A musical ambassador and a veteran of acid house, a champion of techno, a dance music pioneer, label owner, King of Ibiza \u2013 you name it, Carl's been there and done it, never losing sight of his passions \u2013 playing music, breaking tunes and celebrating life. It was at the age of 15 that Carl bought a set of turntables and began working as a mobile DJ. Disco was the first music that captivated him but by the early 80s Cox had moved on to playing the same music as other young London DJs \u2013 rare groove, New York hip-hop and electro. He was perfectly placed to hear Chicago house music in its earliest forms, and when the epic 'Acid Trax' by Phuture (a.k.a. DJ Pierre) came out in early '87. \u201cIt was then that I thought, 'This is it,\u2019 says Carl. \u201cI would do my parties, and I'd play old rare groove and hip hop and soul and I would say 'Right you've got to hear this Phuture track\u2019 and people would just stop and listen.\u201d As a founder of the sound, Carl rode the exploding British rave scene. He played the opening night of Danny Rampling's legendary Shoom, co-promoted The Project with Paul Oakenfold, where he also DJ\u2019d and did the sound system. He held a residency at the Zap Club in Brighton and at the Sunrise rave in 1988, hooked up a third turntable for his dawn-breaking set, got 15,000 people back on their feet, and established a personal rep for three-deck wizardry. The next step was to make music, and Carl's 1991 debut single for Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto label, 'I Want You,' reached Number 23 in the national UK charts and gave Carl his first Top of the Pops appearance. Two more singles also made the charts. But Carl was a reluctant pop star and as the masses moved onto fluffy house and trance, and the hardcore created jungle, Cox retreated into the club world that had nurtured him, and instead embraced the underground sounds of techno. \"Techno drives home somewhere,\" he says of his core music. \"It takes you to an element of surprise, not knowing where you're going. It's scary but wonderful at the same time.\" Carl\u2019s classic releases include his 1995 mix CD, 'F.A.C.T,' which became a techno benchmark, selling over 250,000 copies, and the 1996 EP 'Two Paintings and a Drum,' which again broke the British top 30. Alongside Carl\u2019s \u2018Ultimate Music Management\u2019 company, which counted Josh Wink and Laurent Garnier among 27 clients, there was the Ultimatum record label, for which Carl recorded his third top 30 UK single, 'Sensual Sophis-ti-cat.' In 2005, Carl\u2019s third album, \u2018The Second Sign\u2019 caused a stir across Europe and reached number 3 in Spain\u2019s national chart. Also gaining critical acclaim was \u2018Dirty Bass,\u2019 a collaboration with Christian Smith, and the funky \u2018Give Me Your Love\u2019, both released on 23rd Century Records, an outlet for his own burgeoning production output. Carl formed his own label, Intec Records, in 1999, scoring a series of underground hits and enjoying eight years at the forefront of electronic music. After its closure in 2006, Carl was still inundated with new music, finally deciding to re-launch the label as Intec Digital at the start of 2010. It\u2019s been a triumphant return, thanks to exclusives from some of the biggest names in techno. \u201cThe label couldn\u2019t be going better,\u201d says Carl. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be back at the helm discovering underground DJs.\u201d Intec Digital was also the home for Carl\u2019s 6th studio album, \u2018All Roads Lead To the Dancefloor,\u2019 released to critical acclaim in 2011 on state-of-the-art, self-updating USB technology. In 2013 Carl re-launched his seminal Pure Intec series, 9 years after the hugely successful original \u2018Pure Intec.\u2019 The release also coincided with the launch of a new series of Intec club nights where Carl played to a sold out XOYO in East London. Since then Intec have continued to hold regular parties across the world, including sell outs in Ibiza, Madrid, Switzerland, Amsterdam for ADE, and London\u2019s fabric. And of course Carl\u2019s name cannot be mentioned without Ibiza. His legendary Ibiza residency at Space came to an end in 2016, after an unbelievable 15 consecutive years. Since 2001 Carl helped establish Space as one of the biggest clubs in the world. With carefully thought out line ups, and as much emphasis on new talent as big names, Carl always strived to keep his night at the forefront of Ibiza clubbing making it one of the most successful residencies in Ibiza history. Starting out in 2001 with just 6 nights, his residency grew and adapted as the club did, so for Carl it was only right to end his residency as Space itself closed its doors. And what a way to go out. Carl\u2019s final 15 week season was his biggest ever, with every single night selling out, heralded by fans and critics alike as a triumphant finale to a piece of dance history. Following the end of his Ibiza residency Carl also decided to say goodbye to his record breaking weekly Global Radio show, which he\u2019d been broadcasting for nearly 16 years. When the final show aired in February 2017, the show was reaching a staggering 17-million weekly listeners worldwide, syndicated across over 60 terrestrial FM, satellite and DAB stations throughout 35 countries. \u201cIt was a hard decision as I loved every minute of creating my Global shows\u201d said Carl at the time. \u201cBut all things must come to an end at some point and it was time to focus on new ventures.\u201d And focus on new ventures he has\u2026. Carl continues to be one of most in demand DJs on the planet, with club dates and festival appearances across the world. After 12 years delivering his Carl Cox & Friends stage at Ultra, Carl is now proud to be ambassador for the Resistance parties, for Ultra worldwide. He also now has his own festival, Pure \u2013 which he initially launched in Australia in 2016. It returned this year with even more dates, including Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Auckland, his Pure brand is something he\u2019s keen to expand on and he\u2019s already taking it global. Summer 2017 saw Carl return to Ibiza with Pure Carl Cox \u2013 two sold out parties at super club Privilege. Built on the idea of taking things back to basics, Carl put the music first and foremost for some no nonsense, no frills house and techno parties \u2013 heralded by many as a highlight of the summer.

Newman and his Quartet played each Wednesday to a mixed crowd seeking a slice of history, welcoming Lady Gaga as a surprise guest, until the venue closed in 2011. Currently, Newman performs every Tuesday and Thursday, as bandleader in a residency at Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel, and select Friday nights at NYC\u2019s legendary Rainbow Room with his orchestra. Brian also routinely appears for special live performances with a diverse array of musical acts, which have included Tony Bennett, Jose Feliciano, Stevie Wonder, Mark Murphy, Dierks Bentley, Willie Nile, Molly Ringwald, David Loeb, Steve Wynn\u2019s Orchestra, Ray Benson\u2019s Asleep at the Wheel and Tommy London.\nNewman\u2019s personal style, which meshes classic suits, vintage tattoos and rock-n-roll, has attracted commercial brands such as Jack Daniel\u2019s, Marc Jacobs and Tiffany & Co., who have collaborated with Newman for special events and performances. The Jack Daniel\u2019s partnership in 2012, which launched the brand\u2019s Sinatra Select premium Tennessee Whiskey, brought Newman alongside Frank Sinatra Jr. himself, in a performance in Cannes, France.\nBrian married burlesque star, Angie Pontani of the World Famous Pontani Sisters in February 2013, with whom he most notably performs in connection with Pontani\u2019s New York Burlesque Festival and Burlesque-a-Pades shows.

Endowed with an innate talent and yet an even greater gift for pouring out the hard work necessary, the artist is building his own Hip-Hop empire, crafting and creating his own music while helping to promote and produce that of other up and coming artists along the way. He\u2019s sticking to his guns, being true to himself and what he believes, and his unwavering commitment to excellence, substance, and honesty permeates everything the artist touches.\n\nPhenom\u2019s journey has been an unusual one, finding him drop out of school in the eighth grade where he soon discovered the joys of music.\n\u201cI first started making music at age 13,\u201d he offers. \u201cMy older sister was dating a producer who taught me how to produce beats. After a while of making beats, I started to produce songs for some local artists and by age 16, I was writing songs for other artists as well as for myself.\u201d\n\nInspired by the work of artists like Nas, Jay-Z, and the legendary Michael Jackson, the artist\u2019s work quickly gained steam, finding him release his first EP, Feeling Like a Champion, in 2011 which boasted popular hits like \u201cLocal Celebrity,\u201d featuring DeX! and \u201cMy Better Half\u201d which found him teaming with Jovanna. The accolades continued to come, drawing comparisons to artists such as Fabolous, Drake, and Jay-Z, while applauding the unique voice in Phenom\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one to emulate trends,\u201d the artist shares. \u201cI keep honesty in my music whether I\u2019m doing a thought-provoking song or something for the radio. I stay true to my character in my music. I don\u2019t put on a persona for sales. And contrary to most Hip-Hop artists, I don\u2019t degrade women or talk about money and violence in my music.\u201d\n\nSimilar success and energy fueled the artist\u2019s work on the production end as he was provided the opportunity to work with a variety of producers from all across the globe. He\u2019s executive produced a number of mixtapes, albums, and EPs for multiple artists and also earned his stripes engineering for well-known acts like Triple Seis (formerly of Terror Squad) and Oun-P.\n\nWith his commercial, radio-ready sounds on the move, it was time for the artist to roll out the second phase of his master plan, launching his own entertainment company, So Phenomenal Entertainment, at the age of 21. That transition saw him not only working at his own music but wearing an array of hats, taking on duties as executive producer, audio engineer, songwriter, manager, and head of artist development.\n\nPhenom\u2019s built his company around a set of core beliefs that resonate throughout everything he does. Authenticity is chief among his beliefs and finds itself front and center in the company \u2019s motto, \u201cBe True. Be You. Be So Phenomenal.\u201d Passion is another key virtue that fuels the artist\u2019s drive, in particular, a passion that is accompanied by a die-hard work ethic. As the artist shares, \u201cI never considered myself overly talented but I consider myself a hard worker and hard work will always beat talent when talent doesn\u2019t work hard.\u201d\n\nPhenom\u2019s formula seems to be working, as the company and his music continue to gain steam, fueled by his lyrical honesty, musical integrity, and his desire for excellence in each and every facet of his business.

With each new release they have carved out a niche that targets themes close to their hearts: porn stars, parties, junk food, TV re-runs, beer blasts, comic books, strippers, B-Movies, 70's nostalgia, 80's cynicism, and 90's complacency.", "otherInfo": "Doors at 7:00PM $20 16+ with valid iD"}, {"Address": "635 Sackett Street, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "David Drake ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.983337, 40.678441], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "littlefield", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Comedians You Should Know brings you the best stand-up the world's greatest city has to offer.

On the album, songwriter Lauren Denitzio (they/them) addresses themes of reconstructing and reexamining relationships as they relate to the current zeitgeist. \u201cI thought a lot about how the state of the world makes any sort of partnership stressful. The album is partially autobiographical but it\u2019s also addressing more universal questions that people have to ask these days. Do we have kids? Do we move to a place that could be underwater in 20 years? How does having no idea how you\u2019ll ever retire affect planning your future?\u201d\n\nSonically, the new album does an incredible job of reflecting these anxieties. To help capture the band\u2019s fresh sound, Denitzio recruited veteran producer John Agnello, best known for his work with some of indie rock\u2019s most influential acts such as Sonic Youth, Kurt Vile, Alvvays, and Dinosaur Jr. Agnello recorded with Worriers over 11 days in Jersey City, NJ at Kaleidoscope Sound and in Brooklyn, NY at Russell Street Recording. On the album, Denitzio is joined by new guitarist Frank Piegaro, and longtime drummer Mikey Erg and bassist Nick Psillas. Unlike their previous releases, 2015\u2019s Imaginary Life (Don Giovanni) and 2017\u2019s Survival Pop (Side One Dummy/reissued by 6131 Records), the band recorded the majority of the album live in the studio.

In October 1985 Drivin N Cryin played their first show at Atlanta\u2019s famed 688 Club. The band quickly gained attention for their blistering live shows, and amassed a rabid fanbase in the fertile soil of the late-1980s Southeast music scene. Now, 33 years later, and after releasing four full length albums on Island Records and one on Geffen Records, founding members Kevn Kinney and Tim Nielsen find themselves enjoying a milestone anniversary for the band, having survived the pressures of fame, a shifting musical landscape, multiple lineup changes, and miles of backroads and highways to arrive here.\nWith a gold record, 10 full-length albums, and a handful of EPs to their credit, the band still refuses to rest. In 2012, a documentary about the band entitled Scarred but Smarter: Life n Times of Drivin' N\u2019 Cryin' was produced. In 2015, a collection of 10 choice cuts from the band\u2019s 4-EP \u201cSongs\u201d series, entitled Best of Songs, was released on Nashville\u2019s Plowboy Records. Additionally, the band was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame that same year. The following year, Drivin N Cryin released a vinyl-only album, entitled Archives Vol One, with a collection of basement recordings from the years 1988 to 1990.\nWith Dave V. Johnson as their drummer, and the band's newest member Laur Joamets (originally Sturgill Simpson) now being added to the lineup, Drivin N Cryin is continuing to tour the U.S. to great acclaim.\nIsland Records re-released their much celebrated \u201cMystery Road\u201d album through Universal Music Group (2017) & Darius Rucker cut \u201cStraight to Hell\u201d on his new album, \u201cWhen Was the Last Time\u201d, released October 2017 with guest vocal appearances by Luke Bryan, Charles Kelley, and Jason Aldean. \u201cMystery Road\u201d was named one of The 50 Best Southern Rock Albums of All Time by Paste Magazine this year as well.\nA quote from the band\u2019s lead singer, Kevn Kinney, gives a little insight into what Drivin N Cryin is all about: \u201cWe are a band that's like your record collection.\u201d Drawing influence from a wide array of musical elements, Drivin N Cryin has developed a unique sound over the years. Their name derives from the eclectic nature of this sound: a little drivin' rock n roll and a little country twang. Comfortable with their past and confident in their future, the band has an arsenal of songs, a full tank of gas, and no plans of stopping any time soon.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1120 Manhattan Ave, New York, NY 11222", "Artist": "Thy Will Be Done ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.955172, 40.736777], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "Metalcore, Metal", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Saint Vitus Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Super Rare no costume performance by Gwar for Freeman Promotions 10 year anniversary! limited tickets available to the public!"}, {"Address": "185 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Jack Broza ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10039000.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988346, 40.722035], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "New York, New York", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall Stage 3", "moreBioInfo": "Jack Broza writes big pieces out of small scraps he has gathered.

Formed shortly after composer Monte Weber met choreographer and vocalist Claire Cuny at a DIY show in Brooklyn in 2015, the duo pairs music with their unique talents of sound design, wearable technology, modern dance, and non-genre specific songwriting.\nMonte comes from a musical family and began his journey at a young age. His parents ran, and still run, a Brazilian Band in Western, MA. This initially lead him to perform and teach Brazilian percussion. As an adult he went on to study music composition in college and graduate school, first focusing on electro-acoustic composition and then studying at IRCAM where he began designing his Kontrol instrument, a way for Weber to make electronic music more tactile in performance. While Monte continues to compose for ensembles, he has always loved playing in bands but never had the opportunity to mix the two genres until he met Claire. Monte states, \u201cReliant Tom gives me the outlet to explore both pulse driven works while maintaining the other musical elements which I find fascinating - timbre, aleatoric processes, and interactive technologies.\u201d\nClaire started playing music much later in life. Beginning her artistic journey as a ballet dancer in Dallas, she later moved to NYC where she immersed herself in the NYC art scene. She danced in immersive dance companies, sang in multiple bands, performed with theatre companies, and started writing songs. She desired to combine all of these interests of study into one project but hadn\u2019t been able to until she met Monte. Claire explains,\u201cIt is very interesting to work together from our differing backgrounds. Our ultimate goal with Reliant Tom is to be a multi-media performance experience that straddles the line between pop and experimental music - and philosophizing about what that even means, and is that even possible as \"experimental pop\"?

The dissolution of the group didn't sway Bernard's pursuit for a singing career as he went solo immediately after. He sang at every type of venue he could, including at talent shows, weddings, and funerals.

Indeed, since he debuted almost two and a half years ago on New York City hip hop station WWPR Power 105.1 FM, Norie\u2019s Sunday night show \u201cAnything Goes-Caribbean Edition\u201d, a vigorous blend of soca, reggaeton, roots reggae and dancehall, accented with a distinctive Brooklyn flavor, consistently tops the ratings for the 8-10 PM time slot according to Arbitron statistics.\nRespectfully referred to as Da Reggae Don, DJ Norie was born to Panamanian parents in Brooklyn, which is often referred to a Jamaica\u2019s 15th parish, due to its concentration of immigrants from reggae\u2019s birthplace. Raised in Brooklyn\u2019s East Flatbush area, Norie became familiar with the music of Shabba Ranks, Super Cat and Ninja Man (dancehall reggae superstars of the late 1980s and early \u201890s) by listening to coveted sound clash cassettes that furthered the popularity of the latest reggae hits and the renown of the era\u2019s premier Jamaican sound systems. \u201cListening to the cassettes of Stone Love, Kilimanjaro and other sounds I thought, I want to be a part of that,\u201d Norie recalled.\nBarely into his teens, Norie began working with a neighborhood sound doing odd jobs such as carrying speakers and other equipment to their various gigs around Brooklyn. He paid close attention to the deejays (or selectors in Jamaican parlance) observing their proficiency in choosing just the right tunes to elicit roaring responses from the crowd and keep them on the dance floor. When the selectors needed to take a break, Norie got the chance to display his burgeoning skills on the wheels of steel; however, these early career-training sessions took place unbeknownst to Norie\u2019s mother. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will get in trouble for saying this now but my mom used to work nights so I used to sneak out to play at these basement parties, and basically that is how I learned to select,\u201d Norie laughingly discloses. \u201cIt was kind of hard in the beginning; they used to line up four or five records, tell me what to play and when I played them, people used to go crazy. So it used to seem like, yeah, I can do this, even though I was scared as s*#t. But I did it anyway and it was a good experience.\u201d\n\nNorie\u2019s fears subsided with repeated stints at the turntables and eventually he was recruited by Spectrum Disco, working with selectors Redds and Super C; as Spectrum\u2019s popularity spread throughout Brooklyn and the greater New York area during the 1990s, so too did Norie\u2019s renown as an intimidating selector. In the late 1990s Super Claude, the founder of Afrique Sound Station, one of the most venerated sound systems in the New York area, recruited Norie to join the set. Alongside Afrique\u2019s remarkable team of selectors, which included Jagga B, Crazy Richie and Super Twitch, Norie\u2019s talents were taken to a wider audience that spanned many states and several countries. \u201cSometimes you have to make a move, enhance yourself and go for you, and Afrique is where my name really started from, its what took me to the level of traveling with the music,\u201d Norie reflects. \u201cI will never forget Spectrum Disco because that is where I came from but Afrique has been in the business for more than 20 years, they set the trend for \u2018nuff sounds and it is a blessing to have been a part of it.\u201d\nNorie has also played on numerous Brooklyn based pirate and Internet stations that exclusively play reggae and Caribbean music (he even started one of his own, My Radio 94.3 FM), a phenomenon indicative of the vast potential for Caribbean music in the New York area. But Norie\u2019s expertise in selecting dancehall also resonated with a mainstream listenership, as he found out when he joined up with (hip hop) DJ Self as one of six deejays comprising a collective called Da Union, which enabled him to take dancehall into several (Manhattan) clubs where it had previously been excluded. This led to a few guest appearances on Power 105.1 FM, and eventually his Sunday night show on the station, which has contributed to his enviable status as America\u2019s most influential radio personality for dancehall reggae. As such, Norie is usually the first to transform a core dancehall anthem into an international hit, which he recently did with Stephen and Damian Marley\u2019s single \u201cJah Army\u201d, featuring Buju Banton.\nNorie is also the personal deejay for Beenie Man, with whom he travels whenever the artist has a show outside of Jamaica and he has also toured with Elephant Man, Bounty Killer, Mavado and Serani. On March 30, 2011 at New York City\u2019s BB King\u2019s nightclub, Norie made history selecting the rhythms for seven time Grammy winner Stephen Marley\u2019s first performance done solely to backing tracks (that is, without his band\u2019s accompaniment); Marley headlined Norie\u2019s two year anniversary party for his Power 105 show, which was also the one year anniversary celebration for his immensely popular monthly live concert series, \u201cAnything Goes\u201d. \u201cStephen was a little hesitant at first, because he never performed to tracks before, but he did it and he was happy about it, so it is a great experience to have under my belt,\u201d Norie shares.\nNorie has recently partnered on several projects with Queens New York based VP Records, the largest independent reggae label in the world. He selects the music at each of VP\u2019s album release parties and the label\u2019s artists are regularly showcased at his \u201cAnything Goes\u201d series. For VP Records\u2019 \u201cReggae Gold 2011\u201d, a collection of the year\u2019s biggest reggae hits, Da Reggae Don provided a vibrant, 35-minute bonus mix CD, rife with artists\u2019 shout-outs to Norie (including 2011 Celebrity Apprentice winner/country superstar John Rich) and customized renditions of popular songs. Additionally, Norie has just started recording artists on his own dancehall rhythms and he plans to release those tracks as part of his own compilation series sometime in the near future.\nEach of Norie\u2019s endeavors is in pursuit of his ultimate goal: expanding the overall popularity of Caribbean music, especially dancehall reggae, the music that inspired his career path almost 20 years ago. \u201cMy radio show has served a lot of purposes; not only did it allow my fans to get to know me but it allowed me to give back to this music game,\u201d Norie explains. \u201cBut I would like to get further in radio, be more than just a deejay because then I can help reggae by impressing upon program directors that New York\u2019s Caribbean population is really an untapped market that no one is paying attention to so why not go out and support it? We don\u2019t have to follow the same trends that everyone has been doing for years and years, we can do things differently, add on and make it much stronger.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E 27th St, New York City, NY 10016", "Artist": "Gerald Clayton ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7567603.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983746, 40.742276], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "Music, Jazz", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "w/ Jimmy Green @ Jazz Standard, NYC", "moreBioInfo": "A four time Grammy-nominated pianist/composer/arranger.

That 2008 release, with its gorgeously melodic writing and improvising and deft use of indie-rock, electronica and hip-hop elements, established Parks as one of the most gifted and original young voices in jazz. \u201cThis is the natural successor to that record,\u201d says the New York-based artist, 34. \u201cIt\u2019s taking the ideas of that project and doubling down on them\u2014fully committing to that direction.\u201d\n\nLittle Big also marks the recorded debut of the intuitive working group that gives the album its title (and which takes its name from a fantastical novel by John Crowley\u2014a favorite book of Parks and, the pianist notes, Wayne Shorter). Parks handled the production duties, with engineering by Daniel Schlett (whose credits include The War on Drugs and Ghostface Killah). The album was mixed by both Schlett and Grizzly Bear bassist/producer Chris Taylor, the latter of whom Parks met in a Seattle big band at the age of 10. \u201cWe put a lot of time and care into the way this record sounds, and the result\u201d\u2014simultaneously crystalline and warm, postmodern and natural\u2014\u201cmakes me really happy,\u201d Parks adds.\n\nAfter experimenting with various lineups and sessions, Parks landed on three musicians ideally suited for this atmospheric, genre-bending new work. \u201cThis feels like a real band, one that will be around for a while,\u201d he says. Greg Tuohey is the longest-running member, a guitarist who places taste and tone ahead of chops-focused bravado\u2014or, as Parks puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s chasing Miles Davis\u2019 phrasing with Jimi Hendrix\u2019s attitude.\u201d On electric bass is David \u201cDJ\u201d Ginyard Jr., a left-handed player with a distinctively lyrical approach and an aptitude for seeing the bigger musical picture. \u201cHe really understands what the bass does, and he thinks super compositionally,\u201d Parks says, noting how some of Ginyard\u2019s basslines have become integral to the songs. Anchoring the unit is Tommy Crane, a forward-looking, stylistically resourceful drummer who brings both explosive creativity and a producer\u2019s knack for precision. \u201cHe has a very unique ability to internalize and commit to the particular heartbeat of each song,\u201d Parks explains, \u201cbut always with this vital and elastic human element, which is rare to hear in combination with the kinds of grooves we\u2019re exploring.\u201d\n\nTogether they interpret a panoramic set of Parks\u2019 original compositions\u2014from the 21st-century fusion of \u201cKid,\u201d to the odd-metered studio jam \u201cProfessor Strangeweather,\u201d to the trip-hop ambiance and folkish melody of \u201cBells.\u201d The psychedelic \u201cAquarium\u201d\u2014\u201cprobably the sexiest tune on the album,\u201d Parks says, chuckling\u2014conjures up the trippy, sultry neo-soul vibe of Meshell Ndegeocello, before Tuohey offers a solo that channels Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood. \u201cDigital Society\u201d somehow manages to evoke Afrobeat, bluegrass and Aphex Twin. \u201cLilac\u201d is, as Parks describes it, \u201ca solo-piano pop tune.\u201d The leader\u2019s \u201csecret favorite\u201d cut, \u201cDoors Open,\u201d seeks inspiration in late Talk Talk and the \u201cearnestness\u201d of Brian Blade & the Fellowship Band. That closing track is \u201cdefinitely not afraid to go straight for your heart,\u201d Parks says with a laugh.\n\nA prodigal talent raised outside of Seattle, Parks moved with his family to study at the Manhattan School of Music when he was 16. Two years later, on the recommendation of a teacher, NEA Jazz Master Kenny Barron, he was invited to join trumpet great Terence Blanchard\u2019s band. That tenure began the relationship with Blue Note that would yield Invisible Cinema, released when Parks was just 24. In The Guardian, John Fordham called the album \u201ca real independent vision,\u201d adding that \u201cParks is a fast-rising star.\u201d In the September 2008 issue of JazzTimes, Parks was named a \u201cNew Jazz Visionary\u201d alongside current giants like Esperanza Spalding, Robert Glasper and Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah. Over the ensuing decade, Parks certainly made good on that early promise. He was an essential presence in Kurt Rosenwinkel\u2019s band, including on the guitarist\u2019s well-received double album from 2012, Star of Jupiter. As a member of the supergroup James Farm, also featuring saxophonist Joshua Redman, bassist Matt Penman and drummer Eric Harland, Parks put out two celebrated albums on Nonesuch. In 2013 he released his first disc as an ECM Records artist, Arborescence, which DownBeat\u2019s J.D. Considine called \u201ca forest-invoking solo-piano effort marked by wonderfully detailed narratives and a harmonic palette worthy of Ravel.\u201d Find the Way, an ECM trio session with bassist Ben Street and drummer Billy Hart, followed last year and garnered equally enthusiastic reviews.\n\nOn Little Big, Parks taps into the lessons he\u2019s absorbed throughout those far-reaching experiences, while also progressing some of the au courant sounds he investigated on Invisible Cinema. \u201cThis feels like the most personal record I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d he says. What\u2019s more, the album reflects his worldview, an outlook in which optimism and inclusion supersede politics. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot out there right now to protest against, and it feels like it\u2019s the artist\u2019s duty to create music that reckons with the issues of the day. Nonetheless, this is not a protest record. It\u2019s not against anything; it\u2019s much more for something. What we\u2019re aiming to do is blend genres and ideas in an open and fluid way, so that structure and freedom work together to serve the larger concept of the song. It\u2019s a way of working together that feels representative of the kind of world I could imagine many of us might want to live in.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "327 Bowery, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "The Mercury Brothers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7942926.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.991787, 40.725751], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie, Rock, Experimental", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "The Bowery Electric", "moreBioInfo": "We are a New Jersey band that pride ourselves on composing and performing unique/original independent rock music with an experimental and progressive edge.", "otherInfo": "Element47, The Mercury Brothers, Arctic Blonde, Notes from Underground grace the stage!"}, {"Address": "146 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Medhane ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.963479, 40.7101], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Baby's All Right", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Medhane with Akai Solo & Maassai"}, {"Address": "327 Bowery, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Notes From Underground ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.991787, 40.725751], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "The Bowery Electric", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Element47, The Mercury Brothers, Arctic Blonde, Notes from Underground grace the stage!"}, {"Address": "146 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Maassai ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8278398.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.963479, 40.7101], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Baby's All Right", "moreBioInfo": "femcee | activist. brooklyn, NYC. wordplay + vibrational revolution, yo. confrontational. uncomfortable. but Healing. & love full.", "otherInfo": "Medhane with Akai Solo & Maassai"}, {"Address": "327 Bowery, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Elementfortyseven ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8984917.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.991787, 40.725751], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "Alternative, Grunge", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "The Bowery Electric", "moreBioInfo": "We play a mix of rock and alternative music such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Radiohead, Foo Fighters, U2, R.E.M., Coldplay, and some of our own.

For although the world seems strangely intent on fixing him in his early twenties (or more specifically, a series of internet sites who have seemingly overlooked the fact that biography ages require a yearly update!), the time has come to acknowledge that DJ and producer James Holden is not quite so young anymore. The timely release of Holden's 'The Idiots Are Winning' mini-album in 2006 marked the occasion, and formed a fitting musical illustration of Holden's new-found maturity.\n\nStill reluctant to bestow upon it the accolade of 'debut album', for Holden himself 'The Idiots Are Winning' remains an EP which grew out of control: take four dancefloor-length Holden tracks, mix in the obligatory DJ tools and alternative versions that he is so keen on, and an interlude or two for good measure, and you have far exceeded the single realm and are pushing into album territory. Not that the manner of its creation should affect the listening experience: Holden's intricate and inimitable production style ensures a coherence of atmosphere, where even DJ-friendly extended intros hold up to home-listening scrutiny. The Guardian went so far as to proclaim it \"the most astonishing debut in electronic music since Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children.\" And who are we to argue?\n\nThe producer James Holden's journey to this point began back in 1999, aged just 19, when he burst onto the UK scene with the exuberant teenage trance hit 'Horizons'. Produced on a basic home computer set-up and the freeware music program Buzz whilst still studying towards a Maths degree at the University of Oxford, the young punk's overnight success was a slap in the face for the audiophile establishment, and went some way towards opening doors for the legions of young bedroom producers who have now become the mainstay of the dance world. The floodgates had opened, and an intensive course of remixing, djing, production and collaborations extended before Holden in place of the conventional Oxford graduate career path.\n\nBut if the axis of English (and those related countries which take their lead from the Anglo-American progressive house and trance scenes) took to Holden overnight, the rest of the world took a little longer to convince. It was not until the launch of his own Border Community label in 2003, kicked off in fine style with his own future anthem 'A Break in the Clouds', when key players in the hugely influential German scene began to sit up and take notice. Having found himself wedged rather uncomfortably between the prog and trance scenes in his native UK, this entrance into the German market represented a new-found freedom for Holden, and the non-generic approach to making melodic electronic music which he found amongst many of his peers in Cologne and Berlin finally had him feeling right at home. A string of hugely-influential and often-imitated monster remixes of everyone from Madonna and Britney Spears, through Depeche Mode and New Order, to Nathan Fake and Kieran Hebden and Steve Reid cemented his place as a mainstay of DJ record boxes everywhere, and Holden's global dancefloor domination was complete.\n\nOriginally founded to offer a restriction-free outlet for Holden's own music, as well as serving as a launch pad for the production careers of his talented friends, the rather fanatical cult of Border Community which has sprung up around Holden's own label has of course been essential in achieving this independence from the narrow limitations of genre-specific music. The accolades due to Holden's Border Community baby include bucking the trend of declining vinyl sales in a major way, unleashing a whole host of idiosyncratic dancefloor classics on the world, kickstarting the careers of many a young musician, and making serious inroads on the realm of the artist album with offerings from Nathan Fake, Fairmont and Holden himself. Now in its fifth year, Border Community is firmly established as one of the foremost breeding grounds for fresh young electronic talent, thanks to their small but faithful army of free-spirited genre benders who between them have injected a new life into the European scene.\n\nThe best place to catch a glimpse of the soon-to-be-massive delights yet to come from his Border Community label is of course a James Holden DJ set, where his tireless dedication to hunting down the next wave of young production talent meets his own sense of exemplary taste in selecting tracks from other labels to bring his unique vision of what club music ought to be to life. Barely coming up for air between his non-stop sampler and CDJ wizardry, Holden is a very modern sort of DJ, brazenly uniting tracks from music's past and present, disregarding genre, confounding the purists and making club hits out of many an unwitting dancefloor virgin. His supreme and unrivalled command of the modern technology available to him allows Holden to go where other DJs fear to tread, consistently pulling off daring mixes on-the-fly which just wouldn't be possible on a conventional two turntable set-up. And so distinct is the resultant sound that your average conservative dance music night can barely contain it, which is why James Holden is often best experienced alongside his edgy labelmates at one of his many Border Community label nights, at The End in London, and beyond.\n\nBetween a hectic touring schedule which has taken in just about every corner of the world, running his Zeitgeist-defining label, and his status as hugely in-demand remixer du jour, it is little wonder that Holden's own original productions have occasionally seemed a little thin on the ground. But something has got to give if Renaissance man Holden is ever going to finish his next album, which is why his plans for 2008 feature a scaled down set of DJ dates and a strictly-enforced remix embargo. With that all-important studio time freed up, the time has come to begin plotting the next chapter in the James Holden story.", "otherInfo": "Thom Yorke"}, {"Address": "635 Sackett Street, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "Aisling Bea ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.983337, 40.678441], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "littlefield", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Jo Firestone, Aparna Nancherla and Maeve Higgins host the freshest comics every Monday at Brooklyn's least smelly comedy venue."}, {"Address": "702 Union St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Deanne Smith ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9618372.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.980048, 40.676115], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Union Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "DeAnne Smith's DeAnarchy"}, {"Address": "635 Sackett Street, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "Butter Boy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8075303.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983337, 40.678441], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "littlefield", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Jo Firestone, Aparna Nancherla and Maeve Higgins host the freshest comics every Monday at Brooklyn's least smelly comedy venue."}, {"Address": "635 Sackett Street, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "JO ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/205646.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983337, 40.678441], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "Bass, Drum, Electronic", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "littlefield", "moreBioInfo": "joanne kearney is originally from dublin and started off gigging there,but currently is living in iceland where she recored her latest ep with the help of a young up and coming local producer and the guest vocals of hans the fisherman!", "otherInfo": "Jo Firestone, Aparna Nancherla and Maeve Higgins host the freshest comics every Monday at Brooklyn's least smelly comedy venue."}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Suzanne Jade ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9688982.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "Soul, Country, Motown, Acoustic, Pop, Jazz, Funk, Adult Contemporary", "Time": "8:15 PM", "Venue": "Observation Lounge, NCL Bliss", "moreBioInfo": "Hi, I\u2019m Suzanne Jade.

At the age of just 18 and living out of\nhis car, Dan was determined to forge a better path for himself. He soon landed a role on Disney Cruise\nLine, performing and acting in their shows. Then, he landed the role of Elvis Presley on Norwegian Cruise\nLine. Dan's dream ever since he picked up the guitar at the age of 12 was to entertain on stage. His\nmusical influences have ranged from Joe Cocker to Justin Bieber, however he never truly felt that he \"fit\nin\" with any particular style.\nDan turned his tiny cabin on the cruise ship into a home-recording studio, churning out several original\ndemos. One night, while performing in For The Record: The Brat Pack on Norwegian, music manager\nJonathan Wax happened to be vacationing with his wife when he discovered Dan's powerful vocals and\ntechnical prowess on the guitar. Wax knew that this could be an artist who could breathe new life into\nthe pop scene, weaving classic guitar lines with catchy modern hooks and vocal acrobatics.\nAfter returning to land, Dan went to Los Angeles to meet with Jonathan's brother, singer-songwriter\nMikey Wax, and producer Jacob Lee. Together, the three of them co-wrote and recorded an EP. The\nresult was exactly what they had hoped for; a modern meets classic vibe. Catchy and infectious pop\nmelodies with soaring, old-soul vocals.\nThat\u2019s when Renata Baiocco entered the picture. The first single off MIDLO\u2019s upcoming EP, \u201cEmotional,\u201d\nfeatures a duet with Renata that was released on August 16th, 2019. The song instantly reacted being\nplaced on Spotify\u2019s New Music Friday playlist, and then on fifteen other Spotify curated playlists\nincluding \u201cPop Right Now,\u201d \u201cLove Pop,\u201d \u201cPower Run 145 BPM,\u201d and \u201cNew Music Friday Denmark\u201d. The\nsong has already surpassed 600,000 streams in just a few months.\nAt that point it was a no brainer; Dan and Renata\u2019s chemistry was too undeniable for the relationship to\nbe a one-off.

His company Wood Violins is the premier manufacturer of electric violins, violas and cellos worldwide and he holds the patent for the first-ever self-supporting violin. The company stands behind its claim to have made the most important change to the violin in 400 years and is often referred to as the \u201cStradivarius of electric violins.\u201d With a design as stunning as their sound, Wood Violins pack both sonic and visual punch. Their premier electric violin, The Viper, has found favor with musicians as varied as Lady Gaga\u2019s violinist Judy Kang, Carrie Underwood\u2019s violinist Jimmy Herman, and Big and Rich\u2019s violinist Shawn Bailey.\n\nWood is a world-renowned performer who rose to fame as string master and original member of the internationally acclaimed Trans Siberian Orchestra. A successful solo artist in his own right, Wood writes and records original music for film and television, has released six solo albums, and tours with his band The Mark Wood Experience (MWE) which features his wife, vocalist Laura Kaye, and their drummer son Elijah. His commission credits include The Juilliard School and extensive TV broadcast music including The Winter Olympics and The Tour de France (for which he won an Emmy).\n\nIn addition to his continued solo and commission work, Wood has collaborated with and appeared alongside some of the biggest names in music such as Lenny Kravitz, Celine Dion, and Kanye West. As a member of his touring band, Wood had the honor of performing with the legendary Billy Joel for both historic final concerts at Shea stadium, sharing the stage with Paul McCartney, Steven Tyler, and Roger Daltry. He also starred in a Kanye West produced national Pepsi TV commercial and has appeared on the world\u2019s most venerable stages including Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and Madison Square Garden.\n\nBut his true passion is music education. His program Electrify Your Strings (EYS) \u2013 founded in 2001 \u2013 is an intensive rock and roll workshop for school music education departments that boosts student self-esteem and motivation and helps raise money for music education. Today EYS visits upwards of 75 schools per year and there is a waiting list of schools wanting to participate. The organization has been featured on The Today Show and CBS Evening News and in countless local media outlets.\n\nBut for Wood, it\u2019s all about the kids. He\u2019s dedicated to providing educators with the opportunity to ignite their students\u2019 passions and to inspiring students to open their minds and unlock their potential. His book \u201cElectrify Your Strings: The Mark Wood Improvisational Violin Method\u201d (published by Cherry Lane) is regarded as the definitive electric violin method book. The first in a series of forthcoming educational books, Wood is passionate about providing educators and students with the tools they need to succeed in the classroom and beyond.\n\nA genuine family man, Wood runs his operations alongside his wife, business partner, and longtime collaborator Laura Kaye out of their home in Port Washington, New York. Their child Elijah is a drummer (Shania Twain, Jordan Rudess, Grace VanderWaal, America's Got Talent) and occasionally tours with EYS and The Mark Wood Experience. In addition to EYS, Wood and his family run the annual MWROC Music Festival (a week-long music camp), as well as the Mark Wood Electrify Your Music Foundation, a 501-C3 dedicated to supporting music and the arts.\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of students reached, millions of dollars raised to help high school music departments across the US, and dozens of school orchestra programs saved from the chopping block because of funds raised through his efforts, Mark Wood has proven himself a man of ideas, action and results.

As a pioneer of looping and synth guitar work well ahead of his time, he's taken the technology to uncharted lands delivering a pocket groove unique to the ears. Zach says, \"call me crazy, but I've always believed live music should always be live, but I've also always loved a good tranced out dance party too.\" With this in mind he tailored his performances to meet his convictions. Combining his family roots Island vibe with his low country southern soul, a pinch of tranced out hippy hop, and a vast amount of talent, Zach's sound emerges in focus.\n\nSelect shows will feature Zach's vibrant band The Yankees, a bluesy jam band who will be supporting Deputy with keys, Drums, Bass, and a whole lot of soul. Alongside Deputy on tour, supporting acts will include powerhouse musicians Audacity Brass Band, Afterfunk & Sarah Blacker, the Trailheads, and Mike Pinto.\n\nThis fall Zach Deputy will hit the road and perform live across the east coast of the United States.

On the album, songwriter Lauren Denitzio (they/them) addresses themes of reconstructing and reexamining relationships as they relate to the current zeitgeist. \u201cI thought a lot about how the state of the world makes any sort of partnership stressful. The album is partially autobiographical but it\u2019s also addressing more universal questions that people have to ask these days. Do we have kids? Do we move to a place that could be underwater in 20 years? How does having no idea how you\u2019ll ever retire affect planning your future?\u201d\n\nSonically, the new album does an incredible job of reflecting these anxieties. To help capture the band\u2019s fresh sound, Denitzio recruited veteran producer John Agnello, best known for his work with some of indie rock\u2019s most influential acts such as Sonic Youth, Kurt Vile, Alvvays, and Dinosaur Jr. Agnello recorded with Worriers over 11 days in Jersey City, NJ at Kaleidoscope Sound and in Brooklyn, NY at Russell Street Recording. On the album, Denitzio is joined by new guitarist Frank Piegaro, and longtime drummer Mikey Erg and bassist Nick Psillas. Unlike their previous releases, 2015\u2019s Imaginary Life (Don Giovanni) and 2017\u2019s Survival Pop (Side One Dummy/reissued by 6131 Records), the band recorded the majority of the album live in the studio.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers. While he may be considered as part of a new generation of \"multilingual\" musicians which have grown up studying classical, jazz and Latin American music, Edward is inventing a language that transcends any rigid genre.", "otherInfo": "SFJAZZ announced two new members of the SFJAZZ Collective for their upcoming 2019-20 Season and tours.

Either way, allow us to present the real story from the horse\u2019s (man\u2019s) mouth\u2026\n\nDISCLAIMER 2: (No animals were harmed in the making of this bio.)\n\nThroughout over three decades in music, Steve Poltz did it all and more\u2014often shared by way of his rockin\u2019 countrified folk slices of sardonic Americana (hatched in Halifax). Of course, he co-wrote Jewel\u2019s multiplatinum Hot 100-topping megahit \u201cYou Were Meant For Me,\u201d but he also went on a whale watch with her and a few federales that turned into a drug bust. The two still share the story at every festival they play together. He made his bones as the frontman for underground legends The Rugburns, who burned rubber crisscrossing the continent on marathon tours and still pop up once in a while for the rare and quickly sold out reunion gig.\n\nIn 20 years since his full-length solo debut, One Left Shoe, he blessed the world\u2019s ears with twelve solo records, spanning the acclaimed 2010 Dreamhouse and most recently Folk Singer in 2015. NPR summed it up best, \u201cCritics and fans alike now regard Poltz as a talented and prolific songwriter.\u201d By 2016, he survived a stroke, endured anything the music industry could throw at him, and still performed like \u201c280 days a year.\u201d\n\nHowever, he still never lived in Nashville, which represents a turning point in the story and the genesis of his 2018 Red House Records debut, Shine On\u2026\n\n\u201cMy girlfriend Sharon sold the condo we were living in, and I was ready to live in a van, which seemed like a good idea for one night\u2014then I decided I wanted a kitchen and a closet,\u201d he admits. \u201cSharon wanted to move to Nashville, because she thought it would be good for me. It caused a huge fight. I\u2019d been in San Diego since 1980, and that\u2019s where I cut my musical teeth. I thought I\u2019d never leave. In fact, at the height of our fight, I said, \u2018I\u2019m not leaving San Diego. I am San Diego!\u2019 This makes me laugh now. As soon as I got to Nashville, I immediately knew I wanted to make a record in \u2018Music City\u2019.\u201d\nSo, the man who once protested \u201cI am San Diego\u201d made Shine On in his new home of Nashville with one of its elder statesman behind the board, Will Kimbrough [Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell]. Holing up in the studio at Kimbrough\u2019s house, nothing would be off limits. Together, they unlocked the kind of creative chemistry you only hear about in band bios\u2014but for real.\n\n\u201cI respect Will so much, and I\u2019d always wanted to work with him,\u201d says Steve. \u201cLike two mad scientists, we just took our time and had fun. We didn\u2019t overthink things. Everything felt organic. We ate soul food and drank lots of really good coffee. We tried out weird sounds, and the songs always started with voice and guitar\u2014no click track, just how I\u2019d play them. I road tested many of them, and they were ripe for the picking when recording time came around.\u201d\n\nEvoking themes of \u201chope, love, contemplation, celebration of Wednesday, pharmacists, and the fact that windows are not inanimate objects and they sometimes have conversations with each other,\u201d the record represents Steve at his most inspired and insightful. The opener and title track \u201cShine On\u201d pairs a delicate vocal with lithely plucked acoustic strings as he urges, \u201cShine on, shine on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe song was a gift,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI woke up really early in Encinitas, California at Sharon\u2019s sister\u2019s house. The sun was just coming up. I was all alone in perfect solitude. My guitar was there. The sky was gorgeous. I wrote it as a poem. Everyone always told me, \u2018Never start a record with a really slow song.\u2019 So, seeing that I have O.D.D. (Oppositional Defiance Disorder), I started my record with one. I love the mood it sets. It\u2019s almost like my mission statement, trying to find some semblance of positivity and light in a sometimes ruthless world.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cPharmacist,\u201d rustling guitar and harmonica propel a tale of \u201cthis dude having a crush on his pharmacist.\u201d It also serves as an extension of his friendship with neighbor Scot Sax\u2014with whom he shares the podcast \u201cOne Hit Neighbors\u201d (since they\u2019ve both had one hit song). Meanwhile, he joined forces with Molly Tuttle on \u201c4th of July,\u201d which, of course, came to life on the 3rd of July. \u201cBallin On Wednesday\u201d drew its title and chorus from a diner checkout girl (with a super cool gold tooth) who Steve paid with a $100 bill and she replied, \u201cOooh, ballin\u2019 on a Wednsday.\u201d The finale \u201cAll Things Shine\u201d skips along on sparse instrumentation as Steve sends a message.\n\n\u201c\u2018All Things Shine\u2019 came about after one of the many mass shootings on this planet,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI was feeling overwhelmed. So, I wanted to put my feelings into words and melody. I was thinking that even if we\u2019re feeling hopeless that there is still beauty. All things shine in their own way.\u201d\nWho could contend that?\n\nIn the end, for everything you can call him \u201csearcher, smartass, movie freak, lover of technology, news junkie, baseball fan to nth degree, lapsed catholic who still believes in god even though all his friends are atheists and think he\u2019s an idiot, and maker of fun,\u201d you might just call Steve that little light in the dark we all need in this day and age.\n\nOr Nashville\u2019s Canadian Jiminy Cricket\u2026\n\n\u201cI hope Shine On makes listeners smile and feel welcome, and they want to share it with their friends,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cMusic means energy to me.

For although the world seems strangely intent on fixing him in his early twenties (or more specifically, a series of internet sites who have seemingly overlooked the fact that biography ages require a yearly update!), the time has come to acknowledge that DJ and producer James Holden is not quite so young anymore. The timely release of Holden's 'The Idiots Are Winning' mini-album in 2006 marked the occasion, and formed a fitting musical illustration of Holden's new-found maturity.\n\nStill reluctant to bestow upon it the accolade of 'debut album', for Holden himself 'The Idiots Are Winning' remains an EP which grew out of control: take four dancefloor-length Holden tracks, mix in the obligatory DJ tools and alternative versions that he is so keen on, and an interlude or two for good measure, and you have far exceeded the single realm and are pushing into album territory. Not that the manner of its creation should affect the listening experience: Holden's intricate and inimitable production style ensures a coherence of atmosphere, where even DJ-friendly extended intros hold up to home-listening scrutiny. The Guardian went so far as to proclaim it \"the most astonishing debut in electronic music since Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children.\" And who are we to argue?\n\nThe producer James Holden's journey to this point began back in 1999, aged just 19, when he burst onto the UK scene with the exuberant teenage trance hit 'Horizons'. Produced on a basic home computer set-up and the freeware music program Buzz whilst still studying towards a Maths degree at the University of Oxford, the young punk's overnight success was a slap in the face for the audiophile establishment, and went some way towards opening doors for the legions of young bedroom producers who have now become the mainstay of the dance world. The floodgates had opened, and an intensive course of remixing, djing, production and collaborations extended before Holden in place of the conventional Oxford graduate career path.\n\nBut if the axis of English (and those related countries which take their lead from the Anglo-American progressive house and trance scenes) took to Holden overnight, the rest of the world took a little longer to convince. It was not until the launch of his own Border Community label in 2003, kicked off in fine style with his own future anthem 'A Break in the Clouds', when key players in the hugely influential German scene began to sit up and take notice. Having found himself wedged rather uncomfortably between the prog and trance scenes in his native UK, this entrance into the German market represented a new-found freedom for Holden, and the non-generic approach to making melodic electronic music which he found amongst many of his peers in Cologne and Berlin finally had him feeling right at home. A string of hugely-influential and often-imitated monster remixes of everyone from Madonna and Britney Spears, through Depeche Mode and New Order, to Nathan Fake and Kieran Hebden and Steve Reid cemented his place as a mainstay of DJ record boxes everywhere, and Holden's global dancefloor domination was complete.\n\nOriginally founded to offer a restriction-free outlet for Holden's own music, as well as serving as a launch pad for the production careers of his talented friends, the rather fanatical cult of Border Community which has sprung up around Holden's own label has of course been essential in achieving this independence from the narrow limitations of genre-specific music. The accolades due to Holden's Border Community baby include bucking the trend of declining vinyl sales in a major way, unleashing a whole host of idiosyncratic dancefloor classics on the world, kickstarting the careers of many a young musician, and making serious inroads on the realm of the artist album with offerings from Nathan Fake, Fairmont and Holden himself. Now in its fifth year, Border Community is firmly established as one of the foremost breeding grounds for fresh young electronic talent, thanks to their small but faithful army of free-spirited genre benders who between them have injected a new life into the European scene.\n\nThe best place to catch a glimpse of the soon-to-be-massive delights yet to come from his Border Community label is of course a James Holden DJ set, where his tireless dedication to hunting down the next wave of young production talent meets his own sense of exemplary taste in selecting tracks from other labels to bring his unique vision of what club music ought to be to life. Barely coming up for air between his non-stop sampler and CDJ wizardry, Holden is a very modern sort of DJ, brazenly uniting tracks from music's past and present, disregarding genre, confounding the purists and making club hits out of many an unwitting dancefloor virgin. His supreme and unrivalled command of the modern technology available to him allows Holden to go where other DJs fear to tread, consistently pulling off daring mixes on-the-fly which just wouldn't be possible on a conventional two turntable set-up. And so distinct is the resultant sound that your average conservative dance music night can barely contain it, which is why James Holden is often best experienced alongside his edgy labelmates at one of his many Border Community label nights, at The End in London, and beyond.\n\nBetween a hectic touring schedule which has taken in just about every corner of the world, running his Zeitgeist-defining label, and his status as hugely in-demand remixer du jour, it is little wonder that Holden's own original productions have occasionally seemed a little thin on the ground. But something has got to give if Renaissance man Holden is ever going to finish his next album, which is why his plans for 2008 feature a scaled down set of DJ dates and a strictly-enforced remix embargo. With that all-important studio time freed up, the time has come to begin plotting the next chapter in the James Holden story.", "otherInfo": "Due to restrictions put in place to minimise the spread of COVID-19, we regret that the North American leg of the Thom Yorke Tomorrow?s Modern Boxes tour is postponed.

The right vocalist can make you fall in love at first listen, elicit tears, or bring you back to a different era altogether. A microphone and a stage remain the only necessities. That holds true for New York-based singer and songwriter Morgan James. On her full-length debut for Epic Records, Hunter, she casts an unbreakable spell with a powerhouse voice equally inspired by smoky soul, swaggering R&B, theatrical swing, and a virtuosic classical poise.\n\nThe Idaho native discovered her passion for music early on and pursued it\nwholeheartedly at the prestigious Juilliard School. While in the midst of the institution's rigorous academic program, she soon realized that her path would diverge from the classical world. \"I didn't want a career in opera, but Juilliard still shaped me,\" she confesses. \"The traditional training really made me a disciplined singer. I carry that with me to this day.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Morgan spent the next few years facing the proverbial struggles of being a young artist in New York. Low on money, she bounced back and forth between bartending and restaurant gigs while fighting to survive. Immersed in classic sixties and seventies soul records, she concurrently experienced a pivotal revelation. \"Out of that frustration came this other voice,\" she says. \"It was my true voice, and I feel like I discovered it in the middle of so much hardship just trying to be heard. I embraced who I was at that very moment.\"\n\nSoon, she would be heard in a big way. In 2008, Morgan booked her first Broadway show\u2014appearing in The Addams Family alongside Nathan Lane, as well as in prominent and leading roles in Wonderland, Godspell (Turn Back, O Man), and Berry Gordy's Motown The Musical as Teena Marie. The latter set the stage for her to\nproperly launch her solo career. Gordy recognized the vocalist's immense talent, and introduced her to Doug Morris and L.A. Reid, opening the door for a deal with Epic Records in 2012.\n\nAround the same time, Morgan booked a landmark show at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, where she paid tribute to Nina Simone with a set of songs that were closely associated with the legendary artist. The incendiary show was recorded and released as the critically acclaimed Morgan James Live on Epic Records. It also proved to be the perfect segue for her first studio album, released in June of 2014.\n\n\"I always knew to make a neo-soul pop record,\" Morgan says. \"The foundation is all real ingredients, and those roots of soul and R&B are pretty strong. It's the culmination of my musical life up to this point. The painful songs are straight out of a bad relationship with someone from my past. The joyful moments are wonderful memories. It's all coming from me. I've lived every one of these stories, and I love the genres I'm representing. It's one point-of-view\u2014mine.\"\n\nThe title track and album opener \"Hunter\" boasts a seductive hook with cinematic noir flair. Flaunting the singer's immense delivery and dynamic presence, it's an undeniable and classy come-on that proves as animalistic as it does magnetic. \"From a woman's perspective, it's such an empowering and sexy song,\" she smiles. \"It totally makes me feel like a warrior! Music is so sensual and life-affirming. That's what I look for. You don't often see a girl take this position, and that's what I love about it!\"\n\nMorgan assumed co-writing duties on eight of the collection's fourteen tracks and even performed all of her own background vocals and harmonies. From the empowering farewell of \"Fed Up On You\" to the mournful rumination of \"You Never Lied\", she continually bares it all\u2014both emotionally and musically. \"I sing like I'm never going to sing ever again,\" Morgan affirms. \"I wanted to capture that power and passion every time. At some moments, it might sound flawless; at others, it might sound like it's going to break. I'm revealing something about myself with\nevery song. You've got to do that. My favorite artists, whether Joni Mitchell or Michael Jackson, are and were, always honest.\"\n\nThere's a unique structure to the album. The first five songs boast electronic elements, while the last six don't have any. \"There's a gradient of the record that goes down,\" she says. \"By the time you get to the last song, it's just piano and voice. It starts with a song about power and ego, and it ends on one about surrender and selflessness. I have all of that in me. Maybe we all do.\"\n\nUltimately, her honesty permeates everything that Morgan James does, and it's why you'll always remember her voice. \"I want people to walk away from this album feeling fulfilled. That's the way it used to be. Often, I think I'm from another time,\u201d she says, her voice trailing off. \u201cI just want to bring back the power of the singular legacy voice.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1160 Broadway 5th floor, New York, NY 10001", "Artist": "Kris Davis ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7317675.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988693, 40.744678], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "The Jazz Gallery", "moreBioInfo": "Pianist-composer Kris Davis has blossomed as one of the singular talents on the New York jazz scene, a deeply thoughtful, resolutely individual artist who offers \u201cuncommon creative adventure,\u201d according to JazzTimes.

I consider her an honorary descendant of Cecil Taylor and a welcome addition to the fold.\u201d Davis made her debut on record as a leader with Lifespan (Fresh Sound New Talent, 2003), followed by three progressively inventive and acclaimed albums for the Fresh Sound label: the quartet discs The Slightest Shift (2006) and Rye Eclipse (2008), then the trio set Good Citizen (2010). Davis\u2019s 2011 solo piano album on Clean Feed, Aeriol Piano, appeared on Best of the Year lists in The New York Times, JazzTimes and Art Forum. Davis wrote the extraordinary arrangements for saxophonist-composer Tony Malaby\u2019s nonet project Novela, with the album Novela released by Clean Feed in 2011 and appearing on Best of the Year lists in DownBeat and JazzTimes. The pianist is also part of the collaborative Paradoxical Frog with Laubrock and drummer Tyshawn Sorey. Paradoxical Frog, the trio\u2019s 2010 album on Clean Feed, was included on Best of the Year lists by National Public Radio, The New York Times and All About Jazz. In addition to her work as a leader, Davis has performed with such top figures as Paul Motian, Bill Frisell, Tim Berne, John Hollenbeck, Michael Formanek and Mary Halvorson. Davis started playing piano at age 6, studying classical music through the Royal Conservatory in Canada and formulating her desire for a life in music by playing in the school jazz band at age 12. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in Jazz Piano from the University of Toronto and attended the Banff Centre for the Arts jazz program in 1997 and 2000. The pianist received a Canada Council grant to relocate to New York and study composition with Jim McNeely, then another to study extended piano techniques with Benoit Delbecq in Paris. She holds a master\u2019s in Classical Composition from the City College of New York, and she teaches at the School for Improvised Music. The Jazz Gallery has given Davis a commissioning residency to write for her trio with Rainey and John H\u00e9bert to take place in May 2013, and the Shifting Foundation awarded her a grant to compose and record a large-ensemble project.

I loved Sergio Mendes\u2019 songs, liked John Hartford on the Glenn Campbell Show and really got into James Taylor and Joni Mitchell who I still consider my two main influences. I also loved the singer-songwriters of the time including Carole King and Laura Nyro and later fell in love with Steely Dan\u2019s music, and just wore out my copy of Hubert Laws\u2019 Rite Of Spring. I was completely self-taught, by llistening to records and playing them over and over, teaching myself tablature from a great James Taylor book and modal tunings from Joni Mitchell\u2019s For The Roses song book. I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit. Other long term members include drummer Ray Levier and keyboardist Peter Vitalone, both of whom have been with KJ since\u201998 and \u201899. I am always interested in stretching myself and performing my music in different ways. The Lucky 7 recordings feature some wonderful pairings of great players that I don\u2019t always get to tour with but who have appeared in with me at The 55 and are wonderful friends too.\nKJ manages between 120-140 performances a year.

For 40 years, the Southern Rock legends celebrated triumphs, endured tragedies and survived legal nightmares to remain one of the most influential and best-loved bands of the genre. Now The Outlaws return with new music, new focus and an uncompromising new mission: It\u2019s about a band of brothers bound together by history, harmony and the road. It\u2019s about a group that respects its own legacy while refusing to be defined by its past. But most of all, it\u2019s about pride.\n\nIt\u2019s About Pride is the new album from The Outlaws, a record 4 years in the making and perhaps 20 or more in the waiting. And for original Outlaws singer/ guitarist Henry Paul, it\u2019s a hard-fought revival whose success can be measured in old fans and new music. \u201cBecause The Outlaws have been out of the public eye for so long, it\u2019s almost like starting over,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut because of the band\u2019s history, we\u2019re seeing this as a new chapter. We\u2019ve written and recorded this album on our own terms, and we\u2019re out to make a significant impression. What our fans loved then they still love now, because we are just as good or even better than we were. Most of all, they recognize the heart of what it is we still do.\u201d For co-founding drummer Monte Yoho, the journey is both bittersweet and jubilant. \u201cI still think about the friends we made when we first came into this industry, how we struggled to define this thing that became known as \u2018Southern Rock\u2019,\u201d Yoho says. \u201cThis new album embodies all the things we shared musically and personally, as well as the relationships we have with our fans to this day. It\u2019s about where we\u2019ve been, where we\u2019re going, and why we still love to do this.\u201d\n\nHistory lesson: Formed in Tampa in 1972, The Outlaws \u2013 known for their triple-guitar rock attack and three-part country harmonies \u2013 became one of the first acts signed by Clive Davis (at the urging of Ronnie Van Zant) to his then-fledgling Arista Records. The band\u2019s first three albums The Outlaws, Lady In Waiting and Hurry Sundown \u2013 featuring such rock radio favorites as \u201cThere Goes Another Love Song\u201d, \u201cGreen Grass & High Tides\u201d, \u201cKnoxville Girl\u201d and \u201cFreeborn Man\u201d \u2013 would become worldwide gold and platinum landmarks of the Southern Rock era. Known as \u2018The Florida Guitar Army\u2019 by their fans, The Outlaws earned a formidable reputation as an incendiary live act touring with friends The Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Marshall Tucker Band and The Charlie Daniels Band as well as The Doobie Brothers, The Who, Eagles and The Rolling Stones. Henry Paul left after the group\u2019s third album to form The Henry Paul Band for Atlantic Records, and later the multi-Platinum country trio Blackhawk. Over the next 20+ years, The Outlaws would experience rampant personnel changes, tonal missteps, ill-fated reunions and bitter trademark battles that left fans \u2013 not to mention Paul and Yoho \u2013 frustrated and saddened. And with the tragic deaths of co-founding members Frank O\u2019Keefe and Billy Jones in 1995, and especially vocalist/lead guitarist Hughie Thomasson in 2007, it was feared that The Outlaws\u2019 trail had come to an end.\n\n\u201cThe Outlaws were the one area of my career where I had regrets,\u201d admits Paul. \u201cMore importantly, I think it was the one area in my career where I thought I still have something to prove. I felt compelled to stick my neck out and take a chance of putting this band back together. I knew we would be judged, but I hoped we would be judged on our abilities.\u201d Along with founding members Paul and Yoho, the band features several of Southern Rock\u2019s most respected veterans: Lead guitarist and longtime Outlaw Chris Anderson is well known for his collaborations with artists that include Dickey Betts, Lucinda Williams, Hank Williams Jr., and Skynyrd. Co-lead guitarist Steve Grisham - who joined the band in mid-2013 following the medical leave of guitarist Billy Crain - is a former member of the Soldiers Of Fortune era Outlaws, a noted songwriter whose tracks include The Henry Paul Band's Top 40 hit \"Keepin Our Love Alive\", and a co-founder of the Southern Rock all-stars, Brothers of the Southland. Keyboardist/vocalist Dave Robbins is a co-founding member of Blackhawk and has written hit songs for artists that include Restless Heart, Kenny Rogers and Eric Clapton. Bassist/vocalist Randy Threet has performed with Pam Tillis, Trisha Yearwood and Blackhawk, and is familiar to TV audiences from USA Network\u2019s \u2018Nashville Star\u2019. \u201cFrom the very beginning, our band had a heart,\u201d Monte Yoho says. \u201cAnd a lot of people who come out and see this incarnation of the band respond to the exact same things we used to put on that stage in the \u201870s and \u201880s.\u201d\n\nOn that stage, the band burns hotter than ever: \u201cThe Outlaws helped define Southern Rock for me and for generations of fans,\u201d wrote music journalist Bill Robinson in June 2012 in The Huffington Post. \u201cSeeing them onstage with The Charlie Daniels Band, Marshall Tucker Band, Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd or countless others was, for a long time, one of the best experiences I could have. And so it was again when I saw The Outlaws play recently.\u201d The Outlaws\u2019 live shows \u2013 more than 150 per year \u2013 are blazing 2+ hour tributes to the band\u2019s rich history and fiery rebirth. Classic tracks and fan favorites from the first three albums \u2013 as well as The Henry Paul Band\u2019s definitive \u201cGrey Ghost\u201d \u2013 share the spotlight with songs from the new disc that are already being embraced by audiences. \u201cI think the new songs go back to those first three classic albums, when the band was proud of its influences from country, blues and jazz,\u201d says Billy Crain. \u201cPlus, Chris Anderson and I have honored and maybe even stepped up the legacy of the \u2018guitar army\u2019. Fans are coming away from shows feeling a part of the Outlaws experience.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s the new album \u2013 produced by Michael Bush and Henry Paul \u2013 that brings the experience home. The disc opens with \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Another Night\u201d, a scorching take on the band\u2019s history complete with monster harmonies and a killer hook. \u201cHidin\u2019 Out In Tennessee\u201d delivers classic Outlaws country/bluegrass energy. \u201cBorn To Be Bad\u201d is badass biker boogie and \u201cLast Ghost Town\u201d is kickass guitar rock. \u201cNothin\u2019 Main About Main Street\u201d is an affecting Springsteen/Seger style look at lost small-town life. \u201cThe Flame\u201d \u2013 Hughie Thomasson\u2019s nickname \u2013 is a potent tribute to the much-loved late Outlaw. Chris Anderson\u2019s \u201cTrail Of Tears\u201d electrifies via bitter history, intense vocals and searing guitars. \u201cRight Where I Belong\u201d, \u201cAlex\u2019s Song\u201d and \u201cTrouble Rides A Fast Horse\u201d could easily be lost tracks from any of the band\u2019s first three albums. The disc\u2019s closer, \u201cSo Long\u201d is a haunting re-recording of Henry\u2019s 1979 classic. \u201cIt was the first song on the first Henry Paul Band album, and it\u2019s the final song on this record,\u201d explains Paul. \u201cI wanted it to be a sort of coda to the new music, but I also want it to be a relevant part of the new Outlaws landscape. I think it\u2019s one of the best songs I\u2019ve ever written, and I think we\u2019ve done an admirable job of giving it a new personality.\u201d But the new album\u2019s true centerpiece is its title track, co-written by Henry Paul and Billy Crain. \u201cIt\u2019s About Pride\u201d is both tribute and testimony from a band that has lived it all, played it all, and returns to reclaim it all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be a part of something that started long ago,\u201d Henry Paul sings reflectively, \u201ca Southern band of brothers bound together by the road/They came from Florida, Georgia, Carolina and Tennessee/With old guitars, tattoos and scars, straight from the heart of Dixie/And our rebel pride.\u201d From its towering chorus to its searing guitar-onslaught finale, \u201cIt\u2019s About Pride\u201d is a fierce first-person anthem to the genre, delivered with the poignancy and power of absolute survivors. \u201cIt\u2019s a very emotional song,\u201d Paul says. \u201cDepending on my mood and the night, sometimes it\u2019s all I can do to get the words out without crying. It summons up a lot of images of people who are no longer with us, of times we shared standing tall together for the first time. When I first wrote the end of the second verse \u2013 \u201cThe reason \u2018Sweet Home Alabama\u2019 means so much to me/Is it\u2019s about pride\u201d \u2013 I knew that people would feel a lot of those same emotions. It\u2019s about an accumulated experience of separation, loss and success.\u201d Almost instantly, the song \u2013 and the entire album \u2013 is classic Southern Rock and classic Outlaws.\n\nRight now, The Outlaws are headed back on the road, back on the radio and back into the hearts of fans nationwide. \u201cI\u2019m seeing this thing we\u2019ve had for four decades be exposed to whole new audiences,\u201d Monte Yoho says. \u201cWe\u2019re having a second life as a band, and it feels better than ever. Best of all, I\u2019m still doing it with some of the same people I\u2019ve known for most of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want people to hear this album and see our show and realize that The Outlaws are back,\u201d says Henry Paul. \u201cOur goal is to unite the fans and bring the band back into the light. In a way, this is like a second chance at my first love. It\u2019s about finishing what we started.\u201d For Henry, Monte, Chris, Steve, Dave and Randy, it\u2019s about a band of brothers who love playing their own style of rock, and who 40 years ago first got the chance to take it from Florida to the world.\n\nFor The Outlaws, it\u2019s still about the music. And now more than ever, it\u2019s about pride.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "610 W 56th St, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "In This Moment ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8259955.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.992666, 40.769855], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Metal, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Terminal 5", "moreBioInfo": "Led by front woman Maria Brink, the Los Angeles hard rock outfit strikes with a seductive metallic bite on their aptly titled fifth full-length album, Black Widow.

On the album, songwriter Lauren Denitzio (they/them) addresses themes of reconstructing and reexamining relationships as they relate to the current zeitgeist. \u201cI thought a lot about how the state of the world makes any sort of partnership stressful. The album is partially autobiographical but it\u2019s also addressing more universal questions that people have to ask these days. Do we have kids?

How does having no idea how you\u2019ll ever retire affect planning your future?\u201d\n\nSonically, the new album does an incredible job of reflecting these anxieties. To help capture the band\u2019s fresh sound, Denitzio recruited veteran producer John Agnello, best known for his work with some of indie rock\u2019s most influential acts such as Sonic Youth, Kurt Vile, Alvvays, and Dinosaur Jr. Agnello recorded with Worriers over 11 days in Jersey City, NJ at Kaleidoscope Sound and in Brooklyn, NY at Russell Street Recording. On the album, Denitzio is joined by new guitarist Frank Piegaro, and longtime drummer Mikey Erg and bassist Nick Psillas. Unlike their previous releases, 2015\u2019s Imaginary Life (Don Giovanni) and 2017\u2019s Survival Pop (Side One Dummy/reissued by 6131 Records), the band recorded the majority of the album live in the studio.

He is best known for his opera Carmen.\n\nHe was born in Paris. He was registered with the legal name Alexandre-C\u00e9sar-L\u00e9opold Bizet, but was baptized Georges Bizet and was always known by the latter name. A child prodigy, he entered the prestigious Paris Conservatory of Music a fortnight before his tenth birthday.\n\nIn 1857 he shared a prize offered by Jacques Offenbach for a setting of the one-act operetta Le docteur Miracle and won the Prix de Rome. As per the conditions of the scholarship, he studied in Rome for three years. There, his talent began to mature with such works as the opera Don Procopio. Besides this stay in Rome, Bizet lived in the Paris area for his entire life.\n\nFollowing his stay in Rome, he returned to Paris where he dedicated himself to composition. Early into his return to Paris, Georges's mother died. In 1863 he composed the opera Les p\u00eacheurs de perles (The Pearl Fishers) for the Theatre-Lyrique. During this period Bizet also wrote the opera La jolie fille de Perth, his well-known L'arl\u00e9sienne (written as incidental music for a play), and the piano piece Jeux d'enfants (Children's games) He also wrote the romantic opera Djamileh, which is often seen as a percursor to Carmen. His first symphony, the Symphony in C Major, was written at the Paris Conservatory when he was only seventeen years old, evidently as a student assignment. It seems that Bizet completely forgot about it himself, and it was not discovered again until 1935, in the dusty archives of the Conservatory library. Upon its first performance, it was immediately hailed as a junior masterwork and a welcome addition to the early Romantic period repertoire. A delightful work (and a prodigious one, from a seventeen-year-old boy), the symphony is noteworthy for bearing an amazing stylistic resemblance to the music of Franz Schubert, whose work was virtually unknown in Paris at that time (with the possible exception of a few of his songs). A second symphony, \"Roma\" was not completed.\n\nBizet's best-known work is his 1875 opera, Carmen, which was based on an 1846 novel of the same name by Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e. Influenced by Giuseppe Verdi, he composed the title role in Carmen for a mezzo-soprano. Not an immediate success, Bizet became despondent over the perceived failure, but praise came from such luminaries as Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Tchaikovsky, and Debussy, who recognized its greatness. Their views were prophetic, as the public eventually made Carmen one of the most popular works in operatic history.\n\nAlthough most known as a composer, Bizet was also an extraordinarily fine pianist, whose playing was praised by no less a judge than Franz Liszt himself. After Bizet flawlessly sightread a complex piece, Liszt said he considered Bizet one of the three finest pianists in Europe.\n\nBizet had long suffered from quinsy, a painful inflammation of the tonsils associated with angina and never got to enjoy Carmen's success. Just a few months after the opera's debut, he died on his sixth wedding anniversary at the early age of 36, the official cause of death being listed as a failed heart due to \"acute articular rheumatism\". He was interred in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.\n\n[source: wikipedia 2006 07 21 \u2022 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bizet]", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "85 E 4th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "The Showdown ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.989876, 40.726489], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Kraine Theater", "moreBioInfo": "There are two bands that share Showdown in their name;\n1.A Hardcore Band from Norway called \"Showdown\"\n2.The other is called \"The Showdown\" from Elizabethton, Tenn., this crushing five-piece band has crafted an epic heavy metal sound for listeners who enjoy their music relentless.

Favorite musste daraufhin einen Gro\u00dfteil seiner Jugend in Waisenh\u00e4usern verbringen und wurde nat\u00fcrlich durch diese Zeit sehr beeinflusst. Er musste sich alleine durchschlagen und sammelte viele Erfahrungen, die ihn gepr\u00e4gt haben.\n\nIn dieser Zeit kam auch der erste Kontakt mit Rapmusik zustande. Er merkte schnell, dass er einfach rappen muss und so entstanden im Alter von 15 Jahren seine ersten Texte und Aufnahmen.\n\n\u00dcber Umwege geriet Favorites Demotape 2004 an Slick One, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt gerade mit der Gr\u00fcndung von Selfmade Records besch\u00e4ftigt war. Sofort war er von dem Talent, der ausdrucksvollen Stimme und dem Rapstil des damals 18j\u00e4hrigen beeindruckt und somit wurde Favorite der erste Newcomer, der fest zu Selfmade Records geh\u00f6rte.\n\nNach dem Einstand mit dem Track \u201eRuhrpott 4 Life\u201c auf dem Schwarzes Gold Sampler machte sich Favorite an das Album mit seinem Rapkollegen Jason, welches im Oktober 2005 unter dem Titel \u201eRappen kann t\u00f6dlich sein\u201c \u00fcber Selfmade Records erschien und f\u00fcr einen Einstand nach Ma\u00df sorgte. Danach konnte er mit diversen Features, u.a. auf dem \u201eZuh\u00e4ltertape\u201c des neuen Labelmates Kollegah, \u00fcberzeugen.\n\nAm 26. Januar 2007 erscheint nun Favorites erstes Soloalbum \u201eHARLEKIN\u201c. Die Produktionen stammen von den TOP Producern RIZBO, FLIPSTAR und JIMMY LEDRAC (SWE). Der Albumtitel beschreibt die zwei Seiten des mittlerweile 20-j\u00e4hrigen Newcomers: Einmal die humorvolle und provokante Seite und andererseits die ernste und nachdenkliche Gegenseite, gepr\u00e4gt von Favorites Vergangenheit. Diese Gegens\u00e4tze werden auch durch das Cover ausger\u00fcckt, welches von Prinz Pi gestaltet wurde.\n\nAuf \u201eHARLEKIN\u201c wird deutlich, welche beachtliche Vielseitigkeit und thematische Variation m\u00f6glich ist, und dies auf einem konstant hohen technischen Niveau. Favorites einpr\u00e4gsame Stimme und der experimentelle, immer wieder \u00fcberraschende Umgang damit, sein druckvoller Rapstil und nicht zuletzt Favorites Humor machen seinen Rapstil einzigartig. Favorite-Rap ist Anarcho-Rap. Rap in einer neuen Form.\n\n\nhttp://www.kingfavorite.de\nhttp://www.selfmaderecords.de\nhttp://www.myspace.com/faiv", "otherInfo": "Sure, you binge-watch episodes of The Voice and try to turn every birthday into a karaoke party.

Also, there are a few tracks that might appear here from theatrical montages of Cabaret, the musical. (Which explains the similar artists being all musical-related)\n\n-Cabaret is a 1966 Broadway musical set in Berlin in 1929 through 1930 during the run-up to the coming to power of the Nazis under Adolf Hitler. The musical is comprised of the book by Joe Masteroff, lyrics by Fred Ebb and music by John Kander.\nIt is based on John Van Druten's play I Am a Camera, which was in turn based on the novel Goodbye to Berlin by Christopher Isherwood. Its initial run was produced and directed by Hal Prince and starred Bert Convy, Jack Gilford, Jill Haworth, Lotte Lenya, Joel Grey, Peg Murray, and Edward Winter. Such soundtrack as the:\n-Original Broadway cast\n-New Broadway Cast Recording 1998\n-Cabaret Motion Picture Soundtrack\n\n- Brazilian band Cabaret hails from Rio de Janeiro, formed after the demise of a previous underground hit called Glamourama. Their sound is heavily influenced by glam rock, also incorporating some Brazilian rock elements. Currently (as of February 2007) the band is comprised of Marvel (vocals), Myself Deluxe (bass), Peter Glitter (guitar) and De la Foca (drums).\n\nCabaret has somewhat of a cult status after their first album, \"Cabaret\", received a wide span of good reviews from both the alternative and mainstream Brazilian music press. The band is also known for their theatrical live performances, often gaining new fans after energetic performances, specially of underground hits \"Messias Pessoal\", \"Dama da Noite\" and \"Cad\u00e1ver no Palco\". The band's website is http://www.radiocabaret.com.br .\n\n\n- The Polish Cabaret was formed in 1997 by two friends: Jaros\u0142aw Pawlik and Mariusz Radecki. But it is the year 2000, when a new musician - Micha\u0142 \u2018IA\u2019 Bieniek (ex-Noise Gate) - joins CABARET, that can actually be considered the initial date of the band\u2019s conscious artistic activity. It is also then that the band first starts achieving minor triumphs.\nhttp://www.cabaret.net.pl\nhttp://www.myspace.com/cabaretband", "otherInfo": "Sure, you binge-watch episodes of The Voice and try to turn every birthday into a karaoke party.

Their sound is characterized by a synthesis of orchestral backing, lounge jazz, and soul; the lush orchestrations of multi-instrumentalist Dickon Hinchliffe and the smoky baritone of lead vocalist Stuart A. Staples are the band's hallmarks. Tindersticks have employed electric guitars, as most rock bands have done, but augment their instrumentation with a wide array of instruments: Rhodes piano, glockenspiel, vibraphone, violin, trumpet, trombone, clarinet, bassoon, Hammond organ, and many more are prominently utilized in the music of Tindersticks.\n\nThe band has a cult following in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, although the eclectic and unique sound Tindersticks possesses never made significant inroads in the mainstream.\n\nPersonnel\n\n* Stuart Ashton Staples, born 14 November 1965 - Lead voice, guitar, melodica\n* Dickon James Hinchliffe, born 9 July 1967 - violin, guitar, voice, piano, string and brass arrangements\n* Neil Timothy Fraser, - born 22 November 1962 - lead guitar, vibraphone\n* David Leonard Boulter, born 27 February 1965 - keyboards, percussion\n* Alasdair Robert De Villeneuve Macaulay, born 2 August 1965 - drums, percussion, trumpet\n* Mark Andrew Colwill, born 12 May 1960 - bass guitar\n\nThe band formed in late 1991, Staples, Boulter, Frazer, Macauley and Hinchcliffe having previously been members of Asphalt Ribbons. The final band line-up for the \"old horse\" mini-LP (1991) was: Stuart Staples (vocals) Dave Boulter (organ & accordion) Neil Fraser (guitar) Dickon Hinchliffe (Guitar & strings) Al Macauley (percussion & drums) John Thompson (bass). Mark Colwill was recruited when John Thompson left the Asphalt Ribbons, but it is not sure if he played any gigs under the Asphalt Ribbons name. Then they changed their name to Tindersticks after Stuart A. Staples discovered a box of German matches on a Greek beach.\n\nTindersticks started recording demo tapes in 1992, and were signed by Tippy Toe Records who released their first single, \"Patchwork\".\n\nTheir self-titled first and second albums established their signature sound and received widespread critical acclaim. Their live performances, often augmented by large string sections and even, on occasion, a full orchestra, were rapturously received. (The live album Bloomsbury Theatre 12.3.95 is a recording of one such concert.) By the time of the third album, Curtains, however, it was clear that a change of direction was called for. There was a certain ennui to the songs, and the lengthy \"Ballad of Tindersticks\" was a weary swipe at the pressures of being a touring band.\n\nThe fourth album, Simple Pleasure, lived up to its title with a series of snappy, direct songs influenced by soul music. The female backing vocals on several tracks, and the respectful cover of Odyssey's \"If You're Looking For A Way Out\", signalled the band's wish to move towards lighter, more soulful material. However, the inner sleeve's documentation of the number of takes each track went through was evidence that the band continued to adopt a painstaking approach to recording.\n\nThe fifth album, Can Our Love, continued the band's soulful direction, in particular evidence on the tender \"Sweet Release\" and in the nod to the Chi-Lites in the title of \"Chilitetime\".\n\nThe sixth and most recent album, Waiting For The Moon, was more stripped down and introspective in nature, particularly on the harrowing \"4.48 Psychosis\" (based on the play of the same name by the British playwright Sarah Kane) and \"Sometimes It Hurts\". Only the bouncy \"Just A Dog\" lightened the otherwise melancholy mood of the album.\n\nIn 2005 Staples embarked on a solo career and there was resultant speculation that the band had split. Staples has so far produced two solo albums, Lucky Dog Recordings 03-04 and Leaving Songs. The title of the second album, and Staples' notes on it, indicate that Tindersticks may indeed be at an end: \"These are songs written on the verge of leaving the things I loved and stepping into a new unknown life, both musically and personally. I was always aware that these songs were the end of something, a kind of closing a circle of a way of writing that I started so long ago and I knew I had to move on from.\"\n\nIn September 2006, the band played a one-off concert at London's Barbican Centre, performing their second album in full with a nine-member string section and two brass players, including former collaborator Terry Edwards on trumpet. This concert brought the band's members back together. A new recording process in 2007 resulted in a new album, The Hungry Saw, which was released on April 28th 2008.\n\nIn the meantime, in July 2007, Island Records had released The BBC Sessions, a double CD compilation of the band's sessions for BBC radio programmes.\n\nAs well as their six studio albums, the band has produced the soundtracks for two films by the French director Claire Denis, Nenette et Boni and Trouble Every Day.\nThey recorded a cover of the Four Tops song, \"What Is A Man\", for the theme to the British TV series The Sins.\nThe Tindersticks song Tiny Tears was featured prominently in the Series 1 episode \"Isabella\" of HBO's The Sopranos. Additionally, a version of \"Running Wild\" was played during the ending credits of the penultimate episode of the series, \"The Blue Comet\". In the Season One Finale of Brotherhood, \"El Diablo En El Ojo\" is used twice.\n\n* Tindersticks (aka First Album) (This Way Up, 1993)\n* Tindersticks (aka Second Album) (This Way Up, 1995)\n* Curtains (This Way Up, 1997)\n* Simple Pleasure (Island, 1999)\n* Can Our Love...

The group consists of Nick Anderson (vocals), Nick Schmidt (guitar), Aaron Kelley (bass), and Billy Nally (drums). Heavily influenced by groups such as The Pixies, The Strokes, Weezer, and Vampire Weekend, this 5-piece isn't afraid to blend undeniably catchy choruses, with self-deprecative, honest lyrics and vocals that pull you right to the center of each song.\n\nThe band actually recorded their debut EP on a whim, alongside friend and engineer Andrew D\u2019Angelo, when they were surprised with the news that a friend had been granted access to a studio for just a few days. With a total budget of $0, and only a week as a band under their belts, the group set out to record the best songs that they could in 3 days. After working ridiculous hours through the night, and to the next day whenever they could get in the studio, the 3 days were over and the EP was cut. Little did the band know, they were not even allowed to be in the studio that week. So through feelings of guilt and worry, they cleaned every bit of information of theirs from the studio computer, every crumb of Dominoes from the studio couch, and they were off with their entire EP on an hard drive in a backpack.\n\nThe homemade \"We Are The Wrecks\" EP was self-released in March 2016. After hundreds of spins on Sirius XM's Alt Nation, and features on some of Spotify's biggest rock playlists, the band signed to Another Century/Sony Music in December of 2016. Their debut single Favorite Liar broke the Top 40 on alternative radio, has over 6 million plays on Spotify, and spent almost a dozen weeks in the top 10 of Alt Nation's Alt-18 Countdown. After signing their record deal, The Wrecks sought out to record a new EP in Los Angeles. 3 weeks into recording, and after blowing almost the entire budget, the band decided the music was going in the wrong direction and threw the EP away. \"I just felt that we had strayed too far from the core of the band's sound,\" says frontman Nick Anderson. \"It sounded like we were trying really hard to get on the radio or something, and I feel like that rarely gets you on the radio anyway.\" So after getting their label and management on board, The Wrecks decided to move into Anderson's grandmother's house in his small hometown (Wellsville, NY) to work on the new record in a barn studio that their friend Patrick Barry owns. Co-produced again by Nick Anderson and Andrew D'Angelo, The Wrecks say their new upcoming EP \"comes from a genuine place, and is something we're all truly proud of.\"", "otherInfo": "The Driver Era"}, {"Address": "311 West 34th Street, New York City, NY 10001", "Artist": "James Holden ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8672091.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.994274, 40.752704], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Progressive House, Techno, Electronic", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Manhattan Center Hammerstein Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "James Holden is far from your average DJ-producer.\n\nThe wunderkind James Holden has finally come of age, and has delivered up the debut album to prove it: and at 28, about time too! For although the world seems strangely intent on fixing him in his early twenties (or more specifically, a series of internet sites who have seemingly overlooked the fact that biography ages require a yearly update!), the time has come to acknowledge that DJ and producer James Holden is not quite so young anymore. The timely release of Holden's 'The Idiots Are Winning' mini-album in 2006 marked the occasion, and formed a fitting musical illustration of Holden's new-found maturity.\n\nStill reluctant to bestow upon it the accolade of 'debut album', for Holden himself 'The Idiots Are Winning' remains an EP which grew out of control: take four dancefloor-length Holden tracks, mix in the obligatory DJ tools and alternative versions that he is so keen on, and an interlude or two for good measure, and you have far exceeded the single realm and are pushing into album territory. Not that the manner of its creation should affect the listening experience: Holden's intricate and inimitable production style ensures a coherence of atmosphere, where even DJ-friendly extended intros hold up to home-listening scrutiny. The Guardian went so far as to proclaim it \"the most astonishing debut in electronic music since Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children.\" And who are we to argue?\n\nThe producer James Holden's journey to this point began back in 1999, aged just 19, when he burst onto the UK scene with the exuberant teenage trance hit 'Horizons'. Produced on a basic home computer set-up and the freeware music program Buzz whilst still studying towards a Maths degree at the University of Oxford, the young punk's overnight success was a slap in the face for the audiophile establishment, and went some way towards opening doors for the legions of young bedroom producers who have now become the mainstay of the dance world. The floodgates had opened, and an intensive course of remixing, djing, production and collaborations extended before Holden in place of the conventional Oxford graduate career path.\n\nBut if the axis of English (and those related countries which take their lead from the Anglo-American progressive house and trance scenes) took to Holden overnight, the rest of the world took a little longer to convince. It was not until the launch of his own Border Community label in 2003, kicked off in fine style with his own future anthem 'A Break in the Clouds', when key players in the hugely influential German scene began to sit up and take notice. Having found himself wedged rather uncomfortably between the prog and trance scenes in his native UK, this entrance into the German market represented a new-found freedom for Holden, and the non-generic approach to making melodic electronic music which he found amongst many of his peers in Cologne and Berlin finally had him feeling right at home. A string of hugely-influential and often-imitated monster remixes of everyone from Madonna and Britney Spears, through Depeche Mode and New Order, to Nathan Fake and Kieran Hebden and Steve Reid cemented his place as a mainstay of DJ record boxes everywhere, and Holden's global dancefloor domination was complete.\n\nOriginally founded to offer a restriction-free outlet for Holden's own music, as well as serving as a launch pad for the production careers of his talented friends, the rather fanatical cult of Border Community which has sprung up around Holden's own label has of course been essential in achieving this independence from the narrow limitations of genre-specific music. The accolades due to Holden's Border Community baby include bucking the trend of declining vinyl sales in a major way, unleashing a whole host of idiosyncratic dancefloor classics on the world, kickstarting the careers of many a young musician, and making serious inroads on the realm of the artist album with offerings from Nathan Fake, Fairmont and Holden himself. Now in its fifth year, Border Community is firmly established as one of the foremost breeding grounds for fresh young electronic talent, thanks to their small but faithful army of free-spirited genre benders who between them have injected a new life into the European scene.\n\nThe best place to catch a glimpse of the soon-to-be-massive delights yet to come from his Border Community label is of course a James Holden DJ set, where his tireless dedication to hunting down the next wave of young production talent meets his own sense of exemplary taste in selecting tracks from other labels to bring his unique vision of what club music ought to be to life. Barely coming up for air between his non-stop sampler and CDJ wizardry, Holden is a very modern sort of DJ, brazenly uniting tracks from music's past and present, disregarding genre, confounding the purists and making club hits out of many an unwitting dancefloor virgin. His supreme and unrivalled command of the modern technology available to him allows Holden to go where other DJs fear to tread, consistently pulling off daring mixes on-the-fly which just wouldn't be possible on a conventional two turntable set-up. And so distinct is the resultant sound that your average conservative dance music night can barely contain it, which is why James Holden is often best experienced alongside his edgy labelmates at one of his many Border Community label nights, at The End in London, and beyond.\n\nBetween a hectic touring schedule which has taken in just about every corner of the world, running his Zeitgeist-defining label, and his status as hugely in-demand remixer du jour, it is little wonder that Holden's own original productions have occasionally seemed a little thin on the ground. But something has got to give if Renaissance man Holden is ever going to finish his next album, which is why his plans for 2008 feature a scaled down set of DJ dates and a strictly-enforced remix embargo. With that all-important studio time freed up, the time has come to begin plotting the next chapter in the James Holden story.", "otherInfo": "Due to restrictions put in place to minimise the spread of COVID-19, we regret that the North American leg of the Thom Yorke Tomorrow?s Modern Boxes tour is postponed.

I found my voice,\u201d notes the Toronto-based artist.\n\nEarly in his career, Ollie was heavily involved in the YouTube community. At the age of 16, he opened his first YouTube channel and began uploading gameplay commentaries. This eventually drove him to create a music channel where he would promote the sounds of up-and-coming artists. Ollie\u2019s desire to promote other undiscovered talent only further inspired him to begin releasing his own music under an alias that took form from his father's childhood nickname. He began, writing, recording and releasing these songs, quickly getting featured on videos of popular gamers and personalities, building awareness around Ollie in the YouTube community. This subsequently translated to over 18K subscribers on YouTube, and over 430K monthly listeners on Spotify. In turn, this created an unbreakable bond between an artist and his constantly growing fanbase.\n\nWith a focused vision, and a clear message behind his music, Ollie\u2019s newest endeavor, a 3-track EP titled, Lost, is setting a promising foundation for 2019. This release coincides with shows in Europe, the U.S. and Canada. Lost, which explores themes of insecurities, paranoia and relationships, adds a complex layer to Ollie\u2019s music, once more highlighting his musicality and fearlessness of being himself, and giving fans something to connect to intimately.\n\n\u201cI get a lot of messages and comments from people talking about how a certain song was able to impact their life, or how they found a form of comfort through my words,\u201d he explains. \u201cI try and spend as much time as I can everyday talking with my fans one-on-one, not just about my music, but on a personal level, something \u2018More Than Music\u2019.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Maybe We Were Supposed To Tour"}, {"Address": "635 Sackett Street, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "Julian Cubillos ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.983337, 40.678441], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "littlefield", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The first headlining tour with a full band following her acclaimed album, The Shape of Your Name."}, {"Address": "North Plainfield, NJ", "Artist": "Tam Garcia ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9215170.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.4274, 40.6301], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Pop, Reggae, Alternative, R&b", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Mi Casa", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-Songwriter Tam Garcia has been performing since he was fourteen years old.

Like Frank\u2019s. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s an ant in amber, frozen forever in its last performance. The Z3\u2019s \u201cFunky Takes on Frank\u201d began as Tim, Beau and Bill\u2019s way of playing the music they\u2019ve obsessed over for years to the audiences that come to see them right now. With nothing but guitar, Hammond organ/keys, drums and three voices, The Z3 tackled everything from Freak Out to Broadway the Hard Way with a playful and adventurous spirit that has thus far tickled the fancies of both diehard FZ fans as well as those that \u201cnever knew they liked him.\u201d\n\nAnd then they met Ed Mann.\n\nEd played mallet instruments, percussion, sang and did a mean Bob Dylan impersonation in the Frank Zappa band from 1977-88, in addition to his many solo albums and other collaborations. He first jammed with the Z3 on a single gig in January 2013, then again about 8 months later. After he accompanied the band on a blizzard-laden four-show run in December 2013 both parties agreed that the collaboration was much deeper than a \u201cspecial guest\u201d situation. So Ed Mann joined the band. Now he keeps the Z3 young and hip with his table full of mallet instruments, iPads, Kaos pads and various other electro-acoustic devices.\n\nOrganist Beau Sasser and drummer Bill Carbone discovered a shared passion for Frank Zappa while touring together in the band of guitarist Melvin Sparks. They daydreamed of a trio in the organ-funk style that performed nothing but Zappa, but who would complete the triumvirate and serve as the missing-link to bridge the two genres was a mystery. When guitarist/vocalist Tim Palmieri, a diehard Zappa fan, ended up on a string of regular Wednesday night funk gigs with The Beau Sasser Trio in November 2011, the Z3 was born. The three musicians knew each other from years working in the Northeast music scene, their chemistry was undeniable, and the transition from pickup band to the Z3 was as smooth as passage of quintuplets in 9/8.\n\nThe Z3 was created for fun, and that\u2019s probably why audiences find it so enjoyable. The initial run of Z3 shows in Northampton, MA were jammed with fans of the individual musicians and of FZ, and, as the band worked toward engaging both the FZ material and the audience, the temperature has risen. The Z3 has since rocked the Blue Note Jazz Club in NYC, peppered the summer festival circuit with their Funky Takes on Frank, and delivered a legendary 3+ hour set at the Zappanale 24 festival in Bad Doberon, Germany. Give thanks for Frank!\n\nThe Z3 is:\n\nTim Palmieri (www.timpalmieri.com)\nTim Palmieri is one of the most impressive guitarists on the national music scene today. Playing with his bands Kung Fu and The Breakfast alongside artists such as moe., Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Tea Leaf Green, and Phish\u2019s Mike Gordon, the New Haven native has amassed a loyal following of obsessive fans who keep tabs on just about every note.\n\nWhile prominent in the jam scene for his aggressive and improvisational guitar style, Palmieri has grown equally comfortable behind an acoustic guitar and tours tirelessly as a solo performer. His acoustic showcases are peppered with a mix of thoughtful originals, classic covers and unexpected rarities, each of which he makes his own through a distinctive style of rhythmic looping.\n\nAt the same time, Palmieri refuses to get too comfortable as a performer and thrives on challenging himself in new ways. He has covered the entire Beatles catalogue in alphabetical order and knows a shocking number of FZ tunes among so many others. His current main project, Kung Fu, has been hailed as a modern super group.\n\nBeau Sasser (www.beausasser.com)\nBeau Sasser hit the music scene at a young age, traversing the snowy highways of Colorado for both All-State high school band gigs and shows with legends like John Denver and Jimmy Ibbotson of The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. In the mid-90s Sasser headed east for a stint at Berklee College of Music and soon found himself back on the highways with the successful jamband Uncle Sammy.\n\nAround the year 2000 Sasser began performing almost exclusively on the Hammond Organ. In addition to his tenure as Melvin Sparks' preferred organist Sasser leads his own trio whose residency at Bishop's Lounge in Northampton, MA is now in its fifth year, performed for several years in the trio of Soulive\u2019s Alan Evans, and freelances like crazy.\n\nTouring throughout the United States and internationally, Beau has performed with with Maceo Parker (James Brown), Warren Haynes(Allman Brothers), Alan Evans (Soulive), Nikki Glaspie (Beyonce), Michael Feingold (Erykah Badu), Mike Keneally (Frank Zappa) and jazz greats Fareed Haque and Melvin Sparks.\n\nBill Carbone (http://www.billcarbone.com)\n\nBorn in the suburban cultural vacuum of CT, drummer Bill Carbone managed to graduate from his initial fascination with the dramatic plinkings of Rush and Yes to a broader palette of loves. Recently he\u2019s played jazz and boogaloo with guitarist Melvin Sparks, funk with organist Beau Sasser's trio, jam-rock with Max Creek and Zach Deputy, original quirky jazz-type music with the sax 4tet plus bass and drums Dead Cat Bounce, and reggae and experimental dub music with his own group Buru Style and various vocalists such as Makengo (Sierra Leone Refugee All Stars), Ajahni, Toussaint Liberator, Shasha Marley and others. As a percussionist he's tickled the Billboard charts with ROIR recording artists 10 ft Ganja Plant, graced several John Brown\u2019s Body tracks and also recorded with the founding members of Jamaica's legendary Soul Syndicate Band.\n\nCarbone is currently a PhD candidate in ethnomusicology at Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT, where he also teaches drums and steel pan while pecking away at a dissertation about gender and the Hammond Organ soul-jazz scene of the 1960s-70s. His writing has been featured in Wax Poetics, Modern Drummer, and in his bi-weekly New Haven Advocate column. He also teaches courses in ethnomusicology and world music at Central Connecticut State University.\n\nEd Mann vibes/percussion/electronics\n\nAward-winning mallet player/percussionist Ed Mann began his international professional career in 1977 when he joined Frank Zappa's band as percussionist, synthesist and background vocalist. Said to be the single-most recorded musician in the Zappa catalog, Ed performed and recorded with Zappa in electric and symphonic settings which are documented on over 35 albums from the 1977 release \"Live in New York\" through Zappa's last electric band project in 1988. During his tenure with FZ, Ed took on additional responsibilities of rehearsal director, keyboardist and electric sound designer, the latter function yielding technologically ground breaking digital music performance systems and the uniquely expressive sound set of sampled human vocalizations which characterize the social setting of Zappa's final electric band tour in 1988, as heard on the albums \"Broadway The Hard Way\", \"Best Band You Never Heard In Your Life\" and \"Make A Jazz Noise Here\".\n\nHaving released 5 critically acclaimed albums of original music, Ed has also performed and recorded with luminaries such as Don Ellis, Mark Isham, Shadowfax, Tavares, Hans Zimmer, Richie Lee Jones, Kenny Loggins, Don Preston, Bruce Fowler, Repercussion Unit, Andy Summers, Michael McDonald, Sting, Los Lobos, John Cage, Bill Eddins, the London Symphony Orchestra, Edmonton Symphony among many others and has taught and facilitated educational programs throughout the USA and Canada.", "otherInfo": "Get funky with the fellas on the music of Frank Zappa, reimagined for our tough times!\n\nTim Palmieri (Kung Fu) - guitar & vocals\nBeau Sasser (Kung Fu) - keys & vocals\nBill Carbone (Max Creek) - drums & vocals\n\nAwesome Double bill with Lo Faber & Tim Perozzi duo!"}, {"Address": "10 Theatre Alley, New York, NY 10038", "Artist": "Barbara Martinez ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7952074.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.006765, 40.711508], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "New York, New York", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Alley Cat Amateur Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "B\u00e1rbara MartInez grew up performing in New York City.

His soulful, Southern gospel and rock infused voice can soar over the top of any song, and draw you in with a hushed Tom Waits whisper. Underneath his voice is the framework of the organ and keyboards which can roar like a ten ton locomotive and wrap you up like a Stevie Wonder love song. The singing and playing come together to create a complete package. What else could you need?\n\nSo when the rhythm section kicks in, it\u2019s hard to believe that you could have more funky power coming your way. But there is more! The Heavy Duty Horns, the hard charging horn section led by founder Justin Flynn, adds the the top layer of energy and excitement that makes you dance, shout, and holler.\n\nThe band draws on a solid funk and soul tradition of remakes which take hits from other musical styles and other bands and spins them into something new. Examples of this are the bands remakes of The Beatles \u201cDaytripper\u201d as a funky, dance hall tune, or an updated \u201cWhat\u2019s going on\u201d that celebrates Marvin Gaye\u2019s urban cry while using the horns to up the urgency and drive home the song\u2019s message. \u201cLove The One You\u2019re With\u201d sounds fresh driven by four horns yet retains a funky 70\u2019s vibe while \u201cThe Way You Make Me Feel\u201d sounds like the an alternate version right out of Michael Jackson\u2019s heyday.\n\nThe band\u2019s live sets contain these songs mixed in with their originals. This is where you\u2019ll find the band\u2019s heart and soul. Drawing from influences including Prince, Tower of Power, Joe Cocker, The Doobie Brothers, and James Brown, the band mixes a dose of latin and jazz music in to create it\u2019s own unique sound.
