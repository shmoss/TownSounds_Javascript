Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011. Elephant Mountain has just recorded their new album and will be releasing it Spring/Summer of 2013. He's lent his vocal expertise to many local releases, and appears on MUSHROOMHEAD\u2019s album, \u201cBeautiful Stories For Ugly Children\u201d, singing on the track \u201cHoles In The Void\u201d\n\nAnd not to be outdone Joe has released three cd\u2019s of original material, \u201cJUST JOE SOLO EP\u201d (December 2011), \u201cMy Demons, My Burden, My Life\u201d (May of 2012) and \u201cGot Joe?\u201d (December of 2012).

But 99 Neighbors love to upend expectations. So the fact that they come from a woodsy hometown, far away from any anywhere people expect rap groups to come from, is only the beginning.\n\n\nA sprawling collective of rappers, singers, songwriters, producers, instrumentalists, and visual artists, 99 Neighbors challenges our preconceived notions of what a band even is. The lineup has evolved fluidly throughout its formation (although it\u2019s more or less set these days). No one person does just one thing, so the vocalists also make beats, and someone making beats one day might be directing a music video the next.\n\n\nIf you need help keeping them all straight (we feel you), that lineup currently consists of:\n\nSam Paulino (rapper/singer/songwriter)\n\nHank \u201cHANKNATIVE\u201d Collins (rapper/singer/songwriter)\n\nAidan Ostby (singer/songwriter)\n\nConnor \u201cSwank\u201d Stankevich (rapper/songwriter)\n\nCaleb \u201cSomba\u201d Hoh (producer/engineer/composer/songwriter)\n\nJulian \u201cJuju\u201d Segar-Reid (producer/multi-instrumentalist/composer)\n\nJared \u201cJFear\u201d Fier (DJ/producer)\n\nShane Kaseta (photographer/designer)\n\n\nLike so many other great bands, 99 Neighbors began as a friendship, or rather a couple of them. Sam and HANKNATIVE grew up together in Burlington, playing football and lacrosse together on their high school teams and rapping at house parties on weekends. Somba (the group\u2019s creative powerhouse, who has a hand in everything including production and videos) and Juju grew up together too. The two duos connected when Sam reached out to Somba over SoundCloud and realized they lived a quarter of a mile away from each other. Shane, another friend from high school, became the group\u2019s photographer and graphic designer. He was a founding member with the original vocalists and Somba when the group formed in 2018.\n\n\nAfter high school, the group\u2019s core moved in together in a dingy apartment in downtown Burlington to work on music full-time. The open-door policy they instituted quickly turned the place into a hub of the city\u2019s creative community where artists of all backgrounds and inclinations could jump into the mix (and crash on the couch if they needed to). Among them were Swank, who met the other rappers through basketball and freestyling at parties, and Aidan, who was involved when Sam and Somba first started working together, who would both become full-fledged members.\n\n\nAs 99 Neighbors grew into a collective with intentional blurry boundaries (hence the name), the core of the group squeezed into Somba\u2019s bedroom for two months to record their debut full-length, Television, an ambitious collection of songs showcasing the diversity of the group\u2019s talent, and an equally wide range of music they draw from, blending post-trap hip-hop with jazz and rock, soulful textures with electronic experimentation, undeniable hooks with the kind of hard-hitting brain-twistingly complex raps that you always hear people complaining no one\u2019s making anymore. It was at this point that Jared (a Boston native and the only member of the group not from Burlington) began DJing and producing with the group. By the time Television dropped at the beginning of 2019, 99 Neighbors was the biggest rap act in Burlington. Its reception online proved that the appeal wasn\u2019t just a local thing\u2013when the band alerted Reddit to its release their post generated so much traffic that the site took it down, mistakenly thinking it was the work of bots.\n\n\nIn February, Television single \u201cChampion\" caught the attention of Chance the Rapper\u2019s longtime manager Pat Corcoran, who soon after posted it on his Instagram. That opened up a conversation that led to a trip to Chicago, and eventually a deal to kick off a brand new collaboration between Corcoran\u2019s entertainment company Nice Work and Warner Records.\n\n\nFor the recording of their upcoming album, 99 Neighbors are going for a change of scenery. This time around they\u2019re working in a tiny town called Island Pond that\u2019s two hours north of Burlington, but the formula\u2019s still the same: a bunch of super-creative, super-talented people living in a house together and pooling their talents into something far bigger than the sum of its parts. If their work so far is any indication, you can bet that the next thing they release won\u2019t sound the same. The only thing you can ever bet on with 99 Neighbors\u2019 music is that you won\u2019t see it coming.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Izadore LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10322500.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Hip-hop, Pop", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Izadore is an American recording artist and record producer.\n\nWebsite: http://izadoreforever.com", "otherInfo": "This is a test post."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Andrew Sleighter LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9758494.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Standup Comedy", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Andrew Sleighter started in comedy looking for the perfect funny line to open a biography.

During that time he recorded some demos of covers on the piano, until later on he began to compose his own musical themes. At the age of 21, he moved to El Paso Tx, where he began to make his way with the American public participating in programs such as \"America\u2019s Got Talent\u201d in Austin, Texas and California. In 2017 he released his first album: \u201cA New Beginning\u201d of original themes from the New Age genre, including some Waltzes, most of the pieces are inspired by moments he personally experienced or reflections. Beside Mexico and the United States, he has played in different countries such as France, Colombia, Peru, Morocco and China. A couple of years later he presents his new album: \"Feelings\" which seeks to transmit the same energy from each place he visited, and his own experiences. Currently his main focus is creating melodies that create freedom, peace and hope, and transmit those emotions through music internationally.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Laura Reed LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9102716.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Blues-rock, Soul-blues", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cI was really young when I left South Africa,\u201d says Laura Reed, \u201cbut I had this vision that if I ever came back, I\u2019d be singing for a huge crowd.\u201d\n\nTwo decades later, Reed\u2019s dream became a reality when she returned to the Sandton neighborhood of Johannesburg, where she grew up, and took the stage in front of 30,000 cheering music fans at the Joy of Jazz Festival. Reed was the special guest of harmonica icon Lee Oskar that night, and her star turn at the festival was an unforgettable highlight in a career that\u2019s been chock full of them. Don\u2019t let the fairytale moment fool you, though. Reed climbed her way to success from the ground up, building a devoted audience and earning high-profile fans through grit, determination, and relentless touring. She weathered tumultuous storms and embraced bold risks without ever sacrificing her artistic independence, betting on herself and her talent even when the odds seemed stacked against her. Now, on the eve of releasing her debut collection for Blue Rose Music, it\u2019s clear that Laura Reed\u2019s gamble is paying off.\n\nRaised by a South African mother and an American father, Reed grew up listening to an eclectic mix of music from around the world. Her dad introduced her to Motown, blues, and country, while her mom shared Afropop and classic British rock. Stevie Wonder was a fixture in their home, as was the mysterious folksinger Rodriguez, who\u2019d been all but forgotten in America while he was exalted as a legend in South Africa.\n\n\u201cMy parents weren\u2019t musicians, but they were writers,\u201d says Reed. \u201cThey would tell me to pay attention to the lyrics, that the words could really make a song special.\u201d\n\nReed relocated from Johannesburg to North Carolina while she was still just a child, but her family carried their culture and traditions (as well as their love of writing) with them wherever they went. At nine years old, Reed saw her first poem published in print, and at fourteen, she picked up her first guitar.\n\n\u201cI actually taught myself how to play on my own,\u201d Reed explains. \u201cAt that age, I was always getting into trouble and being grounded, so I\u2019d spend hours every day in my room just learning chords and deconstructing songs.\u201d\n\nOpen mics and cover sets led to original recordings and homemade CDs, and before she\u2019d even finished high school, it was clear what Reed was meant to do with the rest of her life. She took her singular blend of rock, blues, and funk on the road with her band, Deep Pocket, performing more than 200 pulse-pounding shows a year and making her own breaks along the way. George Clinton discovered Reed performing on the streets of New Orleans and was so taken that he brought her into the studio, while Lee Oskar found the versatile musician on YouTube and invited her to be an ambassador for his ubiquitous harmonica brand. Reed would go on to collaborate with everyone from Killer Mike and Robert Randolph to Karl Denson and Jewel, sing the national anthem at Madison Square Garden twice, and share bills with Mali Music, India.Arie, Miguel, Valerie June and Anthony Hamilton among others.\n\nWhen Deep Pocket broke up, Reed was living in Atlanta and ready to launch a solo career. Life seemed promising at the time: she\u2019d landed a production deal, gotten married, and given birth to a beautiful baby boy. One night in the studio, though, she received a surprise visit from a childhood hero with some prophetic words.\n\n\u201cI was in singing with my back turned and suddenly someone grabbed me by my arm,\u201d remembers Reed. \u201cIt was Whitney Houston. She was holding a small little dog and she told me to keep singing. I continued to sing and she grabbed my hand and started dancing with me. At the end, she asked my name and said, \u2018You have great talent. You\u2019re as real as collard greens.\u2019 Then she looked in my eyes, really close to my face, and told me, \u2018Never stop singing. It\u2019s gonna get hard, but whatever happens, never stop.\u2019\u201d\n\nThings did indeed get hard, harder than Reed had ever imagined. Her marriage and production deal both soured, and she soon found herself scraping by as a single mother on welfare, struggling just to make ends meet. With nowhere else to turn, she called famed producer Paul Worley (Dixie Chicks, Lady Antebellum), who\u2019d become a fan and a mentor, and asked his advice.\n\n\u201cI played him some of my demos, and he told me, \u2018Put your stuff in storage and get to Nashville,\u2019\u201d remembers Reed. He told me that my one-year-old and I could come live with him and his wife while I finished writing my album.\u201d\n\nOver the next six months, Reed poured her heart and soul into writing and recording what would become her solo debut, \u2018The Awakening,\u2019 reinventing herself personally and professionally with the help of GRAMMY-winning producer Shannon Sanders (John Legend, India.Arie). The songs earned her a major publishing deal, and upon its release, the record was a critical hit, with Blurt raving that it \u201cshowcases Reed\u2019s astonishing pipes\u201d and SoulBounce calling it \u201ca refreshing blend of retro-leaning soul and pop with hints of gospel and R&B.\u201d The album\u2019s lead single, \u201cWake Up,\u201d landed in rotation at Nashville\u2019s Lightning 100, which led to public praise from the likes of Sheryl Crow and Debra Messing. Songs from the album, meanwhile, turned up in a slew of films and television shows, including Cold Light of Day (Sigourney Weaver, Henry Cavil), Chloe and Theo (Dakota Johnson, Mina Sorvino), and Alicia Keys\u2019 The Inevitable Defeat of Mister and Pete (Jennifer Hudson, Jordin Sparks).\n\nThe record also caught the attention of the burgeoning Blue Rose Music artist collective, who presented Reed with the unique opportunity to join their prestigious roster without sacrificing any of the fiercely independent spirit that had guided her from the start.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so strong willed that I need to have creative control wherever I go,\u201d explains Reed, who now calls North Carolina home once again. \u201cWhen I walked in to Blue Rose, I saw a room full of women for the first time in all my years in the music business, and I immediately felt at ease. It didn\u2019t feel like signing a typical record deal. It felt like I was joining a team that understood me.\u201d\n\nWith the team in place and the most exciting, adventurous material of her career ready to go, Laura Reed is poised to reach her biggest audiences yet, and to turn even more dreams into reality.", "otherInfo": "Streaming live with guitarist Laur Joamets, performing songs from new project \u201cLORE\u201d."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Frankie Cosmos LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8671667.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie Pop, Pop, Indie", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Instagram Live feat. special guests"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Daring Greatly LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10313138.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Rock, Americana, Roots Rock, Heartland Rock, Country Rock", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Daring Greatly, an independent, self-managed Heartland Rock & Soul band, known for its mesmerizing \u201cblood harmonies,\u201d is comprised of a father and his two sons, and a friend who formed in Calgary, Canada in 2014.

But 99 Neighbors love to upend expectations. So the fact that they come from a woodsy hometown, far away from any anywhere people expect rap groups to come from, is only the beginning.\n\n\nA sprawling collective of rappers, singers, songwriters, producers, instrumentalists, and visual artists, 99 Neighbors challenges our preconceived notions of what a band even is. The lineup has evolved fluidly throughout its formation (although it\u2019s more or less set these days). No one person does just one thing, so the vocalists also make beats, and someone making beats one day might be directing a music video the next.\n\n\nIf you need help keeping them all straight (we feel you), that lineup currently consists of:\n\nSam Paulino (rapper/singer/songwriter)\n\nHank \u201cHANKNATIVE\u201d Collins (rapper/singer/songwriter)\n\nAidan Ostby (singer/songwriter)\n\nConnor \u201cSwank\u201d Stankevich (rapper/songwriter)\n\nCaleb \u201cSomba\u201d Hoh (producer/engineer/composer/songwriter)\n\nJulian \u201cJuju\u201d Segar-Reid (producer/multi-instrumentalist/composer)\n\nJared \u201cJFear\u201d Fier (DJ/producer)\n\nShane Kaseta (photographer/designer)\n\n\nLike so many other great bands, 99 Neighbors began as a friendship, or rather a couple of them. Sam and HANKNATIVE grew up together in Burlington, playing football and lacrosse together on their high school teams and rapping at house parties on weekends. Somba (the group\u2019s creative powerhouse, who has a hand in everything including production and videos) and Juju grew up together too. The two duos connected when Sam reached out to Somba over SoundCloud and realized they lived a quarter of a mile away from each other. Shane, another friend from high school, became the group\u2019s photographer and graphic designer. He was a founding member with the original vocalists and Somba when the group formed in 2018.\n\n\nAfter high school, the group\u2019s core moved in together in a dingy apartment in downtown Burlington to work on music full-time. The open-door policy they instituted quickly turned the place into a hub of the city\u2019s creative community where artists of all backgrounds and inclinations could jump into the mix (and crash on the couch if they needed to). Among them were Swank, who met the other rappers through basketball and freestyling at parties, and Aidan, who was involved when Sam and Somba first started working together, who would both become full-fledged members.\n\n\nAs 99 Neighbors grew into a collective with intentional blurry boundaries (hence the name), the core of the group squeezed into Somba\u2019s bedroom for two months to record their debut full-length, Television, an ambitious collection of songs showcasing the diversity of the group\u2019s talent, and an equally wide range of music they draw from, blending post-trap hip-hop with jazz and rock, soulful textures with electronic experimentation, undeniable hooks with the kind of hard-hitting brain-twistingly complex raps that you always hear people complaining no one\u2019s making anymore. It was at this point that Jared (a Boston native and the only member of the group not from Burlington) began DJing and producing with the group. By the time Television dropped at the beginning of 2019, 99 Neighbors was the biggest rap act in Burlington. Its reception online proved that the appeal wasn\u2019t just a local thing\u2013when the band alerted Reddit to its release their post generated so much traffic that the site took it down, mistakenly thinking it was the work of bots.\n\n\nIn February, Television single \u201cChampion\" caught the attention of Chance the Rapper\u2019s longtime manager Pat Corcoran, who soon after posted it on his Instagram. That opened up a conversation that led to a trip to Chicago, and eventually a deal to kick off a brand new collaboration between Corcoran\u2019s entertainment company Nice Work and Warner Records.\n\n\nFor the recording of their upcoming album, 99 Neighbors are going for a change of scenery. This time around they\u2019re working in a tiny town called Island Pond that\u2019s two hours north of Burlington, but the formula\u2019s still the same: a bunch of super-creative, super-talented people living in a house together and pooling their talents into something far bigger than the sum of its parts. If their work so far is any indication, you can bet that the next thing they release won\u2019t sound the same. The only thing you can ever bet on with 99 Neighbors\u2019 music is that you won\u2019t see it coming.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Groovy Judy LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10322404.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Funk, Pop, Rock, Rnb-soul, R&b/soul", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Groovy Judy puts a new face on the late 60\u2019s, early 70\u2019s sound that made the Bay Area what it is.

The rest of the population will catch up. What this means is that Chromeo is really good at being Chromeo. The mission, the package, the vision\u2014it\u2019s been a straight shot of pure intentionality from the jump. These Chromeo dudes? They have the whole being-these-Chromeo-dudes thing totally wired.\n\nAnd with the benefit of blessed hindsight, we can all see now that Chromeo stuck to it with the natural doggedness of the soulful heirs that they are. Funk a game plan\u2014these guys had a ten-year battle strategy. When they released their first album in 2004, Rick James was still the Antichrist to all but the enlightened. Fast forward to today, and \u201880s funk\u2014which makes up a major part of Chromeo\u2019s DNA\u2014is all over the charts.\n\nSo it\u2019s the perfect time for a fresh dose of the real stuff and\u2014lo and behold\u2014Pee (still looking a smooth criminal in a Coogi) and Dave (ever the Semitic/Gallic heartthrob in tight pants) are back. We are officially on the cusp of the Canadian funk lords\u2019 fourth album\u2019s release. It\u2019s called White Women and it\u2019s a doozy. As a work of cultural theory, it posits that we are living in a post-nostalgia age. All previous genres and styles of music now coexist within a singularity of moves and gestures. (Ouch, sorry, got possessed by a cultural studies prof. for a second there\u2026 but the foregoing is true of Chromeo, just FYI.) More importantly, as pure entertainment, White Women perpetuates and elevates Chromeo\u2019s existing blueprint: sexy funk, ass-targeting beats, melodic honey, and smart lyrics about the foibles of contemporary love.\n\nDave 1\u2019s words continue to turn urban music clich\u00e9s on their heads. On \u201cJealous (I Ain\u2019t With It)\u201d, a Chromeo crossover comet if there ever was one, our arch antihero witnesses his ex in the arms of other guys\u2026 wearing the jacket that he bought her. Conversely, the pristinely produced \u201cOver Your Shoulder\u201d is a paean to the insecure. You\u2019re all beautiful, ladies, is the message; don\u2019t even sweat that body-image noise. And \u201cSexy Socialite\u201d is a warning to the highhanded party girls of the early twenty-teens. Check yourself, sayeth Chromeo.\n\nWhite Women is the band at its most ambitious, with both the pop and the muso elements of Chromeo pushed into the red. On the hooky side, we\u2019ve got instant classics like the soaring \u201cCome Alive\u201d and the pulsating \u201cFrequent Flyer\u201d which offer moments that would make Hall & Oates and Wham green with envy. On the crate-digger side, Dave and Pee employ an unprecedented analog arsenal that would make Kraftwerk drool. Mtume\u2019s female vocalist croons on more than half the album. Steely Dan\u2019s string conductor pops up on the progressive album closer \u201cFall Back 2U.\u201d Try all that on for size, nerds.\n\nBut for all that 80s talk, White Women, more so than any other Chrome-opus, is firmly grounded in pop\u2019s present. It features some stellar cameos, too. Solange belts it out with Dave 1 on \u201cLost On The Way Home,\u201d Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend contributes the piano-led, heartstring-pulling intermezzo \u201cEzra\u2019s Interlude,\u201d and Toro y Moi dives into the undiluted electro-funk of the aforementioned \u201cCome Alive.\u201d\n\n2014 happens to be the Year of the Horse, which makes sense because Chromeo are about gallop in on shining white steeds to delicately trample all of us with their sublime sound. The weather is perfect; the water is warm; the people are waiting.

Music styles such as dirty south, crunk and miami bass are now trademark ingredients of the Hollertronix output. Pentz's solo work is also influenced by Southern Gothic and other southern literature. Additionally, world music is a strong musical influence on Diplo, especially baile funk which he encountered whilst traveling in Brazil.\n\nDiplo was recently signed to Ninja Tune, on the Big Dada imprint.

The repetitive beat of the primitive instrument was used in tribal ceremonies, to celebrate, bringing tribe members together and unifying their consciousness. Meanwhile the emotive responses that stem from classical compositions and string instruments are more closely connected with European ancestry. With German and Ghanaian DNA Ben Rau is blessed with the best of both cultures and the combination of influences from his forefathers permeates into his music. Infectious rhythmic grooves and emotive melodies mix together to form a rich, deep and hypnotic formula that speaks to your very soul... Ben originally fell in love with house and techno simply because he wanted to lose himself in the music and explore his deep-seated passion for music through self-expression - namely, raving. Ben spent many years tearing up dancefloors back home in Germany and in the UK, too. As time went on he became more and more involved behind the scenes, progressing from the dancefloor to the decks and into the studio. Having a solid grounding in club culture from such a grassroots level means Ben's connection with the dancefloor runs deep, likewise his studio endeavours are aimed squarely at those who dedicate their time to dancing the night away. A Berliner born and bred, Ben moved to the UK in 1999 to study Computer Animation in Bournemouth \u2013 once there, he fell in love with British culture and decided to make it his home. After a few years on the south coast he moved to London, which really cemented his hunger for music. He immersed himself in the highly influential east London party scene, having made the decision to dedicate his life to pursuing a career in music. Before he knew it Ben was tumbling down the rabbit hole and made long-lasting connections that have helped shape his career. After winning an IDJ Raw Talent competition he caught the attention of Fuse owner, Enzo Siragusa, before the party brand had been conceived. As time went on and Fuse came into being, Ben joined Enzo and the rest of the family as a resident and his career went from strength to strength. While Ben was living in the UK, Berlin had become the global epicentre of house and techno and he felt a strong calling to return home. In 2012 he decided to move back home to build a studio and he returned to Berlin with a fresh outlook, a renewed desire to succeed and the time and space to truly pursue his dreams. As 2014 begins Ben's focus has never been so strong, every waking moment is spent channeling his energy into music \u2013 resulting in extended periods in the studio, where he has accumulated an impressive collection of analogue gear. Following the advice of friend and mentor Alex Arnout , Ben has been spending his time getting to grips with his synths which allow him to explore electronic music and sound crafting in a visceral, immediate and spontaneous way \u2013 key aspects of the production process. He has also invested his spare time into taking piano lessons and learning music theory, adding a new level of musicality to his output. A long-standing relationship with London-based Save You Records continues to flourish, and his close bond with the ever-growing Fuse outfit has never been stronger. Releases are penciled in for both labels and he continues to build his skills in the studio with a clear focus on future successes. So 2014 looks set to be a pivotal year for the infectiously positive artist. With such a strong foundation, an unerring passion for his craft and so much support, Ben Rau's drum will carry on beating for many years to come...

There's the date they were crowned winners of The X Factor (December 11 2011), and when they scored their second UK Number 1 with their first single proper, Wings (September 2, 2012). But perhaps the moment the pop axis truly shifted was on June 5 2013 when the band's album, DNA, became the highest debut ever in the US Billboard Chart for a British female group's first album. It entered at Number 4 and eclipsed a sixteen-year-old record previously held by the Spice Girls\u2019 Spice album. Within two years, Perrie, Jesy, Jade and Leigh-Anne have gone from obscurity to being one of the biggest bands on the planet. Their growing success was further heightened with the release of their second album, Salute and its hit first single Move. Bold, confident, emotionally-resonate and bursting with character, Salute is a quantum leap forward from what Little Mix have done in the past. In May 2014 they embarked on their biggest UK tour, with dates including London's O2 Arena. They have also supported Demi Lovato on The Neon Lights Tour in the US. In 2015 the girls announced their third studio album, Get Weird, which is due to be released on November 6th. Black Magic, Little Mix\u2019s first single from the new album, was released on the 10th July and went straight to No. 1 in the UK charts, giving them their third No. 1 single to date. During a recent visit to the US, Little Mix gave a show stopping performance at the Teen Choice Awards as well as receiving the Choice Music: Breakout Artist Award. Their trip also included performances on The Late Late Show with James Corden, the Today Show and a special collaboration with Taylor Swift during her 1989 Tour.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alex Mendenall ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9148102.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Soul, Jazz, Indie, Alternative", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Alex Mendenall is a nationally touring songwriter based in Detroit, MI.

He rapidly broke through onto the Garage pirate radio stations and forums gaining instant recognition, and was subsequently snapped up by international promoters to perform tours of Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Russia. Majestic has since crossed into a multitude of dance music genres from UK Garage to House to Drum & Bass and Dubstep performing with leading artists across the scene such as Sigma, DJ EZ, Dream Teem, Agent X, MJ Cole, Judge Jules, Micky Slim, Jack Beats, Laidback Luke, The Wideboys, Netsky, High Contrast, Loadstar, Shy FX, Skream, Bar9, Nero and Jacob Plant to name a few.\n\nAs well as a legendary MC known for being risqu\u00e9 in spreading his word, Majestic is also making waves as an artist in his own right. His single \u201cIn The VIP\u201d written and produced with the Wideboys that took a satirical look at the VIP Club culture, was released on Skint Records. After receiving serious hits on YouTube and Radio Support from MistaJam, DJ Target, Kissy Sell Out and Steve Smart on heavy rotation, the record also made its way onto the MOS Bass Culture annual.\nMajestic\u2019s lyrical flow then caught the eye of American Dubstep superstar Skrillex who sampled Majestics legendary, almost anthemic, \u201cRuffneck Bass\u201d spit for his latest massive single of the same title, played by the worlds biggest DJs and over 50m views online.\n\nAfter signing up to be Dubstep wonderkid, Jacob Plant\u2019s official hype man, the pair released, \u201cMosh Pit\u201d on Speakerbox. Majestic has been in the studio collaborating on a number of cutting edge tracks they intend to PA live at their shows. They have already performed for massive student brand Under The Radar on their tour dates up and down the country, as well as for Fresher\u2019s events at all the leading Universities in the UK. Plus having just wowed the crowd at Brighton\u2019s Shakedown festival performing on the main stage in front of 8000 revellers, in-between Razorlight and Example, they are certainly heading for superstar status!\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder Majestic is in demand to perform Live, with Mistajam quoting Majestic as being the \u201cbest live MC in the game\u201d after requesting him to perform alongside him at Exit festival in Serbia and Eddie Temple Morris bringing him onboard The Big Reunion Shows this winter not to mention continuing tours with The Wideboys, the hype has only just begun. After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece. Majestic is also opening for the Prodigy as part of his festival looks with Kiss FM UK.\n\nSo with the Majestic message travelling fast, hyping the crowd into a frenzy, Majestic takes on the role of grand puppeteer, from waiving lighters in the air to chanting back at the DJ, his commands are dutifully followed and quite a sight to behold. Through years of hard graft, quite literally behind the scene, Majestic has studied the sound of the underground for well over a decade.

Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Let Em Riot ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10373709.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Popwave, Synthwave", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Pairing dream-like synth tones and melodic vocal hooks with a chill, southern California vibe, Let Em Riot has established himself as a prominent act on the frontiers of retrowave. The artist has been innovatively mixing \u201880s nostalgia with modern music as Let Em Riot since 2010, creating a unique and compelling take on established songwriting conventions. His newest album, The Futurist, is a milestone for both himself and the synthwave genre.\n\nAlan Oakes is the one-man band behind Let Em Riot, and the diverse influences heard in his songs are the culmination of decades spent soaking up new music and playing in bands. An \u201880s baby, Oakes\u2019 earliest influences came from pop culture of the decade. Movie soundtracks were especially important in those formative years, with artists like Cyndi Lauper capturing his imagination from the reels of VHS tapes. Along with other pop acts of the era like Tears for Fears and Depeche Mode, these movie soundtracks remain prominent influences on the music of Let Em Riot.\n\nAn early love for M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce also marked a pivotal point in Oakes\u2019 music interests, and rock and punk became increasingly influential as he grew into adolescence. Immersing himself in skate culture, he discovered punk bands that were integral to skate videos of the era, and those artists left a lasting impression on his creative direction.\n\nGrowing up in a southern California college town, Oakes also had plenty of opportunities to see local bands ply their craft. Watching live acts and listening to DJs spin records became a favorite pastime, and spending his days around the college\u2019s radio station introduced him to a wealth of new music including emo, ska, trance, drum and bass, and other contemporary genres.\n\nOakes joined his first band as a freshman in high school and quickly began developing his skills as a singer and guitarist. In time, his role in these acts expanded, and soon he was forming and fronting his own bands. He spent many years in this role writing music, playing shows, and doing the legwork promoting his bands, though as each new endeavor fizzled out and Oakes was left to start from scratch, he found he was tiring of the grind and felt the need to strike out on his own musical journey.\n\nThis led to the creation of Let Em Riot, a fresh and liberating solo project that combined everything Oakes had learned over the years as a music fan and artist. For the first time, he was free to synthesize his many influences into a focused, cohesive, and unmitigated musical expression of his own design. The project quickly developed a unique sound, picking up loyal followers from diverse genres along the way. In early 2018, his career hit a high mark when he released The Futurist through NewRetroWave, the leading record company in synthwave music.\n\nWith his songs reaching a new audience and shaping an exciting new genre of music, Oakes continues to refine and develop the sound of Let Em Riot without ever losing touch with his roots.", "otherInfo": "Live-streaming festival beginning at 2:00PM EST on NEON.FM\n\nPresented by: NEON, Retro Synth Records, Retro Reverb Records and Nightride FM.\n\nAlso Performing:\nVon Kaiser, Turbo Knight, Vampire Stepdad, Neon Nox, d.notive, Honey Beard, Neutron Dreams, Favourite, Blood Panic and Alex Vecchietti."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Danny Kensy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7503491.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Country, Songwriter", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "I'm a Rad Records Nashville, CMA, TCMA, EACM and ASCAP artist who is also with NSAI.

Having grown up on his father eclectic combination of house - electronic (Unkle, Sasha, John Digweed), synth-infused 80s music (Depeche Mode, U2), all which became infused with his own love, Andre ended up with quite a mixed spectrum of musical influence.\n\nToday, his sets have hand-picked influences that translate into what he loves best: tech bassline and vocal hooks, all on top of a pronounced foot-shuffling house beat.\n\nAndre Rizo is involved in music industry since 1999, but he started his djing career in 2006, when he had the opportunity of occupying the residency in Club Pacha (Bucharest, the capital of Romania). In the following years he started his own production studio dedicating his time to produce his own material as well as developing tracks for many other artists from the romanian dance scene.\n\n2014 came with a change of scenery, switching from mainstream music to deephouse, making a great impression with the smashing remix for 'Colindul Cerbului', which boosted his brand on romanian clubbing scene, as well as outside its borders.\n\nThough he loves playing in nightclubs or festivals, his love for music goes beyond the spectrum of mixing tunes. As a producer, he has found plenty of ways to express himself musically.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about mood and a housy, hypnotic groove [\u2026] playing those tracks that get you tapping your feet and nodding your head without you realizing it, regardless of tempo, style, or release date. \u201c\n\n2017 / 2018, became one of the most airplayed dj/producer on Dance FM radio with 7 tracks, encouraging him to release the nine EP called \"Going Forward\".\n\n2020 is a year for new challenges.

She has been described, by Eddie Gordon, as \"The new face of dance culture\" and \"This generation's Kate Bush\". Nathassia made history as being the first electronic music artist to perform at Valley of the Kings in Luxor Temple, Egypt at the Nefertiti International Fashion Festival and was also featured on the Channel 4 TV show The Casting Couch.\n\nBeing half Dutch & half Indian, she emanates a rare & mesmerising quality described by The Yorkshire Times as \"impossible to define in just a few words\". Described by T.H.E. Music Essentials as \"An artist unlike any other\" her music and live performances bring together both eastern and western cultures in spellbinding style. Mauritius Times said about Nathassia: \u201cShe is a role model for multiculturalism\u201d. Her latest live show, broadcast from her London TV studio, was streamed live by over 1 Million viewers.\n\nHer first big break out single was \"Turning Headz\" and Nathassia's debut studio album, Light Of The World was released in 2017 by Inter-dimensional Recordings. Nathassia co-produced the album with some of the UK\u2019s leading underground electronic music producers including British Dubstep producer Stenchman and chose to write several songs with Grammy award winning writer/producer Bruce Elliott-Smith. The first two singles that were released from the album including \"Contagious\", gained support from the likes of e.g. Eddy Temple Morris, BBC 6, Kiss and Mixmag.\n\nMulti-million selling Universal A&R Eddie Gordon described the album Light Of The World as \"Unique song creations that show a connection to something much higher than the normal mind\", American music magazine Love is Pop said about the album: \"Light Of The World is one of the best albums I\u2019ve ever heard in my life, period!\" and critically acclaimed writer Christopher Nosnibor said \"Light Of The World stands as a truly multidimensional piece.\" The last single released and title track \"Light of the World\" was described by DJ Mag as \u201cA rare broken beat number\u201d.\n\nIn May 2017 Nathassia commenced her first national UK tour called Feel The Future Now. The show was themed as a spellbinding journey, bringing the past back to life then transporting you into the future and covered the subjects from 3D to singularity, paganism to transhumanism, Egypt to nanotech & third eye to A.I.\n\nIn 2018 Nathassia launched Nathassia TV, and the first episode of The Nathassia Devine Show. In addition to live music performances by Nathassia from her London studio, the show also hosts the characters The Raving Robot & Nefertiti Now, characters sprung from her UK tour.\n\nOn Summer Solstice day in 2018, Nathassia released her second album Devine Sunrise produced with renowned downtempo artist/DJ Pete Ardron. The album reached the Top 5 in the UK iTunes Album Chart (Electronic) and was described by critics as \"a truly unique project\" and \"totally uncompromising in its global appeal\". The debut single released from the album \"Is Everybody Searching\" reached the number 10 position in the UK pop chart.\n\nHer latest single \u201cGoddess\u201d, mixed by James F Reynolds and written & Co-Produced by Nathassia, was released in 2019 by ArchangelUK and reached the Top 10 in the UK Club Charts & Commercial Pop.

Each new release has brought an expansion of her voice and her art, and she has reached the level of absolute mastery. Her new record Me and the Ghost of Charlemagne is brilliant. The song Ginger Ale and Lorna Doones is a masterpiece, a hard hitting gut punch on every level- voice, melody, words, performance, instrumentation. I nominate it for song of the year, and predict that this song will bring legions of new fans to Amy\u2019s work. Folk music doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d - Mary Gauthier\n\nA modern folksinger whose music nods to the genre's 1970s glory days, Amy Speace has spent two decades chronicling the high marks, heartbreaks, and hard roads of a life logged on the road. She's been a tireless traveler, chasing the dream from the coffeehouses of New York City to larger stages across the globe. Along the way, she's built an international audience without the help of a major label, relying instead upon a touring schedule whose milestones include the Glastonbury Festival, NPR's Mountain Stage, and a yearly average of 150 shows.\n\nMe And The Ghost Of Charlemagne finds Speace focusing on the other side of that so-called dream. The real side, filled with an ever-shifting balance of struggle and joy. Produced by longtime collaborator Neilson Hubbard and recorded during the final weeks of Speace's pregnancy with her first son, Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne captures Amy Speace at her most nakedly honest, with sparsely-decorated songs that double down on her larger-than-life voice and detail-rich songwriting. It\u2019s an album about the colliding of dreams and reality, full of characters making sense of their lives when something is lost and then found. Really, it's an album about the trials and triumphs of an artist's journey \u2014 a journey that's no longer focused upon the destination, but upon the actual trip itself.\n\nDiscovered and mentored by folk-pop icon Judy Collins during the early 2000s, Speace left her career as a classically-trained Shakespearean actress and, instead, kicked off a string of acclaimed albums, including Songs for Bright Street, The Killer in Me, and How to Sleep in a Stormy Boat. Championed by The New York Times, NPR and other taste-making outlets for her solo work, she received further acclaim as a member of Applewood Road, a harmony-heavy trio whose self-titled album became a critical success in the UK, earning a five-star review from The London Sunday Times.\n\nYears before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Speace was one of the genre's earliest champions, mixing the best parts of American roots music \u2014 gospel, alt-country, folk, classic pop \u2014 into her own songs.

Fans inked vocalist/bassist AJ Perdomo\u2019s words on their skin. Bands cribbed their names from Dangerous Summer song titles. They never broke in the mainstream, but to a rabid underground audience, The Dangerous Summer were a phenomenon.\n\nNow, newly reformed and reunited with Hopeless Records, the band\u2014Perdomo, guitarist Matt Kennedy and drummer Ben Cato\u2014are ready to begin their second chapter with the release of their fourth full-length album in 2018, produced by James Paul Wisner (Underoath, Dashboard Confessional, Paramore).\n\n\u201cIn all of our minds, we thought this was never going to happen again,\u201d Perdomo says. \u201cThere was a point in my life where I thought I was never going to play another Dangerous Summer song again. But the easiest thing in the world is writing music and playing music together. It\u2019s second nature. It feels right again.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s forthcoming album, their first in four years, looks to build on an already accomplished discography. The Dangerous Summer\u2019s first three albums\u20142009\u2019s Reach For The Sun, 2011\u2019s War Paint and 2013\u2019s Golden Record\u2014were more than just critically acclaimed: They were collections of visceral, textured alternative rock that shook audiences to their core with an unrivaled musical heft and lyrical honesty. They were songs that demanded your attention, as catchy as they were introspectively vulnerable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking elements of what people always loved about the band and trying to push the limits and push things forward,\u201d Perdomo explains, noting that the band\u2019s new music is more uplifting and upbeat than the stark, bleak Golden Record, which came at a time of both personal and professional turmoil for the group. \u201cOn Reach For The Sun, we had a lot of inspiring songs,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like right now we need to pull out of this dark veil before we do anything else in our story. We\u2019re pulling out of the darkness, and it\u2019s really inspiring and uplifting.\u201d\n\nSo, as The Dangerous Summer approach the next stage of their career, they do so with an overwhelming optimism that\u2019s never been stronger. This isn\u2019t a rehash: It\u2019s a band acknowledging their past with eyes turned squarely toward the future. Most importantly, it\u2019s a reunion led by the music instead of the ancillary trappings of the industry. In their time away, Perdomo, Kennedy and Cato had plenty of time to figure out who and where they wanted to be, and they\u2019ve all returned to the same place.\n\n\u201cNo one owes us anything,\u201d says Perdomo, who became a father during the band\u2019s hiatus. \u201cWe have to prove ourselves again. We\u2019re giving our entire selves to this. We were always just grinding so hard because we needed to do it for a living, just trying to get by. We\u2019re not going to be grinding out 100-day tours; we conquered that.

He rapidly broke through onto the Garage pirate radio stations and forums gaining instant recognition, and was subsequently snapped up by international promoters to perform tours of Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Russia. Majestic has since crossed into a multitude of dance music genres from UK Garage to House to Drum & Bass and Dubstep performing with leading artists across the scene such as Sigma, DJ EZ, Dream Teem, Agent X, MJ Cole, Judge Jules, Micky Slim, Jack Beats, Laidback Luke, The Wideboys, Netsky, High Contrast, Loadstar, Shy FX, Skream, Bar9, Nero and Jacob Plant to name a few.\n\nAs well as a legendary MC known for being risqu\u00e9 in spreading his word, Majestic is also making waves as an artist in his own right. His single \u201cIn The VIP\u201d written and produced with the Wideboys that took a satirical look at the VIP Club culture, was released on Skint Records. After receiving serious hits on YouTube and Radio Support from MistaJam, DJ Target, Kissy Sell Out and Steve Smart on heavy rotation, the record also made its way onto the MOS Bass Culture annual.\nMajestic\u2019s lyrical flow then caught the eye of American Dubstep superstar Skrillex who sampled Majestics legendary, almost anthemic, \u201cRuffneck Bass\u201d spit for his latest massive single of the same title, played by the worlds biggest DJs and over 50m views online.\n\nAfter signing up to be Dubstep wonderkid, Jacob Plant\u2019s official hype man, the pair released, \u201cMosh Pit\u201d on Speakerbox. Majestic has been in the studio collaborating on a number of cutting edge tracks they intend to PA live at their shows. They have already performed for massive student brand Under The Radar on their tour dates up and down the country, as well as for Fresher\u2019s events at all the leading Universities in the UK. Plus having just wowed the crowd at Brighton\u2019s Shakedown festival performing on the main stage in front of 8000 revellers, in-between Razorlight and Example, they are certainly heading for superstar status!\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder Majestic is in demand to perform Live, with Mistajam quoting Majestic as being the \u201cbest live MC in the game\u201d after requesting him to perform alongside him at Exit festival in Serbia and Eddie Temple Morris bringing him onboard The Big Reunion Shows this winter not to mention continuing tours with The Wideboys, the hype has only just begun. After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece. Majestic is also opening for the Prodigy as part of his festival looks with Kiss FM UK.\n\nSo with the Majestic message travelling fast, hyping the crowd into a frenzy, Majestic takes on the role of grand puppeteer, from waiving lighters in the air to chanting back at the DJ, his commands are dutifully followed and quite a sight to behold. Through years of hard graft, quite literally behind the scene, Majestic has studied the sound of the underground for well over a decade.

Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Let Em Riot ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10373709.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Popwave, Synthwave", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Pairing dream-like synth tones and melodic vocal hooks with a chill, southern California vibe, Let Em Riot has established himself as a prominent act on the frontiers of retrowave. The artist has been innovatively mixing \u201880s nostalgia with modern music as Let Em Riot since 2010, creating a unique and compelling take on established songwriting conventions. His newest album, The Futurist, is a milestone for both himself and the synthwave genre.\n\nAlan Oakes is the one-man band behind Let Em Riot, and the diverse influences heard in his songs are the culmination of decades spent soaking up new music and playing in bands. An \u201880s baby, Oakes\u2019 earliest influences came from pop culture of the decade. Movie soundtracks were especially important in those formative years, with artists like Cyndi Lauper capturing his imagination from the reels of VHS tapes. Along with other pop acts of the era like Tears for Fears and Depeche Mode, these movie soundtracks remain prominent influences on the music of Let Em Riot.\n\nAn early love for M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce also marked a pivotal point in Oakes\u2019 music interests, and rock and punk became increasingly influential as he grew into adolescence. Immersing himself in skate culture, he discovered punk bands that were integral to skate videos of the era, and those artists left a lasting impression on his creative direction.\n\nGrowing up in a southern California college town, Oakes also had plenty of opportunities to see local bands ply their craft. Watching live acts and listening to DJs spin records became a favorite pastime, and spending his days around the college\u2019s radio station introduced him to a wealth of new music including emo, ska, trance, drum and bass, and other contemporary genres.\n\nOakes joined his first band as a freshman in high school and quickly began developing his skills as a singer and guitarist. In time, his role in these acts expanded, and soon he was forming and fronting his own bands. He spent many years in this role writing music, playing shows, and doing the legwork promoting his bands, though as each new endeavor fizzled out and Oakes was left to start from scratch, he found he was tiring of the grind and felt the need to strike out on his own musical journey.\n\nThis led to the creation of Let Em Riot, a fresh and liberating solo project that combined everything Oakes had learned over the years as a music fan and artist. For the first time, he was free to synthesize his many influences into a focused, cohesive, and unmitigated musical expression of his own design. The project quickly developed a unique sound, picking up loyal followers from diverse genres along the way. In early 2018, his career hit a high mark when he released The Futurist through NewRetroWave, the leading record company in synthwave music.\n\nWith his songs reaching a new audience and shaping an exciting new genre of music, Oakes continues to refine and develop the sound of Let Em Riot without ever losing touch with his roots.", "otherInfo": "Live-streaming festival beginning at 2:00PM EST on NEON.FM\n\nPresented by: NEON, Retro Synth Records, Retro Reverb Records and Nightride FM.\n\nAlso Performing:\nVon Kaiser, Turbo Knight, Vampire Stepdad, Neon Nox, d.notive, Honey Beard, Neutron Dreams, Favourite, Blood Panic and Alex Vecchietti."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "I Am Lotus ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10204842.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Indie, Folk, Pop, Afro-pop", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "I Am Lotus combines the Western music with a twist of Afro sound and psychedelic melodies.

Unter anderem wie Robert Carl Blank es alleine nur mit seiner Gitarre und Stimme schafft, eine Masse von mehr als 1000 Menschen so zu verzaubern, als w\u00fcrde er f\u00fcr jeden einzelnen singen. Der Konzertbesucher vergisst einen Abend mit dem sympathischen Fallschirmspringer aus Hamburg nur schwer, nachdem seine Songs einmal den Weg in den Geh\u00f6rgang gefunden haben. Robert ist einziges lebendes Roadmovie, der in seinen Liedern seine Erfahrung wiedergibt und das Freiheitsgef\u00fchl mit jeder Pore ausstrahlt. Mr. Blank ist der Prototyp der neuen Generation von Songwritern, die ein aufregendes, spannendes und freies Leben f\u00fchren und ihre Erfahrungen teilen wollen.\n\n\u201eWelcome all you volunteers, jokers, clowns and puppeteers\u201c hei\u00dft es gleich in der ersten Zeile seines neuen Albums \u201eFairground Distractions\u201c, das im Herbst 2016 auf den Markt kam. Robert macht hier ein gro\u00dfes emotionales Fass auf: Ein Album \u00fcber die Liebe zum Leben in seiner ganzen Unvorhersehbarkeit - die gro\u00dfe Freiheit gepaart mit bitter-s\u00fc\u00dfen R\u00fcckblicken. Es ist aber auch ein Album \u00fcber Entscheidungen im Leben geworden. Das Album zeigt wieder einmal, wie gro\u00df das Talent dieses Mannes ist, einfach gute Songs zu schreiben und zu interpretieren. Im Gegensatz zum letzten Album ist der Sound hier 60er Jahre Pop mit vielen Anleihen bei den Gro\u00dfen der Zeit. Den Hamburger mit den tschechischen Wurzeln interessieren keine Schubladen, da ihm das Leben in seiner ganzen Vielfalt daf\u00fcr viel zu schade w\u00e4re. Der inzwischen schon inflation\u00e4r gehandelte Titel des \u201eSinger/Songwriters\u201c ist bei Robert daher auch nur reine Nomenklatur, denn der Pops\u00e4nger und Songschmied ist viel mehr als das. Er ist ein rastloser und leidenschaftlicher Idealist, der sich f\u00fcr ein kompromissloses Musikerleben entschieden hat.\n\nUnber\u00fchrt von den Bequemlichkeiten des b\u00fcrgerlichen Lebens reist er bepackt mit einer Batterie von akustischen Gitarren, einem Fallschirm und einer dicken Portion Soul das ganze Jahr \u00fcber durch die Welt, sammelt Material, beobachtet und schreibt seine Eindr\u00fccke und Erfahrungen als kodierte Reiseberichte nieder. Kaum hat er ein neues Album fertig aufgenommen, gibt es schon Material f\u00fcr das n\u00e4chste. Und dabei sind seine Songs nie am Rei\u00dfbrett entstandene L\u00fcckenf\u00fcller, sondern Reisetageb\u00fccher, inspiriert von intensiven Erfahrungen auf einer selbstgebuchten Welttournee.\n\nSein erster musikalischer Reisebericht nach 10 Jahren Worldwide Travelling - das Deb\u00fctalbum \u201eSoul Circus\u201c 2008 - wurde von der Presse mit Lobeshymnen \u00fcberh\u00e4uft. Das INTRO Magazin lobte beispielsweise das liebevoll aufgenommene Album f\u00fcr seine \u201eRadiotauglichkeit\u201c und ordnete ihn als \u201eHoffnung zwischen Jack Johnson und American Idol\u201c ein. Mit seinem zweiten Album \u201eLast Time I Saw Dave\u201c (2010) konnte er sich nicht nur musikalisch weiterentwickeln, sondern auch sein Deb\u00fctalbum noch toppen. Robert Carl Blank gelang es zweifelsohne zu zeigen, dass er keine Eintagsfliege ist, und g\u00e4be es einen Soundtrack zum Leben, dann h\u00e4tte Robert ihn geschrieben \u2013 eine Wahrheit in und zwischen jedem Song, Ehrlichkeit und k\u00fcnstlerische Tiefe.

Each new release has brought an expansion of her voice and her art, and she has reached the level of absolute mastery. Her new record Me and the Ghost of Charlemagne is brilliant. The song Ginger Ale and Lorna Doones is a masterpiece, a hard hitting gut punch on every level- voice, melody, words, performance, instrumentation. I nominate it for song of the year, and predict that this song will bring legions of new fans to Amy\u2019s work. Folk music doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d - Mary Gauthier\n\nA modern folksinger whose music nods to the genre's 1970s glory days, Amy Speace has spent two decades chronicling the high marks, heartbreaks, and hard roads of a life logged on the road. She's been a tireless traveler, chasing the dream from the coffeehouses of New York City to larger stages across the globe. Along the way, she's built an international audience without the help of a major label, relying instead upon a touring schedule whose milestones include the Glastonbury Festival, NPR's Mountain Stage, and a yearly average of 150 shows.\n\nMe And The Ghost Of Charlemagne finds Speace focusing on the other side of that so-called dream. The real side, filled with an ever-shifting balance of struggle and joy. Produced by longtime collaborator Neilson Hubbard and recorded during the final weeks of Speace's pregnancy with her first son, Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne captures Amy Speace at her most nakedly honest, with sparsely-decorated songs that double down on her larger-than-life voice and detail-rich songwriting. It\u2019s an album about the colliding of dreams and reality, full of characters making sense of their lives when something is lost and then found. Really, it's an album about the trials and triumphs of an artist's journey \u2014 a journey that's no longer focused upon the destination, but upon the actual trip itself.\n\nDiscovered and mentored by folk-pop icon Judy Collins during the early 2000s, Speace left her career as a classically-trained Shakespearean actress and, instead, kicked off a string of acclaimed albums, including Songs for Bright Street, The Killer in Me, and How to Sleep in a Stormy Boat. Championed by The New York Times, NPR and other taste-making outlets for her solo work, she received further acclaim as a member of Applewood Road, a harmony-heavy trio whose self-titled album became a critical success in the UK, earning a five-star review from The London Sunday Times.\n\nYears before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Speace was one of the genre's earliest champions, mixing the best parts of American roots music \u2014 gospel, alt-country, folk, classic pop \u2014 into her own songs. Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne follows in that diverse tradition, but it also shines its light on a new Amy Speace: a clear-eyed, reenergized songwriter who's done with chasing things that don't matter\u2026but isn't anywhere close to being done with her art.", "otherInfo": "Each Saturday I'll be playing a lunchtime concert on FACEBOOK.COM/AMYSPEACE from my Closet (or screened in porch) during this strange time.

Fans inked vocalist/bassist AJ Perdomo\u2019s words on their skin. Bands cribbed their names from Dangerous Summer song titles. They never broke in the mainstream, but to a rabid underground audience, The Dangerous Summer were a phenomenon.\n\nNow, newly reformed and reunited with Hopeless Records, the band\u2014Perdomo, guitarist Matt Kennedy and drummer Ben Cato\u2014are ready to begin their second chapter with the release of their fourth full-length album in 2018, produced by James Paul Wisner (Underoath, Dashboard Confessional, Paramore).\n\n\u201cIn all of our minds, we thought this was never going to happen again,\u201d Perdomo says. \u201cThere was a point in my life where I thought I was never going to play another Dangerous Summer song again. But the easiest thing in the world is writing music and playing music together. It\u2019s second nature. It feels right again.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s forthcoming album, their first in four years, looks to build on an already accomplished discography. The Dangerous Summer\u2019s first three albums\u20142009\u2019s Reach For The Sun, 2011\u2019s War Paint and 2013\u2019s Golden Record\u2014were more than just critically acclaimed: They were collections of visceral, textured alternative rock that shook audiences to their core with an unrivaled musical heft and lyrical honesty. They were songs that demanded your attention, as catchy as they were introspectively vulnerable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking elements of what people always loved about the band and trying to push the limits and push things forward,\u201d Perdomo explains, noting that the band\u2019s new music is more uplifting and upbeat than the stark, bleak Golden Record, which came at a time of both personal and professional turmoil for the group. \u201cOn Reach For The Sun, we had a lot of inspiring songs,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like right now we need to pull out of this dark veil before we do anything else in our story. We\u2019re pulling out of the darkness, and it\u2019s really inspiring and uplifting.\u201d\n\nSo, as The Dangerous Summer approach the next stage of their career, they do so with an overwhelming optimism that\u2019s never been stronger. This isn\u2019t a rehash: It\u2019s a band acknowledging their past with eyes turned squarely toward the future. Most importantly, it\u2019s a reunion led by the music instead of the ancillary trappings of the industry. In their time away, Perdomo, Kennedy and Cato had plenty of time to figure out who and where they wanted to be, and they\u2019ve all returned to the same place.\n\n\u201cNo one owes us anything,\u201d says Perdomo, who became a father during the band\u2019s hiatus. \u201cWe have to prove ourselves again. We\u2019re giving our entire selves to this. We were always just grinding so hard because we needed to do it for a living, just trying to get by. We\u2019re not going to be grinding out 100-day tours; we conquered that.

The band\u2019s seventh album, Wildness, their first in seven years, entered the UK charts at Number Two, went gold, and kept them on tour around the world for the best part of 18 months.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gigging time, but also a lot of thinking time.\n\n\u201cWhere did it all go right?\u201d echoes Lighbtody. \u201cNo idea!\u201d the singer and songwriter laughs. \u201cAfter 10 years of no success, no one \u2013 least of all us \u2013 expected us these last 15 years to sell 17 million albums, headline festivals and play to thousands of people all over the world.\u201d\nAdd to that: one billion global track streams, five UK platinum albums, an Ivor Novello award and Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominations. And, in the shape of Chasing Cars, a modern classic recently anointed by the PPL as the most played song on UK radio of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWhen we released Final Straw in 2003, I think there was general goodwill around us from the media,\u201d continues Lightbody, \u201cas people knew the story of the previous 10 years and were kinda glad for us to get a shot on a major label,\" he notes of their move from indie Jeepster (also original home of Belle and Sebastian) to discerning Polydor imprint Fiction. That \u201csea-change\u201d set in motion the next phase of the band\u2019s existence. Still, in music, as in life, nothing is a given. \u201cOf course the good grace of the press is hard won and easy lost, but radio kept on playing us. That\u2019s been the real key to our success, I firmly believe. Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. On those shows we did some of the songs close to how they sound on the Reworked album \u2013 for example, the new version of You\u2019re All I Have came directly out of playing those acoustic shows.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re All I Have is the opening track from 2006\u2019s Eyes Open, the album that also featured Chasing Cars. On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain. Iain came up with the beautiful, John Martyn-style guitar, and his version floored me when I heard it the first time. Iain\u2019s guitar playing has always been a joy to listen to and to have it feature so prominently on this album is just amazing.\"\n\nAlso presented in simple acoustic simplicity is Chocolate, the third single from Final Straw, and produced here in classy, \u201ctime-stopping\u201d style by McDaid. \u201cChocolate has been a live favourite since we released it. It\u2019s a song all Snow Patrol fans know \u2013 I can\u2019t attest that they all love it but they know it!\u201d its co-author laughs. \u201cAnd we wanted to rework the songs that the fans are the most familiar with. There's not much point in reworking songs people don\u2019t really know as there's not really a stark contrast.\u201d\nThat said, \u201cwe will be doing something with the first two albums before the release of Reworked as those two albums do not feature for that same reason,\u201d Lightbody teases.\nWhat of the recent Twitter \u201caccusation\u201d that SP have \u201cdisowned\u201d those albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It\u2019s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2001), because they don\u2019t play the songs live?\n\u201cNot true at all,\u201d he replies with a shake of the head. \u201cWe are very proud of them. It\u2019s just that when we play those songs live they negatively affect the atmosphere of the gig. And as Star Trek taught us: \u2018The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat need to entertain and surprise also informed the approach taken to Called Out In The Dark. The curtain-raiser from 2011's Fallen Empires now comes with an inventive synth throb that echoes the original.\n\u201cI had worried a little that the whole record was getting very downtempo,\u201d admits Lightbody. \u201cThe nature of recording in hotel rooms and dressing rooms is that things will invariably be low-key. Hard to rock out with a family of four in the next hotel room trying to sleep!\n\u201cSo when it came to some of the songs we recorded towards the end of the new album, we wanted to explore a slightly higher tempo \u2013 without, of course, leaning too heavy into the original version. Called Out\u2026 is certainly the closest to the original version of any song on Reworked, but I think distinct enough to warrant its place. It has an electro bent like the original but steers clear of any of its predecessor\u2019s tropes. I asked Iain to lift it up and he sure did.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the three new songs. First up, the lovely, heart-stopping Time Won\u2019t Go Slowly.\n\u201cJohnny and I wrote this in his house in LA. We\u2019re both massive fans of Frank Ocean, so we wanted it to sound like Frank Ocean crossed with Frank Sinatra. All the Franks! It\u2019s a classic crooner track. We just wanted to try something starkly different from anything we have done before.\n\"As for the lyrics, I guess I\u2019ve not written about love for a while and needed a fix,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI like the idea of the inherent tragedy woven into the fabric of time: time speeds up when we're having a great time and slows down when we're miserable. Although it\u2019s all perception, of course, not reality. And I like that, too. That distortion. Our minds are powerful and sometimes terrible things. I guess the song tries to wrap its head around that great cosmic joke. Also it\u2019s just a love song.\"\nThen there\u2019s I Think of Home, a folk-flavoured piano ballad with vivid, evocative and deeply personal lyrics. Lightbody wrote it in 2014, as part of a five-song contribution \u201cto a night dedicated to my greatest literary hero Seamus Heaney when he opened the Seamus Heaney Home Place in Magherafelt. They wanted me to play a few songs at the opening night.\n\u201cI set my own rules for the songs\u2019 content,\" he expands. \"They had to be inspired by what Heaney had been inspired by: home, family, Ireland, The Troubles, hope, the soil\u2026\u201d\nI Think of Home was later considered for inclusion on Wildness, but none of the versions the band tried out in the studio fitted.\n\u201cBut then we went on tour with Wildness and at shows in Ireland and Irish strongholds like Boston, New York, Sydney and Melbourne, I would play I Think Of Home acoustically on my own in the middle of gigs. It would always go down well.\n\u201cSo when it came to Reworked we had lived with the song enough to feel like we could do a great version of it. And Johnny produced a stunning version of it. I had been playing it a certain way for so long it was hard for me to hear it any other way. That can be dangerous \u2013 stagnation can set in. So when that happens you have to let someone you trust take it from you and remake it. So, in the spirit of what we were doing, it was great to get a reworked version of a song that had never even been released.\"\nThe third new song is Made Of Something Different Now, which is quietly sweeping, quietly epic and wholly devastating.\n\u201cOne of my favourite tracks we have done in ages,\" nods Lightbody. \"In keeping with the Reworked attitude of trying new things, it\u2019s unlike much of what we\u2019ve done before. Lyrically, it\u2019s the story of a dear friend\u2019s heartbreak. My own heart, having not been in a relationship in ten years, is unrisked so unbroken. A damning self-portrait if ever there was one! Writing this song \u2013 with Johnny \u2013 made me realise my own lack of bravery in that department. Hasn\u2019t effected any change yet, mind you, but it did start me thinking at least\u2026 Anyway, as us Celts say, it\u2019s a belter,\u201d he grins.\n\nThe final word should go to Take Back The City. Gary Lightbody\u2019s hymn to Belfast is the song that opens Reworked and is sure to be an emotive live highlight when Snow Patrol take Reworked on the road later this year. As he reflects on 25 years of Snow Patrol, how have his feelings about the city changed in the 11 years since the song was released?\n\u201cWell, as the song says, I love Belfast tonight and always. There are still things that drive me crazy about the place. But I think that's the same for everyone\u2019s home city \u2013 although my home town, of course, is Bangor.\n\u201cMy love has deepened though not waned. I see the conflict that still goes on in people\u2019s hearts, my own included, and yet there is this drive in most people \u2013 most people \u2013 to put the past behind us and move on. To lift each other up.\n\u201cWe need that now more than ever with the looming clusterfuck that is Brexit and the devastation it has the potential to bring to the whole of UK, but to Northern Ireland more than anywhere else. We need that will to put the past behind us and lift each other.\u201d\n\nHear, hear. Equally, with these 16 inspiring, enveloping tracks, this is also moment to embrace the past \u2013 and, like the man said, to use it to lift each other. This is Reworked. This is Snow Patrol\u2019s history, and their legacy. And it\u2019s their inspired next step.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Charli XCX ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8363770.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Experimental, Other, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Snarky Puppy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10377661.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Jazz, World & Latin Jazz, Funk, Pop, Soul", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With every new project\u2014hell, with every show they play\u2014Snarky Puppy hopes to do something they\u2019ve never done before. With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Entry is a choose-your-own-donation basis between $1-100.

Jason, told the room off, and he was right to do so then played even harder in reaction, that impressed the shit out of me.

A few years ago, singer-songwriter Jake Benjamin made a left turn from his core self of being a musician that sent him on a winding, self-reflective odyssey through states and states of mind. He announces his return to music with his aptly-titled debut EP, Finally Back Home, an exquisite collection of jazz-tinged pop.\n\n\u201cThe songs on this EP are a culmination of stints of living in Miami, Indiana, and New Jersey, where I grew up. Each song represents a different side of me. Together, this album salutes the journey back home and presents me as I am,\u201d Jake reveals.\n\nJake is one of those rare gifted artists that early on could sing better than they could speak. Yet, when it came time to go to college, Jake decided to pursue a career as a music business professional, and chose not to fine tune his prodigious talents. However, while in college, Jake became reacquainted with songwriting and discovered the beauty of jazz. \u201cI fell in love with the fact that music could be an exchange of energies between two people,\u201d Jake shares\n\nThe New York-based artist earned his bachelor\u2019s degree from University of Miami\u2019s Frost School of Music\u2019s Music Business and Studio Music & Jazz programs, and earned his master\u2019s degree from Indiana University\u2019s prestigious Jacobs School of Music where he studied voice. Because of this formal training, core to Jake\u2019s aesthetic is his sophisticated harmonic compositional vocabulary.\n\nJake tempers this studied musicality with adventurous artistic explorations via a loop station. His innovative approach with this technology treats the loop station as a compositional tool through which he explores the possibilities of vocal layering, beatboxing, and body percussion. \u201cI write original music for the sensitive and heartfelt millenial, and I reimagine jazz repertoire to make tunes my own. The stories in my songs are about me, or somebody I know. I don\u2019t like to make up stories of things I didn\u2019t go through,\u201d Jake says.\n\nThese days Jake is in New York music making within a community of musicians and friends. His next release, however, will showcase his solo artistry with a collection of songs themed around Vincent van Gogh.

He has managed to combine elements of the revered canons of Western music interspersed with the audacity of jazz improvisation, and paying tribute to the ancient structures of Asian, South American and African traditional music.\n\nHe has recently signed a contract with Challenge records for a series of 10 CD's, collaborations with musicians from all over the world, based on his travels.The first trio CD will be released worldwide in the fall of 2011, and the second production in the spring of 2012, with guest artists from Brazil.\n\nMike's father was opera singer Leonard del Ferro (1921-1992), who sang and recorded with Maria Callas, and his childhood was thus filled with music of the highest order.A native of Amsterdam, he started his career studying classical piano at the age of nine and, after falling in love with jazz, he focused his studies on jazz and received a Masters of Music in Contemporary Music from the Amsterdam Conservatory.\n\nIn 1989 he won First Prize at the Rotterdam Jazz Piano Competition, the Soloist Prize at the Europe Jazz Contest in Brussels, and First Prize at the Karlovy Vary Jazz contest and from 1993-1996 studied composition and arranging with Bob Brookmeyer at the Musikhochschule in Cologne, Germany. In 1995 Mike was appointed to the faculty of the Royal Conservatory in Gent, Belgium where he taught jazz piano until 1997.

The pair kicked off the label in 2000 with \u2018Anjunabeats Volume 1\u2019, a massive club success which instantly ear-pricked the likes of Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold and Paul van Dyk. The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label. It provided the perfect outlet for their numerous production projects \u2013 Oceanlab, Aalto, Freestate, Nitromethane, POS, Rollerball and Tranquillity Base \u2013 and every release was warmly received by elite DJ\u2019s and club-goers across the globe.\n\nIn late 2002 James Grant joined the Anjunabeats management team and the label began to expand its output, signing a series of fresh artists.

In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

This dream inspired the songs that now comprise Fur and Gold.\n\nRecorded in London and Brighton, the album was co-produced by Khan and David Kosten (Faultline).

Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage. Whether Love Saves The Day makes one dollar or a million isn\u2019t a big concern to him. It stands as a huge success because he made the gritty, honest album that he intended by \u201ckeeping it raw, keeping it immediate, keeping it real.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that he has honed over the years: \u201cbe original and be true to what you do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To Benefit 3rd and Lindsley, Nashville"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Enjambre ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8671882.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Enjambre is a four-piece rock band from Anaheim, California. Their sound is the bastard son of Grunge and 60\u2019s rock, with a dose of macabre-pop. In describing the band\u2019s music, OC Weekly wrote \u201cSometimes they\u2019ll ballad you\u2026Or they\u2019ll out-Weezer Weezer for emo wimpiness, afterward straight-edging you \u2026Or they\u2019ll come straight out of The Wizard of Oz with a bizarre oompa-loompa song that has you scanning the sky for winged monkeys.\u201d\n\nIn 1994, Luis Humberto (LuH) and Rafael Navejas began their Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll journey in Fresnillo, Zacatecas, Mexico with a band called Los Cuatro Fantasticos (The Fantastic Four). In 1998, they moved to The U.S.A., and began a new project with their cousin, Romeo Navejas. They named the band Enjambre, which means \u201cswarm\u201d (in Spanish, Navejas sounds like \u2018abejas\u2019 [bees]). In 2002, a Chilean math tutor from a nearby community college takes over as their new drummer. Enter Nicolas Saavedra. His experience as a drummer and heavy metal influence elevated the band\u2019s live performance and composition style to another dimension.\n\nEnjambre noticed that an element was missing from their sound. Osamu Nishitani was a friend of the band who they knew was a good guitarist. This Germany-born Japanese boy with a British accent fell in like a ring on to a finger. The missing link was found. His use of 80\u2019s-influenced synthesizer sound and buzz saw guitar completed the formula.\n\nEnjambre has performed with acts such as Caf\u00e9 Tacuba, Aterciopelados, Fobia, Enanitos Verdes, Jumbo, Zurdok amongst others and have visited cities like Chicago, Atlanta, Las Vegas, San Jose, San Francisco, San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico.\n\nhttp://rockero.com/artists/enjambre/biography", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lagwagon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371130.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Punk", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Lagwagon is a punk band based in the small town of Goleta, California. Forming in 1990, they have released seven albums, all through San Francisco label Fat Wreck Chords. They are widely viewed as catalysts for the pop-punk movement of the 1990's, opening the door for some of the subgenre's more mainstream bands.\n\nVocalist Joey Cape also plays guitar in punk rock cover band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes and sang in the recently disbanded experimental punk band Bad Astronaut. Recently, he started a new project called Afterburner, which is expected to be similar to Bad Astronaut. Other members of Lagwagon include guitarists Chris Flippin and Chris Rest, bassist Jesse Buglione, and drummer Dave Raun.\n\nAfter 9 years and 5 records, the band remained silent in 1999-2000. They reunited in 2002 and released a comeback album titled Blaze in the following year. Despite the brief hiatus, the group has never broken up. In 2004, Joey released a split acoustic album with No Use for a Name frontman Tony Sly, which features acoustic versions of songs by both bands. Lagwagon's latest album, entitled Resolve, was released in October 2005 and is a tribute to the life of longtime friend Derrick Plourde (original drummer for Lagwagon and Bad Astronaut), who commited suicide on March 30, 2005.\n\nOn August 12, 2006, it was announced at punkbands.com that Lagwagon is expected to record and release a new album sometime in 2008.\n\nThey are now in the studio recording an EP entitled I Think My Older Brother Used to Listen to Lagwagon due to be released in August 2008.", "otherInfo": "\u23f0MAY 16TH ANNOUNCEMENT\u23f0\nJOEY LIVESTREAM SHOW + FACEBOOK LIVE HANG WITH LAGWAGON AFTER THE SHOW\n\nHeads up!

In the end of 2018, Amy Stargher was added in the lineup, a singer/guitarist and percussionist, previously with Jett & The Bombs, with strong vocals and electric stage presence. The core of the band is completed with Gina Rebelo on bass (formerly of Three Day Threshold) and influences from Bootsy Collins to John Paul Jones, and Peter Douskalis a skillful guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, creating the foundational surge for the listener to truly become part of the music. Using the depth of life experiences as inspiration for their lyrics, the band strive to connect with the listener through rock-and-roll infused messages of overcoming obstacles with a tinge of sorrow-filled hope. Guitar riffs, keyboards, string section, bass lines, drum rhythms and a strong emotionally-charged stage presence add to the radio-ready experience of TIS.\n\n\"We're all trying to escape the static that surrounds us,\" says Athan. \"We all seem to be trapped in some way, and the theme of our music is to find ways to break free from the things that hold you back.

In '87 Jask began djing at the age of 13. Influences consisted of soul, jazz, funk, r&b, hip hop, rock, new wave, disco, early electro & freestyle. A year later he would soon discover and quickly embrace a passion for the music that was coming out of Chicago & New York, known as the underground house sound. Jask was one of the major players to introduce the acid jazz sound to Tampa & most of central Florida in the early 90's. He held Tampa's longest running eclectic loungin' night called, \"Martini Jazz\". It took place every Thursday night at a club called the Castle which ran from '94 to '96. The \"Martini Jazz\" night brought some notoriety to Jask, which eventually led him to assist in the promotions of \"Groove Collective's (NYC) first ever performance in the Tampa area. In December of 1995, Jask started Tampa's first weekly soulful underground house night called, \"Jacks House\". During its successful over a decade ongoing run, Jask has played alongside various talented djs such as: Mark Farina, Dj Disciple, Benji Candelario, Marques Wyatt, Doug Smith, Brian Tappert , Miguel Migs, King Britt, Tedd Patterson, Tommy Musto, Kaskade, Pete Moss, David Harness, Rasoul, Julius Papp, Matthias Heibronn, Jay-J, Little Louie Vega, Frankie Feliciano, Karizma, Mark Grant, Johnny Fiasco, Diz, Collete, Heather, Tortured Soul, Cevin Fisher, Harry Choo Choo Romero, Cajmere, Lisa Shaw, JJK and many other luminaries in the dance music industry...As of Today, Jask still holds down Jack's House(Tuesdays) and a new night called, \"Paradise\" which has become the new Underground house night in the Tampa area and features guest djs from all around the globe. On the production and remix side of the musical pendulum, Jask has appeared on such notable labels as: Vega, King Street/NiteGrooves, I!Records, Swanky, Metaphor, K2/Vinylicious, Step Ahead, Erotic City, DeepTouch, Harlequin, SoulGroove, Soulfuric Deep, Soulfuric, Soufuric Trax, Catch 22, Deeplay, Solu, Om, Vino, Defected, Undo, Large Music, Salted, Sole Channel, Ultra, Rhythm & Culture, Transport & NeoDisco. His most successful project to date is his release on Soulfuric Deep called Jask featuring Jocie \"Beautiful\" it was released at the end of 2001. This was Jask's first original vocal track in which he wrote everything from the music to the lyrics with haunting lush deep vocals from his friend Jocie. It is a special release in which Jask has dedicated it to his late mother who passed away July 31, 2001. Due to the successful Jacks house night in Tampa and his music productions, Jask has had the luxury of performing/djing across the United States and beyond. Such destinations include, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Denver, St. Louis, Atlantic City, Miami, Ft.

This solo album was acoustically driven with an accompanying band to highlight the songwriting and lyrical prowess. \"Shallow is a singer whose vocal personality is ultimately a category unto itself, like a Willie Nelson, an Otis Redding. He could sing anything and make it sound great, make it well worth listening to.

It was a bit of good luck.\u201d\n\nThese grainy, absorbing images play over the exhilarating whirl of \u201cDivebomber\u201d, a song inspired by the World War II film of the same name, and one of several on his new album that evoke a sensation of sharp ascent, of giddy height, the free-fall thrill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rush, if you fly fast enough. With a rush of blood, you can bet you forget everyone.\u201d\n\nFinn did not set out on his third solo album with a theme in mind. But by the time he came to call it after another track on the record, \u201cDizzy Heights\u201d, it had become inescapable. \u201cIt crept up on me. I started noticing it in lots of places.\n\n\u201cYou start off with a number of different threads and angles and demos, and they dictate the terms of the record. It\u2019s only in the course of the process that you maybe get a feeling there\u2019s a type of song emerging, or an atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe cloud jumpers epitomise, too, the Finn creative process: an attachment to a work-ethic and prosaic rigour - \u201ca willingness to be disciplined, punctual and focused\u201d \u2013 but designed for the arrival of something more, \u201cto capture the little flashes of complete happenstance or good fortune that come your way \u2013 often from a mistake\u201d.\n\nAn indirect inspiration for the height motif is mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1953, five years before Neil was born. \u201cHilary had a huge impact on my generation of New Zealanders,\u201d says Finn. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the New Zealand DNA about trying to scale impossible heights. It\u2019s something that can be very positive, but also has its downside.\u201d\n\nAmid its vertiginous, richly melodic swirl, Dizzy Heights contemplates love (\u201cBetter than TV\u201d), loss (\u201cFlying in the Face of Love\u201d), ageing (\u201cRecluse\u201d) and allure (\u201cLights of New York\u201d). It peeks, too - in \u201cIn My Blood\u201d, for example - into the abyss.\n\nNeil Finn was 18 when he was invited by his older brother Tim to join the trailblazing art rock band Split Enz. His career since might be measured as a series of bounds, the best-known being Crowded House, which he founded with Paul Hester and Nick Seymour after the breakup of Split Enz in 1984. Four albums, among them Crowded House and Together Alone, brought the group popular and critical acclaim around the world.\n\nAlong the way, there have been a host of collaborations, including with brother Tim and wife Sharon, and an array of names from Johnny Marr, Ed O\u2019Brien, Eddie Vedder and most of Wilco. There have been two solo records, Try Whistling This and One Nil (or One All). And yet Dizzy Heights unmistakably marks a fresh leap.\n\nWith wife Sharon (bass) and sons Liam (guitar) and Elroy (drums), Finn travelled in two bursts to producer Dave Fridmann\u2019s Tarbox Road studio in upstate New York, to record songs composed at his Auckland studio, Roundhead. With Fridmann (Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips), and in collaborations with young New Zealand musicians Connan Mockasin and SJD, Finn has assembled a textured, heady sound, furnished and elevated by woozy strings and soaring vocals.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it a solo record in a stripped back singer-songwriter sort of way,\u201d says Finn. \u201cI had a feeling Dave would be good at adding some odd shapes to the music. Which I always welcome \u2013 making things a little more expansive ... He is good at subverting things, and making things sound a bit messed up and not as obvious, rather than being too tasteful, which is always a temptation.\u201d\n\nFinn remembers an important English teacher, from four decades ago at his high school in Te Awamutu, a small rural town in New Zealand\u2019s north island. His name was Ron Martin, and he raced them through the School Certificate syllabus in a matter of weeks, to clear space for reading, writing, arguing, making films (\u201cHe [later] gave me a Super-8 movie I\u2019d made in his class, and I\u2019d done a kind of dramatised version of the song \u2018Aqualung\u2019 by Jethro Tull ... I was dressed as a tramp with an old coat\u201d).\n\nSays Finn: \u201cWe had a very spirited debate one day in class about whether having big aspirations, big dreams, was a good idea given it can ultimately lead to disillusionment and isolation and at worst bitterness. There was quite a lot of variance of opinion, and I definitely came out for the, yeah, you\u2019ve got to have the big dreams and big aspirations and it doesn\u2019t matter, what the hell.\n\n\u201cI think of that sometimes when ambition, or having big dreams, seems slightly shallow and vain. Because the motivations they shift \u2013 imperceptibly sometimes ...\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like those boys, jumping off that cliff. I keep thinking back to the one who runs to the edge and stops twice, before leaping off. Life carries on being like that.\u201d\n\n- TOBY MANHIRE", "otherInfo": "Neil Finn is back for more Fangradio live audio streams on Mixlr, Tuesdays and Saturdays at 3pm PT.\n\n\"Tuesday will be broadcast from my place, more or less solo.

On the album\u2019s dynamic yet delicate title track, for instance, the band shifts from furious intensity to harmony-soaked melancholy as they reflect on certain overwhelming societal pressures. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we always feel five years behind in life, at least as far as the expectations of the world around us,\u201d says Sisti. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re constantly battling, but at the same time we know that there\u2019s no real timeline\u2014there\u2019s no time limit for doing what we want to do.\u201d\n\nTHICK\u2019s most politically charged work to date, 5 Years Behind offers up tracks like \u201cMansplain\u201d\u2014a blistering, brilliantly sarcastic takedown bookended by a sound collage of massively infuriating comments from men (e.g., \u201cGirl bands are really in right now,\u201d \u201cHere, let me help you carry your amp,\u201d \u201cAre those your boyfriend\u2019s drums?\u201d). \u201cThose are all things that men have actually said to us or our friends at shows,\u201d Page points out. On \u201cFake News,\u201d the band lets loose a 49-second blast of pure punk vitriol, spiked with scathing social commentary. And on \u201cBumming Me Out,\u201d 5 Years Behind delivers a bouncy but bittersweet epic that perfectly captures the pain of feeling powerless in the face of endless horrors happening in the world (sample lyric: \u201cNever knew I\u2019d be so tired/Fighting for what I believe\u201d).\n\nClosing out with the unrestrained fun of \u201cParty With Me\u201d\u2014as in \u201cJust take your clothes off and party with me/In the backyard of New York City\u201d\u20145 Years Behind also finds THICK looking back on their early days and on the increasingly endangered all-ages scene that birthed the band. To that end, the tenderly detailed \u201cWHUB\u201d unfolds as a heavy-hearted tribute to \u201call the DIY venues that are shut down now,\u201d as Page puts it. All originally from New York State, THICK\u2019s three members forged their friendship in those venues, with Sisti and Page forming the band in 2014 and Black joining the lineup two years later. Along with playing live as often as they could\u2014and purposely focusing on DIY/all-ages spaces all around New York\u2014THICK made their debut with the 2016 EP It\u2019s Always Something\u2026, put out their sophomore EP Would You Rather? in 2018, then signed with Epitaph later that year. \u201cFor a long time we didn\u2019t have management or a booking agent or anything\u2014we just worked our butts off and stayed true to ourselves, and it got us to where we are now,\u201d says Sisti.\n\nOver the years, THICK have earned recognition as an unstoppable live act, with their show typically spawning a mosh pit described by Stereogum as \u201cmore like an aggressive hug.\u201d As they dreamed up the tightly crafted yet uncontainable sound of 5 Years Behind, the band kept the live experience at the forefront of their minds. \u201cWhen we write, we write toward the emotions of the audience,\u201d says Sisti. \u201cI know that lyrics play a huge role in connection, but I\u2019m personally more focused on visualizing how people might physically respond to a song\u2014what it would make them feel in the moment and how it might make them move or dance.\u201d\n\nNow gearing up for a national tour in support of 5 Years Behind, THICK aspire to strengthen the palpable sense of inclusivity that\u2019s defined their shows from the start. \u201cWe want people to feel safe in the mosh pit, and hopefully connect with each other,\u201d says Page. \u201cWe\u2019ve made so many friends at the shows we\u2019ve played, and we\u2019d love it if people could build some kind of community from coming to see us.\u201d And in the making of their first full-length effort, THICK aimed to instill an undeniable feeling of solidarity into each of the album\u2019s tracks. \u201cIn a way the theme of all our songs is: \u2018We\u2019ll get through this. We\u2019re not going to be kept down,\u201d says Black. \u201cI hope when people listen to the album, it gives them that same feeling. And I hope they feel like, if they ever needed it, we\u2019d absolutely have their back.\u201d\n\nNikki Sisti (guitar, vocals) - Kate Black (bass, vocals, guitar) - Shari Page (drums, vocals)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mom Jeans.

He eventually moved to Atlanta, where he would go on to make a name for himself as one of the most prominent Southern rappers.\n\n\nEarly years\n\nBridges began his music career as a radio personality and DJ as Chris Lova Lova on Hot 97, an urban radio station in Atlanta, Georgia. He made his recorded debut on \"Phat Rabbit,\" a track from Timbaland's 1998 album Tim's Bio: Life from the Basement. Although both Timbaland and Jermaine Dupri showed interest in signing Ludacris, he decided to release the album \"Incognegro\" independently in 1999. The album sold over 50,000 copies through the Atlanta based independent music distributor, Southern Music Distribution. The same year, he recorded the theme to the video game Madden NFL 2000. Scarface, an original member of the Geto Boys, signed Ludacris in 2000 to Def Jam Recordings, and created a new imprint, Def Jam South, around him.\n\nBack for the First Time\n\nLudacris released his major label debut, Back for the First Time, in October 2000. The album reached as high as #4 on the charts, and was a major success. Ludacris made his mark on the industry with singles such as \"Southern Hospitality\" and \"What's Your Fantasy\", along with his first ever single \"Phat Rabbit\", from 2 years prior. Back for the First Time was the beginning of Ludacris's explosion to the top of the rap world.\n\nWord of Mouf\n\nLudacris promptly completed his next album, Word Of Mouf and released it at the end of 2001. Its lead single, \"Rollout (My Business)\" was boycotted in many American video stations. Despite the controversy, the video was nominated for a 2003 VMA, and Luda performed it live at the awards' pre-show. Ludacris also toured with Papa Roach in 2002 after the release of their sophomore album lovehatetragedy. Ludacris reached a new level of notoriety when TV's Bill O'Reilly expressed outrage that Pepsi had hired Ludacris as a spokesman. O'Reilly repeatedly attacked Ludacris's foul language and called for a nation-wide boycott of Pepsi, who then fired Ludacris and hired Ozzy Osbourne's family instead.\n\nChicken-N-Beer\n\nDuring the spring of 2003, Ludacris returned to the music scene after a brief hiatus with a new single, \"Act A Fool\" from the 2 Fast 2 Furious soundtrack. At around the same time, he released the lead single from his upcoming album, Chicken & Beer, called \"P-Poppin\" (short for \"Pussy Poppin'\"). Neither of his new singles were as well-received by either the urban or pop audiences as his previous songs had been, and both music videos received only limited airplay. Chicken & Beer opened strongly, but without a popular single, the album fell quickly.\n\nHowever, in the fall of 2003, Ludacris rebounded with his next single, \"Stand Up\", which appeared on both Chicken & Beer as well as the soundtrack for the teen hip-hop/dance movie, Honey. Produced by Kanye West, \"Stand Up\" went on to become Ludacris' biggest mainstream hit to date, hitting the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 and garnering heavy airplay on mainstream pop, rhythmic, and urban radio stations, as well as on MTV, MTV2, and BET.\n\nThe album's next single, \"Splash Waterfalls\", was released in early 2004. Though not a pop hit, it became a success at urban radio and BET. It was Ludacris' most sexual video yet and an R&B remix that featured Raphael Saadiq and sampled Tony! Toni! Tone!'s \"Whatever You Want\". Luda next released \"Blow It Out\", a gritty song that had a heavily low-budget, gritty, and urban-looking music video, which was a huge departure from the colorful, sensual, R&B leanings depicted in \"Splash Waterfalls\". \"Blow It Out\" acted both as a scathing response to the aforementioned criticism levied by Bill O'Reilly and an expression of disgust at Pepsi's cowardice in the affair:\n\nShout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'm'a throw you a curve\nYou mad cause I'm a thief and got away with words\nI'm'a start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves\nPepsi's the New Generation?\u2014Blow it out cha ass!\n\n* On 1 June 2006, a federal jury found that \"Stand Up\" did not infringe on the copyright of a song called \"Straight Like That\" by a New Jersey group known as I.O.F. \"I hope the plaintiffs enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame,\" Ludacris said after the verdict. \"This whole experience is proof to me of why I will always fight for what I believe in.\"\n\nThe Red Light District\n\nThe fourth studio album from Ludacris. Although entirely different from the usual antics of the previous albums, Ludacris had taken a more mature approach to his album. Ludacris openly boasted that he may be the only rapper able to keep the Def Jam label afloat. Ludacris had recently filmed and recorded the single \"Get Back\" in which he was featured a muscle-bounded hulk who was being annoyed by the media and warned his critics to leave him alone. He also was featured on Saturday Night Live playing his song Get Back with Sum 41. The follow-up single was the Austin Powers-inspired \"The Number One Spot\". It was produced by New York City's Hot 97 personality DJ Green Lantern. It used the Quincy Jones sample of \"Soul Bossa Nova\" and sped it up to the tempo of Ludacris' rap flow. Ludacris also filmed the video in which he pokes fun at O'Reilly's problems with Andrea Mackris (Hi Mr. O'Reilly / Hope all is well kiss the plaintiff and the wifey). Production credits come also from veteran producers Timbaland, Lil' Jon, The Medicine Men and legendary rapper Doug E. Fresh. Featured artists on the album include Nas, DJ Quik, DMX, Trick Daddy, and Disturbing Tha Peace newcomers Bobby Valentino (of Mista fame) and Dolla Boi and Small World. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts. And most recently the rapper had used his opportunity to start his own foundation. The Ludacris Foundation started by Ludacris and Chaka Zulu is an organization that helps young middle and high school students motivate themselves in creative arts. Ludacris also has a daughter by the name of Karma. Ludacris had also participated at the Super Bowl and is the spokesman for the Boost Mobile Phone ad-campaign. Ludacris also received his first Grammy Award with Usher and Lil Jon for their hit single \"Yeah\"\n\nRelease Therapy\n\nIn a recent issue of XXL, a hip-hop based magazine, Ludacris was placed in the number nine spot for the most anticipated albums of 2006, for Release Therapy. The album Release Therapy was released on September 26, 2006. Ludacris is going to format the cd to have two sides, a Release side and a Therapy side. With the Release side having songs that allow him to get everything off his chest and the Therapy side being just feel-good music. A song titled \"War With God\" is one of the confirmed tracks from the upcoming album. The first single, \"Money Maker\", which features Pharrell, was released to U.S. radio outlets on July 17. Others songs will be : \"Tell It Like It Is\" (Produced by Elaborate Musik Workshop), \"Runaway Love\" (Feat. Mary J. Blige) and Woozy (Feat. R. Kelly)[1] \"Money Maker\" reached number one on the BET 106 & Park Countdown for the first time on September 15, 2006. The album recently reached number 1 on the Billboard 200 album charts with sales of more than 300,000 in its first week.\n\nTo promote the album, Ludacris will be hosting and performing on Saturday Night Live 18 November. Ludacris is the second and only rapper to host and perform on the same episode (MC Hammer hosted and performed in 1991, on different episodes ).\n\nTheater of the Mind\n\nLudacris's 6th album, Theater of the Mind, is to come out in 2007.\n\nActing career\n\nLudacris has been acting in film since The Wash in 2001, but his big break came in 2005, where he received critical praise for his roles in the Oscar-winning films Hustle & Flow and Crash. Crash includes an ironic sequence where Ludacris's character is dismissive of hip-hop music. Interestingly, in both films, he is physically beaten by characters played by Terrence Howard. He is occasionally credited as \"Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges\".\n\nOn January 29, 2006 he was awarded with a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture for his work in the film Crash. Ludacris also starred in 2 Fast 2 Furious.Ludacris narrated the 2006 Ward Serrill basketball documentary \"Heart of the Game.\" Ludacris recently cut his trademark braids off to project a new image for his upcoming album, Release Therapy.\n\nHe recently appeared in the 28 March 2006 episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Ludacris portrayed Darius Randall, the nephew of Detective Fin Tutuola, portrayed by Ice T.\n\nDisputes\n\nFurthering the controversy, in response to the signing of the Osbourne family, popular music hip-hop mogul, Russell Simmons, organized a boycott against the company. Simmons demanded an apology from Pepsi to Ludacris and a 5 million dollar donation to one of Ludacris' charities. Eventually Simmons and Pepsi settled on an agreement to stop the boycott, right before it was to officially begin-- while Pepsi did not formally apologize to Ludacris, they did agree to donate millions of dollars over years to Russel Simmon Hip-Hop Summit Action Network.\n\nLudacris' song \"Blow It Out\" (from the Chicken & Beer album), acted as a scathing response to his critics, namely O'Reilly.\n\nIn another song, \"Hoes in My Room\", he tells a story about anonymous prostitutes being left in his room, and at the end of the last verse he says:\n\nThen it got to my head and Somethin' remind me\n\nI know who let 'em in, it was Bill O'Reilly.\n\nThen, in 2004, in \"Number 1 Spot\"\n\nRespected highly, Hi Mr. O'Reilly.\n\nHope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with GQ magazine, Ludacris criticized Oprah Winfrey about his appearance on her show with the cast of the film Crash. During the interview, the conversation veered from the movie and Winfrey chose to speak on Ludacris' lyrical content, which he felt was unfair as he was visiting her show in the capacity of an actor and not a rapper. Also, Ludacris was upset that some of his responses were later edited from the show's airing. He was later joined by other rappers such as 50 Cent, Ice Cube and Killer Mike who argued that Winfrey had an anti-hip hop bias.\n\nWinfrey responded by saying that she's opposed to rap lyrics that \"marginalize women,\" but enjoys some artists, including Kanye West, who appeared on her show. She said she spoke with Ludacris backstage after his appearance to explain her position and said she understood that his music was for entertainment purposes, but that some of his listeners might take it literally. Ludacris later said the media had blown his comments out of proportion and said he respects Winfrey and considers her \"a great individual.\"\n\nIn 2004, before the release of his debut album Straight Outta Ca$hville, Nashville, Tennessee native and G-Unit member Young Buck would enlist the services of fellow Atlanta emcee T.I., also known as T.I.P. in his native Bankhead neighborhood of westside Atlanta. They would create a track entitled \"Stomp\" amid growing tension between Buck's good friend Ludacris and T.I. On the track, T.I. takes subliminal shots at Ludacris including the line \"me gettin' beat down, that's ludicrous.\" Buck, immediately sensing the tension, decided before releasing the track to notify Ludacris that T.I. had mentioned him since he didn't want to position himself as encouraging T.I.'s actions. Ludacris hears the track and asks Buck if he can add his own verse to which Buck agrees. The results end up being costly for T.I. as he is berated throughout Ludacris' verse and called out by name in his last line. Representatives from T.I. notify Buck that T.I.'s vocals will not be cleared for the album unless T.I. is allowed to change his verse, and also have Ludacris change his. Buck refuses this offer and T.I. prohibits his vocals from being used. Buck has hypeman and fellow rapper D-Tay replace T.I. on the song and D-Tay himself is eventually replaced by The Game on the official release.\n\nAlthough T.I. was removed, the street cut featuring him and Ludacris had already been leaked to DJs in Atlanta and New York. T.I. was unable to stop the track's distribution throughout the streets of the nation at this point. It is widely accepted that T.I. \"lost\" this battle with Ludacris easily being the victor. The beef between Ludacris and T.I. was then put to an end behind closed doors as T.I. said that the problems between them have ceased.\n\nIn 2006 however, T.I. would release his highly anticipated fourth solo album entitled KING. In his Just Blaze produced track titled \"I'm Talkin To You,\" T.I. lyrically attacks one or more unknown targets who have widely been speculated to be either Ludacris, New Orleans emcee Lil Wayne, or Houston rapper Lil' Flip (whom T.I. also had beef with but has since ended their animosity behind closed doors) or a combination of all three. It is still unknown whether or not T.I. was in fact battling Ludacris again or anyone else for that matter at all. A closer listen to the song, however proves that T.I. isnt dissing Ludacris. In one of T.I.s lines he quotes \"had it out with 'Cris, but he still my nigga...sat down civilized talked about it like niggas\", alluding to the sit down that he and Ludacris had to end their beef. As a matter of fact during the taping of MTV's My Block 'Atlanta', T.I. and Ludacris are shown greeting each other respectfully.\n\nIn July of 2006, a track entitled \"War with God\" would see Ludacris return after some time off in movies. In the track, Ludacris goes on the offensive against an unknown rapper who has sold drugs, and makes repeated references to shooting guns in his songs, isn't as rich as he (Ludacris) and likes to give himself titles - all very well known characteristics and facts directly relating to T.I and Young Jeezy (or countless other less popular rappers) or the newcoming rappers Yung Joc and Young Dro. In this instance it also unknown whether or not Ludacris is indeed aiming his disses at Young Jeezy, T.I. or if the track is even a song recorded recently. Ludacris recently stated that the song was deeper than just a diss, and the song is more about him than anyone else, it's showing that he isn't just the 'cartoon entertainer' type rapper that he has always been portrayed as, when asked about who specific rhymes were aimed at he said \"The guilty will speak\". The track has been confirmed to be a selection from Ludacris' upcoming album Release Therapy this September. The song is not aimed at Young Jeezy as he features on the latest album. \"War with God\" uses a beat written by Don Cheegro and Dirty Harry.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nelly ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9049470.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Rap, Hip-hop, Hip Hop", "Time": "10:59 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Name at birth: Cornell Haynes, Jr.\n\nNelly became a hip-hop and pop superstar after the success of his solo 2000 release, Country Grammar.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gabrielle Stravelli ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8941680.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "New York, New York", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cListening to the jazz singer Gabrielle Stravelli is like imbibing a potent cocktail whose flavor changes as you drain the glass\u2026a confidence and playfulness that recalled Ella Fitzgerald in her prime\u2026\u201d -The New York Times\nGabrielle Stravelli was born in New York and raised in New Jersey by parents who had very eclectic taste in music; her childhood home was full of the sounds of swing, big band, opera, R&B, gospel, musical theater and 1970s and 80s pop.

Recorded at the iconic Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama, Italian Ice finds the Nashville-based artist joined by Spooner Oldham and David Hood (both members of The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, who played on classic records from the likes of Aretha Franklin and Etta James), Binky Griptite of The Dap Kings, Jim Sclavunos and Dave Sherman of The Bad Seeds, and drummer McKenzie Smith (St. Vincent, Midlake). With special guests including Spoon frontman Britt Daniel, Seth Avett of The Avett Brothers, Erin Rae, and John Paul White, the album is a testament to Atkins\u2019s uncommon talent for uniting musicians of radically different sensibilities. As Atkins explains, the abundance of collaborations on Italian Ice partly stems from a freak accident in which she stumbled into a sinkhole in a Knoxville parking lot\u2014an incident that left her with a profound longing to fill her life with the people and experiences that bring her the most joy.\n\nCo-produced by Atkins and Ben Tanner of Alabama Shakes, Italian Ice makes brilliant use of its A-list personnel, unfolding in a kaleidoscopic sound that Atkins likens to \u201can acid trip through my record collection.\u201d At turns as opulent as symphonic pop and gritty as garage punk, the album wanders into shades of psych-rock and honky-tonk and girl-group melodrama, endlessly spotlighting the tightly honed musicianship and unbridled originality at heart of Atkins\u2019s artistry.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mark Joseph ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8787909.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Bluegrass, Jazz, American Soul, Jazz Blues, Funk, Gospel, Reggae, Jam Bands, Blues, Jazz Fusion, Rock, Blue-eyed Soul", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Minneapolis, Minnesota\u2019s Mark Joseph & The American Soul are modern day proof of what genuine creative talent, exceedingly hard-work, and decades of dedication to one\u2019s craft can bring to the world.

In the end of 2018, Amy Stargher was added in the lineup, a singer/guitarist and percussionist, previously with Jett & The Bombs, with strong vocals and electric stage presence. The core of the band is completed with Gina Rebelo on bass (formerly of Three Day Threshold) and influences from Bootsy Collins to John Paul Jones, and Peter Douskalis a skillful guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, creating the foundational surge for the listener to truly become part of the music. Using the depth of life experiences as inspiration for their lyrics, the band strive to connect with the listener through rock-and-roll infused messages of overcoming obstacles with a tinge of sorrow-filled hope. Guitar riffs, keyboards, string section, bass lines, drum rhythms and a strong emotionally-charged stage presence add to the radio-ready experience of TIS.\n\n\"We're all trying to escape the static that surrounds us,\" says Athan. \"We all seem to be trapped in some way, and the theme of our music is to find ways to break free from the things that hold you back.

His new album, I Don't Dance, is a showcase for his painstaking approach to writing and recording, with his distinctive fingerprints clearly emblazoned on every element of the album. While Brice is now known as reliable chart- topping Nashville hit-maker whose 2014 performance on the Academy of Country Music telecast \u2014 where he picked up the trophy for \u201cSong of the Year\u201d\u2014 \"stole the show\" (USA Today), there was a time when he was only recognized for his work behind the scenes.\n\n\"I had success as a writer before I had success as an artist,\" says Brice, \"so there's a misconception that I was a songwriter first and then started to sing my own songs later. But all along, I've really always been writing for myself. When I started writing songs at ten years old, it was because I wanted to sing them, and when I came to Nashville, I came to be a songwriter and a singer. It's all one thing to me.\"\n\nAfter relocating from his native South Carolina to Music City, the former Clemson lineman dove headfirst into his craft, writing on his own and with a slew of talented musicians he fell in with. He found early success, with songs picked up by established artists like Jason Aldean and Keith Gattis. Though they may have been sung by other artists, those songs were stories from deep within Lee's own heart.\n\n\"'More Than A Memory' was a very personal song for me,\" he says of his breakout 2007 track. \"I was thinking about keeping it for myself when Garth Brooks called, and that changed the whole dynamic.\"\n\nIt changed a whole lot of things. Brooks' recording of the track was the first single in the history of the Billboard Hot Country Songs Chart to debut at #1. Lee's stock skyrocketed in Nashville, and that same year, he signed with Curb Records and began laying the groundwork for his inexorable rise as a solo artist.\n\nHe released his debut album, Love Like Crazy, in 2009. The title track reached #3 on the Billboard Country chart and set a record as the longest-charting song in that chart's history. In 2012, he topped his own success with Hard 2 Love, an album that went Gold and featured three #1 Country singles, including \"I Drive Your Truck,\" which won Song of the Year at both the CMA and ACM Awards. The record earned raves from NPR to Country Weekly and found the New York Times hailing him as \"a sensitive macho man,\" a compliment that perfectly encapsulates both sides of Brice's persona. Hard 2 Love also garnered Lee his late-night debut, a stirring performance of \"I Drive Your Truck\" on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d\n\n\"On my first record, I had all these ideas and sounds I didn't know how to get out of me,\" Brice remembers, crediting frequent collaborator Doug Johnson with helping him learn some of the early ropes of recording. \"On Hard 2 Love, I figured out that I could really step out and try things in the studio, and if they don't work they don't work, but sometimes those ideas become the basis of how you record some tracks.\u201d\n\nBrice took it a step further on I Don't Dance, relishing the role of producer with a flair for experimentation as yet another way to mold and shape his songs to match the sounds he'd been chasing in his head.\n\n\"I wanted to have control over every drumbeat, every lick of the bass part,\" he explains of his meticulous approach in the studio. \"It was a lot of really sitting down and thinking about every little piece that goes into it.\"\n\nRather than approach the record as a whole entity, Brice listened to what each song called for and played to its strengths, allowing the warmth and presence of his personality to form the cohesive thread that binds them all together. On the lighthearted summer anthem \u201cGirls In Bikinis,\u201d he built the track entirely from the ground up, playing every single instrument himself. The searing \u201cSirens,\u201d on the other hand, was cut live and loud in the studio, with raw electric guitars and a banjo part that captured Brice's first time playing the instrument. Other tracks grew out of drum loops and studio experiments, inspired in part by his love of recent albums from Bruno Mars and Eminem. Live-show- moment \u201cDrinking Class,\u201d one of three songs on the album not written by Brice, taught him a valuable lesson about hearing what the music calls for. \"We had ideas to put a lot of electronic sounds in it,\" he explains, \"but after we cut it, I had a feeling that this is really a song about the working class, and it needed those sounds, like chain gang stomps and claps and hums, and now I have a sledgehammer hitting a railroad tie on there. I changed everything about it to get it back to its roots. Sometimes you gotta go to a lot of the wrong places to get to the right places, and that's not wasted time. It takes that trip to get to where you're going.\"\n\n\"Panama City\" is another track that took a circuitous journey to its final destination on the new album. Written by his good friend Chris Thompkins, the track first caught Brice's ear a decade ago when he heard a stripped-down arrangement of it on one of Thompkins' work tapes.\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t imagine it being any different than what I heard on the work tape,\" says Brice. \"I said we had to do it live because I didn't want to give myself the option of redoing vocals or piano or bringing in background singers later. They brought the piano out into the main room of Ocean Way Studios [in Nashville], which is an old church, and we took our headphones off, had no click tracks, no drums. It's like they did 50 years ago. We played it four times and the last time was perfect. I took it off the board exactly the way we recorded it and mastered it, and it's my favorite track on the record by far.\u201d Perhaps the most personal song on the album, though, is the title track, which Brice wrote for the first dance at his May 2013 wedding. As with so much of his work, the lyrics are inspired by his undying love for his wife, Sara, but they resonate with a huge audience. Top wedding website The Knot recently selected it for the \"Dream Wedding\" they threw for a pair of Boston Marathon bombing survivors.\n\n\"It's my favorite song I've ever written in my life,\" says Lee, \"and I don\u2019t know that that'll ever change.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/CircleAllAccess/posts/232606148164824"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Paul Potts ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9616822.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Classical", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Recording a live operatic song each day"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Two Blue Roses House Concert Series ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10131290.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "House Concert Series in Eugene Oregon for local and touring quality acoustic Independent musicians hosted by Jeanette Lundgren", "otherInfo": "Two Blue Roses (in Eugene, Oregon) Presents From Different Mothers (Jeff Kossack and Jimmy Yessian) on Saturday, May 16th.\n4:30 till 6 PM PDT\nOn Facebook Live, both on this page: https://www.facebook.com/TwoBlueRosesEugene"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Machine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9063116.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Pink Floyd", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "THE MACHINE, America\u2019s top Pink Floyd show, has forged a 30 year reputation of excellence, extending the legacy of Pink Floyd, while creating another legacy all their own.

During a period when he headlined his first Massey Hall concert and supported sold out shows with The Gaslight Anthem all over North America, Matt teamed up with co-producer Eric Ratz to record at studios around Toronto between touring commitments.\n\nTwice Upon a Hell of a Time\u2026 was originally conceived as a straight-up solo interpretation, similar to the iTunes Session recorded with Ratz in 2011. As the songs took shape, however, Matt decided to incorporate extra vocals and instrumentation. Tapping musicians Aaron Goldstein (Daniel Romano, Lee Harvey Osmond) on pedal steel, Anthony Carone (Arkells) on piano, and guest singers Andrew Rodriguez, Kate Dyke, and Melissa Payne, the album\u2019s arrangements are lush and large without straying from the \u2018unplugged\u2019 vibe he sought from the outset.\n\nLead track \u201cOla Volo\u201d is inspired by a Vancouver-based mural artist of the same name who also created the original album art for both records. \u201cHer paintings and drawings all have a theme that I picked up on,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nature. To me, it\u2019s from another dimension, a very curious dimension that draws me in. Her pieces are very edgy and real-life at the same time. I had this feeling that I\u2019d like to be in one of her paintings, to live in that world that she\u2019s created.\u201d\n\nAfter departing seminal alt-country collective The Guthries back in 2002, Matt Mays alternated between solo projects (his self-titled debut, the unfinished film soundtrack \u2026When the Angels Make Contact) and band projects (the eponymous Matt Mays & El Torpedo record and 2008\u2019s Terminal Romance).

Evidence: Before the World Was Made. The Austin-based songwriters\u2019 debut collaboration spotlights celebrated troubadours in peak form (\u201cBefore We Come to Our Senses\u201d). \u201cThese are modern day country duets \u00e0 la George Jones and Melba Montgomery,\u201d producer Gurf Morlix says, \u201cbut with very sophisticated songwriting.\u201d Before the World Was Made began taking shape three years ago right as Leigh\u2019s solo high watermark The Box stirred waves far and wide. (Lee Ann Womack, Sunny Sweeney and the Carper Family have covered her defiantly traditional country songs.) By that point, Leigh was well rooted in Austin, where she moved after growing up playing in a family band in Minnesota. \u201cI was attracted to the scene in Austin,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place to learn and get better at what I do.\u201d Meanwhile, McKay fronted the regionally popular McKay Brothers (Cold Beer and Hot Tamales), a band legendary songwriter Guy Clark had been championing for years. \u201cNoel and Brennen are great songwriters,\u201d says Clark, whose new album My Favorite Picture of You contains the McKay co-write \u201cEl Coyote.\u201d \u201cAnd Brennen plays guitar like a motherfucker.\u201d Before the World Was Made proves his point. \u201cSome of these are songs that Noel had from a long time ago that we reconstructed,\u201d Leigh says, \u201cand some we wrote together recently. Writing duets is just almost like writing from one point of view and splitting it and making it make sense. Like \u2018Ball in Chain,\u2019 is not like a fight song. Same with \u2018Breaking Up and Making Up Again.\u2019 They\u2019re dysfunctional, but the characters are happy with their situation, so it\u2019s almost from one point of view.\u201d The singular duo effortlessly balances wit (\u201cLet\u2019s Don\u2019t Get Married\u201d) and whimsy (\u201cLet\u2019s Go to Lubbock on Vacation\u201d) throughout. \u201cI\u2019ve loaded up the Nomad and the tank is full of gas/We\u2019ll ride along across the High Plains fast,\u201d the latter goes. \u201cWe\u2019ll find the sweetest spot on God\u2019s creation, my pretty little turtle dove/Let\u2019s go to Lubbock on vacation.\u201d Punch line: \u201cThen we\u2019ll know we\u2019re really in love.\u201d The pair consistently doubles down with sharp snapshots charting equally unpredictable romantic byways (\u201cSalty Kisses in the Sand,\u201d \u201cGreat Big Oldsmobile\u201d). \u201cWe kind of set out to make out a record of songs that we were singing together, even if it wasn\u2019t specifically duet songs,\u201d McKay says. \u201cWe both have solo careers to think about, but we\u2019ll probably revisit this over and over and it\u2019s a nice thing we can keep doing.\u201d \u201cWe got to where people were asking us about certain songs and lumping us together in their mind,\u201d Leigh adds, \u201cso we thought we should make something to pay homage to that. Of course, people like the funny ones the best.\u201d Good reason: Only kindred spirits allow a song as wickedly waggish as \u201cBe My Ball and Chain.\u201d Priceless. Everyday conversation suggests Leigh and McKay indeed share a single mindset. The pair simply compliment each other in every way. \u201cBrennen\u2019s really great at melodies,\u201d McKay says. \u201cShe\u2019s always kicking around a melody around the house and it\u2019s great and she\u2019ll attach it to a lyric idea that\u2019s equally great. She writes characters in her songs like a novelist.\u201d \u201cNoel always has the line,\u201d Leigh counters. \u201cIt\u2019s like, How are we gonna wrap this up? How are we gonna bring it around so it makes sense? He always ties it up. He always knows.

Her distinctive and brutally honest songwriting, paired with her energetic performances, come through seamlessly no matter where her music is played, live on the stage or in her critically acclaimed recordings.\n\nSince she began writing music when she was a teenager, the essence of Nicole Rayy\u2019s music has always been, first and foremost, to express herself as honestly as possible. When pressed for musical comparisons to her musical ability, the Oakville, Ontario-born Rayy is reluctant to provide. For as long as she\u2019s been playing music, she has been herself. Comparisons are easy to fall back on, but for Nicole, her music should always speak for itself.\n\nNicole Rayy first blasted into the Canadian Country music scene in 2012 with the release of her debut EP \u201cOnly Everything\u201d. She went on to release her debut full-length album Dig, in October 2016. The highly anticipated album, continued in the theme of uncompromising honesty and challenges listeners, as well as Nicole herself, to dig deep down to the emotional core of themselves. Produced at Noble Street Studios in Toronto by renowned Record Producer/Writer and Musical Director Doug Romanow, whose long list of clients include Justin Bieber, Johnny Reid, Chantal Kreviazuk, and the Canadian Country Music Awards. The album showcases Rayy\u2019s tonal range and relatable sentiment perfectly\n\nThe release of the album was celebrated by a performance and fundraising event at Cowboys Roadhouse in Winnipeg, MB, which raised over $4000 for the Manitoba Neurofibromatosis Support Group (MBNF). It was shortly after the event, that the title single \u201cDig,\u201d also released in October 2016, started to make its way on to radio stations across Canada. The single was highly supported nationally and garnered over 63,000 streams on Spotify.\n\nWith the success of the album and single \u201cDig,\u201d Nicole released her next single \u201cFireproof\u201d March, 2017, and embarked on a radio tour throughout Ontario and across Western Canada. \u201cFireproof,\u201d hit immediate success among music programmers and directors, and to date has received over 155,000 streams on Spotify.\n\nThe single took Nicole into what became a very exciting 2017, seeing her invited back to perform at such festivals as Manitoulin Countryfest, The Calgary Stampede and Burlington Ribfest, sharing the stage with artists such as The Chris Buck Band, Crystal Shawanda, and Joe Nichols. Nicole was also invited to showcase at the Country Music Association of Ontario Roadshow in Ottawa, NSAI Toronto\u2019s Tin Pan North, Diamonds In The Rough during Canadian Country Music Week in Saskatchewan, SK, and Indie Week Canada in Toronto, November 2017.\n\nNicole has also had the honour of performing at the World Music Festival in Shanghai, China, for three years in a row (2015-2017), and will be returning again in 2018, proving to be a hit among Shanghai\u2019s enthusiastic crowds.\n\n2018 began with an opportunity to open for Brett Kissel in Barrie, Ontario, and continued with multiple festival performances including Dauphin Countryfest, Trackside in London and the main stage at the Howl at the Moon festival in Manitoba opening for Aaron Pritchett and Brett Kissel\n\nIn June Nicole was honoured to be nominated for Rising Star by the CMA Ontario and her latest single \u201cBad Habit\u201d was released and has been very popular with her fans this summer.\n\nWith a sound that is distinctly her own and a creative ambition that knows no bounds, Nicole Rayy feels right at home either on a stage or in a recording studio and will never stay put in one place for too long. She will always keep learning, she will always keep writing, she will always keep singing\u2026\n\nAnd she will always be herself.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ekali ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9047161.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Bass, Electronic", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Producer with writing credit on Drake's record; Red Bull Music Academy Tokyo 2014 Alumni.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/insomniac"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alex Lucero & The Live Again Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10382489.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Funk, Blues, Southern Rock, Soul, Alternative Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "For over 6 years Live Again has been portraying their love of music to fans and audience members all around California.

It\u2019s a formula that quickly took them from local favorites, playing around Annapolis, to a national stage. With a wildly infectious sound, tattoo-worthy lyrics and an itch to take their music to the masses, the band piled into the van years ago and have rarely seen home since.\n\nThe Bumpin Uglies\u2019 origin story begins with singer/guitarist Brandon Hardesty playing open mics around Maryland. He met bassist Dave Wolf not too long after and Bumpin Uglies was born. With a proper set of wheels and TJ Haslett on drums, they went off to spread their music across the country like modern day Johnny Appleseeds. The group recently added Chad Wright on keyboards, expanding on their sound.\nRaised on everything from Bad Religion and The Beach Boys to Sublime and Reel Big Fish, Bumpin Uglies have managed to take inspiration from some of the best out there, run it through their own distinctive filter and end up with a truly original take on the various genres creating an original hybrid. With a unique sound that\u2019s nearly impossible to ignore, the band has gotten everyone from dreadlocked kids to PBR-fueled tattooed punks moving their heads to their music at festivals and on headlining tours across the country.\n\nWhen they aren\u2019t on the road, they\u2019ve been camped in the studio, churning out three full lengths, two EPs and a live record. Their latest, 2016\u2019s Keep It Together came out on Right Coast Records and is proof that the band has found their groove. The album consists of a dozen stand-out tracks, any one of which could be considered instant classics for the band.

Rhythm underlines each ebb and flow, scoring the soundtrack to humanity\u2019s evolution.\n\nWith every move, Black Eyed Peas dictate the rhythm of culture. Blurring genre lines long before it became commonplace and pioneering an unprecedented global hybrid of hip-hop, pop, electro, and world as early as 1995, the Los Angeles trio\u2014will.i.am, apl.de.ap, and Taboo\u2014maximize the momentum of a legendary career earmarked by making history, breaking records, and raising the bar yet again in 2020 and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe last time we were this clear was in 1995 when we started the group,\u201d grins will.i.am. \u201cThere was a lane for us. There was room for us. We capitalized on moments to make an impact in 2003 and 2009. We\u2019re looking to the future now. What\u2019s the next ten years? For us, they\u2019re about being purposeful in society.\u201d\n\nThe group certainly constructed the perfect launchpad to be \u201cpurposeful.\u201d Over the past 25 years, they earned six GRAMMY\u00ae Awards and achieved sales of 35 million albums and 120 million singles across seminal releases such as Elephunk, The E.N.D., and more. Cemented as one of the era\u2019s biggest acts, they emerged as \u201cthe second best-selling artist/group of all-time for downloaded tracks,\u201d according to Nielsen, and landed on Billboard\u2019s \u201cHot 100 Artists of the Decade.\u201d Moving over 3 million tickets, performing 300-plus shows throughout 30 different countries, and headlining stadiums, they graced the biggest stage in the world with a landmark performance at the Super Bowl XLV Halftime Show in 2011.\n\nAfter reaching these heights, a period of relative quiet followed\u2014lasting nearly eight years. As always, Black Eyed Peas\u2019 music coursed through the zeitgeist between one-off singles, but the group simultaneously endured life\u2019s trials and tribulations. Taboo battled cancer in 2014, recovering victoriously with his brothers by his side at home.\n\n\u201cMetaphorically, Black Eyed Peas gave me life, but also in a real sense,\u201d admits Taboo. \u201cI had that horrible disease. At least, I was back in Los Angeles to deal with it. I became stronger and got back into work mode with my brothers. I appreciate us having another chance to feed this amazing journey and vehicle of Black Eyed Peas. This is my engine. It kept me fighting to know I\u2019d be on stage again. It taught me how to appreciate and love every moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you have a run like we did, you should not expect for it to repeat,\u201d adds will.i.am. \u201cWe never thought we could do what we did in the first place. Then, we basically took an eight-year break. It\u2019s taken a long time for us to get back. We had to learn, and to refocus on our roots. We\u2019re a trio again, swinging for the fences. It\u2019s a new era here.\u201d\n\nThey found the best way to ignite this era on the single \u201cRITMO (Bad Boys For Life)\u201d alongside one of the hottest acts in the world and possibly the biggest Latin star of the millennium J Balvin. Featured as the lead single of the Bad Boys For Life Soundtrack, it exploded as a phenomenon right out of the gate, generating over 180 million streams and 294 million video views in under a month\u2019s time. Creatively, it illustrated yet another breakthrough. Once again, Black Eyed Peas pulled from the streets, magnifying underground club energy, reggaeton grooves, and a Spanglish singalong on a global sonic canvas.\n\n\u201c\u2018RITMO\u2019 is about having a good time,\u201d Taboo states. \u201cAs much as we live in an internet age, people like to go out. So, this song is all going out, expressing yourself, and living life to the fullest. It\u2019s a party song. I want my whole week to be like my Friday and Saturday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always joke, \u2018Damn, we made a career out of going out\u2019,\u201d laughs apl.de.ap. \u201cWe still go out all the time. We just call it \u2018research\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe deliberately aimed to make a record that reflected our origins and celebrated the last two decades,\u201d will.i.am elaborates. \u201cWe love boom-bap. We love hip-hop. We love Latin. When we made The E.N.D., I was going to a lot of clubs and hearing what was happening with dance music. The same thing is going on now with Latin. There\u2019s a Latin Afro-fusion influence to this next chapter. It\u2019s always been there, and it\u2019s part of our DNA as an L.A. group. We\u2019ve been working on songs that are muscle with a global punch and saved them because we knew they would be special. This is one of them.\u201d\n\nWith their eighth album and full-length debut for Epic Records on the way, Black Eyed Peas fulfill a perennial purpose on new music and so much more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a family,\u201d concludes apl.de.ap. \u201cWe have bigger dreams than ever, and we\u2019re going to make them happen together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot from our journey,\u201d will.i.am leaves off. \u201cI think we\u2019ve learned more than we thought possible. I believe our younger selves would be proud of the courageous and fearless people we\u2019ve become, because there\u2019s a deeper meaning in our music. We try to bring answers and joy.

It\u2019s a formula that quickly took them from local favorites, playing around Annapolis, to a national stage. With a wildly infectious sound, tattoo-worthy lyrics and an itch to take their music to the masses, the band piled into the van years ago and have rarely seen home since.\n\nThe Bumpin Uglies\u2019 origin story begins with singer/guitarist Brandon Hardesty playing open mics around Maryland. He met bassist Dave Wolf not too long after and Bumpin Uglies was born. With a proper set of wheels and TJ Haslett on drums, they went off to spread their music across the country like modern day Johnny Appleseeds. The group recently added Chad Wright on keyboards, expanding on their sound.\nRaised on everything from Bad Religion and The Beach Boys to Sublime and Reel Big Fish, Bumpin Uglies have managed to take inspiration from some of the best out there, run it through their own distinctive filter and end up with a truly original take on the various genres creating an original hybrid. With a unique sound that\u2019s nearly impossible to ignore, the band has gotten everyone from dreadlocked kids to PBR-fueled tattooed punks moving their heads to their music at festivals and on headlining tours across the country.\n\nWhen they aren\u2019t on the road, they\u2019ve been camped in the studio, churning out three full lengths, two EPs and a live record.

The album consists of a dozen stand-out tracks, any one of which could be considered instant classics for the band.

What he once described as a \u201cparty-rock record for the brokenhearted\u201d transforms into a reflective and beautiful dive into false escapism, grief, love, and loss. \"The stripped-down record lends clarity and depth to his already nuanced lyrics, revealing a deep thinker who seeks honesty in his craft, and in life.\" - Beatroute\n\nThe recording came amidst a particularly busy time for Matt Mays. During a period when he headlined his first Massey Hall concert and supported sold out shows with The Gaslight Anthem all over North America, Matt teamed up with co-producer Eric Ratz to record at studios around Toronto between touring commitments.\n\nTwice Upon a Hell of a Time\u2026 was originally conceived as a straight-up solo interpretation, similar to the iTunes Session recorded with Ratz in 2011. As the songs took shape, however, Matt decided to incorporate extra vocals and instrumentation. Tapping musicians Aaron Goldstein (Daniel Romano, Lee Harvey Osmond) on pedal steel, Anthony Carone (Arkells) on piano, and guest singers Andrew Rodriguez, Kate Dyke, and Melissa Payne, the album\u2019s arrangements are lush and large without straying from the \u2018unplugged\u2019 vibe he sought from the outset.\n\nLead track \u201cOla Volo\u201d is inspired by a Vancouver-based mural artist of the same name who also created the original album art for both records. \u201cHer paintings and drawings all have a theme that I picked up on,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nature. To me, it\u2019s from another dimension, a very curious dimension that draws me in. Her pieces are very edgy and real-life at the same time. I had this feeling that I\u2019d like to be in one of her paintings, to live in that world that she\u2019s created.\u201d\n\nAfter departing seminal alt-country collective The Guthries back in 2002, Matt Mays alternated between solo projects (his self-titled debut, the unfinished film soundtrack \u2026When the Angels Make Contact) and band projects (the eponymous Matt Mays & El Torpedo record and 2008\u2019s Terminal Romance).

Two Super-Bowl appearances, Pollstar Box Office chart-topping tours with Def Leppard, Journey, Boston, REO Speedwagon, Bad Company (to name only a few), two more studio albums and no end in sight, STYX continues to conquer the planet, one venue at a time.\n\nSpawned from a suburban Chicago basement in the early \u201870s, Styx would eventually transform into the virtual arena rock prototype by the late '70s and early '80s, due to a fondness for big rockers and soaring power ballads.\n\nEarly on, Styx's music reflected such then-current prog rockers as Emerson, Lake & Palmer and the Moody Blues, as evidenced by such releases as 1972's self-titled debut, 1973's Styx II, 1974's The Serpent Is Rising, and 1975's Man of Miracles. While the albums (as well as non-stop touring) helped the group build a substantial following locally, Styx failed to break through to the mainstream, until a track originally from their second album, \"Lady\" started to get substantial airplay in late '74 on the Chicago radio station WLS-FM. The song was soon issued as a single nationwide, and quickly shot to number six on the singles chart, as Styx II was certified gold. By this time, however, the group had grown disenchanted with their record label, and opted to sign on with A&M for their fifth release overall, 1975's Equinox (their former label would issue countless compilations over the years, culled from tracks off their early releases). On the eve of the tour in support of the album, original guitarist John Curulewski abruptly left the band, and was replaced by Tommy Shaw. Shaw proved to be the missing piece of the puzzle for Styx, as most of their subsequent releases throughout the late '70s earned at least platinum certification (1976's Crystal Ball, 1977's The Grand Illusion, 1978's Pieces of Eight, and 1979's Cornerstone), and spawned such hit singles and classic rock radio standards as \"Come Sail Away,\" \"Renegade,\" \"Blue Collar Man\" and \"Fooling Yourself.\u201d\n\nThe band decided that their first release of the '80s would be a concept album, 1981's Paradise Theater, which was loosely based on the rise and fall of a once-beautiful theater (which was supposedly used as a metaphor for the state of the U.S. at the time -- the Iranian hostage situation, the Cold War, Reagan, etc.). Paradise Theater became Styx's biggest hit of their career (selling over three million copies in a three-year period), as they became one of the U.S. top rock acts due to such big hit singles as \"Too Much Time on My Hands\". It also marked the first time in history that a band released four consecutive triple-platinum albums.\n\nA career-encompassing live album, Caught in the Act, was issued in 1984, before Styx went on hiatus, and the majority of its members pursued solo projects throughout the remainder of the decade. A re-recording of their early hit, \"Lady\" (titled \"Lady\" '95\"), for a Greatest Hits compilation, finally united Shaw with his former Styx bandmates, which led to a full-on reunion tour in 1996. But drummer John Panozzo fell seriously ill at the time (due to a long struggle with alcoholism), which prevented him from joining the proceedings -- as he passed away in July of the same year. Although grief-stricken, Styx persevered with new drummer Todd Sucherman taking the place of Panozzo, as the Styx reunion tour became a surprise sold-out success, resulting in the release of a live album/video, 1997's \"Return to Paradise,\" while a whole new generation of rock fans were introduced to the grandiose sounds of Styx via a humorous car ad which used the track \"Mr. Roboto,\" as well as songs used in such TV shows as South Park and Freaks & Geeks.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpu0LMJ0ygg"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Joey Alexander ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8410861.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Piano Jazz, Jazz", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "jazz pianist", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jonas Brothers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9104354.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Pop Rock, Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jonas Brothers are an American pop band. Hailing from Wyckoff, New Jersey, the band consists of three brothers: Kevin Jonas, Joe Jonas, and Nick Jonas. They have released three albums: It's About Time (2006), Jonas Brothers (2007), and A Little Bit Longer (2008).\n\nThe band started as a solo project of Nick Jonas. When Nick was six years old, he was discovered while singing at a salon and was referred to a professional show business manager. At the age of 7, Nicholas began performing on Broadway. He has acted in several plays, including A Christmas Carol (in 2000 as Tiny Tim and Scrooge at eight), Annie Get Your Gun (in 2001 as Little Jake), Beauty and the Beast (in 2002 as Chip), and Les Mis\u00e9rables (in 2003 as Gavroche). After Les Mis\u00e9rables closed, he performed in The Sound of Music (as Kurt) at the Paper Mill Playhouse.\n\nIn 2002 while performing in Beauty and the Beast, Nick wrote a song with his father called \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)\". With background vocals from the Beauty and the Beast cast, Nick performed the song on the 2002 annual Broadway \"Equity Fights AIDS\" album, Broadway's Greatest Gifts: Carols for a Cure, Vol. 4. In November 2003, INO Records received a demo copy of \"Joy To The World (A Christmas Prayer)\". The label released the song to Christian radio, where it quickly became popular on Record & Radio's Christian Adult Contemporary Chart. While Nick was working on his solo project, Joe followed in his footsteps to Broadway, appearing in Baz Lurhmann's production of La Boheme.\n\nBy September 2004, an executive at Columbia Records found out about Nick's song. Nick was soon jointly signed to INO Records and Columbia Records and released the single \"Dear God\". A second single, a new solo recording of \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)\", was released on November 16. It was supposed to be followed by a December release of a self-titled solo album Nicholas Jonas, but the album had been pushed back; it did, however, get a limited release. Nick, along with Kevin and Joe, had written several other songs for the album.\n\nIn early 2005, Columbia Records' new president, Steve Greenberg, listened to Nick's record. While Greenberg did not like the album, he did like Nick's voice. After meeting with Nick and hearing the song, \"Please Be Mine,\" written and performed by the brothers, Daylight Columbia Records decided to sign the three as a group act.\n\nAfter being signed to Columbia, the brothers considered naming their group \"Sons of Jonas\" before settling on the name \"Jonas Brothers.\"\n\nThroughout 2005, the Jonas Brothers went on several tours, including being the opening act of Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, the Backstreet Boys, and The Click Five.They spent the latter portion of the year on an anti-drug tour with Aly & AJ and The Cheetah Girls. Additionally, they opened for The Veronicas in early 2006.\n\nFor the album, titled It's About Time, the band collaborated with several writers, including Adam Schlesinger (Fountains of Wayne), Michael Mangini (Joss Stone), Desmond Child (Aerosmith, Bon Jovi), Billy Mann (Destiny's Child, Jessica Simpson) and Steve Greenberg (Joss Stone, Hanson). The album was initially supposed to be released in February 2006, but was pushed back several times.The delay was due to executive changes at Sony (the parent company of Columbia) and the executives' desire to have \"another lead single\" on the album. For the album, the Jonas Brothers covered two hit songs by UK band Busted - \"Year 3000\" and \"What I Go to School For\".\n\nThe Jonas Brothers' first single, \"Mandy\", was released on December 27, 2005. Its music video was shown on MTV's Total Request Live on February 22, 2006 and reached number four. Another song, \"Time for Me to Fly,\" was released on the Aquamarine soundtrack, also in February. In March, \"Mandy\" was featured in the Nickelodeon television film Zoey 101: Spring Break-Up and the Zoey 101: Music Mix soundtrack album, with Nicholas Jonas listed as the artist name. The group's music was also featured on Cartoon Network's Cartoon Cartoon Fridays.The band covered \"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\" from Pirates of the Caribbean for the DisneyMania 4 album, released on April 4, 2006. Over the summer of 2006, the Jonas Brothers went on tour with Aly & AJ. The Jonas Brothers also created the theme song for the second season of American Dragon Jake Long, airing from June 2006 to September 2007 on the Disney Channel.\n\nIt's About Time was finally released on August 8, 2006. According to the band's manager, it was only a \"limited release\" of 50,000 copies, so the album can be bid on auction sites like eBay for up to $200-$300 USD. Because Sony was not interested in further promoting the band, the Jonas Brothers then considered switching labels.\n\nOn October 3, 2006, Nick's 2004 solo single, \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer),\" was re-released on Joy to the World: The Ultimate Christmas Collection. Also in October, the Jonas Brothers covered \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" from The Little Mermaid. Along with a music video, the song was released on a two-disk special-edition release of The Little Mermaid soundtrack. The second single from It's About Time was \"Year 3000.\" The song became popular on Radio Disney, and the music video debuted on Disney Channel in January 2007.\n\nThe band was ultimately dropped by Columbia Records in early 2007.\n\nAfter shortly being without a label, the Jonas Brothers signed with Hollywood Records in February 2007. Around the same time, brothers began appearing in commercials for Baby Bottle Pops, singing the jingle. On March 24, two additional songs on two different albums were released: \"Kids of the Future\" from the Meet the Robinsons soundtrack (Based on Kim Wilde's \"Kids in America\"), and \"I Wanna Be like You\" from DisneyMania 5.\n\nTheir self-titled second album, Jonas Brothers, was released on August 7, 2007. It reached number five on the Billboard Hot 200 chart in its first week.

For Tourist Company, the Vancouver-based musical duo of Taylor Swindells and Brenon Parry, they haven\u2019t let the uneasiness of their life choice hinder them in any way. In fact, they seem to have taken that tension and used it as creative tinder.\n\nWhen they met back in 2009, they knew the ease and openness of collaborating on music together they had was unique. Fast forward to 2013, when they decided to make it official, and formed Tourist Company. They released their debut record Apollo to critical acclaim in their home country and toured it relentlessly across Canada and the world, playing shows in the United States, Europe, and Mexico. Both also took a break from touring together and their own music to lend their talents to touring with other groups before finally coming back to their primary project. After so much time away, both Swindells and Parry felt ready to hole up in the studio and hone in on what their own music needed to say.\n\nOn Apollo, Tourist Company explored the parallels between their own lives and the vast mystery of outer-space. The music they made on their last album was far-reaching; cinematic and grandiose. This time around they\u2019re keeping both feet firmly planted on Earth, choosing instead to follow a more introspective route. Their new album is rooted in a creative experiment undertaken by Taylor. \u201cI was thinking about the way we process life in the 21st century. How we interact with tragedy and bad news. Those moments carry a sense of urgency and I wanted that to invade this record,\u201d he said. We often hear artists talk about fanciful escapes - buying property in a remote part of their country, or a sojourn into the wilderness. Taylor\u2019s escape was more restrained, yet his personal parameters he set out for himself yielded the escape he needed. \u201cWe had access to this heritage house in a historic neighbourhood with high vaulted ceilings and a grand piano in the front room. I brought all my equipment and set up a creative space with guitars, amps, synths and recording gear, all orbiting around the piano. I started working and stayed up for 72 hours straight, just writing.\u201d\n\nAs Taylor began what ended up becoming a 2 year writing process, the outside world seemed to volley between chaos and calm. A rise in nationalism, protests, the increasing presence of artificial intelligence, and natural disasters, all topped off with an overlying feeling of unease in a mounting arms race between two great nuclear nations. \u201cI had just planned a road trip down the West Coast of the United States and was reminiscing about my childhood fascination with volcanoes. They became an image of volatility and uncertainty and these songs took their form: an expression of what processing disaster feels like. \u201d\n\nTourist Company's new single \"Conflicted/Restricted\" will be available on all platforms on January 25th, 2019. A new record will follow later in the year with details to come soon.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Styx ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7923429.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tommy Shaw, James \u201cJY\u201d Young, Lawrence Gowan, Todd Sucherman and Ricky Phillips (along with the occasional surprise appearance by original bassist Chuck Panozzo), have performed more live since \u201999 than all of the previous years of its career combined. Two Super-Bowl appearances, Pollstar Box Office chart-topping tours with Def Leppard, Journey, Boston, REO Speedwagon, Bad Company (to name only a few), two more studio albums and no end in sight, STYX continues to conquer the planet, one venue at a time.\n\nSpawned from a suburban Chicago basement in the early \u201870s, Styx would eventually transform into the virtual arena rock prototype by the late '70s and early '80s, due to a fondness for big rockers and soaring power ballads.\n\nEarly on, Styx's music reflected such then-current prog rockers as Emerson, Lake & Palmer and the Moody Blues, as evidenced by such releases as 1972's self-titled debut, 1973's Styx II, 1974's The Serpent Is Rising, and 1975's Man of Miracles. While the albums (as well as non-stop touring) helped the group build a substantial following locally, Styx failed to break through to the mainstream, until a track originally from their second album, \"Lady\" started to get substantial airplay in late '74 on the Chicago radio station WLS-FM. The song was soon issued as a single nationwide, and quickly shot to number six on the singles chart, as Styx II was certified gold. By this time, however, the group had grown disenchanted with their record label, and opted to sign on with A&M for their fifth release overall, 1975's Equinox (their former label would issue countless compilations over the years, culled from tracks off their early releases). On the eve of the tour in support of the album, original guitarist John Curulewski abruptly left the band, and was replaced by Tommy Shaw. Shaw proved to be the missing piece of the puzzle for Styx, as most of their subsequent releases throughout the late '70s earned at least platinum certification (1976's Crystal Ball, 1977's The Grand Illusion, 1978's Pieces of Eight, and 1979's Cornerstone), and spawned such hit singles and classic rock radio standards as \"Come Sail Away,\" \"Renegade,\" \"Blue Collar Man\" and \"Fooling Yourself.\u201d\n\nThe band decided that their first release of the '80s would be a concept album, 1981's Paradise Theater, which was loosely based on the rise and fall of a once-beautiful theater (which was supposedly used as a metaphor for the state of the U.S. at the time -- the Iranian hostage situation, the Cold War, Reagan, etc.). Paradise Theater became Styx's biggest hit of their career (selling over three million copies in a three-year period), as they became one of the U.S. top rock acts due to such big hit singles as \"Too Much Time on My Hands\". It also marked the first time in history that a band released four consecutive triple-platinum albums.\n\nA career-encompassing live album, Caught in the Act, was issued in 1984, before Styx went on hiatus, and the majority of its members pursued solo projects throughout the remainder of the decade. A re-recording of their early hit, \"Lady\" (titled \"Lady\" '95\"), for a Greatest Hits compilation, finally united Shaw with his former Styx bandmates, which led to a full-on reunion tour in 1996. But drummer John Panozzo fell seriously ill at the time (due to a long struggle with alcoholism), which prevented him from joining the proceedings -- as he passed away in July of the same year. Although grief-stricken, Styx persevered with new drummer Todd Sucherman taking the place of Panozzo, as the Styx reunion tour became a surprise sold-out success, resulting in the release of a live album/video, 1997's \"Return to Paradise,\" while a whole new generation of rock fans were introduced to the grandiose sounds of Styx via a humorous car ad which used the track \"Mr. Roboto,\" as well as songs used in such TV shows as South Park and Freaks & Geeks.", "otherInfo": "Join us Saturday night at 8pm EST/5pm PST for STYX FIX LIVE SATURDAY on our official Youtube."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Old Crow Medicine Show ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9133823.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "American Roots Music", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Old Crow Medicine Show started busking on street corners in 1998 New York state and up through Canada, winning audiences along the way with their boundless energy and spirit.

He invited the band to play at his festival, MerleFest, helping to launch their career. Shortly thereafter the band was hired to entertain crowds between shows at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, TN.\n\nIt\u2019s been over twenty years since these humble beginnings. The band has gone on to receive the honor of being inducted as members of the Grand Ole Opry, and have won two Grammy Awards: \u201cBest Folk Album\u201d for Remedy (2014) and \u201cBest Long Form Music Video\u201d for Big Easy Express (2013).

They\u2019ve toured with artists such as Willie Nelson & Family, Brandi Carlile, Mumford & Sons, The Lumineers, John Prine, The Avett Brothers and others. The band also took part in the historic Railroad Revival Tour, traveling from California to New Orleans on a vintage train, which was captured in the Emmet Malloy directed Grammy award-winning documentary, Big Easy Express.\n\nOld Crow Medicine Show now has six studio albums to their name, three of which were released by Nettwerk Records \u2013 O.C.M.S. (2004) and Big Iron World (2006) produced by David Rawlings, and Tennessee Pusher (2008) produced by Don Was.

We have created much of our own sound by taking bits and pieces of every genre we love and smashed it together to make what is our sound today! We have been told we sound like a mash up of Lamb of God, Slayer ,Black Label Society, Slipknot and now even some Killswitch! Taking the heavier edge, we love and bringing back the mind numbing solos from the past. Nothing beats thunderous drums, heavy vocals, killer bass riffs and a screaming lead guitar!!!

We pride ourselves in being able to please every fan no matter what genre you are into we have something for you!!! So sit back relax and prepare for you mind to be melted!\n\nDead Reckoning\u2122 was formed by Mike K-OS Spriggs originally from Albuquerque NM, at the time an active duty soldier stationed at Fort Benning GA in the spring of 2012 with the goal to mix old and new metal elements to create something powerful, lasting and unique. He began to build a foundation from bands like Slayer, Lamb Of God, Children of Bodom, BLS, Pantera and many others to create what has become the Dead Reckoning\u2122 Sound. Ryan Lake has taken over on Drums to bring true clarity and power to the rhythm section with fast pummeling rolls and dynamic foot work. On Bass, Brian Silverstein is now holding down the low end with a bass finger style reminiscent of Iron Maiden and early Metallica with his killer sound. New vocalist Curt Esparza was once the bassist for us and found himself down a different path but once he heard we were looking for a new singer he quickly made his way back. Within days of tryouts he was signed to the band with a very unique sounding range of screams, growls and even cleans bringing us to a new level for upcoming albums.

It's the same kind of self-assurance the soft-spoken Rodgers displays on his second independently released EP, available January 19th. Produced by Mickey Jack Cones (Dustin Lynch, Joe Nichols) and Chris Farren, the five-song collection showcases him as both a talented writer and interpreter, merging the electrified rock he heard on the baseball diamond with the thoughtful lyricism of country. Well before he was singing for his supper, the Batesville, Mississippi native was an accomplished baseball player who was a scholarship athlete at Northwest Mississippi Community College. Raised in the midst of country's '90s commercial heyday \u2013 his first concert was Garth Brooks at the Pyramid in Memphis \u2013 Rodgers always had an inkling that he might end up living in Music City, he just didn't know how or when. \"I can remember in high school I would tell people \u2013 this was before I played guitar or anything \u2013 I would just be like, 'Yeah, I'm gonna move to Nashville one day,'\" he recalls. And so he did, departing Mississippi with one of his college buddies to see if he could make it in Music City. Through the countless open mic nights and lean years that inevitably followed, Rodgers was able to develop the songwriting voice that would eventually earn his first publishing deal with Combustion Music. \"I went into songwriting boot camp,\" he says. \"That's all I did. I hardly played any shows or anything. I just focused on writing.\" In the meantime, Rodgers scored his first cut on Florida Georgia Line's Dig Your Roots, with \"Wish You Were on It.\" He also released his self-titled EP, featuring the streaming hit \"Midnight Daydream.\" All that intense focus shows on his second self titled EP. Opening track \"Ain't Really Over\" depicts a man in the hangover stage of a rough breakup and trying to move on. Framed by surging, distorted electric guitars and Rodgers' bluesy howl, it sets the tone for his melody-rich, introspective style of songwriting. On \"Cold Case,\" Rodgers draws a line between himself and country's long tradition of clever wordplay. Bouncing off the title's suggestion of criminal investigations, he's popping tops and pining over a woman who's up and vanished from his life. His solution? Downing as many beers as he can handle. \"'Cold Case' was just one of those things \u2013 somebody started playing a guitar and one of us just spit it out,\" says Rodgers. \"It kind of fell out of thin air.\" Rodgers' clear sense of his artistic identity also shines through on the outside songs \"Like You've Been There Before\" and \"Some Girls.\" It's easy to envision Rodgers singing about a younger version of himself in \"Like You've Been There Before,\" a rebellious kid getting some sage advice from his father to play it cool whether he's knocking a fastball over the fences or cautiously taking his first trip around the bases with a young woman. He sings it with the easy confidence of a seasoned vet, or as he says in the chorus, \"like it ain't no thing.\" \"Some Girls,\" on the other hand, calls back to \"Ain't Really Over\" except this time he's ended things and she's not handling it well \u2013 talking behind his back and playing childish games on social media. \"Some girls make it easy on you,\" he sighs, \"and some girls never do.\" The female woes reach their apex in the Rodgers co-write \"Missing One,\" which flips the title phrase on its head. Initially it's a missing copy of the Eagles' Desperado that she took when she left, then a single smoke from a pack of cigarettes that she forced him to give up. But it turns out he's actually missing something else most of all. Rodgers wrote the tune with pals Smith Ahnquist and Hunter Phelps, taking months to get it right. \"We started it in January and we didn't finish it until May,\" he says. \"We knew it was gonna be a clever idea, but we had to get it right. It was a hard one, but a fun one.\" That dedication, coupled with Rodgers' finely-tuned ear for songs, makes him perfectly suited to lean forward into Nashville's ever-shifting winds while honoring his roots. \"I want to be known as the dude with good songs,\" he says. \"If a song gives you chill bumps or if it makes you cry or if it makes you happy, it's done its job.\" That may sound like a relatively humble mission for a performer with such promise, but hey, sometimes you just know.", "otherInfo": "Saturday Nights Live"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kim Prevost and Bill Solley Fan Page ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10378908.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Jazz Soul", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Kim Prevost and guitarist Bill Solley has been racing the high road to success since winning the 1999 \"BET on Jazz\" Jazz Discovery Award.

Hailing from Wyckoff, New Jersey, the band consists of three brothers: Kevin Jonas, Joe Jonas, and Nick Jonas. They have released three albums: It's About Time (2006), Jonas Brothers (2007), and A Little Bit Longer (2008).\n\nThe band started as a solo project of Nick Jonas. When Nick was six years old, he was discovered while singing at a salon and was referred to a professional show business manager. At the age of 7, Nicholas began performing on Broadway. He has acted in several plays, including A Christmas Carol (in 2000 as Tiny Tim and Scrooge at eight), Annie Get Your Gun (in 2001 as Little Jake), Beauty and the Beast (in 2002 as Chip), and Les Mis\u00e9rables (in 2003 as Gavroche). After Les Mis\u00e9rables closed, he performed in The Sound of Music (as Kurt) at the Paper Mill Playhouse.\n\nIn 2002 while performing in Beauty and the Beast, Nick wrote a song with his father called \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)\". With background vocals from the Beauty and the Beast cast, Nick performed the song on the 2002 annual Broadway \"Equity Fights AIDS\" album, Broadway's Greatest Gifts: Carols for a Cure, Vol. 4. In November 2003, INO Records received a demo copy of \"Joy To The World (A Christmas Prayer)\". The label released the song to Christian radio, where it quickly became popular on Record & Radio's Christian Adult Contemporary Chart. While Nick was working on his solo project, Joe followed in his footsteps to Broadway, appearing in Baz Lurhmann's production of La Boheme.\n\nBy September 2004, an executive at Columbia Records found out about Nick's song. Nick was soon jointly signed to INO Records and Columbia Records and released the single \"Dear God\". A second single, a new solo recording of \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)\", was released on November 16. It was supposed to be followed by a December release of a self-titled solo album Nicholas Jonas, but the album had been pushed back; it did, however, get a limited release. Nick, along with Kevin and Joe, had written several other songs for the album.\n\nIn early 2005, Columbia Records' new president, Steve Greenberg, listened to Nick's record. While Greenberg did not like the album, he did like Nick's voice. After meeting with Nick and hearing the song, \"Please Be Mine,\" written and performed by the brothers, Daylight Columbia Records decided to sign the three as a group act.\n\nAfter being signed to Columbia, the brothers considered naming their group \"Sons of Jonas\" before settling on the name \"Jonas Brothers.\"\n\nThroughout 2005, the Jonas Brothers went on several tours, including being the opening act of Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, the Backstreet Boys, and The Click Five.They spent the latter portion of the year on an anti-drug tour with Aly & AJ and The Cheetah Girls. Additionally, they opened for The Veronicas in early 2006.\n\nFor the album, titled It's About Time, the band collaborated with several writers, including Adam Schlesinger (Fountains of Wayne), Michael Mangini (Joss Stone), Desmond Child (Aerosmith, Bon Jovi), Billy Mann (Destiny's Child, Jessica Simpson) and Steve Greenberg (Joss Stone, Hanson). The album was initially supposed to be released in February 2006, but was pushed back several times.The delay was due to executive changes at Sony (the parent company of Columbia) and the executives' desire to have \"another lead single\" on the album. For the album, the Jonas Brothers covered two hit songs by UK band Busted - \"Year 3000\" and \"What I Go to School For\".\n\nThe Jonas Brothers' first single, \"Mandy\", was released on December 27, 2005. Its music video was shown on MTV's Total Request Live on February 22, 2006 and reached number four. Another song, \"Time for Me to Fly,\" was released on the Aquamarine soundtrack, also in February. In March, \"Mandy\" was featured in the Nickelodeon television film Zoey 101: Spring Break-Up and the Zoey 101: Music Mix soundtrack album, with Nicholas Jonas listed as the artist name. The group's music was also featured on Cartoon Network's Cartoon Cartoon Fridays.The band covered \"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\" from Pirates of the Caribbean for the DisneyMania 4 album, released on April 4, 2006. Over the summer of 2006, the Jonas Brothers went on tour with Aly & AJ. The Jonas Brothers also created the theme song for the second season of American Dragon Jake Long, airing from June 2006 to September 2007 on the Disney Channel.\n\nIt's About Time was finally released on August 8, 2006. According to the band's manager, it was only a \"limited release\" of 50,000 copies, so the album can be bid on auction sites like eBay for up to $200-$300 USD. Because Sony was not interested in further promoting the band, the Jonas Brothers then considered switching labels.\n\nOn October 3, 2006, Nick's 2004 solo single, \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer),\" was re-released on Joy to the World: The Ultimate Christmas Collection. Also in October, the Jonas Brothers covered \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" from The Little Mermaid. Along with a music video, the song was released on a two-disk special-edition release of The Little Mermaid soundtrack. The second single from It's About Time was \"Year 3000.\" The song became popular on Radio Disney, and the music video debuted on Disney Channel in January 2007.\n\nThe band was ultimately dropped by Columbia Records in early 2007.\n\nAfter shortly being without a label, the Jonas Brothers signed with Hollywood Records in February 2007. Around the same time, brothers began appearing in commercials for Baby Bottle Pops, singing the jingle. On March 24, two additional songs on two different albums were released: \"Kids of the Future\" from the Meet the Robinsons soundtrack (Based on Kim Wilde's \"Kids in America\"), and \"I Wanna Be like You\" from DisneyMania 5.\n\nTheir self-titled second album, Jonas Brothers, was released on August 7, 2007. It reached number five on the Billboard Hot 200 chart in its first week. Two singles with music videos were also released around this time - \"Hold On\" two weeks before, and \"S.O.S.\" just after the release of the album.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers' third studio album, A Little Bit Longer, was released in the United States on August 12, 2008 with CDVU+ technology, just like their last album, Jonas Brothers. On June 24, 2008, iTunes announced that it would be releasing four songs from A Little Bit Longer, one roughly every two weeks. The purchase of each of the songs will go toward the price of the entire album, and one will be able to buy it using the Complete the Album feature after the album is released. Each song will also feature a new podcast episode from the boys. The schedule: June 24, 2008 for \"Burnin' Up\"; July 15, 2008 for \"Pushin' Me Away\"; July 29, 2008 for \"Tonight\"; and August 5, 2008 for \"A Little Bit Longer.\" Now that all of the singles have been released, all of them have occupied the number 1 spot on iTunes for at least 3 days.\n\nThe band filmed a Disney Channel Original Movie called Camp Rock where they play a band called \"Connect Three.\" Joe plays the lead male role and lead singer \"Shane Gray\"; Nick plays the role of \"Nate,\" a guitarist; and Kevin plays the role of \"Jason,\" also a guitarist. A soundtrack for the movie was released on June 17, 2008. It debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 with 188,000 copies sold in its first week.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers made history being the first group ever to sell more than 100,000 digital downloads for three consecutive singles: \"Burnin' Up\", 183,000+ first week sales, \"Play My Music\", 109,000+ sales, and \"Pushin' Me Away\", 116,000+ sales. In addition, \"Burnin' Up\", \"Pushin' Me Away\", and \"Tonight\" all charted as #1 on the iTunes \"Top Songs\" Chart for several days, pushing off Katy Perry's \"I Kissed a Girl\", which had been charting for weeks on #1 already.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ketch Secor ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Hartland Hootenanny: Episode 6 Livestream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFkilHpEZnE"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Thunderstruck: America's AC/DC Tribute ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9087186.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Kevin Feller - Rhythm Guitar, Jerry Lawson - Drums, Chris Jones - Bass Guitar, Corey Baetz - Lead Guitar, Dave Moody - Vocals", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Thunderstruck:America's AC/DC recreates the spirit and energy of a live AC/DC show the way you remember it.", "otherInfo": "Live stream show featuring the entire Back in Black album!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jess Meuse ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8963344.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Alternative, Guitar And Voice, Acoustic, Songwriter, Writer, American Country Music, Americana, Country Music, Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Current Highlights:\n\n\u2022 Jessica Meuse - Over 7 million streams of songs on her \"Halfhearted\" album | iTunes Top 10 Country Album\n\n\u2022 \"Love Her Better\" Music Video Receives Seven Film Festival Awards:\n- 2019 San Antonio Film Festival (Official Selection)\n- 2019 WorldFest Houston Film Festival (REMI Winner/Official Selection)\n- 2019 New Hope Film Festival (Official Selection)\n- 2019 Eurovision Palermo Film Festival (Official Selection)\n- 2018 Nevada International Film Festival (Platinum Reel Award Winner)\n- 2018 Laughlin International Film Festival (Official Selection)\n- 2018 Great Lakes International Film Festival (Official Selection)\n\nAbout Jessica Meuse:\n\nJessica Meuse is an American performer from Slapout, Alabama.

It\u2019s a journey that has seen the country-rocker tour with superstars like Taylor Swift and Alan Jackson, play to over 50,000 people in Nashville at the world\u2019s biggest country music festival and build a large, devoted following as he\u2019s played the length and breadth of his native land and across the USA. Morgan has made his mark on the Australian musical landscape with a sound that fused contemporary country with melodic rock, fueled by a unique passion and energy all Morgan\u2019s own. His music is driven by an optimism shaped by life\u2019s bumpy journey, a faith in the power of love and hard work to overcome the obstacles we all face every day. Growing up in the working class beach city of Newcastle in NSW, Morgan turned the blue-collar ethic of his neighborhood into a relentless drive for energy and connection in his live shows. After seeing him whip a festival crowd into a frenzy, Warner Music Australia offered Morgan a recording contract. In 2013, after releasing two hit EPs that yielded three #1 singles, Morgan was named New Oz Artist of the Year at the CMC Music Awards. The fan voted award solidified his status as the hottest young performer in Australian country and was followed by four more trophies over the next two years, including back-to-back Male Oz Artist of the Year awards. Soon Morgan returned to Nashville to record his debut album with an all-star group of A-list musicians and Nashville based Aussie ex-pat producer Jedd Hughes. \u201cTo hear guys who played on the songs that inspired me to become a musician, playing on my songs, blew my mind,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cIt reminded me of why I was doing this in the first place and pushed me to take my vocals and guitar playing on the album to the next level\u201d. The songs that make up Morgan Evans are the result of a relentless songwriting schedule for almost a year that took Morgan to Nashville and back, and saw him tap into the deepest parts of himself. Morgan wrote eleven of the twelve tracks - some by himself, some with local artists and many with A-list Nashville writers. The album, released in March 2014, immediately shot to #1 on the iTunes and ARIA Country Album Charts and debuted at #20 on the ARIA Mainstream Album Chart. The impact of the acclaimed album has been immense \u2013 3 #1 singles (One Eye for an Eye, Best I Never Had and record-equaling Like A Tornado) and his first APRA nominations just for starters. The release also garnered international attention, leading to an invitation to return to Nashville\u2019s massive CMA Music Festival and perform at the legendary Grand Ole Opry, which prompted William Morris Endeavor \u2013 the world\u2019s largest talent agency \u2013 to sign Morgan up for international representation. Morgan\u2019s charisma and talent for engaging audiences led to his signing as the face of Foxtel\u2019s Country Music Channel, which has already seen him nominated for an ASTRA Award and a TV Week Logie Award \u2013 a first for an Australian country music star. He hosts television coverage of the CMC Rocks music festival, artist interviews and the CMC Music Awards. He was joined in 2016 by international co-host Kelsea Ballerini for the live national broadcast. A major career milestone was capped off when Morgan received a message from Grammy-winners Lady Antebellum informing him that he\u2019d been awarded the prestigious 2015 CMA Global Artist Award. The award recognizes outstanding achievement by an international country star in furthering the popularity of country music in their home country. Morgan joins an exceptional list of previous winners including Tommy Emmanuel, Kasey Chambers and Lee Kernaghan. Since then, Morgan has his sights set once again on Nashville, relocating to Music City where he has been writing with the A-list of songwriters for his upcoming US debut release and recently made return performances to CMA Music Fest and the Grand Ole Opry. His growing fanbase in both Australia and the USA is eagerly awaiting new music from Morgan, expected to be released later this year. http://www.morganevansmusic.com \"Kiss Somebody\" Out Now: https://wmna.sh/me_kisssomebod Twitter: @Morgan_Evans Instagram: @morganevansmusic Snapchat: themorganevans", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.circleplus.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Wallace Field ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9276491.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Indie Folk, Acoustic, Folk Rock, Indie, Folk, Indie Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The emerging solo output of Chelsie Field (of the new Western Mass. folk trio Ona Canoa), Wallace Field\u2019s \u201cquarter-life-crisis folk\u201d is deeply personal and yet easily relatable with its emotional vulnerability and heartbreaking honesty.

He began by forcing his friends to watch him perform to records of his dad\u2019s band, Four Saints. Later on, Stephen learned to play the trumpet in various school bands, singing in the choir, and performing in musicals.\n\nInspired by his brother, Scot Evans, and his regional success in the band, Floating Men, Stephen started his own rock band, Mean Season, in the late 80\u2019s where he began honing his songwriting skills on the guitar. After a few years of local success and radio play in Tallahassee, FL, his band moved to Atlanta, GA to try and develop into something bigger. Unfortunately, the band broke up and left Stephen to try his hand at performing solo around Atlanta.\n\nSoon the jammed highways of the big city drove him to the beautiful mountain town of Asheville, NC in 1996, where he quickly began soaking in the creative influence of his amazing surroundings. After many years of vacillating between being a professional musician and being building a nest in Asheville, Stephen is finally focused on his love for creating and performing music.\n\nIn June of 2015, Stephen recruited the True Grits and released the debut CD, \u201cSomething to Bleed\u201d. The True Grits are Brian Shoemaker - bass/lead guitar, Sam Hess - drums, and Woodstock - mandolin, along with special guests Halli Anderson of River Whyless (violin/backing vocals), his brother, Scot Evans of Floating Men (bass on \u20181000 Roses), and his mother, Barbara Evans (backing vocals on \u2018Sound\u2019).\n\n2017 marks the second release of Under the Bridge by Stephen Evans & the True Grits. This EP has 5 songs that range from rock to folk rock and describe an appreciation of Stephen's time in Asheville. Shawn Duxbury, Stephen's former bandmate in Mean Season, is a guest Grit performing lead acoustic guitar on the song 'Waiting'. The last track, 'A Rose for Emily', is a cover song written by Jeff Holmes & the Floating Men, and is based on the short story by William Faulkner of the same name.", "otherInfo": "Stephen Evans will be playing LIVE on Facebook on Saturday at 8pm EST facebook.com/stephenevansmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kendall Street Company ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10352891.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Jam Bands, Jam Rock, Rock, Ska, Bluegrass, Psychedelic Rock, Indie, Funk, Alternative, Psychedelic & Stuff., Jam", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "From late night jam sessions at the University of Virginia to main stages at venues and festivals throughout the country, Kendall Street Company has broken the mold of improvised rock and enters a world of jazz-grass infused psychedelic bliss. With no two shows ever the same, word of mouth has quickly grown a ravenous fanbase eager to hear their favorite studio tracks explored and extended as part of a live community. As seasoned KSC fans can tell you, any one of their songs could easily turn from a fun sing-along, into a cacophonous headbanging garage-rock soundscape, to a Klezmer-disco dance party, and then resolve into a peaceful ambient meditation that evokes the nostalgia of your childhood.\n\nAveraging over 100 shows per year since 2013, the band is currently comprised of Louis Smith [Acoustic guitar, vocals], Brian Roy [Bass, vocals], Ryan Wood [Drums], Ben Laderberg [Electric guitar], and Jake Vanaman [Saxophone]. For such a young band, their accomplishments are sincere. Kendall Street has performed at festivals such as Lockn\u2019, Roosterwalk, Floydfest, Resonance, and Domefest and has opened for acts such as Papadosio, Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Tauk, and Leftover Salmon. All the while, the band has proudly released three records and two EPs. Their most recent 2019 release, \u201cLunar Dude\u201d showcases their versatility and virtuosity, and was met with overwhelming support.\n\n2020 is building up to be the biggest year yet for the band. Along with two (or perhaps three) new records on the horizon, their upcoming Winter/Spring tour will take them all across the country in Woody Guthrie fashion. From Louisiana to Texas, Colorado to Wisconsin, Ohio to Boston, New York City and more, the band has no intent of slowing down any time soon.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee. Bandmembers from both Umphrey's and Bisco have further more found each other in The Brain Damaged Eggmen, a Pink Floyd and The Beatles coverband\n\n\nDiscography\n\n* Encephalous Crime (self-released, 1996)\n* Uncivilized Area (1998)\n* Bisco Lives (2000)\n* They Missed the Perfume (2001)\n* Se\u00f1or Boombox (2002)\n* TranceFusion Radio Broadcast Vol. 1-4 (2003)\n* Wind at Four to Fly (2006)\n* Rocket 3 (2007)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Madison Malone Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9329696.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Alternative, Pop, Electro Pop", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Madison Malone is stepping out of her artistic shell to release songs that use the light to recognize the dark. Her new music is the beauty created beneath the destruction.\n\nRaised in a small town in south-central Wisconsin, Madison was an anomaly in her little city. She started sneaking into rural dive bars at the age of 15 to play cover music for patrons until 2 am, paid only in pizza & tips. She spent the next seven years building a following in the Midwest, gigging in restaurants, around the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus, clubs, bars, banquet halls, four to six times a week just to pay the bills & get her voice heard.\n\nAfter seven years of performing other people\u2019s music, Madison felt inclined to evolve and write about her own troubadour experiences. To pursue this neon journey of self-discovery, Madison moved to Los Angeles in late 2016. When Madison first arrived in Los Angeles, she began writing songs for artists at Sony Music, creating music for commercials at Barking Owl in Santa Monica, and landing featuring slots on high-profile artists' tracks (Anthony Federov [American Idol], Leonell Cassio, Raye Zaragoza, APZE, Mic Kellogg). She also began making a name for herself as a songwriter at the world famous, Hotel Caf\u00e9, after selling out both stages and opening for artists like Kaleo, Wrabel, Rozzi Crane, Vincint, Lucy Rose Parton, Ari Herstand, & Tall Heights. Through all of these experiences, Madison was developing her personal artistry.\n\nCurrently, Madison is in the studio working on a new EP. It is produced by Justin Glasco (Ron Pope, Christina Perri, The Lone Bellow), mixed by Bryan Cook (U2, OneRepublic, Radiohead, Delta Rae) and mastered by Grammy-award winning, Hans DeKline (U2, Diplo, Pixies).\n\nMadison Malone has written for artists at Sony Music, Warner and more as well as performed at some of the world's largest music festivals including SXSW and SUMMERFEST, where she was voted \u2018Favorite Emerging Artist\u2019. The singer-songwriter performs across the country selling out high-profile venues in cities including Los Angeles, and New York City. She also recently headlined a European tour expanding her fan base world wide. Madison Malone is continuing the next chapter of her musical endeavor with her feet planted and her voice directed toward connecting us all. \u2018Quiet Down 2\u2019 & music video are due for release summer 2019.\n\nMadison Malone intends for her music to be the saving grace in times of distress.

Randomly. He can\u2019t really tell you why. Maybe it\u2019s that \u201cno-fear-of-the-edge\u201d mentality that hooks the non-country-lovin\u2019 folk while he manages to maintain a balance of traditional vibes that will remind you of a modern day John Wayne. He's a 6\u20194\u201d bass-baritone powerhouse who once hit 200 million television sets worldwide as a contestant on \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d With each performance he fights to create something electric, something that grabs you and makes you look up. Maybe that\u2019s it. Maybe that\u2019s why some people don\u2019t like country and yet... they like him.\nThe most common question a singer will be asked is, \u201cWhen did you start singing?\u201d Buckstein has always had the same answer: \u201cWhen I found out that the chicks dig it.\u201d Sounds like a punchline but it\u2019s actually the truth.\nHe was 13, at summer camp, trying to figure out how to meet girls like everyone else. A couple of girls were singing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d and he shyly scooted up next to them and started singing along. \u201cWhen they found out I could sing they immediately introduced me to all the other girls in the camp,\u201d he grins. \u201cI\u2019ve been singing ever since.\u201d\nHis love of country music is thanks to his father who played it all the time when he was young even though he hated the genre. \u201cIt takes one good country song to hook ya!\u201d Buckstein warns. \u201cMine was probably \u2018Thunder Rolls\u2019 by Garth Brooks or \u2018This Ain\u2019t No Thinking Thing\u2019 by Trace Adkins. I heard those tunes when I was about 11 or 12 and something just clicked\u2014I was hooked.\u201d\nHe continued to grow up a country boy at heart often retreating to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. However, since he always lived in the city, the rest of his musical tastes fall outside of the expected box, running a gamut that includes blues, rock, rap, classics from the \u201950s, and whatever was on Top 40 radio at any given time.\nBuckstein studied theater in college, earning his BA from California State University, Fullerton. Prior to \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d he had moved to LA to pursue a career as an actor. \u201cBig surprise, it wasn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d he confides. \u201cOne day a few friends of mine went to the \u2018American Idol\u2019 auditions, which was the hottest show on TV at the time. They wanted some company so I went along. I got through and they didn\u2019t. It was Idol that set me on a different path.\u201d After appearing on the finale of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d in Season 5, he returned to Denver with music on the brain.\nHe started singing with whomever would back him up, growing along the way, learning his craft, year after year, little by little, making friends, music, mistakes, and big moves, all leading him to today. \u201cThose years were invaluable,\u201d he says. \u201cThey call it \u2018paying your dues.\u2019 It always sounded like a bad thing. But I found out paying your dues can be some of the most fun you\u2019ll ever have.\u201d\n\nOver the past few years Buckstein has traveled all over Colorado and the Midwest region performing for soon-to-be-lifelong fans. He admits to laughing to himself when other performers come to Colorado and complain about how hard it is to sing at such a high altitude. Buckstein, being a true native of the 5280 state, has never had a problem.\n\nWith the help of his band, \u201cThe Heard\u201d (his rotating roster of professionals), he has rocked crowds opening for Charlie Daniels, Dustin Lynch, Old Dominion, Eli Young, John Michael Montgomery, Mark Chesnutt, Vanilla Ice, and many, many others. He\u2019s gained local fame as a regular guest star on Denver\u2019s hottest country station 98.5 KYGO and also as the writer and performer of \u201cThe Grizzly Rose,\u201d which is a popular song about the famous Denver nightclub, and he produced a music video for the track. Buckstein wrote the song about his personal experiences after his first week playing at the legendary venue.\n\nHe began, as most do, singing covers of all of the artists he was most influenced by. Buckstein embraces covers and thinks that no matter what, \u201cthere should always be room in your set to pay homage to the artists and songs that have touched your life. Even when you\u2019re selling out arenas with your own stuff you can do that. I have a saying: \u2018Today we play the songs that others have written\u2026 so that someday we may play the songs that we have written\u2026 so that someday others may play the songs that we have written.\u2019 You gotta put those pauses in there for dramatic effect,\u201d he laughs.\n\nBuckstein is currently embarking on his next chapter with his newest EP, Country Side. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of heart in these five tunes,\u201d Buckstein says. \u201cMaking them has been a very valuable experience. It has shown me not only where I am but where I want to go from here.\u201d\n\nBuckstein\u2019s goal is to bring soul to everything he does. \u201cWhat people seem to respond most to in my live performances is my passion, so I worked hard to bring that passion to the record. My sound gets compared a lot to the great bass-baritones of my time: Trace Adkins, Toby Keith, Josh Turner, and Chris Young. But I personally hate comparisons. I don\u2019t think Josh Turner wants to hear he sounds like Don Williams,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI just wanna sound like me. If my sound were a drink, I'd like to think it would come in a bottle with a cork instead of a twist cap. And I'd like to say it's got a crisp bite with a smooth finish.\u201d\n\nHe gives all the thanks in the world to his fans and his crew: \u201cWithout the people who support me, on stage and off, this would all be for nothing. I try to always surround myself with good people who want to make good music for other good people.\u201d\n\nAnd if you\u2019re still wondering, it\u2019s pronounced \u201cBuck-steen.\u201d\n\nwww.bucksteinmusic.com", "otherInfo": "It\u2019s that tiiiiiiiime again.

In the immediate aftermath of the birth of his first child, before he\u2019d found his footing in this extraordinary new reality, a jarring incident left him contemplating his own mortality. After completely scrapping early recording sessions for the upcoming album Bone Structure, Pope set out on a new path, crafting incredibly candid songs directed squarely at his newborn daughter. Some songs speak to her directly and muse on the experience of fatherhood, while others reflect on a personal experience that has a lesson or a moral. Pope's 2017 release, the critically-claimed \"Work\" drew comparisons to Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen, while also refusing to put him squarely into one category. Uncompromising and relentless, Pope has evolved into one of the top grossing independent acts in the business while garnering a legion of devoted fans the world over. Taking the industry-road-less-traveled and holding fiercely to his independence has proven fruitful for Pope; to date, he has sold out shows on three continents and in more than 20 countries, sold over 2 million digital tracks, had over 350 million streams on Spotify, 825 million plays on Pandora, 150 million views on Youtube, and has more generally crushed every metric used to measure what is possible for independent artists.", "otherInfo": "Join Ron for another addition of LIVE! and In Sweatpants this Saturday at 8:30 EDT on Facebook and Instagram!\n\nIn this weeks addition, we'll have a special poll during the show asking fans which album Ron should focus on for next week's sweatpants social.\n\nThe show is free, but if you'd like to \"buy a ticket\" use the below options:\nMerch: http://ronpopemusic.com/shop\nVenmo: @Ron-Pope-Music\nPayPal.me/RonPopeMusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Whethan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9893355.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "12:40 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/insomniac"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Greg Sover Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8627650.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Blues-rock, Rock, Blues", "Time": "12:55 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Indie blues, singer-songwriter, guitarist - Greg Sover continues to impress along with his bandmates; bassist Garry Lee, guitarist Allen James and drummer Tom Walling.\n\nThe release of the band's debut album, Songs of a Renegade & sophomore follow up, Jubilee, continue to garner praise as the records have successfully charted on Roots Top 50 Blues Rock stations.

Throughout the course of a show he's known to croon an audience with acoustic guitar ballads, play a few shredding slide guitar solos and even sit down at the keys to show off his surprising boogie-woogie piano chops.\n\nSydow draws comparisons to voices like Paul Simon and Jackson Browne, mixed with a roots rock vibe reminiscent of Tom Petty or Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats. He is a serious songwriter, though occasionally uses satire to get his point across.\n\nSydow's newest release, Wicked Dreams is a three song EP, lyrically centered around the idea of fulfillment in all aspects of life. Musically it features a horn section and extended guitar solos. The lead off track, \"Still My Girl\" tells a relatable story of finding a significant others flaws and imperfections to be what you love most about them. The title track is the story of a troubadour who travels around working odd jobs and various 9-5's in an attempt to follow societal norms. \"Feel Like Gold\" is a polite jab at today's society. \"If we stick to hate, then all that's left to do is wait and see.\"\n\nAndy says about his new EP, \"Perhaps for the first time in my life I do feel a sense of fulfillment. Life is good. I've met the right lady, I go for long runs in the morning, I'm constantly inspired by my job. I enjoy myself. What gives me wicked dreams is not achieving my career goals. When I was 17, I promised myself that by 30 I'd be headlining 500 cap rooms and playing stages like the Telluride Blues & Brews Festival and eTown. Perhaps my goals were ignorant statements at the time, but I'm 28 (quickly approaching 29) and I'm nowhere near where I want to be. Yes, I'm thankful for what I have! Yes, I'm happy! But there's a lot of work to do. I'm far from satisfied.\"\n\nAndy has had the opportunity to open up for artists such as: Chase Rice, Koe Wetzel, Dick Dale, Brett Dennen, Anders Osborne, Tab Benoit, Shane Smith & The Saints, Delbert McClinton, Samantha Fish, and Chuck Prophet.

Hannah always knew she wanted to be an entertainer, but it wasn't until she was ten years old that she made her debut solo performance at her fourth grade Christmas Recital. She sang \"Tender Tennessee Christmas\". After that she was hooked. She focused on nothing else. At fourteen she picked up a Squire acoustic guitar that her younger sister had abandoned and quickly began learning to write. Over the next four years she performed at fairs, coffee houses, shopping malls and talent shows throughout the Upper Midwest. At eighteen Hannah moved to Nashville, TN to make her dreams a reality. She attended Belmont University in Nashville to study the business of music and vocal performance. After two years she decided to leave Belmont and delve deeper into the art of song writing. She also began performing her own material in and around Nashville. In 2010 Hannah released her first EP, a self produced project called, \"No Stopping, Standing, Parking\". It received rave reviews from the Nashville songwriting community. Soon after it's release, she was personally selected to attend the prestigious Horse & Writer Songwriting Invitational by one of Nashville's most successful songwriters, Skip Ewing. Hannah was a contestant on the 2011 season of the reality television show, \"The X Factor USA\". Her goal was to show America her unique version of country music. The results were evident when her fan base exploded and has continued to grow ever since. Hannah returned to Nashville to continue performing and writing. Her hard work paid off when she secured four song cuts on the debut album of country artist, Rachele Lynae, on Momentum Label Group. Hannah's newest project, \"The Freedom EP\", was released on Thanksgiving Day 2012. Her current single from the project, \"No Where Left to Roam\" has been sent to Country, Americana, College and Internet radio around the world and is receiving an enthusiastic response. \"The Freedom EP\" includes five original tracks and is available now on all major online stores including iTunes and Amazon, as well as her website.

Marsden combines influences of Neil Young, John Frusciante, Alice in Chains, and Pink Floyd to create his own take on 90\u2019s era acoustic guitar based grunge rock. Marsden first garnered attention in 2016 as one of the top 3 finalists in 105.5 Triple M\u2019s Project M Singer Songwriter Competition with his intricate guitar playing, powerful vocals, and passionate performances. Over the next year, Marsden took this momentum and successfully crowd-funded his debut outer space concept album, \u201cGravity\u201d.\n\nDescribed as \u201ca beautifully dark adventure away from earth\u201d, the creative process of \u201cGravity\u201d was carefully thought out and executed. Marsden\u2019s goal was to use guitar tones, song moods, selective vocabulary, and emotional delivery in the new spacey acoustic rock songs he was writing to tell a story arc of an adventure through the stars. J. Marsden managed to crowd-fund over $3000 to help pay for the necessary production costs to do justice to his vision of Gravity. Marsden, a professional audio engineer for over 10 years, did much of the recording and producing himself but chose to hire talented mix and master engineers to take \u201cGravity\u201d to a higher level than he could on his own. \u201cGravity\u201d was released in August 2017 with an excellent reception to its concept. Mike Huberty of Maximum Ink writes, \u201cPlenty of technical skill, a great sense of melody, and most importantly a surplus of heart\u2026 Listening to the whole thing in a sitting, there\u2019s no question that Marsden\u2019s Gravity is a clear statement of mood and genre.\u201d Rick Tvedt of Local Sounds typed, \u201cMarsden\u2019s music is for the thoughtful listener, has an artistic integrity, and is expertly crafted, exploring existential topics that are laced with love, loss, and uncertainty.\u201d\n\nWanting to have a platform to meet and showcase local solo artists, J. Marsden has hosted quarterly singer songwriter nights at The Frequency. He\u2019s also been an active participant in the local singer songwriter circle events where he enjoys the intimate attentive atmosphere and the camaraderie between writers. Marsden believes that music is meant to connect people to one another and to themselves, and he strives to use his own (sometimes very personal) experiences to tell stories that the listener can truly connect with on their own level.\n\nLong before his solo career J. Marsden had many diverse musical experiences, playing a variety of genres in multiple bands and one-off acts. Oldies and 90\u2019s pop radio primed Marsden\u2019s interest in music at age 6. However playing the trumpet in the 5th grade was the first time he fell in love with being a musician, and he became thoroughly involved in anything band related. At the beginning of his teenage years, Marsden picked up playing the guitar and started his first garage band, Blue Furnace. Their strange classic rock/jam/n\u00fc metal sound morphed into a funk metal band called Wall Of Funk where Marsden first got excited about band management and the music business. Over the next six years, he carried the band through one hunderd live shows, a full length album and an EP, seven Christmas songs, and tribute shows as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Deftones. During this time, J. Marsden also established himself in the local music scene by joining the popular party punk/ska band, 4 Aspirin Morning, and playing in several pop-up custom cover set wedding bands and an Offspring tribute band.\n\nJ. Marsden is currently performing throughout the Midwest in support of \u201cGravity\u201d and is writing material for his next acoustic rock adventure. He is always stashing song ideas in his back pocket and plans on also diving into new genres with ideas ranging from progressive metal to ambient relaxation music. Original and cover song videos are also on the horizon as well as a small west coast tour this summer. Marsden is available for booking private events, festivals, listening rooms, weddings, and guitar or songwriting clinics and lessons.", "otherInfo": "Join J.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town.

The \"Martini Jazz\" night brought some notoriety to Jask, which eventually led him to assist in the promotions of \"Groove Collective's (NYC) first ever performance in the Tampa area. In December of 1995, Jask started Tampa's first weekly soulful underground house night called, \"Jacks House\".

Alegre, apasionado y persistente se erige en la escena musical internacional como uno de los DJ\u2019s m\u00e1s afamados y el \u00fanico latino en formar parte del Sal\u00f3n de la Fama.\n\nEsta por celebrar sus 35 a\u00f1os de carrera ininterrumpida, y hasta el momento cuenta con un acervo de m\u00e1s de 26 mil discos compactos \u2013al que se suman continuamente nuevas adquisiciones-. Como DJ se autodenomina ecl\u00e9ctico, porque puede programar distintos estilos musicales a lo largo de varias horas, todo en honor de la diversi\u00f3n, sea para una boda de ensue\u00f1o como la de Seal con Heidi Klum o bien para una quincea\u00f1era tapat\u00eda.\n\nEn la ciudad es conocido como el fundador de Organizaci\u00f3n Zeppelin, lo que muy pocos saben es que C\u00e9sar es el fundador y \u00fanico miembro activo de la compa\u00f1\u00eda desde sus inicios; le puso el nombre dado que es un gran fan de la agrupaci\u00f3n inglesa Led Zeppelin, lo cual se comprueba al internarse en su oficina en la colonia Monraz, un espacio que habla de la trayectoria de C\u00e9sar Cos\u00edo, de su paso por las diferentes d\u00e9cadas en cualquier sentido que a esto se refiera.\n\nDe las paredes penden reconocimientos oficiales de la localidad y otros m\u00e1s que han cruzado diferentes oc\u00e9anos y fronteras internacionales para llegar a ser parte de esos muros, como una peque\u00f1a oda al ego, m\u00e1s no por ello deja de ser un tapat\u00edo m\u00e1s: pero m\u00e1s que tapat\u00edo, exitoso y mundialmente reconocido.\n\nCos\u00edo es de los pocos que han roto el paradigma y es profeta en su tierra, en el mundo de las fiestas es el rey, cualquiera que haya ido a una podr\u00e1 decir que Zeppelin es sello de garant\u00eda. La clave de su \u00e9xito o el secreto de C\u00e9sar para triunfar dice: \u201cEs que le gustan las fiestas, por una \u00e9l viaja miles de kil\u00f3metros, espera horas su turno y aguanta que le pidan 16 veces la misma canci\u00f3n cuando se trata de complacer a la quincea\u00f1era\u201d, dice hablando en tercera persona.\n\nLo que no sale a plena luz (al menos no en la localidad) es que C\u00e9sar Cos\u00edo es m\u00e1s que Organizaci\u00f3n Zeppelin, ahora su nombre pesa, m\u00e1s en el extranjero, este a\u00f1o conquist\u00f3 Rusia y La Rep\u00fablica Checa. Tokio, en Asia y Per\u00fa en Sudam\u00e9rica, mientras que Estados Unidos de costa a costa es el destino en donde m\u00e1s trabajo tiene y sobre en todo en Las Vegas, pero el pr\u00f3ximo 2 de julio se va a Nueva York, el a\u00f1o pasado fue invitado a formar parte de los Embajadores de la Marca Japonesa Pioneer DJ\n\nEl \u00e9xito de C\u00e9sar se debe principalmente a dos cosas, una a su formaci\u00f3n musical desde la infancia y la otra a su excelente memoria, lo que lo hace \u00fanico es lo detallista que puede llegar a ser, pues le da importancia hasta a las cosas m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as ( y eso se comprueba al pasar a la vitrina del recuerdo).\n\nLa historia comenz\u00f3\u2026\u201ca los 14 a\u00f1os fue que me avent\u00e9 a decir: hago una fiesta, pero antes de eso ya ten\u00eda un camino recorrido en cuanto a formaci\u00f3n musical, de la cual es importante que hable: hab\u00eda esos viajes familiares a la playa, que seguramente muchos hicieron, donde exist\u00eda una dictadura total que ahora no se da, la cosa es que de ida a Melaque o a Barra de Navidad mis pap\u00e1s iban escuchando a P\u00e9rez Prado, luego mambos todo el camino y de ni\u00f1o te vas preguntando \u00bfa qu\u00e9 horas llegas? y vas contando en mambo, el n\u00famero cinco, el n\u00famero ocho. De regreso a la ciudad la m\u00fasica era de puras grandes bandas y fueron esos recorridos los que llenaron mi cabeza de m\u00fasica. Afortunadamente ten\u00eda unos pap\u00e1s muy musicales, y aunque siempre fui v\u00edctima de esa dictadura, hoy lo agradezco\u201d.\n\nDe ni\u00f1o hizo muchas cosas: \u201cFui parte de los grupos de baile con Pita Sandoval, fui boy scout y luego me llam\u00f3 la m\u00fasica. Compraba discos de 45 revoluciones y empec\u00e9 a tener mi colecci\u00f3n, una interesante; se acercaba el cumplea\u00f1os de mi hermana Magadalena, as\u00ed que yo iba a hacer la fiesta\u201d.\n\nLa primera vez\n\nDe todas las fiestas, la de Magdalena fue la primera y en esa C\u00e9sar puso especial empe\u00f1o para que todo fuera excepcional, incluso realiz\u00f3 una especie de ritual que hasta la fecha ha marcado la diferencia: \u201cSaqu\u00e9 el est\u00e9reo de la casa y lo puse en la cochera, arm\u00e9 una tabla con focos de esa \u00e9poca y una bola de espejos. Pero para la primera canci\u00f3n prepar\u00e9 todo un rito.\n\nEsto fue el 25 de septiembre de 1978. Para poder mezclar le ped\u00ed el est\u00e9reo prestado de mi vecina, porque ten\u00eda que tener dos, as\u00ed pon\u00eda un disco y daba la mezcla con el volumen para dar paso a la otra canci\u00f3n. Era una ocasi\u00f3n especial y quer\u00eda estrenar un disco, el que estaba de moda, fui a comprarlo \u2013importado, que sonaba m\u00e1s bonito que los nacionales porque se escuchaba un gis por la calidad del vinil- as\u00ed que compr\u00e9 el de K.C. & The Sunshine Band, Keep it coming love, que estaba de moda y fue la canci\u00f3n de la semana; ten\u00eda el disco cerrado y lo abrir\u00eda hasta el momento de ponerlo en el plato y ponerle play. Esto era muy importante, porque era parte de los detalles y como esos detalles hay mucho que se relacionan con la pasi\u00f3n, son cosas que de alguna manera te van forjando\u201d.\n\nDe alguna manera hab\u00eda elegido su camino, sin siquiera cuestionarse si era\nrealmente lo suyo, no hubo crisis existencial s\u00f3lo fiestas. Por cierto C\u00e9sar no tiene ning\u00fan vicio: no bebe alcohol, no fuma y nunca ha usado drogas. \u201cMi vicio es la m\u00fasica\u201d.\n\nLa trayectoria de C\u00e9sar Cos\u00edo va de la organizaci\u00f3n de eventos y fiestas de lo p\u00fablico a lo privado, nacional e internacional. Tambi\u00e9n dedica parte de su tiempo para regresarle a la m\u00fasica un poco de lo que \u00e9sta le ha dado, realiza cursos para los aprendices de DJ a trav\u00e9s de talleres gratuitos que imparte en la V\u00eda RecreActiva. Tiene a su cargo un evento al rescate de la m\u00fasica de anta\u00f1o que lleva por nombre Todos a bailar, concepto que ha presentado exitosamente, adem\u00e1s imparte un seminario de Geograf\u00eda Musical Latinoamericana en el marco de la Convenci\u00f3n de la Asociaci\u00f3n Americana de DJ\u2019s (de la cual forma parte).\n\nUna canita al aire\n\nOtra de sus aportaciones al rescate de la m\u00fasica es Una canita al aire, el nombre hace referencia a la picard\u00eda mexicana y con \u00e9ste se pretende rescatar la buena m\u00fasica de anta\u00f1o. El proyecto ya se hizo en Tepic, Nayarit y ahora se encamina al Z\u00f3calo de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, en donde va a amenizar el festejo de los 40 a\u00f1os del metro, \u201calgo que nunca me imagin\u00e9, por ejemplo, voy a dividir la pista ( la plancha del Z\u00f3calo en cuatro partes, un solo DJ que soy yo, y en cada una de las \u00e1reas voy a programar distintos estilos musicales; danzones, mambos, rock and roll y grandes bandas. Es un proyecto \u00fanico porque para aislar el sonido se ha creado un dise\u00f1o ac\u00fastico que me hizo el favor de hacer Lalo Sandoval, el ingeniero de Man\u00e1 y de Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez; \u00e9l hizo un dise\u00f1o que est\u00e1 bien, hay unos peque\u00f1os pasillos de contaminaci\u00f3n pero no pasa nada.\n\nEl reto est\u00e1 en que si voy a ir al Z\u00f3calo no voy a ir a presentarme como todos lo har\u00edan lo voy a hacer de una manera diferente \u00bfc\u00f3mo? pues voy a tener cuatro cabinas y simult\u00e1neamente voy a estar tocando, al pendiente de que no se me acabe la canci\u00f3n en ninguna. Lo estoy ensayando porque son cinco horas de m\u00fasica, llevo ensayadas tres y sin ning\u00fan problema. Soy un tapat\u00edo reconocido en muchos lugares pero aqu\u00ed es muy dif\u00edcil el reconocimiento y tener la propuesta de parte de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico es halagador\u201d.\n\n\n\u201c S\u00ed se puede triunfar en Guadalajara, no es f\u00e1cil, pero nada es f\u00e1cil en esta vida. El secreto es aferrarse, insistir e insistir\u201d\n\nEntrevista Por Karelia Alba para \"el Informador\"\n\\", "otherInfo": "S\u00e1bado 16 / 20:00 h\n\nDJ Cesar Cos\u00edo\nPresenta:\nBEETHOVEN + 1\nUn repaso de los grandes \u00e9xitos por los surcos de los beats digitales de Beethoven.\n\n\"Transmisi\u00f3n digital\"\n\nInicia en:\n3d 4h 38m 53s\nSuscr\u00edbete a nuestro canal\npara que recibas las notificaciones\n\n\n\nConcierto en Vivo\n\nProducci\u00f3n en vivo con equipo audiovisual con calidad Full HD, con levantamiento de sonido directo.\n\nProducci\u00f3n: Festival Cultural de Mayo en Jalisco + C\u00e9sar Cos\u00edo + Foro IQ\n\nConcepto Original: C\u00e9sar Cos\u00edo y Miguel Carrillo\n\nGrabaci\u00f3n y postproducci\u00f3n: Sarape Films\n\n\n\nInvitados Especiales:\n\nAlberto Stanley, pantomima / Anita Proenza, danza / Arturo Ybarra, guitarrista / Carlos Montes, bailar\u00edn disco / Guillermo M\u00e9ndez, malabares / Joca Sol\u00eds, percusi\u00f3n / Juan M\u00e9ndez, malabares / Juan Rosa, bailar\u00edn tango / Samuel Infante, danza / Wendy Cuevas, danza, Jos\u00e9 Luis Altamirano, pianista.\n\n\n\n\n\nDJ Cesar Cosio (Curador Musical)\n\nMultipremiado DJ tapat\u00edo y primer miembro latinoamericano del prestigiado \u201cAMERICAN DJ HALL OF FAME\u201c\u00ae\n\nNombrado en Tokio EMBAJADOR OFICIAL DE PIONEER DJ\u00ae y reconocido en los \u201cVI DJ & CLUBBING AWARDS\u201d\u00ae notando una clara tendencia ecl\u00e9ctica y mainstream , pasando de los ritmos latinos al E.D.M.

But when the sun goes down, he straps on his signature Gretsch 6120, steps up to the mike and is transformed into REVEREND HORTON HEAT, a hellfire-spewing, rock and roll dare-demon.\n\nJim\u2019s tome is iconic: From recording with Lemmy Kilmister, being revered by country music legends like Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins, touring with Soundgarden, ZZ Top, The Cramps, Social Distortion, White Zombie and the Sex Pistols (a young Lydon was connected to Jim\u2019s original 1985 demo), to providing touring opps to upstarts Kyuss, Hank III, Marilyn Manson and countless others across decades on the road.\n\nHeath and longtime confidant and slap-bass general Jimbo Wallace have polished up their 12threlease, Whole New Life, which Heath calls \u201cthe most positive material I have ever written. It focuses heavily on rock and roll but there is a human interest parallel - songs about growing up poor, vices, marriage, having children and walking the rapturous streets of America.\u201d\n\nCall it a new twist on an old sound, Whole New Life was recorded between Fun Guy Studios and Modern Electric in the band\u2019s hometown of Dallas. The eleven track rumination features new sticksman Arjuna \u2018RJ\u2019 Contreras. The Texas based jazz pupil came to the bands attention from a friend\u2019s reference in the summer of 2017, and brought a whole new backbeat to the legendary rockabilly administration. After clicking with Contreras, Heath hired a new pianist in 2018, Matt Jordan, to flesh out the sound with the pomp and power of Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. \u201cI love playing with these guys, it truly is a whole new band, so the title fits perfectly.\u201d\n\nRecording the album, Heath recalled that \u201cBack in the 1950\u2019s, reverb chambers were really hip and I always loved their warmth. I\u2019m all about Sam Phillips and the things he did with tape machines and tape echo. I love that kind of production value, even if it is older than me! It really sent me to this whole other headspace where I worked with a lot of vintage gear on this album - some of which I built myself for a truly unique sound - ribbon, old tube microphones, pre-amps and stuff. Additionally, a year before I started piecing this together I worked especially hard on my singing voice. Whole New Life brought out something in me where I am screaming more and making more throaty sounds. It's got some Louisiana feel to it, a bit of gruff and some Roy Orbison style in it. We tested out new tracks on our most recent tour and they are working better with the audience than any new songs we premiered since the early days of the band.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis tour started around 1986,\u201d Heath chuckles dryly. REVEREND HORTON HEAT still performs nearly 200 shows annually, including their trademark Horton\u2019s Hayride Festival in Southern California, which has expanded to an end-of-the-year jamboree under the name Horton\u2019s Holiday Hayride. The band has also wowed sold-out crowds with their multi-city residencies across America, including performances at Coachella, Reading, Austin City Limits, Riot Fest and countless other festivals. The Texas troubadours also took a unique approach to the term \u2018Special Guests\u2019 on recent tours. Recalling the time the band opened for Jerry Lee Lewis, Heath had a vision, \u201cThe idea of playing in Jerry\u2019s backing band would have been pretty neat. So every once in a while we\u2019ll have a load of fun putting that aspect in our live set. In the middle of our set, we\u2019ll have a special guest come on stage for a mini-set where REVEREND HORTON HEAT is the backing band. The first time we did it was with Lemmy Kilmister. We stopped our set midway, the road crew dragged a Marshall amp on stage, wiped the Rickenbacker clean and out came Lem. He was adamant on playing deep cuts, but I fought tooth and nail with him to do \u2018Ace Of Spades.\u2019 I told him, \u2018Lemmy, we must do this song, we have to give the people want they want.\u2019 He took a drag of his smoke, looked me square in the eye, and said \u2018Never give them what they want, give them what they need!\u2019\u201d\n\nWith over 1 million albums sold and nearly 35 years in the game, Heath and company have been delivering blood-pressure inducing scriptures to millions of fans worldwide. Call it rock and roll, psychobilly or what have you, REVEREND HORTON HEAT is often considered an early architect of the latter genre (at least on this side of the Atlantic) and occupies a peculiar place in American musical terrain.\n\nWhole New Life was delivered November 30, 2018.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Benny Benassi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7938040.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Electronic, Techno", "Time": "3:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Marco Benassi, better known as Benny Benassi (born in Milan, 13 July 1967) is an Italian disc jockey and a euro house/electroclash artist.

The duo started DJing in the late 80s in their hometown, before moving to Larry Pignagnoli's Off Limits production studio in the mid 90s, creating music for various acts, including Whigfield, J.K. and Ally & Jo. His first big international hit was I Feel So Fine, released as KMC with vocals by Dhany in 2001. After moving from eurohouse to electro, he had another successful hit single \"Satisfaction\" in 2003 and 2004. This reached Number 2 on the OCC UK Top 75 chart after the Ministry of Sound record company replaced the original video (an almost still picture of the band overlayed with graphics) with a video of models using power tools. Some of his singles have charted high in the United Kingdom and have been played world-wide in clubs. Benassi also remixes the music of his contemporaries, such as DJ Tomcraft and Fischerspooner. Recently, Benny created a record label known as Pump-Kin Music. The focus of the label is primarily new and unsigned producers.

Throughout his youth, his father exposed him to a wide variety of Eastern and Western music, giving Menert fertile soil in which to plant his musical visions. His passion for original analog sounds coupled with a vast knowledge of music history has given him an even larger platform from which to produce. A multi-instrumentalist, he incorporates live guitar and keys into his final production for a full sound and rich feel. By tapping into the world of music that surrounds him, Menert twists and turns day-to-day inspirations into music that is all his own.\n\nMenert worked as the co-producer with Derek Vincent Smith on the chart topping Pretty Lights album Taking Up Your Precious Time, and was a natural choice to be the first artist to join Pretty Lights Music in 2010 with the release of his solo album, Dreaming of a Bigger Life. Michal\u2019s second album with PLM, the critically acclaimed mega-LP Even If It Isn\u2019t Right, dropped in the spring of 2012. Within just a few short months, Menert was landing headlining slots at some of the most prestigious venues in the country.\n\nHis musical collaborations have brought him a wealth of inspiration, and led to the formation of a number of ongoing side projects including Half Color (with Paul Basic), Manic Menert (with Manic Focus), and a slew of others. 2014 saw the culmination of a musical dream with the debut of the Michal Menert Big Band \u2013 an 18-piece ensemble led by Michal that performed his catalog in front of thousands, including headlining performances at Denver\u2019s Fillmore Auditorium and direct support at Colorado\u2019s famed Red Rocks Amphitheatre.\n\nA dynamic and ideological producer, Menert has always taken a community driven approach. He works hand in hand with producers he chooses for his own record label, Super Best Records. By collaborating and working closely with a new generation of hip-hop & EDM producers, he\u2019s bringing a new musical vision to life without any imposed limitations.\n\nThe Spring of 2015 saw the release of Michal\u2019s third LP, Space Jazz on Super Best Records, to an extraordinary response from fans and press. That fall, Menert released the first LP, \u201c1\u201d with his live indie-soul band Michal Menert & the Pretty Fantastics. His sound combines vintage vinyl samples with rich analog synthesis and organic, hard-hitting beats. It\u2019s a fusion of yesterday\u2019s elements and tomorrow\u2019s ideas.

His parents have named him after Don van Vliet, also known as Captain Beefheart. He produces his own music, writes and sings his own songs, does remixes and production work for other artists and used to host a monthly Saturday night show on national radio in his own country. Furthermore, he makes music for motion pictures and commercials, runs two record labels to push and create opportunities for a new generation of talented producers, directs his own music videos, and as an ambassador for Dance4Life - an international UN-supported action campaign to fight back against HIV and AIDS - he stays active on the charity front. At the end of 2006 for instance, he travelled to South Africa to visit several Dance4Life affiliated projects in Johannesburg and Capetown. MTV Networks shot an intense documentary of Don Diablo\u2019s visit to these projects.\n\nAfter signing his first record deal at age fifteen, Don Diablo has had the opportunity to grow as a producer as well as an artist. It is his unique sound that sets Don Diablo apart from other artists. His music is a refreshing blend of musical styles; rock, electro, and hip hop are the main ingredients. In 2004 Don Diablo released his first artist album through Universal Music, which spawned two chart hits, both accompanied by a groundbreaking futuristic video. At the end of 2005, Don Diablo founded his own record label and event brand, Sellout Sessions, and really started fine tuning his own sound and raising his profile in his native country, the Netherlands. Chart success followed soon after with hits like Blow, Who's Your Daddy, I Need to Know, Stand Up, This Way, Pain is Temporary, Pride is Forever storming the mainstream charts. Blow was the first single to be rolled out internationally and got licensed to over ten territories after creating quite a buzz in the club scene.\n\n2007 saw Don Diablo doing over 250 sold-out shows, performing to over 700.000 people. His hectic tour schedule has taken him from London to Tokyo and from Miami to Sydney. Furthermore, Don Diablo proved to be hot in more ways than one in 2007: one of his music videos got nominated for an TMF Award in the category Best Music Video 2007, he was voted Best Dressed Man Of The Year by Esquire Magazine and named Most Eligible Bachelor by Jackie Magazine, while also being named Most Popular Dutch DJ at the GKA Awards.\n\nAt the end of 2007, Don Diablo also participated in the prestigious Public Enemy \u2018Bring the Noise / Give it Up\u2019 remix project together with Ferry Corsten and Benny Benassi, whose remix of Bring the Noise eventually resulted in a Grammy Award for Best Remix. Don Diablo has done remixes for such diverse artists as The Audio Bullys, Newton Faulkner, Kraak & Smaak, and Tami Chynn, to name but a few.\n\nDon Diablo has also proved his ability as an A&R by discovering, singing and then licensing the UK top 3 chart hit Exceeder by Mason. The record was originally signed to Middle of the Road; a record label set up by Don Diablo and club promoter Roy Avni.\n\nDon Diablo will release his highly anticipated artist album \u2018Life is a Festival\u2019 in October 2008 through Sony BMG after which he will embark on a world tour that passes through Australia, Asia, North America, Russia, and of course Europe. The album will be supported by eight music videos. The title song of the album, Life is a Festival, will also be used as the title song of a major independent Dutch movie called Radeloos by the book of popular Dutch writer Carry Slee.

The concept of Vini Vici was formed by the boys with an intention to express their love for the old school sound, paired with their progressive ideas. Iboga Records and FM Bookings, widely considered to be the biggest psytrance label and booking agency, were the first to see the potential of the project and invited them to be part of their well respected family, alongside names such as: Ace Ventura, Liquid Soul, Ticon, Captain Hook, Atmos, and the like. After the huge success of their premier EP 'Divine Mode' and their follow-up \u2018Back Underground\u2019, \u2018Expender\u2019, \u2018Anything & Everything\u2019, and \u2018Veni Vidi Vici\u2019 tracks (all top sellers on Beatport and Iboga Records charts), Vini Vici continued to produce massive hits while touring the world nonstop - Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Switzerland, Finland, France, India, Denmark, Germany, United State, Italy, Portugal, Austria, Australia, Serbia, Netherland, Scotland, United Kingdom, Ireland, Israel\u2026.. It's no surprise Beatport positioned them at No.3 on the Top Artist list of 2014. 2015 was a huge step forward for the boys with the release of their debut album \u2018Vini Vici - Future Classics\u2019. They hit the Beatport Main Chart at No.2 (Psytrance at No.1) - a position that very few psytrance artists have managed to stand at before, followed by Psyshop No.1 and TrackItDown No.1 spots, while the legendary Infected Mushroom named them \u201cthe best upcoming psytrance artists at the moment\u201d. The explosion continued when trance king Armin Van Buuren edited their already classic tune \u2018The Tribe\u2019, and featured them on his legendary \u2018ASOT\u2019 radio show over and over again. Finishing 2015 with a bang, the boys were ranked by Beatport as No.1 on the PsyTrance Artist chart and they also landed the Best Selling Track of 2015. They continued to make history early in 2016 with their Vini Vici Remix of \u2018Hilight Tribe - Free Tibet\u2019 - the track gained over 15,000,000 views on YouTube and 5,000,000 plays on Soundcloud, while also hitting the No.2 spot on Beatport\u2019s Main chart, and becoming the first psytrance track ever to have entered the Beatport Main Top 10. After such an outstanding beginning to 2016, it\u2019s no surprise that the rest of their year continued to bring this elevated level and even after many successful years before became their best year by far. Some even call it the \u2018The Vini Vici Year\u2019 - with over 220 shows in some of the most prestigious electronic music events around the globe (A State Of Trance Festival NL, Tomorrowland BE, Boom Festival PT, Electric Daisy Carnival in U.S.A, Ultra BR, Dreamstate U.S.A, Transmission CZ, Experience BR, Vuuv DE, Sunburn GOA, Luminosity NL, Earthcore AU, Unity IL just to name a few\u2026). Keeping their No.1 spot on Beatport\u2019s Psytrance Artist list and Best Selling Track for the second year in a row went on to lead a new generation of psytrance fans and producers to their style. Just before ending off 2016 came the jewel in the crown; a collaboration with no other than one of the solid founders of modern electronic music - Armin Van Buuren, featuring french band Hilight Tribe in their creation \u2018Great Spirit\u2019. This massive collaboration took over the Beatport Main Chart immediately and gained over 1,000,000 views on YouTube in just 2 weeks, taking them one step closer to their life goal of spreading psytrance culture and energy in the world. Armin van Buuren: \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to work with Vini Vici ever since they embarked on the music scene.

This upcoming album is the band\u2019s first since 2014 and the unquestionably catchy first cut, \u201cKeep on Coming Back\u201d incorporates all the elements of the classic Wagons' sound, with a brand new spiraling twist.

Continuing on the TV theme, singer/songwriter John Barker appears in a feature role in the forthcoming series of 'Mercy Peak', to numerous TVCs.\n\nA D.I.Y band at heart, a large portion of Jesters music is recorded in the comfort of their own home studio, including the song 'Fries with That' which was chosen to be the main song for the soundtrack of the T.V show Being Eve. Jester have recently made a second contribution to the shows soundtrack and will be releasing the song and it's video in conjunction with the start of Being Eves second serie\n\nFrom Jester.co.nz but found on www.nzmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Vicky Devine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6186598.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Electronic, Trance, Rock, Tech, Progressive", "Time": "9:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Vicky Devine is one of the leading DJs to break out of the UK.... with her successful career taking her all over the world and which led to her becoming a main room resident at one of the most popular and well known nights in Ibiza - Judgement Sundays. Also an established producer, record label owner, TV / radio presenter and event promoter, Vicky's hard work is testament to her love of all things dance music and one of the reasons she continues to be at the forefront in todays dance music scene. The History.... Vicky has been involved in music in some capacity throughout most of her life. Reaching Grade 6 in Piano and playing classical guitar throughout her school years, she was quickly enticed into the dance music world and has worked within the industry ever since. Beginning as a club reviewer and interviewer for a variety of dance music magazines, she then went on to work in promotional roles for a number of UK based events. There was always a DJ inside though and she was soon behind the decks spending hours after college learning how to mix. This coupled with her passion for music, endless enthusiasm and her gritty determination has helped build her career and has made her one of the most established female DJ\u2019s and producers in the current dance music scene. As a result Vicky has gone on to wow fans in the UK and indeed around the world, with a reputation built on her uplifting yet driving sets which span a variety of genres and incorporate elements of trance, tech and progressive. She has played at some of the biggest and most respected nights and clubs in the UK including The Warehouse Project, The Gallery, The Syndicate and Pams House, has been included on several festivals and tours including A State of Trance (Den Bosch), Gatecrasher, and Slinky and has DJ'd for years on a worldwide level at clubs throughout Europe, Canada, Russia, South America, Mexico, Indonesia, Malaysia, Dubai, Australia and New Zealand to name but a few. Ibiza.... Over the years Vicky has been a regular guest at many clubs and bars in Ibiza and this eventually led to her gaining a main room residency at Judge Jules\u2019s massive Judgement Sundays night at Eden. Playing weekly for over 8 years at the busiest night in San Antonio meant playing regularly alongside many of the leading names in today\u2019s scene, as well as establishing her name as one of the favourite Ibiza residents both with DJ\u2019s and clubbers alike. And lets not forget Vicky\u2019s other Ibiza summer residencies at UltraViolet, Derailed, the Judgement Boat Parties and the all female DJ \u201cCharlys Angelz\u201d events which featured on the island for several years and which she played an integral role in running and promoting. Vicky has also played at several of the islands others superclubs over the years including Amnesia, Privilege, Space, Es Paradis, Summum, El Divino and The Old Zoo as well holding a residency for 6 years (2003 - 2009) at the huge BCM on neighbouring Balearic island Majorca. Ibiza though is her home, and it is here she loves to play. She is a well known face on the circuit here and she continues to be involved in new projects both DJing and behind the scenes on the island year after year. Production.... On the production front Vicky has also seen much success. She had early productions as part of collaborations released on Infectious Distribution, Solar Records and F Active Music, before moving onto working on solo productions. She has gone on to have releases on some of todays biggest labels - most notably Spinnin, Blackhole, Fraction and Recoverworld, - and has had corresponding remixes from and collaborations with some of the scenes most recognisable names and emerging stars. Her tracks have been supported by the likes of Armin Van Buuren, Tiesto, Paul Van Dyk, Paul Oakenfold, Gareth Emery and Sean Tyas, have had amazing reviews in top music magazines IDJ, Mixmag and M8, have regularly reached high charting positions both in Beatport and Trackitdown, have had plays on some of the biggest Radio Shows and Podcasts from around the world and have featured on numerous mix compilations. Never one to rest on her laurels, 2012 saw the launch of her own label DE:VA Recordings. As the name alludes to - expect music on here with plenty of attitude - including releases from the lady herself. Indeed Vicky's studio itinerary is always bubbling away - news of brand new releases are coming soon! Radio & TV .... Radio has played a massive part in Vicky\u2019s career to date and is something she was involved with from a very early stage. Having provided Ibiza reports and interviews for several UK based stations, and having also hosted her own show on Ibiza dance music station Holiday FM, she went on to produce her own monthly \"DE:VA\" radio show on Afterhours FM as well as airing as a podcast on Podomatic. Over the years she has had a multitude of guest mixes and interview\u2019s on other high profile radio shows also including Judge Jules's BBC Radio One Show, Woody Van Eyden and Alex Morph\u2019s Heavens Gate Show, Kiss FM, Eddie Halliwell\u2019s BBC Radio One Show, and on Judge Jules\u2019s Global Warm Up show, not to mention on several International Web Based Stations. In addition Vicky has been involved in television work with Rapture TV, MOS TV, Living TV and WTFI, and was one of the presenters for Ibiza Live and Clubland TV in Ibiza whereby she interviewed and presented for a range of high profile music and TV stars. Vicky is one of the unsung heroes of trance in the UK. She has been our Judgement Sundays Ibiza resident for ten years and never fails to ignite the crowd. Her music style and persona behind the decks are second to none - Judge Jules One of the worlds best female DJ\u2019s \u2013 Armin Van Buuren, ASOT Ibiza's leading female DJ - Mixmag Vicky Devine is definitely one of the reasons why I enjoy DJing at Judgement Sundays in Ibiza so much, it\u2019s hard to find a DJ who can do a proper warm up set without taking anything away from the music I want to play in a club. I have stayed around to hear one of her closing sets and they have just as much impact as her opening sets. If I was a promoter I would want her involved in my night! - Sander Van Doorn I have been playing in Ibiza for years now and I have been with Judgement Sundays for the last six years. Each time Vicky Devine plays before me, I know I can arrive at the venue five minutes before my set knowing that she has done the perfect job. Vicky plays a perfect mix of quality grooves with euphoric breakdowns, none of which conflicts with what I want to do as a DJ. - Marco V Website - http://www.vickydevine.com Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/vickydevine Podcast- http://vickydevine.podomatic.com Beatport - http://dj.beatport.com/vickydevine You Tube - http://www.youtube.com/djvickydevine", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "K-Klass ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8519511.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "9:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "K-Klass are a house music group from Wrexham, North Wales.

The tracked reached number 3 in the UK chart. Let Me Show You reached number 13 in 1993. Subsequently, the band purchased a disused Royal Observer Corps underground bunker in Borras for use as a recording studio.[3] They have released two albums, \"Universal\", featuring the vocals of Bobbi Depasois, and \"K2\". In 1995, K-Klass won the I.D.A Best International Remixer award; the first ever UK artist to do so.\n\nK-Klass have played many live events, including stints at superclubs in Liverpool, Sheffield, Hong Kong and Ibiza.[4]\n\nSince then, they have also been involved with producing and remixing tracks by other artists. K-Klass were one of the producers on the Pet Shop Boys album, Bilingual, and have also produced for Candi Staton, Rebekah Ryan and Rosie Gaines.\n\nThe group have remixed tracks by varied dance and pop artists including Sunscreem, Kylie Minogue, Geri Halliwell, S Club 7 (\"Bring it All Back\") and M People.

Their musicianship and energy appeals to music fans everywhere. On stage, frontman Joe Camilleri steers the band through an infectious interplay of solid grooves that mixes blues, soul, old school R&B and gospel, with flashes of jazz, country and Brill Building pop.\n\nRecently awarded \u201cLiving Legend\u201d status by Rolling Stone, Joe Camilleri has kicked a staggering number of goals during his 50+ years in music as a singer, songwriter, multi-talented musician and producer. Joe first came to prominence as leader of seminal 70\u2019s band, Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons. Considered one of the most genuinely talented figures in Australian music, Joe was inducted into the ARIA Music Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nThe Black Sorrows have a legion of loyal fans throughout Australia and Europe.

Joe\u2019s songwriting skills are much in demand with greats, Elvis Costello and John Denver having recorded versions of his songs.\n\nAlong with Joe Camilleri (vocals/guitar/sax/harp) the band boast a formidable lineup with Claude Carranza (guitar/vocals), Mark Gray (bass/vocals), John McAll (keyboards/vocals) and Angus Burchall (drums).\n\n\n\u201cCatching The Black Sorrows brand of raw, rootsy, hip-shaking rock\u2019n\u2019roll feels like discovering the best bar band in the world\u201d The Dubai National\n\n\u201c\u2026you know you\u2019re in the presence of a real thumping, jangling, Mississippi-by-way-of-Melbourne rock n\u2019 roll band\u201d\nThe Skinny Edinburgh\n\n\u201cCamilleri is an Aussie rock legend and one of this nation\u2019s finest performers..the epitome of a hardworking entertainer who knows how to connect with his audience.\u201d Sydney Morning Herald", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTY3KQKai_D45CiN_6kdJg/featured"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Jezabels ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8990747.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Nik Kaloper - Drums, Hayley Mary - Vocals, Heather Shannon - Keys, Samuel Lockwood - Guitars", "Time": "9:50 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Brink, the first and title track of The Jezabels' second album, revisits the glorious mystery of rock'n'roll redemption: the thrilling loss of innocence to a power that never wanes from one teenaged generation to the next.\n\nWith The Jezabels though, there's always a twist.\n\n\"I have a reading of that song in my mind where the spirit of rock'n'roll is actually a kind of succubus,\" singer Hayley Mary confides. \"She takes your life and your soul as well as giving it to you. In giving you a reason to live, she gives you all you have.\n\n\"What's funny is that I seem to be singing from her perspective, so maybe I'm sucking the life out of this little boy,\" she adds with a wicked laugh. \"That's rather twisted.\"\n\nThe Brink materialised from a dark place. It wasn't just the second album void that naturally follows a monumental debut. Prisoner won the 2011 Australian Music Prize, you'll recall. The Jezabels won Best Artist at the AIR Independent Music Awards and got nominated for a staggering 8 ARIAs.\n\nBut the solid two years of touring at home and overseas certainly played a part in the abyss that welcomed Hayley, guitarist Sam Lockwood, keys player Heather Shannon and drummer Nik Kaloper when they pulled up in London at the end of that marathon cycle of gold, platinum, gigs and festivals.\n\n\"We played between 180 and 200 shows last year and it was possibly a bit extreme,\" says Hayley. \"But the low came from not performing. We basically had a year off and I realised how much I live to do shows. For me, writing is the self-deprecating, self-loathing stage.\n\n\"We all had our reasons for feeling low at various times, but I felt like I was on the brink of a lot of things on this album. Some of them good, some of them bad: youth and age, alternative and pop, giving up and pushing through. I guess hope is part of that. And also fear.\"\n\nA fearless record of youthful optimism shining through hard-won experience, The Brink is the explosive resolution of all that and more. Hammered out by the tight-knit band through dark days in a strange new city, it's a classic testament to the power of rock'n'roll salvation.\n\nThe first single, The End, is an act of sheer levitation heralded by the kind of cascading exuberance that FM radio was made for. Time to Dance and All You Need are all open arms and crashing cadences of hope in the storm. Even the big city bite of Beat to Beat and the cold war chains of No Country are soothed by a reaffirmed faith in unabashed pop hooks.\n\n\n\n\"Pop is a weird word,\" Hayley says. \"But as you get older and more experienced you do tend to have a greater appreciation of simplicity. We were growing into it with Prisoner, but now I think we have a better understanding of simple ideas communicated effectively, rather than piling all this stuff in because you think it's beautiful.\"\n\nThe clarity of thought and expression reflects a more single-minded approach, she says. \"Right from the first demos we just sounded more like a band. We were writing together; not four different musical thoughts pushed together into a song.\n\n\"After all the shows we've played and all we\u2019ve been through, we listen to each other better, we play together better. 'Maturity' is a really bad word,\" she laughs, \"but I can't think of a better one.\"\n\nThe album's death-defying balance of optimism and maturity; richness and simplicity was aided by Dan Grech-Marguerat, a UK producer whose mixing, engineering and production expertise has served Radiohead, Scissor Sisters, Kooks and Lana Del Rey. He was \"a burst of positive energy,\" says Hayley, who helped turn the darkness to blinding light.\n\n\"What this record represents is not reflecting what is, but what we want out of life,\" she says. \"I guess it depends on what you think is the role of music. Is it to reflect how you feel, and bring everyone and everything to that level? Or is a kind of healing power, pushing you to this fabulous fantasy world where happiness can exist?\"\n\nIf you're reading this you\u2019ve been saved.

Eats Everything has since become one of the most in demand remixers in the business, proving his remix abilities by adding the Midas touch across a wide range of tracks from the likes of Fatboy Slim, Niles Rodgers, Jamie Jones, Disclosure, Four Tet, Matador and Booka Shade.\n\nAfter winning DJ Magazine\u2019s \u2018Best British DJ\u2019, and becoming the only DJ ever to perform two BBC Radio 1 Essential Mixes within the space of a year, Eats Everything debuted at #13 in Resident Advisor\u2019s Top\nDJs poll during 2012. A technical wizard on the decks, his obsession with House, Techno and Disco shone through immediately, displaying the \u2018studio geek\u2019 inside the Bristolian, which led to him mixing the\n\u2018Fries With That\u2019 compilation on Hypercolour Records, launching it with a very special intimate Boiler Room set in Bristol at the beginning of 2015. Stepping things up a notch, he later took on one of the\nworld\u2019s most acclaimed mix series, fabric 86, in honour of the iconic London superclub - firmly cementing him as an underground DJ.\n\nAlways one to go with the moment rather than to meticulously plan out sets, it is this party-ready approach that saw him become a key member of the elrow family early on, playing for the world-famous\nSpanish brand as an all night resident during their Ibiza season, as well as at many of their major European festival stage takeovers and club nights. All this in addition to a continuing dizzy array of high profile\ngigs; from Awakenings Festival, Movement Detroit, Kappa Futur Festival, Paradise DC10, Coachella to the Space Ibiza closing party, and his own personal favourite, Glastonbury, where his reputation as a local hero is set in stone. Now firmly established as one of the UK\u2019s finest House and Techno exports, Eats Everything has more recently become a key part RESISTANCE, which is an integral component of the ULTRA Festival brand worldwide. Regardless of his success, Eats Everything has stayed true to his roots, never forgetting where his story began, and aside from throwing parties for family, friends and his biggest fans, he has held three \u2018Food For Thought\u2019 lectures across schools in England, talking to inspired students about his musical journey and creative processes within the studio, having honed his skills since first obtaining a pair of decks at the age of 12. In addition, he became a firm advocate for the \u2018Last Night a DJ Saved My Life\u2019 charity, aiding to provide safe clean water across Africa and India by performing very special NYE performances at The Nest and fabric in London, in honour of the organisation and donating all proceeds to the charity. Making incredible music that resonates further than just the confines of underground House and Techno, the larger than life character is known for his confidence both on camera, and on radio, where his naturally gifted hosting skills have led to the headstrong producer garnering a reputation as the people\u2019s champion. Following a hugely successful 12 month stint on the BBC Radio 1 Residency, Eats Everything was quickly appointed as a deputy host for Radio 1\u2019s Dance specialist broadcasts, allowing his boisterous persona to shine through on the UK\u2019s favourite station. His radio output doesn\u2019t end there - whilst his globally syndicated weekly \u2018Edible Beats\u2019 radio show is now airing on over 70 FM stations around the world, stretching all the way from Argentina to Australia and everywhere in between, it was recently awarded best Electronic Music show and Listeners Choice for the 2018 Mixcloud radio awards.\n\nHis Edible imprint \u2013 a joint project with fellow Bristol music legend Nick Harris \u2013 continues to go from strength to strength, releasing standout tracks from the likes of Skream, Paul Woolford, Waze & Odyssey,\nEats Everything himself and newcomers like Alex Virgo. With Edible now 15 releases in, the label continues delivering high quality House, Techno and Disco influenced records that resonate broadly and\nwith a respective nod to its past.\n\nThis year sees Eats Everything launch his new A.T.E alias and event series as he looks to diversify his musical output through a combination of live branded shows, a brand new record label in collaboration with Spanish Techno hero Andres Campo, entitled EI8HT, which also provides him a platform to release no-nonsense European techno with a British twist, and to sign music from his globally renowned peers.\n\nWith 2018 already shaping up to be the biggest and best year so far in the meteoric rise of Eats Everything, the Bristolian native has a range of solid new music soon to be released on Carl Cox\u2019s infamous INTEC imprint, which is a huge honour for him and says \u201cCarl\u2019s always been a childhood hero of mine, and a really great moment in my life was when I got to play at the Discoteca in Space before him\u201d, Dense & Pika\u2019s fledgling Kneaded Pains, along with remixes for Tiga\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re So Special\u201d on Turbo and an \u2018Eats Rebeef\u2019 of Size 9\u2019s classic \u201cI\u2019m Ready\u201d on Josh Wink\u2019s legendary OVUM, proving Eats Everything to be one of the most consistent premiere names on the scene.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bec Stevens ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10353515.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bec Stevens is an old soul.

Grooverider began his DJing career at illegal raves and warehouse parties in Britain in the late eighties, and rose to prominence with partner Fabio through his innovative sets at influential club nights such as Rage and Speed. At these nights, Grooverider championed the emerging UK breakbeat culture that would eventually split from house and techno to produce Hardcore, and then after another split it became jungle, which would in turn become known as drum and bass.\n\nGrooverider remains an influential figure in the worldwide drum and bass scene, in part due to his successful radio show on BBC Radio 1 (presented in conjunction with Fabio) which has attained a devoted audience outside the United Kingdom. Consequently, he is in great demand as a DJ and works extensively abroad as well as in the UK.\n\nAlthough Grooverider is known primarily as a DJ and presenter, he is also a recording artist and runs one of the most prestigious drum and bass imprints; Prototype Recordings. Prototype is known for its sporadic, yet highly-anticipated, releases showcasing productions from many of the biggest names in drum and bass, including Dillinja, Ed Rush, Photek and Optical. As a recording artist, Grooverider has released one album, Mysteries of Funk (Sony 1998), produced in conjunction with Optical, and a number of acclaimed remixes. As of 2005, he is currently working on a new album.\n\nGrooverider was arrested 24 November 2007 in Dubai after flying in for a nightclub gig with 2.16g of cannabis and a pornographic DVD in his luggage.\n\nGrooverider had been employed on a freelance basis and has not been paid by BBC Radio 1 since November. Four years is the minimum sentence for drug trafficking in the United Arab Emirates. \"I must have forgotten the spliff,\" he said in an interview. \"It was a small amount.

Their sound, unmistakable. Their calling, unarguable. Their performances, unforgettable. Their joy, unspeakable.\nThe Perrys\u2014Libbi Perry Stuffle, Jared Stuffle, Troy Peach, and Andrew Goldman\u2014have forged a deep sense of unity. This is due, in part, to the fires through which they have walked over the last few years.

With unparalleled determination, Libbi and her beloved group have continued to heed the call to carry the Gospel to the multitudes.\nLoved by gospel music fans around the world, The Perrys have earned many accolades over their illustrious career. In addition to their Dove Award for Song of the Year and countless Dove nominations, they have garnered numerous #1 songs and 15 Singing News Fan Awards, including the 3-time Favorite Mixed Group honor, 2-time Song of the Year, Favorite Album, as well as Libbi being named both a 2-time Female Vocalist of the Year and 8-time Favorite Alto of the Year.\nA career spanning nearly fifty years, their commitment to the calling of God upon their lives has never been greater. \"Now, more than ever,\" says Libbi, \"we want to share the good news of Jesus Christ in song.\" The Perrys are looking toward the future with great expectation.

With her captivating vocals, the 23-year-old artist delivers every lyric with both a larger-than-life urgency and uncompromising intimacy, drawing the listener further and further into her own private universe. Set against a backdrop of sumptuously textured alt-pop, In Bloom finds GRANT wholly embodying whatever mood she\u2019s conjuring: lovestruck, vengeful, heavy-hearted, triumphant. The result is an album that subtly transports you into a more enchanted state of mind, then returns you to the outside world with a deeper understanding of your own emotional truth.\n\nProduced mainly by Peter Kvint (with additional production by Johan T Karlsson), recorded in GRANT\u2019s home base of Stockholm, In Bloom features her sublimely devastating debut single \u201cWaterline.\u201d The track arrived last fall and quickly earned acclaim for its elegant intensity and candid depiction of choosing survival over suicide. \u201cWhen I wrote that song I\u2019d been feeling bad for a long time, and I realized I had to make a choice,\u201d says GRANT. \u201cI decided that even though I was probably going to feel bad many more times in my life, I wasn\u2019t going to let it drown me\u2014I was going to choose to live.\u201d\n\nThroughout In Bloom, GRANT maintains a deliberate vulnerability, a willful sensitivity that speaks to\nthe quiet power in softness. But while each song is rooted in raw emotion, the album unfolds in lyrics showing a poet\u2019s attention to detail and knack for unexpected turn-of-phrase. And whether the mood is ecstatic or stormy, outrageous or fragile, GRANT endlessly proves her skill at sculpting melodies as exquisite as a tune from some centuries-old music box.\n\nThough its title nods to GRANT\u2019s growth as an artist, In Bloom also documents her coming-of-age in\na grander sense. On the album-opening \u201cLighthouse,\u201d with its bombastic horns and slinky groove, she offers a snapshot of some wild adventures at a warehouse party, channeling all the dizzy elation in losing your head on a Saturday night. More darkly charged and spiked with spaghetti-western guitar tones, \u201cGone\u201d takes on a bluesy ferocity as GRANT recounts a falling-out with a friend and lays down a perfectly plainspoken confession (\u201cA fucked mind can act so dumb\u201d). Written soon after the U.S. presidential election, \u201cGravity\u2019s Rainbow\u201d begins in torchy despair but builds into a beautifully defiant epic (\u201cWe\u2019re in love, fuck the war\u201d). And on \u201cLightyears,\u201d GRANT pays homage to her father (a farmer she describes as \u201ca very down-to-earth, full-of-love person who just wants to take care of everyone around him\u201d), infusing the soul-stirring track with flashes of easy wisdom (\u201cAmbition is graceful when handled right\u201d).\n\nAt the heart of In Bloom are a handful of songs that capture the starry-eyed thrill of new romance. \u201cI fell in love and didn\u2019t want to write about being sad anymore,\u201d says GRANT of single \u201cCatcher in the Rye,\u201d a sweetly uptempo track built on plush beats and lust-crazed lyrics. \u201cI wanted to write about being so happy without making it into some cheesy love song\u2014and even if it is some cheesy love song, I don\u2019t care: it\u2019s honest.\u201d Another moment of sheer romanticism, \u201cShimmer\u201d opens with brightly ethereal effects that soon give way to GRANT\u2019s gorgeously strange balladry (\u201cLike orchids in the rain/I eat the honey from your voice/Your skin is shimmering/It looks better when you wear no clothes\u201d). \u201cFor that one I wanted to write about how beautiful my boyfriend is, and I wanted to use a word that\u2019s not very manly, like shimmer, to describe how a person\u2019s skin looks after sex,\u201d she points out.\n\nBut for the synth-laced \u201cBody Electric,\u201d with its schoolgirl sing-song and sampled fireworks, GRANT twists the love-story narrative to focus entirely on herself (\u201cIf my self-love intimidates a grown-up man/I\u2019ll use my hand, goddamn\u201d). \u201cWith \u2018Body Electric,\u2019 I was interested in the idea of discovering my sexuality and pleasing myself, but in a way that was playful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt also came from trying to get myself to like my body\u2014trying to make the song sound beautiful, so that I could feel beautiful.\u201d\n\nThrough the years, that balance of dreamy sincerity and cheeky playfulness has emerged as an essential element of GRANT\u2019s songwriting. Born Alma Caroline Cederl\u00f6f, she grew up on a farm in the countryside outside Stockholm, spending much of her childhood among the horses, \u201csinging and imagining the different possibilities of life.\u201d At age nine she joined an after-school music program, and soon fell in love with performing. \u201cThere was a small gathering for all the parents to come see what their kids had been up to, and it was the first time that a whole room went quiet and actually listened to me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was the most empowering feeling I\u2019d ever experienced, especially being a shy kid in a very loud family.\u201d\n\nIn high school GRANT attended music school full-time, and dedicated herself to studying jazz singing. \u201cI have a family friend who\u2019s a jazz singer and gave me lessons sometimes,\u201d she says. \u201cIt opened the door to the most amazing music I\u2019d ever heard, singers like Billie Holiday\u2014their voices and their storytelling went right through me, straight to my heart.\u201d Along with mastering the jazz phrasing that still informs her music today, GRANT also explored pop music for the first time, having mostly grown up on artists from the \u201990s alternative music scene (PJ Harvey, Tricky, Bj\u00f6rk and Nirvana). All those eclectic inspirations coalesced when, at the end of high school, she began to envision a career as a singer/songwriter. \u201cWhen I graduated, I decided I wanted to make music and I wasn\u2019t going to let anyone write my songs for me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I also felt a little bit lost, and I had to figure out what\nI really wanted to do as an artist.\u201d\n\nInstead of continuing her musical education, GRANT took a year off, writing a song a day and experimenting with different genres. Thanks to a connection from her vocal coach, her demos caught the attention of Peter Kvint, who took GRANT under his wing and helped her to sharpen her songwriting skills. Around that time, she also traded her given name for a moniker inspired by Cary Grant (\u201cI wanted a name that had some masculinity about it, since I\u2019m a very tender, girly person,\u201d\nshe explains). Once she\u2019d dreamed up her singular sound, GRANT posted a single called \u201cWicked\u201d\nto SoundCloud, emailed the link to countless music blogs, and soon gained major buzz for the song\u2019s moody and magnetic take on soul-pop. By spring 2017, she\u2019d landed her deal with Sony Music Sweden, releasing \u201cWaterline\u201d that October. In February she made waves with her spellbinding performance of the song at the Swedish Grammy Awards\u2014a show-stealing moment centered on her now-signature, preternaturally still stage presence. \u201cI think I\u2019ve always been inspired by Edith Piaf, how she just stood and talked with her hands and sang from her heart, and everyone listened,\u201d GRANT notes.\n(Check 2:40 minutes into the clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOIojRgyyLE)\n\nIn reflecting on the making of In Bloom, GRANT reveals that the album\u2019s soul-baring quality has much to do with the purposeful seclusion in her writing practice. \u201cI could never write lyrics in a session,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m usually at home in my tub where I can\u2019t run away. It\u2019s mostly about trying to find the feeling that\u2019s standing out the strongest in the middle of the emotional hurricane.\u201d But despite the solitude of that process, each song on In Bloom is undeniably outward-reaching in its purpose. \u201cI love how writing music lets you go deeper into yourself, and how that\u2019s actually your job,\u201d says GRANT. \u201cIt\u2019s like being your own psychiatrist, or writing a diary for everyone to read. I\u2019d love for people to listen to this album and know that they can feel lots of emotions and not worry about being too much. I\u2019d love for them to feel some power in that.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DjCharley ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10369263.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Charles-Andr\u00e9 Labb\u00e9", "Time": "3:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Always on the look-out for news beats and stunning sounds, DjCharley is proud to represent musical diversity.

She does it through her texts, her poems, her melodies.\n\nHer mother, originally from Madagascar gave her the taste for poetry and reverie, her French-German father ingrained the longing for risk and drama. This cultural mix shaped her adventurous soul.\n\nA model and actress in Europe then in New York, where she attends the renowned Lee Strasberg Theater Institute, life\u2019s torments bring her all the way to Los Angeles. There, as she tries to find authenticity, she questions her whole life and puts her acting career on hold, in order to focus on her childhood dream: to be a singer.\nWith a classical music background acquired during childhood, and with an opera vocal training Maylin goes head on: She is reborn \u00ab singer/songwriter \u00bb as she puts her first band together with Omar Torrez (Tom Waits) on guitar, and David Leach (Ben Harper) on percussion.\n\n- In 2005, she releases her first album \u00ab On My Way to See You \u00bb produced by Robin Di Maggio (Tracy Chapman, David Bowie, Steve Vai\u2026) and Baraka Di Candia (Sting). She performs at festivals such as SXSW in Austin (TX), PopKomm in Berlin.\nHer music gets played on college and independent radio stations in California (KPFK, KXLU) and in Canada.\n\n- In 2007, she moves to Paris with a leitmotiv : integrate her folk and blues influences (Nina Simone, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, Tom Waits...) to her new artistic signature.\nShe takes a course in harmony at l\u2019EDIM (Paris), finds new co-writers and a starts a band with guitarist Antonin Huerre. Antonin and Maylin work together for a few years on her new sound, Jeremy Nattagh (bass, percussions) joins them on stage.\n\n- In 2012 Maylin produces a second album. The name of the album \u00ab Run Hippy Run \u00bb seems obvious for this fianc\u00e9e of travels who constantly strives to move forward : \u00ab I am like a spinning top, if I stop, I fall. \u00bb\nDuring that time, Maylin\u2019s band performs in France on a regular basis and goes on two US tours.\n\n\nEn 2015, Maylin feels the desire to push her limits and develop her art. She starts playing the guitar off and on stage and after many years of having considered English her natural creative tongue, she delves into French songwriting. She joins the \u00ab stylomaniaques \u00bb, the French- songs-writing workshop of her friend and mentor acclaimed-songwriter Claude Lemesle.\nThere, she experiences a renewed pleasure for writing songs in French with the candor of a child who is rediscovering her own mother-tongue.\n\nShe is currently embarking on a new journey with a new core band : Michael Ravassat on guitar and Ricardo Garatea on percussions, joined by a bass player and a drummer for a more \u00ab rock \u00bb sound .\nThey are preparing a third album in English and French\n\nMaylin also writes music for film and commercials in France and the US (documentary : \u00ab c\u2019est quoi ce cirque \u00bb, (independant movie: \u00ab Goddess of Love \u00bb, clothing brand : \u00ab Maker and Company \u00bb) and other artists\u2026\n\n\n\n\nComment raconter, en quelques lignes, les cheminements, les errances, les le\u00e7ons, les joies et les inspirations de toute une vie ? Maylin le fait au travers de ses cr\u00e9ations artistiques.\nD\u2019origine malgache, sa m\u00e8re lui donne le go\u00fbt de la po\u00e9sie et de la r\u00eaverie ; son p\u00e8re franco-allemand lui transmet celui de l\u2019audace et du drame. Ce m\u00e9tissage a forg\u00e9 son \u00e2me aventuri\u00e8re.\n\nFinaliste fran\u00e7aise au concours de mannequins \u00ab the look of the year \u00bb de l\u2019agence Elite et actrice en Europe puis \u00e0 New York, Maylin joue dans diverses productions cin\u00e9matographiques et t\u00e9l\u00e9visuelles telles que \u00ab La Reine Blanche \u00bb, \u00ab In God\u2019s Hands \u00bb, \u00ab October 22 \u00bb.\nA New York, elle suit les cours \u00e0 la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre \u00e9cole Lee Strasberg, puis les tourbillons de la vie la conduisent jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Los Angeles.

Le nom de l\u2019album \u00ab Run Hippy Run \u00bb (https://itunes.apple.com/fr/album/run-hippy-run-ep/id686577834) est une \u00e9vidence pour cette fianc\u00e9e du voyage qui cherche sans cesse \u00e0 aller de l\u2019avant : \u00ab je suis comme une toupie, si je m\u2019arr\u00eate je tombe. \u00bb\nAu cours de cette p\u00e9riode, elle se produit r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement sur sc\u00e8ne en France et fait 2 tourn\u00e9es aux Etats-Unis.\n\nEn 2015, Maylin ressent le d\u00e9sir de repousser ses limites et de d\u00e9velopper son art.

After throwing in a handful of well-received full band gigs in 2016, in 2017 the duo finally called up Bryan West to officially form the Avey/Grouws Band. Chris Avey, formerly of The Avey Brothers and former lead guitarist for blues icon Big Pete Pearson, has been called a \"younger, more fiery Coco Montoya mixed with a dash of Tab Benoit\". Avey and drummer Bryan West came in 3rd in the International Blues Challenge in Memphis in 2009 as The Avey Brothers. The strength and grit of Avey's guitar and vocals are beautifully matched by the sheer power and nuance of Grouws' unmistakable voice. She's been called \"a choir full of angels on a runaway train!\u201d Gary Eckhart of Blue Monday Monthly saw their first performance in 2017 and said, \"It was their first show and they are already ready for festivals!\" The band has been steadily booked at festivals across the Midwest as well as as far off as Florida and Arizona.

With lyrics about the experience of being human, her music has a way of connecting with pretty much anyone on a deeply personal level. She's compared frequently to classics like Joni Mitchell and Carol King. And to describe her voice, it\u2019s common to hear words like \"Clear\", \"Pure\", \"Haunting\" and \"Mesmerizing\".\n\nAmy's a California native. After growing up in San Diego, she moved to Santa Cruz for college (go slugs!) and after a fifteen year love affair with the town, moved on to San Francisco where she's lived since 2012. She\u2019s toured the U.S. and Europe, plus recorded and toured with her own French band (The Carbone Band), along with an Artist in Residence in Saint Herblain, France. You also may have heard her song, Carousel, on the hit TV Show, Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\n\nYou can hear Amy perform in a variety of formats. She\u2019s performing frequently in San Francisco with her new energetic groove-rock band, Amy & The Elements. At other times she uses a looper where she can instantly record, playback and perform atop her own performance with harmonies and instruments. And very often she\u2019ll pair things down and simply perform a solo acoustic show highlighting the purity of her songs.\n\nAmy\u2019s musical history stretches back to age five, when she began singing in her school choir. She took up piano at age six and has been studying music ever since. She finally picked up the guitar when she began songwriting at twenty-two.\n\nDuring her long residence in Santa Cruz, she supported local organizations through two benefit concerts called Take Back Your Forest. Collectively they raised six thousand dollars for the Sempervirens Fund, an organization that purchases and protects redwood forest in the Santa Cruz Mountains. She continues to support these types of organizations as much as possible. In 2012, her Carbon Conscious global tour raised awareness about the burning of rainforest in South America and the affects on climate change.", "otherInfo": "Wear your PJs, grab your morning beverage of choice and virtually cuddle up with me for about 45 minutes.

Fortunately, he doesn't need to do that because his compositional skills are a match for his delivery.\"\n\nAfter fronting the Columbia Records band Wood, whose debut Songs From Stamford Hill was featured prominently on TV shows such as \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek,\u201d Maddock moved from England to New York City in 2003. His 2009 album Sunrise On Avenue C won a New York Music Award for Best Americana Album, while the follow-up Wake Up And Dream ranked among the top albums of 2011 in WFUV's (NYC) Listener Poll. With the release of Another Life (2013) and The Green (2015) Maddock continued to demonstrate why many consider him to be one of the best singer/songwriters working today. He has performed with Bruce Springsteen, Willie Nile, Aaron Comess (Spin Doctors) and David Immergluck (Counting Crows). According to radio legend Vin Scelsa, Maddock's \"heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely crafted\" music \"touches the soul.\" As a songwriter, James recently had three songs co-written with Mike Scott on the new Waterboys album Modern Blues (which appeared in the Top 50 on the UK Albums Chart), a co-write with Gary Barlow (\u201cActress\u201d) on Barlow\u2019s new album (2X Platinum), as well as a cut (\u201cFragile\u201d) on the Dirt On My Tongue album by emerging UK artist Jo Harman.

In fact, the record includes a rare upbeat cover of the Townes Van Zandt chestnut \u201cLoretta\u201d. With his long-time group of players (Aaron Comess, Ben Stivers, and Drew Mortali) the record was made in Bushwick, Brooklyn in a mere two days of principle recording; made in the way of the hits of the past. Write it, and capture the lightning in a bottle before the energy dissipates. The ironic reflection and sense of aspiration remains, but James continues to surprise with every new record.

The two were also romantically involved. Pentz's alias, short for Diplodocus, derives from his childhood fascination with dinosaurs.\n\nAs a DJ, Diplo is characterized by his eclectic, often 80s-oriented mashups, mixtapes, and live sets. On his full-length solo effort Florida, however, his sound is closer to sample-based cinematic instrumental hip hop, not unlike the work of DJ Shadow.\n\nBorn in Mississippi and raised across the southern United States, Diplo picked up much of the local culture while growing up there. Music styles such as dirty south, crunk and miami bass are now trademark ingredients of the Hollertronix output. Pentz's solo work is also influenced by Southern Gothic and other southern literature. Additionally, world music is a strong musical influence on Diplo, especially baile funk which he encountered whilst traveling in Brazil.\n\nDiplo was recently signed to Ninja Tune, on the Big Dada imprint. In 2006, he started his own label, Mad Decent, signing Brazilian baile funk group Bonde do Role and Dj Blaqstarr.", "otherInfo": "CHILL OUT \u2600\ufe0f A Very Lazer Sunday w/ Walshy Fire, Diplo and Ape Drums Live Now"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Patrick Watson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9552430.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Songwriter, Singer, Alternative, Indie, Folk", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The official Patrick Watson page on Facebook.\nFollow us on twitter: @patrickwatson", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/icimusique"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Marc Broussard ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9106065.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Blues, Soul", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Marc Broussard is an artist with a unique gift of channeling the spirits of classic R&B, rock and soul into contemporary terms.

The granddaughter of an international barbershop quartet champion, she grew up singing in theater productions, eventually picking up the guitar and playing her own songs at local coffee shops as a teenager. Lissie was also something of a rebel; she got thrown out of high school during her senior year, spent a brief period at Colorado State University, relocated to Paris for a semester, and eventually ditched college altogether to pursue her music career. Returning to the U.S., Lissie headed west and settled in Los Angeles, where she became a fixture on the local venue circuit and landed a national tour opening for Lenny Kravitz\n\nWhy You Runnin'Lissie's music had already appeared on shows like The O.C., Veronica Mars, and House by the time she moved to California, and she widened her fan base by launching a weekly songwriter's circle at her local bar, Crane's Hollywood Tavern, and releasing a self-titled EP. Things truly began picking up speed in 2009, though, when Lissie released the dusky Why You Runnin' (partly recorded in the U.K.) and toured the country alongside Ray LaMontagne.\n\nCatching a Tiger Although she also made several appearances in America -- including a standout performance at the Bonnaroo Music Festival and a single date with the rebooted Lilith Fair -- Lissie spent most of her time touring Europe, where her debut record, Catching a Tiger, was released in June. An American release followed in August, courtesy of Fat Possum Records. Featuring production from a handful of artists including Jacquire King, Julian Emery, and Ed Harcourt, Catching a Tiger built upon Lissie's folkie California sound with a commercial appeal that helped land it in the Top Five of the U.S. Billboard Folk Albums chart and number 12 on the U.K. Albums chart.\n\nBack to Forever After an extensive period touring, particularly in the U.K., Lissie returned to the studio in 2012 with producer Garrett \"Jacknife\" Lee -- who had also produced albums for Snow Patrol and Robbie Williams -- to work on a follow-up. In October 2013, Lissie delivered her second full-length album, the glossy, '80s soft rock-influenced Back to Forever. The covers EP Cryin' to You followed a year later.\n\nMy Wild West In 2016, Lissie released her third studio effort, the Curt Schneider-produced My Wild West. Recorded in Los Angeles, Ojai, and Nashville, the album had a moody, noir-ish feel. It debuted at 16 in the U.K. and 171 on Billboard and was followed in the autumn by Live at Union Chapel.

The album received two Independent Music Award nominations for Best Americana Album and Best Country Song (Let Me Ride), and one win for Best Bluegrass Song (Long Song).\n\nThe Danberrys sing songs rich in pastoral imagery, about overcoming demons, being washed clean and starting anew, and love in its many forms. In conversation with both Ben and Dorothy, spirituality, and the concept of blooming into the full power of your brain and heart are topics that often surface, naturally suffusing into their lyrics with clever subtlety - more hinting than hollering.\n\n\u2018Give and Receive\u2019, 2012\u2019s self titled \u2018The Danberrys\u2019, and 2011\u2019s \u2018The Company Store\u2019 feature a similar cast of musicians. All three harness the unique skills of producer/multi instrumentalist Ethan Ballinger (Lee Ann Womack, Missy Raines) and fiddle player Christian Sedelmeyer (Jerry Douglas,10 String Symphony), with bassist Sam Grisman (Lee Ann Womack, David Grisman) and banjoist Kyle Tuttle (Jeff Austin Band, Hayseed Dixie) coming in on \u2018Give and Receive\u2019.\n\nLive, Dorothy is a fiend for the tambourine: \u2018I locked myself in our music room for hours\u2019 she says, describing her honing of the much overlooked instrument. Learning to play, she would follow the band Blue Mother Tupelo from gig to gig, gleaning techniques from Indianola-born Micol Davis and recordings of Dr John, the Meters, and Alan Toussaint.\n\nHaving embraced bluegrass in 2008 at The 5 Spot (bar in East Nashville) weekly bluegrass jam, Ben\u2019s acoustic guitar playing is a lynchpin in the Danberrys sound. His solid playing and grasp of theory leads to interesting harmonic shifts - letting their music straddle and dip into the crannies between genres.\n\nThe Danberrys have appeared at many festivals throughout the US Southeast and United Kingdom \u2013 including the CMA Festival, the International Bluegrass Music Association festival, the Americana Music Festival, the Cornbury Music Festival, the Maverick Festival, and many more. They are currently in the studio with producer/drummer Marco Giovino (Band of Joy, Patty Griffin, Buddy Miller) and executive producer Brian Brinkerhoff recording their fourth studio album.\n\nCY WINSTANLEY", "otherInfo": "Live streaming music on our FACEBOOK PAGE and INSTAGRAM PAGE.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Entry is a choose-your-own-donation basis between $1-100.

Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week. I only made it through one semester of college, but being around these amazing songwriters here in Austin\u2026 It\u2019s like getting an education.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ Ron ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10348712.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Chicago, Illinois", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ron Slomowicz (RONS) is a Chicago-based DJ/VJ/Journalist with a 25 year-long career.

Cascadia is the Vancouver trio\u2019s sixth album, and it sounds like quintessential Said The Whale: with a big-hearted blend of indie rock and atmospheric folk, it perfects all of the elements that have propelled the band to JUNO Award-winning, radio chart-topping success.\n\nCascadia represents a back-to-basics approach after the synth-fuelled experimentation of 2017\u2019s As Long As Your Eyes Are Wide. That previous record was made amidst intense personal turmoil, as band members Tyler Bancroft (vocals/guitar), Ben Worcester (vocals/guitar) and Jaycelyn Brown (keyboards) upended their sound while weathering personal tragedies and the departure of their long-term rhythm section.\n\nThis time around, with their personal lives back in order, the timing was right to return to the core of their signature style. \u201cWe sat down with guitars again and wrote songs in the way that feels the most natural to us,\u201d Tyler says. \u201cWe\u2019re just following the whims of the three of us, and it\u2019s a much more distilled version of what the band is.\u201d\n\nEarly recording took place in an assortment of studios across Vancouver and Toronto, including Tyler\u2019s own Ol' Dirty Bikeshed \u2014 quite literally the shed in the driveway behind his apartment. Three more songs were tracked with Hot Hot Heat\u2019s Steve Bays. From there, the group fleshed out the songs with producers Alexandre Bonenfant and Jay Merrow, culminating in a solar-powered session at Ben\u2019s family cabin on Gambier Island.\n\n\u201cWe were recording in the living room of the cabin,\u201d remembers Ben. \u201cAt one point you can hear me drop a plate because I was washing dishes and I didn\u2019t know they had hit record. The whole experience was just totally relaxed and comfortable. We were at home.\u201d\n\nThe results capture the rugged warmth of Said The Whale\u2019s West Coast sound. There are full-throated singalongs (\u201cWake Up,\u201d \u201cLove Don\u2019t Ask\u201d), meditative ballads drenched in moody ambience (\u201cGambier Island Green,\u201d \u201cOld Soul, Young Heart\u201d), and pop-rock bangers that are guaranteed to become instant favourites (\u201cUnAmerican,\u201d \u201cRecord Shop\u201d). Along the way, the listener can hear background chatter and snippets of studio experimentation, making for an album that\u2019s as spontaneous as it is meticulously beautiful.\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious, multifaceted sound that\u2019s reflected in Casadia\u2019s title. \u201cCascadia is the name of a proposed country made up of British Columbia and the western United States,\u201d notes Tyler. \u201cThat\u2019s the physical manifestation of our music.\u201d With rich harmonies drawn from California pop, crunchy guitars rooted in the lineage of Pacific Northwest rock, and naturalistic lyrics inspired by the water and mountains, Cascadia is the embodiment of everything Said the Whale does best.\n\nCascadia is Said The Whale\u2019s first album for Arts & Crafts and is due out Feb 8, 2019.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://sidedooraccess.com/shows/q1JNQmoDsyFxOiIkx5vn"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Danny Michel ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8097545.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Folk, Rock, World, International", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Danny Michel is a singer-songwriter based just outside Guelph, Ontario, Canada.\n\nBorn in 1970 and raised in Kitchener, Ontario , he began his professional career playing with the Rhinos before beginning a solo career.

His passionate performances are punctuated by a crisp acoustic guitar and soaring tenor vocals. This is best shown in his 2018 EP \u201cBreathe,\u201d a four song project consisting only of acoustic guitar, bass and vocals. And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.\n\nKyle takes in the world, processes it and turns it into song with his own special touch. He has a unique take on things, a view of the world others may not necessarily notice. He continues to grow as an artist, sharing his story and messages of love and peace.\n\nAbove all, though, it\u2019s still about the music.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lauren Jauregui ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:33 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jeff Mattson ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Yeule ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Natalie Gelman ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8980110.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Singer Songwriter, Alternative, Singer-songwriter, Alt Country, Pop Rock, Folk, Folk-pop, Pop Folk, Alt Rock, Americana, Folk Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Raised in the old West Village, NYC stomping ground of songwriting greats, Natalie Gelman grew up amidst artists and true bohemians.

The first release, Keep On Jumpin\u2019 on featured a vocal workout from super-divas Martha Wash and Jocelyn Brown, together for the first time ever. The song became a top 10 UK crossover pop hit and worldwide smash.

From SNAP to Annie Lennox to George Michael to Bjork, Todd\u2019s mixes bridge the ground between club cool and commercial accessibility. In 1995, his remix for Everything But The Girl\u2019s Missing became a worldwide smash, giving the British duo their first ever hit. He then rode the charts with mixes for Garbage (Stupid Girl), The Cardigans (Love Fool), Everything But The Girl (Wrong), 10,000 Maniacs (More Than This), Jamiroquai (Alright), The Cardigans (Been It), and The Lightning Seeds (You Showed Me),.among others.

As a solo artist, Ken O\u2019Malley easily commands the room; with his band he also rocks the house. Quickly drawing the audience in, it is no wonder that the Irish News describes him \u201cwithout question, as the single most enduring, influential and proficient of all Irish musicians in Southern California\u201d and the University of St. Thomas at Houston acknowledges him to be \"widely regarded as the finest Irish folk singer/songwriter in the United States today.\"\n\nArriving in Los Angeles from Ireland over 30 years ago, Ken O\u2019Malley was immediately offered a spot at Molly Malone's, the legendary Irish venue in the city's Fairfax district, and he hasn't stopped playing since. Through the years, O'Malley has performed solo and as part of The Mulligans, Blended Spirits and, currently, The Twilight Lords. He's shared bills with such artists as Mary Black, The Chieftains, The Saw Doctors, Michael Flatley and Pierce Brosnan and continues to be an ever-popular and near legendary constant on Southern California's Celtic music circuit. In addition to his musical performances, he can also be found on stage and screen in productions ranging from Ray Bradbury\u2019s \u201cFalling Upward\u201d to the Paramount Pictures feature \u201cPatriot Games\u201d.\n\nIndeed, Ken O\u2019Malley was born to perform. In Dublin at the age of 15, he opened for legendary balladeer Paddy Reilly at the equally legendary Old Sheiling Pub. By the time he turned 18, he was gathering professional credits, among them a stint with Trudy's People, a group he formed that played Gaelic shows on RT\u00c9, Ireland's national radio and television network. His fluency in the Gaelic language was earned from his education by the Christian Brothers and his summers in the West of Ireland.\n\nA true ambassador of Irish culture, he infuses every performance with the rich history of his native land and audiences quickly become engaged with his compelling stories. One show producer put it this way: \u201cHe holds nothing back. Whether singing a passionate ballad, playing a solo on the mandolin, or explaining the gloriously sad history of Erin his homeland, Ken O\u2019Malley is all-in, wide open to the world, and as true as an arrow\u2019s flight.\u201d Another simply stated that \u201cKen O'Malley connected with our audience in a way none of our other artists have.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "luke mcmaster ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8975769.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Pop Soul, R&b & Soul", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Icons of Soul, Luke McMaster\u2019s ambitious new project, offers a refreshing twist.\n\nFor not only is Brandon, Manitoba-born purveyor of contemporary blue-eyed soul paying tribute to classic R&B songwriting legends on his upcoming fourth album: he\u2019s recruiting them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m collaborating with legends like Lamont Dozier and Felix Cavaliere on some new originals,\u201d says McMaster, the Toronto-based singer, songwriter and producer best known for \u201cGood Morning, Beautiful,\u201d his 2013 Top 3 Billboard AC smash with new age pianist Jim Brickman.\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s especially cool about this project is that they\u2019re still hungry: as much as I\u2019m learning from these masters who wrote unforgettable hits that have formed the soulful soundtrack of my life, they\u2019re equally excited to work with me and my songwriting partner Arun Chaturvedi to write something fresh.\u201d\n\nAside from covering some of the classic immortal chart-toppers written by Rascals founder Cavaliere (\u201cGood Lovin\u2019,\u201d \u201cGroovin\u2019,\u201d \u201cPeople Got to Be Free\u201d) and Motown sensation Dozier of Holland/Dozier/Holland (\u201c(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave,\u201d \u201cI Can\u2019t Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch),\u201d \u201cYou Can\u2019t Hurry Love\u201d) - both\nmembers of the Rock \u2018N Roll and Songwriter Halls of Fame -McMaster co-wrote two songs apiece with the prodigies at their respective Nashville and Las Vegas homes, capturing the occasions on camera for a corresponding Icons of Soul TV documentary series.\n\n\n\u201cLamont told me this great story about his inspiration for \u2018I Can\u2019t Help Myself,\u2019\u201d McMaster recalls. \u201cIt turns out his grandmother owned a beauty shop and his grandfather would be hitting on all the ladies, saying things like, \u2018Hello, Sugar Pie;\u2019 \u2018How you doin\u2019, Honey Bunch?\u2019 When Brian and Eddie Holland asked him for some ideas for the song, he remembered his grandfather\u2019s flirting and the rest is history.\n\n\u201cStories like Lamont\u2019s that I can now tell my audiences enable me to entertain them even more and offer them a unique and authentic perspective whenever I perform.\u201d\n\nSoul and R&B are no strangers to Luke McMaster, even during his Brandon formative years.\n\n\u201cIn my small town, many of my friends were into hockey and metal like Iron Maiden, but I was always the one who sang pop music with an emphasis on Motown and soul,\u201d McMaster explains. \u201cI had a natural inclination to sing in that style and I loved it all \u2013 the falsetto, the major keys and the strong melodies \u2013 it just resonated with me.\u201d\n\nThat proclivity continued in the late \u201890s and early \u201800s, when he relocated to Winnipeg and enjoyed his impressive Canadian gold album run as a duo with Rob James in McMaster & James, (\u201cThank You,\u201d \u201cLove Wins Everytime,\u201d) with media often referring to them as the \u201cCanadian Hall & Oates.\u201d\n\nWhen he turned solo in 2002 and launched a more focused songwriting career and placing songs on multi-platinum and gold albums by Rihanna, Nick Lachey, Nick Carter and Kalan Porter (7 million sales and counting), he also recorded a succession of EPs and albums (2008\u2019s Time EP, 2013\u2019s All Roads, 2014\u2019s Heart of Soul and 2016\u2019s Trending) that contained both originals and sensual interpretations of such favourites as Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cSigned, Sealed, Delivered (I\u2019m Yours),\u201d Roberta Flack\u2019s \u201cFeel Like Makin\u2019 Love\u201d and the Bee Gees \u201cHow Can You Mend a Broken Heart.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us full circle to Icons of Soul, inspired in part by publishing giant Leeds Levy, president of Leeds Music, a director of ASCAP and a former president of Chrysalis Music Group and MCA Music Publishing (Elton John, Elvis Presley, OutKast) who planted the initial seed of the idea following a chance meeting with McMaster in Los Angeles.\n\nLevy made the calls that hooked McMaster up with Cavaliere and Dozier, and is playing a prominent role in hooking the Icons of Soul\nprincipal up with some other hopefuls on his wish list: Philly-based soul architect Thom Bell and blue-eyed soul progenitor Daryl Hall; prolific Brill building pop Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and \u2013 fingers crossed - Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music - and give them an experience that they will never forget.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Sunday may be a day of rest, but Sunday night is reserved for Smokey Robinson!

So Brent locked himself in an LA studio with producer and songwriter Lewis Pesacov, of Fool's Gold fame, and they put together the funky foundations for \"High To Low.\u201d Brent and Lewis built the song around the bass-line. The result is exuberant, good time rock n roll. Says Brent, \"It\u2019s a song about dancing like everyone is watching, and you don\u2019t give a damn.\"\n\nBlurring the lines between boisterous rock, R&B, and contemplative folk, Brent\u2019s infectious voice and knack for melody seem to swing effortlessly from quavering intimacy to a soulful roar as they soar atop his exuberant, explosive arrangements.\n\nGrowing up, Cowles first discovered the power of his voice singing hymns at his father\u2019s church in Colorado Springs. Having a pastor for a parent meant heavy involvement in religious life, but Cowles never quite seemed to fit in. At 16 he fell in love with secular music; at 17 he recorded his first proper demos in a friend\u2019s basement; at 18 he was married; at 19 he was divorced. Meanwhile, what began as a solo musical project blossomed into the critically acclaimed band You Me & Apollo, which quickly took over his life. The Denver Post raved that the group created \u201csome of the most exciting original music in Colorado,\u201d while Westword proclaimed that their live show was a \u201cclinic in roots rock mixed with old-school swing and blues,\u201d and Seattle NPR station KEXP hailed \u201cCowles\u2019 Otis Redding and Sam Cooke inspired vocals.\u201d The band released two albums and toured nationally before they called it quits and amicably went their separate ways.\n\nThe parting was a necessary but difficult one for Cowles. In the ensuing months and years, he would find himself alone more than ever before, at one point living out of his Chevy Tahoe just to make ends meet. But rather than break him, the experience only strengthened his resolve. \"High to Low\u201d gives the listener a real sense of Brent\u2019s current mood.

His 2009 album Sunrise On Avenue C won a New York Music Award for Best Americana Album, while the follow-up Wake Up And Dream ranked among the top albums of 2011 in WFUV's (NYC) Listener Poll.

He has performed with Bruce Springsteen, Willie Nile, Aaron Comess (Spin Doctors) and David Immergluck (Counting Crows). According to radio legend Vin Scelsa, Maddock's \"heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely crafted\" music \"touches the soul.\" As a songwriter, James recently had three songs co-written with Mike Scott on the new Waterboys album Modern Blues (which appeared in the Top 50 on the UK Albums Chart), a co-write with Gary Barlow (\u201cActress\u201d) on Barlow\u2019s new album (2X Platinum), as well as a cut (\u201cFragile\u201d) on the Dirt On My Tongue album by emerging UK artist Jo Harman.

In fact, the record includes a rare upbeat cover of the Townes Van Zandt chestnut \u201cLoretta\u201d. With his long-time group of players (Aaron Comess, Ben Stivers, and Drew Mortali) the record was made in Bushwick, Brooklyn in a mere two days of principle recording; made in the way of the hits of the past.

It wasn't long before he became a pivotal member of Bonnie Raitt's band, Rufus, Keith Richards & the Xpensive Winos and the Spin Doctors. Ivan launched his solo career with the acclaimed If My Ancestors Could See Me Now and, several years later, followed with Thanks. In between solo records, Ivan wrote, performed and/or recorded with Bonnie Raitt, Keith Richards, Robbie Robertson, The Rolling Stones and other major artists.\n\nIvan recently wrote and co-produced Saturday Morning Music, a highly autobiographical solo album. Saturday Morning Music is a timeless hybrid of Soul, Rock, and New Orleans Funk that translates into an incomparable modern musical gumbo that includes performances by Bonnie Raitt, Bobbie Womack, Keith Richards and Aaron Neville.\n\nIvan says:\n\"Saturday Morning Music was a chance to express myself and reflect on my life. The sound of this record is a mix of the music I grew up with as well as the music I've been involved with in the past couple of years. The songs are my story and the people who collaborated with me are not only my friends and family, but also my mentors. I am very fortunate to complete a project like this that is rewarding on so many levels. I feel extremely blessed to do this for a living.\"\n\nIvan is currently performing with his own band which recently appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, and has also re-teamed with his father and uncles, The Neville Brothers, for future recordings and live performances.\n\nBio taken from: http://www.ivanneville.com/biography.html", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Green Heron ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8814954.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Old-timey, Blues, Bluegrass, Americana, Folk", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Green Heron is an acoustic folk duo that combines guitar, fiddle, banjo, and vocal harmonies to bring the back porch to to the stage", "otherInfo": "Green Heron goes live in front of the faux wood panel.

In '87 Jask began djing at the age of 13. Influences consisted of soul, jazz, funk, r&b, hip hop, rock, new wave, disco, early electro & freestyle. A year later he would soon discover and quickly embrace a passion for the music that was coming out of Chicago & New York, known as the underground house sound. Jask was one of the major players to introduce the acid jazz sound to Tampa & most of central Florida in the early 90's. He held Tampa's longest running eclectic loungin' night called, \"Martini Jazz\". It took place every Thursday night at a club called the Castle which ran from '94 to '96. The \"Martini Jazz\" night brought some notoriety to Jask, which eventually led him to assist in the promotions of \"Groove Collective's (NYC) first ever performance in the Tampa area. In December of 1995, Jask started Tampa's first weekly soulful underground house night called, \"Jacks House\". During its successful over a decade ongoing run, Jask has played alongside various talented djs such as: Mark Farina, Dj Disciple, Benji Candelario, Marques Wyatt, Doug Smith, Brian Tappert , Miguel Migs, King Britt, Tedd Patterson, Tommy Musto, Kaskade, Pete Moss, David Harness, Rasoul, Julius Papp, Matthias Heibronn, Jay-J, Little Louie Vega, Frankie Feliciano, Karizma, Mark Grant, Johnny Fiasco, Diz, Collete, Heather, Tortured Soul, Cevin Fisher, Harry Choo Choo Romero, Cajmere, Lisa Shaw, JJK and many other luminaries in the dance music industry...As of Today, Jask still holds down Jack's House(Tuesdays) and a new night called, \"Paradise\" which has become the new Underground house night in the Tampa area and features guest djs from all around the globe. On the production and remix side of the musical pendulum, Jask has appeared on such notable labels as: Vega, King Street/NiteGrooves, I!Records, Swanky, Metaphor, K2/Vinylicious, Step Ahead, Erotic City, DeepTouch, Harlequin, SoulGroove, Soulfuric Deep, Soulfuric, Soufuric Trax, Catch 22, Deeplay, Solu, Om, Vino, Defected, Undo, Large Music, Salted, Sole Channel, Ultra, Rhythm & Culture, Transport & NeoDisco.

It is a special release in which Jask has dedicated it to his late mother who passed away July 31, 2001. Due to the successful Jacks house night in Tampa and his music productions, Jask has had the luxury of performing/djing across the United States and beyond. Such destinations include, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Denver, St. Louis, Atlantic City, Miami, Ft.

His introduction to music came through his family: the early influence of Jimi Hendrix from his brothers, Bluegrass, Folk and Mountain music from both his parents, and boogie woogie from his grandmother.\n\nHis love for the Blues and American Roots Music began to blossom after moving to Texas at the young age of 5. His uncle gave him a copy of \"The Vaughan Brothers: Family Style\" and he was hooked. He got his first SRV album shortly after, and was off into the world of Blues. He began digging deeper and deeper for the nastiest, grooviest, and raunchy sounds he could find and focused his list of influences to include Albert King, Howlin' Wolf, Hound Dog Taylor, Elmore James, Lightnin' Hopkins, Lightnin' Slim, Albert Collins, Otis Rush, Little Walter, Willie Dixon, and the list GOES ON!! He sat in with bands from the time he was 11 years old and began meeting and playing with musicians in the San Antonio Blues scene. Thanks to local SA sax legend Frank Rodarte, Will landed a weekly Friday night gig while in the 7th grade, and 3 or 4 years later landed another weekly gig and began refining his chops.\n\nDuring his senior year of high school, the band got the opportunity to open for and back up the great Stephen Stills in Austin, TX. From there he moved on to other inspiring moments in music, opening for Lynard Skynard, Three Dog Night, and quite a few other notable acts.\n\nAfter graduating from school he co-formed his own group in the style of Classic Country and Rock! The band played legendary Texas venues such as Luckenbach, TX and Gruene Hall. After that Will began playing with anyone and everyone and opened solo for greats such as Dick Dale. When he was 22, he traveled to France to play with \"Mitch Webb & The Swindles\u201d at the Crappone Country Rendezvous Festival. It was there he met the Great-Nephew of Texas Country Legend Ernest Tubb. He joined the band and began touring the USA and Europe with Lucky Tubb and the Modern Day Troubadours. After getting a bit burned out on the party lifestyle on the road, he left the Troubadours to get back to what he does best, playing Roots/Blues, and writing his own material.\n\nIn 2013 he released his first self-produced album \"Travelin' Man\" and proceeded to play all across the State of Texas, and various other places in the Continental U.S.\n\nCurrently, Will is performing full time with legendary Texas rockabilly group Two Tons Of Steel, touring throughout Texas, the Mid-West US and Europe. To keep up with Will's schedule with Two Tons, check out www.twotons.com. However, in the mean time, Will continues to write, record, perform and sit in with many notable seasoned musicians in the San Antonio area, including the Texas Tornados, among many others.

His latest studio album, Gotta Get Back, produced by Jano Rix of The Wood Brothers, and its companion release, Live At Mauch Chunk Opera House, further expand upon this reputation.\n\nGrowing up on a commune in rural North Carolina, the son of classically trained musicians, Seth Walker played cello long before discovering the six-string in his 20s. When his introduction to the blues came via his Uncle Landon Walker, who was both a musician and disc jockey, his fate was forever sealed. Instantaneously, Seth was looking to artists like T-Bone Walker, Snooks Eaglin, and B.B. King as a wellspring of endless inspiration. The rest is history. He's released seven albums between 1997 and 2015; breaking into the Top 20 of the Americana charts and receiving praise from NPR, American Songwriter, No Depression and Blues Revue, among others.\n\nIn addition to extensive recording and songwriting pursuits, Seth is consistently touring and performing at venues and festivals around the world. Along with headline shows, he's been invited to open for The Mavericks, The Wood Brothers, Raul Malo, Paul Thorn and Ruthie Foster, among others.\n\nSeth Walker is currently splitting his time between New Orleans and New York City after previously residing in Austin and Nashville.

With a bluesman\u2019s respect for roots and tradition, coupled with an appreciation for\u2014and successful melding of\u2014contemporary songwriting, Seth sublimely incorporates a range of styles with warmth and grace.

The fourth full-length from bi-lingual French-born singer Samantha Stephenson and post-punk guitar visionary Scott Helland, Hooray Beret is organic and largely acoustic but relentless in its downhill grooves and cheeky garage noir riffage. In song after song, Stephenson nails the vanities, traps, and disfiguring pressures of 21st century life as she delivers a genuinely affirmative and urgent call to action: the action of self-reflection.\n\nThe album-opening \u201cWah\u201d winks in awareness of this paradox. Over an insistent club beat and a stylish, Euro vocal hook, Stephenson instructs herself to \u201cstay at home on a Saturday night...diving into what feels real.\u201d A feminist theme of self-exploration-as-activism recurs in almost every song. The deliriously cool chorus of the New Wave and spy-toned \u201cLankey Bell Bottoms\u201d celebrates continual growth and the rejection of triviality, while the gorgeous jangle-pop of \u201cSing\u201d offers a compact time-lapse portrait of a woman ignoring or forestalling her true calling in five different decades of her life.\n\nHooray Beret\u2019s message of independence and the shedding of socially imposed identities is well-earned. For more than a decade, Frenchy and the Punk have been refining their own voice in many quadrants of the Balkanized post-punk world. They have essentially invented their own genre in which punk vitality and drive meets an evocative, cinematic way with exotic melodies and European-inflected percussive textures. A founding member of Deep Wound with J Mascis and Lou Barlow, Helland weaves dark riffs and layers of spidery melody in an acoustic/electric tone that is entirely his own. Stephenson sings with a gothy heft and authority that may remind one generation of Siouxsie Sioux and another of Grace Slick.\n\nThrough no design of their own, the Hudson valley, New York, based band has become an in-demand performer on the post-cabaret, mythic, and steampunk scenes, even as they eschew affectation and excessive theatricality. Their engaging, unjaded live shows convert strangers to fans regardless of the setting. Hooray Beret offers the strongest proof to date of this band\u2019s rich and edifying spirit of serious fun.\n\nThe product of a 1998 office romance, the two left their temp jobs, traveled as a solo musician (him) and artist (her) selling their wares until 2005 when, Stephenson, the sultry French born singer jumped onstage and joined, Helland, the fiery punk rock guitarist from the golden days of the hardcore scene, and Frenchy and the Punk was born. Along the way they became the 'jewel of the steampunk/Dark Cabaret scene' and were named one of the ''Top 25 duos in America' by Yahoo music.\n\nThe unlikely pairing has since released 6 full-length CDs, produced a live concert DVD and have performed all across the U.S. and in Europe.

Sounds pretty scary -- but for Chris Pinnella it's the stuff of natural habitat; an environment that the versatile vocalist has thrived in, whether performing with symphony orchestras around the country, leading his own combos of anywhere from 8 to 15 players, or (for several tours of North America and Europe) lending his finely honed skills to the prog-rock / crossover locomotive known as the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. That association with the late Paul O'Neil's spectacularly scaled project netted the New Jersey native a platinum record for his contributions to 'The Lost Christmas Eve' tour, and a chance to perform for an audience of over 1 million people, during a particularly raucous New Year's Eve in Berlin.\n\nIn the process the seasoned young performer - a singer whose influences run from the epic arias of Pavarotti, to the elegant jazz phrasings of Tony Bennett and the next generation concert hall mastery of Bocelli and Groban - built his brand as a bandleader through gigs at venues that range from big city nightspots to theatres across the United States such as The Algonquin Arts Theatre in New Jersey as well as Axelrod PAC, The Great Auditorium, The Pollack Theatre, Rahway PAC, The Newton Theatre, House of Independents, The Grunin Center for the Arts, McLoone's Supper Club and numerous Luxury Private, Charity, Fundraising Galas and Events throughout the country. He has also played such prestigious NYC venues as Birdland, The Rainbow Room, The Explorers Club, The Rose Theatre at Jazz! At Lincoln Center, The Cutting Room, and Feinstein's / 54 Below. Recently, Pinnella was tapped by American Young Voices, singing with the group as one of their guests vocalists alongside massive student choirs ranging from 3000-8000 young singers touring major arenas, including a sold out evening at The Prudential Center in Newark, NJ.\n\nPinnella began his career professionally at the age of 16 after an audition for Maestro Fr. Alphonse Stephenson & the Orchestra of St. Peter performing with the orchestra on and off throughout his career. Chris went on to pursue music and received his degree from Marymount Manhattan College in NYC. Post college he worked off-Broadway and regional theatre and had the opportunity to portray the title role of Simeon in the New Musical 'Simeon's Gift' which was co-written by icon Julie Andrews and her daughter Emma Walton-Hamilton. Pinnella spent a month with Ms. Andrews and the 6-person cast at Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, NY working side by side until the shows premiere. Pinnella also worked alongside Emmy, Oscar winning arranger Ian Fraser and the Tony nominated John Bucchino and Tony nominated director Marcia Milgrom Dodge (B'Way's Ragtime) on the project.\n\nCurrently Chris is working on writing and arranging his debut EP which is set to drop in 2020. The 11-track debut will feature mostly original material as well as a re-worked covers, namely Pinnella's always requested version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' will be given an overhaul complete with gospel choir and full orchestra. Infusing elements of jazz, classical, alternative, rock, and pop, Pinnella has his sights set on making 2020 his best year yet.\n\n\"Pinnella has been compared to vocal superstars Josh Groban and Michael Buble, but there is no doubt about the fact that Pinnella has a style that is completely his own. Every time he takes the stage he proves that he's one of the strongest forces in the classical crossover realm. His strikingly rich baritone and stage presence are unmatched.\" Ticketmaster\n\nGenre breaking.

They've played their shows, developed their sound, released their records and very quietly built a massive fan base in the process.\n\nWhat makes this band different from all the others is that their local fan base includes Bruce Springsteen, David Bryan, and Steve Cropper, all of whom have volunteered to perform on the band's album, Brotherhood.\n\nPrior to Brotherhood's release, Matt's talent was recognized globally when he got the nod to join rock legends Bon Jovi as their guitarist/backing vocalist on their 2015 stadium tour of the Far East.\n\nWhen some of your biggest supporters have sold over 200 million units, you know you're doing something right.\n\nIn addition to being a creative songwriter, Matt was recognized by the industry as a guitar great after winning a national guitar contest hosted by B.B. King and John Mayer through Guitar Center and Guitar World magazine. Matt beat out over 4,000 competitors to win the grand prize which consisted of multiple guitars, an endorsement from Gibson, a shopping spree at Guitar Center and a new car from Scion. This major accomplishment was the spark that jumpstarted his career and gave his band momentum for their future success.\n\nGrowing up on influencers ranging from Jimi Hendrix, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Rory Gallagher, ZZ Top, Robin Trower, Joe Walsh, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, the Matt O'Ree Band has taken all these diverse elements and forged a new iron.\n\nMatt's writing is inspired by many life experiences and years of study from the ones that have written the book on how to play real guitar rock music. Not as a photocopy, but in a new light that hasn't been seen in quite some time. Now is the time for real music and real musicianship to make a resurrection.\n\nRecently, the band has been promoting two new singles \"Without You\" and \"Through Time With You\" co-written and produced by John Ginty, B3 Organ player for the Allman Betts Band and the Dixie Chicks. The songs are an indication that the band is moving in a new direction forming a powerhouse team, blending Eryn's soulful vocals with Matt's gritty vocals and unparalleled guitar. Together these two front an incredible sound where the audience can feel the sparks between them. The chemistry on stage is unstoppable.\n\nEryn is an accomplished artist in her right. She won awards such as the BELK Southern Musician Showcase/Blues Artist as well as Asbury Park's Top Female Vocalist and Top Blues Band. She is also the youngest artist to be inducted into the NJ/NY Blues Hall of Fame and one of only three females who have been inducted. She has performed or opened for artists such as Don McLean, Gregg Allman, Johnny Winter, Robert Cray, Dr. John, Shemekia Copeland, The Gin Blossoms, Little River Band, Marcia Ball, Walter Wolfman Washington, Eric Lindell, Sonny Landreth, The Radiators, Johnny A and so many more. She also recently sang backup vocals with the Smashing Pumpkins on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\nTogether, the band takes their fans on a ride that hasn't been heard or seen at this level since the '70s. Their live show is like revisiting a Zeppelin concert at the Garden, and with Lex Lehman's smooth soulful bass, John Hummel's Bonham-esque drums, and Eryn's angelic and gutsy lead and backing vocals, Matt and company have built a foundation that can hold up the biggest house on the block.", "otherInfo": "Matt O\u2019Ree Band Live from Sofa Stage!\n--------------------------------\n\nMOB family- it\u2019s spring cleaning time!\nJoin Matt & Eryn 7pm EST for an acoustic Qtine house party and live Q+A from the comfort of your sofa.\n\nStreaming available on Facebook, YouTube, Mixer, and Twitch.\n\nVIRTUAL TIP JARS\n-------------------\nVenmo: @matthew-oree\nPayPal / Zelle: mattoree@mattoree.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Craig Cardiff ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10382336.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Singer-songwriter, Acoustic, Indie, Traditional, Folk, Roots", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Canadian Singer-Songwriter\n100+ million streams\n100% fan powered\n\nCANADA: brandhawa@apa-agency.com\nUS: domenique@ecgnyc.com\n\nMGMT - tom@ecgnyc.com", "otherInfo": "Please follow on instagram for live stream concert updates.\n\n\n\neveryday 7pm - 7:30pm where bring the songs to you for singalonging.\n\n\n\nplease follow on all the regular social media and such.\n\n\n\nRemember:\n\nbe honest, silly and kind. avoid mischief and jealousy.\n\n\n\nbe gentle with yourself. be gentle with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider supporting the music / team on patreon.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/craigcardiff"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Guitar & Whiskey Club ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9697586.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-17", "Genre": "Hard Rock, Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Guitar & Whiskey Club (GWC) was founded in 2015 by Jeff Donovan.

The band released two albums, the breakout debut, Flow, and the follow up release, The Corporate Sugar Daddies. CSD broke up after being passed over for an appearance on NBC's Saved By The Bell - a crushing blow to the group that was already dealing with the pressures of being a hip, local high school act. The rejection from Saved by the Bell knocked the band down and they never really got up. The only thing left do was move on.\n\nAfter graduating from High School a year early, and finding that substitute teaching was not his bag, he decided to move South and go to college. Brock kissed King George goodbye and made his way to Savannah, GA for what would eventually become a turning point in his life. Brock enrolled in The Savannah College of Art and Design where he pursued and obtained a degree in video and film production as well as a minor in sound engineering.

Not just because she was only one of about seven Black kids in her junior high school, but because of the compelling power of her shockingly big voice, which stopped people in their tracks from early on. Danielia\u2019s natural gift--raw, searing vocal chops combined with a deep, buttery tone--draws from the two different rich traditions that she absorbed early in her youth. On the one hand, she couldn\u2019t get enough of what her friends and neighbors were listening to: AC/DC, Zeppelin, the Stones. On the other, she was her mother\u2019s girl: daughter of a jazz singer and member of the church gospel choir, grooving to Mavis Staples, Etta James, Billie and Ella.\n\nThe happy collision of these two traditions is her new album, Rare Child, produced by Brad Jones (Jill Sobule, Over the Rhine) and co-produced by Joe Blaney (Shawn Colvin, Soul Asylum) and Danielia herself. On Rare Child, the sheer joy and pain she evokes in her songs instantly draw the listener in. She pulls, stretches and grips her lyrics with a strength that is startling considering this lovely young woman\u2019s seemingly happy-go-lucky demeanor and petite frame. Appearances aside, like male counterparts Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone or crossover icon Tina Turner, Danielia not only has embraced the notion of Black Rock--she has redefined it.\n\nVery early on, music played a major role in Danielia\u2019s life. It became not only the focus of what would become her career, but also, her saving grace and her best friend. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have music saving me every day, I wouldn\u2019t have a place to put a lot of emotions that I have that could potentially be destructive,\u201d says Danielia. \u201cIt\u2019s how I survive.\u201d Citing her mother, Danielia speaks lovingly about musical influences that aren\u2019t quite from the playbook of most Rock performers. \u201cI loved Phyllis Hyman\u2019s ..Somewhere In My Lifetime,\u2019\u201d she says, \u201cand Chaka Khan. But not just the popular stuff. It was her version of ..I Loves You, Porgy\u2019 from Gershwin\u2019s Porgy and Bess. My mom also listened to things like Bonnie Raitt and Loggins & Messina. But for me, it was listening to Donny Hathaway and Stevie Wonder\u2019s album Songs In The Key of Life: it was about that tone that I thought was the best. And Nancy Wilson singing ..Guess Who I Saw Today\u2019\u2019; the first time I heard that I was like, ..I don\u2019t even like that genre\u2019 but I couldn\u2019t get over the delivery. There was so much emotion. I like artists that were living and feeling whatever it was they were singing about.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, more than any other important influence was Danielia\u2019s fascination with musical movies of the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s. \u201cI had a thing for Bing Crosby,\u201d she bashfully admits. \u201cI was an old soul. What entertained me didn\u2019t entertain most kids. But we had a deep life. So anything that would take me out of that life was important. Anything that was singing and had a story to it I liked.\u201d A very young Danielia would stand up on a wood crate in her backyard, grab a stick, and sing Donna Summer\u2019s ..Last Dance\u2019 to the trees and a few semi-curious deer, When she realized she could really belt it out, she decided she might make singing her career. Soon, 12 year-old Danielia joined her mom and aunts in a gospel group called Brookes Ensemble Plus, where she learned harmony. Around that time, Danielia received her first guitar. While her mother couldn\u2019t afford to pay for lessons, she gave Danielia a ..How To\u2019 book that the young writer devoured, locking herself in her room until she came out a comfortable player and had penned her first song.\n\nDanielia\u2019s home life wasn\u2019t always easy. Danielia never met her father, a native of Puerto Rico. Moving around a lot and experiencing the hardships of racism, Danielia had to grow up fast. And although Danielia came from very humble beginnings, the one thing the family was not lacking was love and determination to succeed. Raising four kids on her own without a college degree, Danielia\u2019s mother nevertheless became the head of accounting for Houghton-Mifflin Publishing and was determined to make sure her children had the best education possible. To that end, books were in no short supply at home (spoils of the trade), and the children learned to read at an early age, while calculators were treated as toys. Following her mother\u2019s example, Danielia strove to make the most of her opportunities, and in her junior year of high school, she gained entry to the Mercer County School of Performing Arts. Danielia excelled and graduated at the top of her class, going on to obtain a full scholarship to the esteemed Bennington College in Vermont, from which she graduated with a degree in Theater Arts.\nBennington was a major turning point for Danielia. There, she studied with the great avant garde jazz trumpeter Bill Dixon. Noted for his vocalic playing style, Dixon, who founded the Black Music division at Bennington, gave Danielia the guidance she needed to refine her distinctive power as a singer. By her junior and senior year, she was studying tutorials. \u201cHe trained my ear. I\u2019d go to his class every day, and he\u2019d hit a note on his trumpet and ask me to match it. I thought it was the most God-awful thing. But I realize today that my pitch is the way it is because of this training. He taught me basic music theory, keyboard harmony and what music reading and writing was. During my senior year, he sent me to study singing with the classical department so I could learn breath, which is where I found my power. He would die to know I was singing rock \u2018n roll now instead of jazz, but he changed my whole perception of how you sing a song.\u201d\n\nUsing classic songs like Eden Ahbez\u2019s \u201cNature Boy\u201d and reading the lyrics as a soliloquy, Danielia learned that \u201cin any good song, there\u2019s a story; it\u2019s a moment. And it\u2019s the same when you get onstage with those same set of words and discover how you can convey that story to an audience. It helped me realize why I loved singing. It was about the story, the tone\u2014it wasn\u2019t about all the ..tricks.\u2019 It was about singing the line straight. That took more skill.\u201d She credits Dixon with teaching her how to \u201csing ..ugly\u2019.\u201d She explains, \u201cYou have to be able to sing the wrong notes if you ever want to sing beautifully. You have to be able to be ..ugly\u2019 sometimes. That\u2019s where you find your true beauty.\u201d\n\nQuietly writing her own songs under wraps while she studied, she performed several original compositions at a recital after she spent her final year at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. Drawing raves for her performance as well as her songs, she had learned well by then that her lyrics had to be pulled from her own life experiences in order to be authentic and received in such a positive light. \u201cI have to write from what I know about. It\u2019s like in acting. I can\u2019t play a character who\u2019s 70 at the age of 30. I don\u2019t know what 70 is. I could go to my grandmother and ask her and she might say, ..It\u2019s a loss of faith, it\u2019s tired\u2019 or whatever, but I don\u2019t know this because I haven\u2019t been there. I could only play a role and be true to something I felt. Because then it\u2019s true.\u201d\nAs a performer, Danielia is glad she grew up pre-American Idol. \u201cMost kids today, if you ask why they want to perform, they\u2019ll say they ..want to be a star\u2019 or ..be in the music business.\u2019 I liked music not because I saw it as a way to get out of the life I lived and have more than what I had, which wasn\u2019t that much. I did it because it was fun; it was like a drug. I\u2019ve always felt a little selfish when people say, ..I do it for the people.\u2019 I do it because it does something for me.\u201d\n\nRadio stations across the country appreciated Danielia\u2019s unique rock talent. After Danielia released her first studio album, 2005\u2019s Small White Town (Hipshake Records), WXPN/Philadelphia and home of the nationally syndicated World Caf\u00e9 named her \u201cArtist To Watch\u201d in 2005, slotted the album\u2019s soulful single, \u201cIt\u2019s Only Life\u201d into heavy rotation, and featured her on their HDNetwork broadcast of \u201cOn Stage at World Caf\u00e9 Live\u201d. WXRT in Chicago featured Danielia on New Year\u2019s Eve, where she brought down the house in a live performance broadcast by ABC.\n\nExtensive national touring followed. Danielia traveled the breadth of the country, opening for some of the greatest acts in music, from Blues legends Buddy Guy and Etta James to Pop Rock giant Bon Jovi, to the Southern Rock royalty of Gregg Allman, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Little Feat. Crossing boundaries was no problem for the versatile Danielia, who has wowed alternative rock audiences of the Flaming Lips, Staind and Collective Soul, among many others.\n\nDanielia\u2019s unique talent drew rave reviews, with notices on her \u201craw intensity\u201d (Essence magazine), her \u201csoulful voice and searing telecaster\u201d (Time Out NY) and for possessing \u201cthe sort of voice for which the phrase ..force of nature\u2019 was coined\u201d (Austin American-Statesman). Relix magazine named Danielia one of the \u201c5 Artists You Should Know\u201d in 2007 and New York\u2019s Amsterdam News proclaimed Danielia \u201ca powerful musician that cannot be ignored.\u201d\n\nThose high accolades often come from those who\u2019ve been blown away by Danielia\u2019s live act. Audiences that experience Danielia and her band live are hit hard with the sheer emotionalism of her songs, and Danielia\u2019s performance style is all about revisiting the feelings that brought those songs into being in the first place. \u201cI give you everything. I\u2019m going back, and these stories are obviously from my life. I\u2019ve picked moments that I can safely go back to time and time again without getting to a place where I can\u2019t collect myself. But, in my songs, I\u2019ll go to places that are still an issue for me. Like in the song ..Rare Child,\u2019 I say, ..On the day I was born/I hope my daddy cried.\u2019 Because I\u2019m still dealing with those issues. So you have to be careful. There\u2019s a responsibility to your audience too, because some of your fans will go there with you. And they don\u2019t know how to pull back either; they\u2019re riding on what you\u2019ve given them. You\u2019re handing them a drug too.\u201d Going back to the idea of music as an emotional release, for the artist and the audience in equal measure, Danielia not only accepts the responsibility, but rather, she is flattered and thrilled by it and sees it as an opportunity. \u201cWhen you hear some of the stories that people tell you and how the songs have helped them through tough times, that\u2019s as good as somebody telling you your album went platinum,\u201d Danielia says. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be about, and then you think, ..This might not be why I wrote this song, but this is what this person got out of it,\u2019 and I\u2019m glad.\u201d\n\nA stiff self-critic, Danielia admits to pre-show and pre-recording bouts of nervousness. \u201cEric Clapton always says, ..If I\u2019m not nervous, I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.\u2019 But then that\u2019s where you get all that energy and you end up giving it back to the audience. And it means just as much to me in the studio when I record. At no time do I take it lightly. I want it to come out well. So it\u2019s harder than live, but I like to record with the band in the studio and I can pull from that energy.\u201d\n\nBut, as much as Danielia is a performer, she is also a proud and dedicated songwriter.\nInspiration for songwriting for Danielia comes at all hours, and her mindset is to grab the moment no matter when it comes and write it down. \u201cI\u2019ve woken up from dreams with an idea, and it was my grandfather that used to say ..God woke you up, and wants you to go get a pen and piece of paper and write it down.\u2019 Otherwise, the idea you had goes away. If you\u2019re lucky enough to get the call, you gotta pick the phone up,\u201d she says. As for when this inspiration hits, contrary to popular belief, it isn\u2019t always as a result of sadness or depression in Danielia\u2019s case. \u201cIt does tend to happen on a cloudy, rainy day, and I do agree with artists that it does happen at moody moments, or when you first wake up, when you\u2019re feeling not necessarily at the peak of happiness. But you can\u2019t always be the source for everything. I collaborate a lot. Like on ..Make U Move\u2019 I collaborated with Kareem Devlin and Shelby Gaines, who I worked with on a lot of the songs on this record. The beauty of co-writing is that when you collaborate, your co-writers take you to a place you normally wouldn\u2019t go.\u201d For example, on \u2018Make U Move,\u2019 one of the most infectious, rocking tracks on Rare Child, \u201cKareem and Shelby brought the track, and I wrote the melody and the words, and there\u2019s no way I would\u2019ve come up with that myself.\u201d\nDanielia is very candid about why she would rather wear her heart on her sleeve in her songwriting than try to deliver her music through a manufactured persona. \u201cSome people create characters to make it easier for them to perform, but that\u2019s just not me. I feel that when someone pays to come see me, they\u2019re coming to see me, and so I owe them that. And that\u2019s more interesting to me. Rock \u2018n roll is real, and that\u2019s what people want.\u201d Danielia describes Rare Child as \u201ca party, in a sense. It starts out saying ..I\u2019m gonna rock your world\u2019 but then it arcs, has some soulful moments, and has some upbeat moments. Like going to a really good party, it isn\u2019t all non-stop ..woo-hoo.\u2019 You might get into a deep conversation with someone in one corner and share a joke with someone else in another. It\u2019s an experience.\u201d\nIn making Rare Child Danielia\u2019s goal was to create an album that she could really play. \u201cI think this is an album that the audience wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd because we didn\u2019t try to write singles or do anything like that, it came out being a real rock \u2018n roll album, and that\u2019s exactly the way you have to go about it. And when you\u2019re lucky, it ends up being this great effort, which I think it is.\u201d\nThe meaning behind the album title is at once personal and universal for Danielia. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out there, I don\u2019t see too many Black girls slinging guitars. And I know they\u2019re out there\u2014Tracy Chapman, Toshi Reagon\u2014but in the venues I\u2019m doing and the genre I\u2019m doing, a lot of times it\u2019s just me. Music is so manufactured nowadays. I feel I go back more to the classics, and Rare Child just reminds me of more of the 70\u2019s feel, and I think this album is a throwback to a time when music was less produced and a little bit more honest, accessible and realer. It doesn\u2019t make it better or worse than anything that\u2019s out there now, it just makes it what it is. Which is a little rare for right now. But a lot of people want that.\u201d The Philadelphia Daily News concurs, saying \u201c\u201cDanielia\u2019s music has the swagger of Let It Bleed-era Rolling Stones, her singing has the raw emotional power of Janis Joplin and her songwriting places her among the top new musical storytellers.\u201d\n\nNow releasing Rare Child on Adrenaline Records/ADA, Danielia has put her remarkable voice, heart, and soul into a record that truly rocks.

When given a stage from which to sing, he simply soars. The soul-stirring wail of Brooklyn-by-way-of-Western Massachusetts singer-songwriter Sean McMahon belies the otherworldliness of his inspiration, while beautiful sonic landscapes change shape and color around it, ruthlessly bending genre, hopelessly without explanation.

Chris shook things up. The engineer played piano. The drummer played guitar. Chris took a Chuck Berry standard and turned it on its head and it came out in a minor key. They added in another surprise cover (you\u2019ll just have to listen to find out what it is). And to top it off, yes, Chris went electric.\n\nAt the core of CALL ME LUCKY are the ten songs. They offer commentary on the human condition that only Chris Smither can put pen to. These songs pull from deep in the soul that make for a kind of reflection \u2013 an introspection \u2013 that comes over someone only when facing a higher power or natural disaster. There\u2019s no choice but reflection. From the opening track of \u201cBlame\u2019s On Me\u201d to \u201cLower the Humble,\u201d Chris raises his own bar when it comes to his songwriting. The rollicking \u201cNobody Home\u201d offers a sharp observation of the 21st century while \u201cChange Your Mind\u201d reaches back to Chris\u2019 blues and folk roots as a young man.\n\nAs most Smither aficionados know, Chris recognizes great songs by other writers and always includes a couple of songs by other musicians. Chris\u2019 deftness as a song interpreter is often overlooked and yet his ability to choose a song and then make it his own is almost as important as his signature guitar styling and his command of the songwriting craft. Listen, you\u2019ll hear for yourself. Chris\u2019 2018 rendition of Chuck Berry\u2019s \u201cMaybellene\u201d is menacing.\n\nGoodrich goes on to say, \u201cThere have been some out there - like Bonnie Raitt, The Dixie Chicks, Emmylou Harris, John Mayall, Diana Krall, and others \u2013 they not only know the strength of a Smither song, they get how coverable he is. Chris himself is the ultimate interpreter of others\u2019 songs, and being the songwriter he is, we thought, \u2018Let\u2019s have Smither cover Smither. So one afternoon we let loose and had some fun. Chris dug in and gave these songs new identities. An interpretation. That\u2019s how we ended up with the second disc.\u201d\n\nSide B of CALL ME LUCKY transcends the core record and takes the listener on an unexpected sonic journey. And mixing it all up is that surprise cover.\n\nAnd that is CALL ME LUCKY.\n\nFans from around the world continue to fill concert venue after concert venue eager for the galvanizing ride of a Chris Smither concert. Reviewers including the Associated Press, NPR, MOJO, and The New York Times agree that Chris remains a significant songwriter and an electrifying guitarist - an American original - as he draws deeply from folk and blues, modern poets and philosophers. And with CALL ME LUCKY Chris keeps doing just that. For some, a record like Chris\u2019 last release, the double CD 50-year career retrospective Still on the Levee would have been a monumental way to wrap up a long and successful career, to hang it up and go out on a high note.\n\nNot Chris Smither.\n\nAs he says, \u201cThis is what I do.\u201d\n\nEighteen records in, 83 songs over a lifetime, so far.\n\nCALL ME LUCKY is proof Chris Smither has more to offer. And aren\u2019t we lucky.\n\nKeep going, man.

Described by DJ Mag as \u201cone of the most talented new forces in modern dance music today\u201d and by fellow future house innovators Art Department as their favourite producer, Lee has firmly established himself in dance music\u2019s collective consciousness. Lee and his Hot Natured band mates Jamie Jones and Infinity Ink are currently leading a whole family of like-minded producers that includes Richy Ahmed, WaFF, Digitaria, Robert James and Miguel Campbell, who are currently re-writing the rulebook of how to make evocative, emotive house music. In 2010 he was the highest new entry into Resident Advisor\u2019s key Top 100 DJs poll, entering at number 38 and by 2011 he had climbed to number 18 in the chart, a huge feat given that he only played his first European gig in 2009. Having hit the UK charts with \u2018Benediction\u2019 as part of deep house super group Hot Natured, with genre-spanning hits such as \u2018Electricity\u2019 (with MK) and \u2018Reverse Skydiving\u2019 under his belt, alongside remixes of chart topping artists such as Rudimental and Lana del Ray, Lee Foss is one of the most exciting forces in modern house music. Not forgetting Hot Creations, the groundbreaking label he runs with partner Jamie Jones, which is arguably one of the world\u2019s most innovative house labels. His unique sound, born out a lifelong love of classic house, 90s hip hop, 80s electro and Detroit techno, has earned him fanatical grassroots support from clubbers in both Europe and North America. Born and raised in Chicago, the birthplace of house, Lee now lives between London and Los Angeles. Lee made his name on both sides of the Atlantic playing at clubs like Fabric (London), Warung (Brazil), The Warehouse Project (Manchester), The Standard Rooftop (Lost Angeles), The Marcy Hotel (Brooklyn), Watergate (Berlin) and Spybar (Chicago). Lee\u2019s rapid rise to prominence has been as much down to his focused but all-encompassing approach to DJing as it has his pioneering take on nu-school house and synth-heavy techno, backed up by a string of hit releases on labels like No 19, Culprit, Wolf+Lamb and his own Hot Creations imprint. While growing up in Chicago, Lee cut his teeth on the clubs and raves of the late 90\u2019s, experiences that initially sparked his interest in house and disco. However, it was a chance visit to Ibiza back in 2001, that changed his whole approach to music and helped steer his musical destiny for the next decade and beyond. It was in Ibiza that summer that he first became friends with Jamie Jones and the pair formed a tight brotherly bond that quickly blossomed into their highly acclaimed Hot Creations label partnership with Richy Ahmed, and later their Hot Natured band project with Infinity Ink and their worldwide event brand, Paradise. Since then, Lee has gone on to release a string of hits on a variety of labels including \u2018The Edge EP\u2019, \u2018Equilibrium\u2019, \u2018U Got Me\u2019 and \u2018Starfruit EP\u2019, all of which have been independently awarded \u2018Tune of the Month\u2019 in Mixmag at various points. Lee has recently joined forces with house legend MK and vocalist Anabel Englund to form a second electronic outfit, Pleasure State. The trio\u2019s first EP, Electricity, has already landed to much success with Pete Tong announcing the title track as his \u2018Essential New Tune\u2019 earlier this year. With this many accolades under his belt in such a short space of time, it would be easy for Lee to rest on his laurels but this couldn\u2019t be farther from the case. Hot Natured\u2019s latest single release \u2018Reverse Skydiving\u2019, is shaping up to be one of the summer\u2019s biggest hits. The debut Hot Natured album is due to follow in the summer, and backed by Pete Tongs legendary FFRR imprint is already garnering incredible anticipation ahead of its release. The innovative Hot Natured Live Show kicked off with two back to back sold out shows at Brixton Academy earlier this Spring and will lead into the band headlining slots at the new Silver Hayes dance stage at Glastonbury, Sonar in Barcelona, Bestival on the Isle of Wight and Wavefront in Chicago.

The stakes are different.\"\n\nThose stakes are what lie at the heart of David Wax Museum's fourth and boldest studio album to date, \"Guesthouse.\" It's the sound of a band reconciling the accountability of marriage and parenthood with the uncertainty and challenges of life on the road; of coming to terms with the limitations of the \"folk\" tag that launched their career and pushing past it into uncharted musical territory; of reimagining their entire approach in the studio to capture the magic and the bliss of their live show. In typical David Wax Museum fashion, the songs on \"Guesthouse\" are simplistic and sophisticated, elegant and plainspoken all at once. Rather than succumbing to the weight of the newfound responsibilities that landed on their doorstep, the band has leaned into the challenges to capture a brilliant portrait of the messy beauty of it all.\n\nThe roots of David Wax Museum stretch back nearly a decade, and all the way from New England to Mexico. As a student at Harvard, Wax began traveling south of the border to study and immerse himself in the country's traditional music and culture. Back in Boston, he met fiddler/singer Suz Slezak, whose love of traditional American and Irish folk music fused with Wax's Mexo-Americana into a singular, energetic blend that captivated audiences and critics alike. Their 2010 breakout performance at the Newport Folk Festival made them the most talked-about band of the weekend, with NPR hailing them as \"pure, irresistible joy.\" They released a trio of albums that earned escalating raves everywhere from SPIN and Entertainment Weekly (who described them as sounding \"like Andrew Bird with a Mexican folk bent\") to the New York Times and The Guardian (which dubbed the music \"global crossover at its best\"). They earned an invitation to return to Newport, this time on the main stage, as well as dates supporting The Avett Brothers, The Carolina Chocolate Drops, Buena Vista Social Club, and more.\n\nIt was on the road over these past few years as the band and audiences grew, though, that Wax could feel their exuberant live show evolving beyond its formative roots.\n\n\"I felt empowered to start the band because of my time in Mexico studying folk music,\" Wax explains. \"In Boston, the term 'Americana' or 'folk' was just this catchall to describe what everyone was doing. It was helpful to use that to talk about our music at first, but we've found that our hearts feel most shaken, and the band fires on all cylinders, when we're putting on a rock show. What we've tried to retain about our folk origins is the warm sound of people playing acoustic instruments together in a room. But, by embracing more of an indie rock approach, we've colored this record with synthesizers, layers of percussion, and adventurous sonic processing. The mental shift of it helped us feel like we could do anything we wanted. There were no rules that we had to follow in terms of what was 'authentic.'\"\n\nPart of the inspiration for the shift was the presence of guitarist and producer Josh Kaufman, who sat in with the band on tour and added new sounds and textures that the they'd never experimented with before. When it came time to record \"Guesthouse,\" the band knew he had to helm it in the studio.\n\n\"The songs entered this Technicolor, 3D world with Josh,\" explains Wax. \"Aside from his contributions to the arrangements, he really wanted us all to be in a room playing the music together live so that the groove would be central. We brought in two other drummers, and there was a real focus on having as much percussion happening at the same time as possible. We gravitate towards that naturally because of the Mexican influences, all of the syncopations and 6/8 dance rhythms and the energy that that gives us, but we really embraced it this time around.\"\n\nThat emphasis on groove sucks you in from the opening seconds of the kickoff track, \"Every Time Katie,\" a whispered come-on that roils and pulses like an anxious heartbeat and features gorgeous call and response vocals from David and Suz. It's followed by \"Dark Night Of The Heart,\" which pushes the sonic envelope further than any previous David Wax Museum track, blending chamber strings, psychedelic vocal filters, explosive drums, and swirling synthesizers.\n\nWritten partially in Mexico and partially in western Massachusetts, the lyrics on \"Guesthouse\" find Wax writing with more direct, personal honesty than ever before.\n\n\"I had felt really reluctant to talk about personal stuff in the past,\" says Wax. \"I was writing personally, but there were lots of things I was obfuscating or filtering through a character to protect myself from putting too much out there. But it got to a point where it was taking a lot more energy than it was worth to maintain that privacy. When we had our daughter, Calliope, it felt like this sudden release because talking and singing about our lives was becoming more and more integral to what we were doing as artists and who we were as people.\"\n\nThe title track, which draws on several traditional Mexican songs for musical inspiration, is a tongue-in-cheek reflection on the life of a traveling musician hunting for a free place to crash, while \"Lose Touch With The World\" faces down the reality of living a life far removed from that of your friends and family, and \"Young Man\" is an earnest musing on growing older.\n\n\"It's about being a parent and coming to terms with what your ambition is,\" explains Wax. \"What part of that is essential to who you are, and what part can you let go of? We have to check in with ourselves and ask what we're doing and why we're doing it more often now because we're not just us putting ourselves through the mental and physical sacrifices of touring anymore,\" he continues. \"Now Calliope is going through it with us, and Suz's dad and my cousin Jordan are going through it with us on the road. And because we're constantly checking and making sure we're doing this for the right reasons, that we feel honest in our hearts about it, I think that's brought new life to what we're doing and a new energy and a new level of commitment.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment brought beautifully to life on \"Everything Changes,\" as Wax and Slezak sing, \"Everything changes / when two becomes three.\" The song was written in response to all of the good-natured warnings about what having a child would mean for the couple, the freedom and sleep and sanity they might lose out on. Instead, they choose to focus on everything they've gained: a beautiful daughter, a stronger bond with their families and fans than ever before, and without a doubt, the most exciting album of their career. For David Wax Museum, the stakes may be higher, but that just means the rewards are even bigger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Victoria Gordon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10349732.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Los Angeles, United States", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Baby Bernadette belting Broadway showtunes.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ellie Holcomb ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7358736.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-Songwriter Ellie Holcomb, a Nashville native, began her musical career by touring the country with her husband in Drew Holcomb and The Neighbors.

The night we played Bonnaroo a couple years ago, I sat with my younger brother Sam, my wife Ellie, and a few other dear friends, reclining in plastic lawn chairs in the midnight Tennessee heat outside our tour bus, drinking wine and listening to music. After a decade of touring, (over 1700 shows) and making records, it\u2019s easy to forget the magic of music. We took turns introducing each other to new bands and artists, talking about our lives, our dreams, our failures. Music has always had a medicinal quality to me, and that\u2019s why I started writing songs and touring in the first place. I first needed the medicine when I was seventeen. I lost a brother that summer, 1999. He was a great kid, lived life from the view of a wheelchair, and was gone without warning a few days before his 14th birthday. I took lots of medicine, from Radiohead and Bob Dylan, from Pearl Jam and Otis Redding, from Bob Marley to the Temptations, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to Rage Against the Machine. I played the guitar in my bedroom, learned songs I loved, sang along in my car alone or with a friend. A year later I went to college in Knoxville and I became an addict. I was introduced to the medicine of Patty Griffin, Whiskeytown, Springsteen, Tom Waits, the Jayhawks, Wilco, Beck and hundreds more that could fill pages. I went and saw their shows and played their records over and over and over. The honesty, the intellect, the stories, the raw emotion, the rhythm, the vulnerability; it all made me feel like I was not alone. Music was a way of saying, \u201cme too,\u201da way of finding hope and meaning in the sorrow and confusion of life. Somewhere in those late college years, I started writing songs, at first feeble attempts, but it grew and grew, and I got better and better. I booked shows, I made myself vulnerable and stood onstage and sang earnest songs about love and joy, pain and tragedy. I convinced myself that making medicine was something I could take a swing at. After graduating, over a cup of coffee, I asked my dentist father what he thought about my dream, and he asked me one question, \u201cAre you going to work hard at that?\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d I replied. \u201cWell let\u2019s go to the guitar shop and I\u2019ll buy you the best one I can afford.\u201d I hit the road, and I hit it hard. I found a band of agile, competent musicians whose musical library is vast and deep and demanding. Along the way, I married the girl I always wanted. She quit her teaching job and joined the band, toured with us for seven great years. We made several records, and spent the majority of the last decade on the road. You may have heard our music on TV. We\u2019ve had our songs on dozens of shows like Nashville, Parenthood, How I Met Your Mother. We have toured with artists like the Avett Brothers, John Hiatt, Needtobreathe, and a host of other kindred souls. We have sold out our own shows in places from Chicago to Austin, LA to New York, London to Denver, on stages we never dreamed we would play, and selling over 100,000 records in the process, all while staying independent. Our music is simple and heartfelt, built to inhabit people\u2019s day to day lives, like so many of the records I have loved over the long haul in my own life. Medicine is by far the best music we have ever made. When I played it for a respected friend, I asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d The response was, \u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s always been there.\u201d We recorded the whole album in eight days, co-produced by the band and Joe Pisapia (Ben Folds, KD Lang, Guster, Josh Rouse) at Joe\u2019s Middletree Studios, in East Nashville, about a mile from my house. We recorded one song at a time, until it was finished. No studio tricks, just me and a great band working together, creating, having fun, embracing the sorrow. It\u2019s always been about the song for us, a community of musicians surrounding that song and bringing it life, trying to make it sound like it has always been there.\nThe twelve songs on Medicine deal with loyalty, hardship, marriage, friendship, feeling like an outsider, and wrestling with God. \u201cYou\u2019ll Always Be My Girl\u201d is a love song to my bride Ellie, who after eight years on the road with us, is stepping away from the band. I came up with the first line when I was playing with our daughter Emmylou before putting her to bed. I wasn\u2019t trying to write a song, just entertaining her and I came up with the first line \u2013\u2018 from the start of spring to the autumn leaves, and the summers and winters between...\u201d After tucking her in, I dashed off the rest of the song in 45 minutes. It was the night before we went into the studio for the last time. When Ellie got home, I played it for her. She loved it, and we cried together for a moment and celebrated what we\u2019ve got and what we\u2019re grateful for. The next day, I taught it to the band, and we recorded the 24-hour-old song in one take. Nathan Dugger on piano, Rich Brinsfield on upright bass and me singing, just sitting in a circle. That ethos embodies the whole experience of making this record. \u201cShine Like Lightning\u201dis a song about us being an underdog band, never embraced by the powers of radio, major labels, large corporate sponsorships, and in light of that we have a healthy chip on our shoulder. But our music making has brought us, and our fans, a lot of happiness, it seems. This is an ode to ten years of doing it our own way, on our own terms, in spite of the roadblocks of cynicism and criticism, those who would \u201ctake something beautiful and make it feel small.\u201dIt\u2019s an anthem for our band and our fans, that we are going to \u201cShine Like Lightning!\u201d critics and cynics be damned. Breaking with my previous autobiographical songwriting bent, I wrote songs like \u201cHeartbreak\u201d and \u201cSister Brothers,\u201d based on the experiences of friends instead. Elsewhere, \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d looks back on the nostalgia and loss of a teenage romance. The grooving, call-and-response \u201cHere We Go\u201d was inspired by that particular night shared with friends at Bonnaroo. Medicine closes with\u201cWhen It\u2019 s All Said and Done.\u201dIt\u2019s about questioning whether God is real and whether he cares about us or not ... and not walking away from that, but holding on to it like you\u2019re hanging on to the side of a cliff, and that\u2019s where I find myself at this point. More than anything else, Medicine is born out of the stories we are told. The email from a fan who was on the verge on suicide but our song gave her glimmer of hope to keep hanging on. The story by the bus of fans who danced their first dance to another one of our songs. The mom who sings our music to her kids before they go to sleep, begging for peace and health and a happy life. The people who dance in the back of the rock club and have a moment of joy in a world of suffering. We only hope to add to the soundtrack, in the same way that all those artists and bands have done for me. Making medicine, Music, it makes you feel good, makes you feel understood like you\u2019 re not alone, not a rolling stone, you\u2019 re not the only one on the road.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Covenhoven ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8823117.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Indie Folk, Folk, Indie Rock", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Colorado native Joel Van Horne, aka Covenhoven, has dubbed his new critically acclaimed album the ocean record, because he wrote the songs while touring and exploring the west coast over the past 2 years.

Love is an art,\" sings Vanessa Carlton on the title track of her sixth album, Love Is An Art. Like the record itself, the song is a meditation on the eternal seesaw that is human connection: the push, the pull, the balance, the bottoming out. It's that constantly evolving nature of love, expectations and compassion that Carlton analyzes from all angles on Love Is An Art, from romantic, to parental, to the friends that hold us up and the leaders that repeatedly let us down. And on tracks like the album's opener, \"I Can't Stay the Same,\" that also includes the relationship with the person staring back at us in the mirror, each and every morning.\n\n\"Love is the energy you put out into the world,\" says the Nashville-based Carlton, who was inspired in part by the 1956 book The Art of Loving by philosopher Erich Fromm, and by stories and struggles both in her interior world and the world around her. \"And it can be so incredibly messy at times.\"\n\nProduced by Dave Fridmann (MGMT, Flaming Lips), Love Is An Art finds Carlton reckoning with toxic relationships (the confessional \"Miner's Canary\"), eternal partnership (\"Companion Star\") and the children who fill the world with love and grace while politicians fill their pockets (the passionate \"Die, Dinosaur,\" written after the shootings in Parkland, Florida). And true to Carlton\u2019s skill as both a lyricist and an instrumentalist, the arrangements on Love Is An Art tell these tales as vibrantly as the words themselves: piano parts that speak of rage and tenderness, synths that burst and glow like dawn.\n\nLove Is An Art doesn't just explore connections \u2013 it was also born of one. Carlton wrote the album with the acclaimed Nashville-based singer-songwriter Tristen, camped out and working while her daughter napped. \"This record is about being out of my comfort zone,\" says Carlton. \"What's going to happen when we do things that people assume are not naturally a match, like working with Dave Fridmann? I loved the idea of working with someone who\u2019s known for a palette that isn\u2019t associated with me, but it was a fit the second we started working together. Or what could happen when I sit with another writer, and just collaborate?\"\n\nThe result is an extremely dynamic LP filled with sticky melodies and haunting phrases as well as experimental constructions: super high highs, super low lows, and song structures that break the mold from the expected. Unlike her previous, critically-acclaimed 2015 album Liberman, which Carlton describes as having a calming, almost meditative palette, Love Is An Art reads, and sounds, \"red.\" Huge. Passionate. The color of a beating heart.\n\n\"I want to run, but I won\u2019t get very far,\" Carlton sings on \"The Only Way to Love,\" the album's first official single. \"Cause I can\u2019t fight the force of my young beating heart. Like a soldier's steady march, answering the call. It\u2019s the only way to love.\" It's a song about loving with everything you've got \u2013 that love itself is precious and rare enough to commit to, above all. \"When you believe in a relationship, in a connection, you are actually believing in yourself,\" she adds.\nCarlton has constantly challenged that belief, in both herself and the expectations that surround her throughout her lengthy, accomplished career: she attended both the School of American Ballet and Columbia University, and was discovered as a singer-songwriter/pianist when a cassette tape demo was given to legendary music impresario Ahmet Ertegun. With her debut single \"A Thousand Miles,\" Carlton soared to the top of the Billboard charts and garnered multiple Grammy nominations, though that song is only a small fraction of the body of work and artistic identity she's developed since then, ever evolving and growing as a performer and songwriter. In the summer of 2019, she pushed that even further, making her Broadway debut as Carole King in Beautiful: The Carole King Musical.\n\nThere's a striking image on the cover of Love Is An Art: it's a delicate hand grabbing a tiger by the tail, but it's not meant to conjure the familiar colloquialism. Instead, it captures something different. It\u2019s a about going after something bigger than you, more powerful than you, something that you\u2019ll never be able to really control: but you grab it anyway. Something like love.

Hailing from the Central Louisiana town of Alexandria, David has steadily built his reputation as an entertainer, playing high energy, musically diverse shows driven by what may be his biggest asset \u2013 that powerful, soul-drenched voice. America got a taste of David\u2019s promising talents when he made the finals of Nashville Star in 2007. Now David is delivering on that promise releasing brand new music showcasing what his followers across the country have been raving about for years.\nDavid\u2019s musical education began early in life as a kid. He was taking in the pop-influenced country sounds of Kenny Rogers from his dad\u2019s record collection before rocking out at Metallica and Guns-n-Roses concerts with his Junior High buddies. The new wave of 90\u2019s country, particularly Garth Brooks\u2019 seminal No Fences album, had a big impact on David. David\u2019s growing obsession for music soon gave way to performing for audiences; he says \u201cI never really wanted to do anything else besides singing and entertaining\u201d. Further musical explorations led David to expand his R&B vocal skills, singing in a Juniorr High group styled after the harmonies of Boyz II Men. By his early 20s David had started playing shows in nearby Hammond, La where he met a local producer. That chance meeting led to a few recording sessions and the beginning of David\u2019s trips to Nashville to take his first swing at the big time.\nIn early 2000, David made further connections in Music City and began working on his first full length album DSR with some of Country Music\u2019s top musicians and songwriters. Over the next few years David toured the country; performing frequently gave David an invaluable opportunity to develop his distinct vocal style and energy-driven live show. \u201cThere\u2019s an experience and wisdom in that environment,\u201d David says, \u201cyou learn to be professional at all times, whether you are playing for two people or a crowd of thousands\u201d.\nOpportunity came knocking in Spring 2007 when he was selected to star as a contestant on the new season of TV\u2019s premiere country competition Nashville Star. Besides the invaluable national exposure the show brought him, David also performed on the 40-city Nashville Star tour and had a chance to interact with many of the nearly half million fans who voted for him. Nashville Star also introduced David to many Music Row veterans, in particular Shawn Pennington, the former manager of mulit-platinum acts Big & Rich, Alabama\u2019s Randy Owen and new group Thompson Square. Shawn was very impressed with what he saw in David\u2019s live show during the Nashville Star tour. \u201cAt the time I was working with Big & Rich and their live show is what really set them apart. They owned the room every night and I\u2019ve seen David do that exact same thing,\u201d Shawn says. \u201cDavid can go into a room where no one knows his songs, and by the end, they are all giving him a standing ovation\u201d.\nBy 2008, David and Shawn were working together finding songs and beginning the process of recording a new album. David also continued collaborating on songs of his own with some of Nashville\u2019s top writers. All I Really Wanted to Say was the first album released on David\u2019s own independent label DSR Entertainment in 2010. His hit single \u201cTwenty Years Late\u201d rocketed to #56 on the Billboard Chart. David continues to successfully tour performing his own brand of country music to riveted crowds earning him a new legion of dedicated fans.\nDavid has also been hard at work writing, producing and recording his newest project due to release later this year. He explains, \u201cI hope this latest EP will show my fans the growth I\u2019ve made as a songwriter and artist, while exploring the depth of my musical influences.

Dobson has the voice and authority to tie it all together, and turn it into a cohesive unit that soars yet remains beautifully delicate and intimate.

But Claude has also influenced the very fabric of the dance community, A&Ring an impeccable roster of acts like Justin Martin, Fisher, Shiba San, Catz n Dogz, Riva Starr, Tim Green, Breach, Eats Everything, Walker & Royce, Shadow Child, and countless others. (And even naming a few of these artists.)

Some other music highlights include working on records with Bootsy Collins, Rihanna, Disclosure and Kevin Saunderson, as well as a few #1 and #2 hits on Beatport. His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world. He continues to innovate and curate new events with a 2 additional multi-day festival mirroring his Birdhouse radio show in Chicago, and his record BBQ event series that has been going since 2003!\n\nVonStroke also loves art; most notably pop-surrealist artwork that he has commissioned for the last 7 years on Dirtybird for all of the releases. Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude.

Perhaps the greatest element of David Guetta\u2019s illustrious story is not simply his countless personal successes, but his wider game-changing approach. From making dance music and DJ culture more of a viable and legitimised commercial success than ever before to finally uniting the worlds of electronic and urban music, the repercussions of his visionary attitude cannot be underestimated.\n\nDavid has established himself as arguably the world\u2019s biggest and most successful DJ of all time by fusing dance music with urban artists. By teaming up with some of the biggest names in hip hop and R&B, and reinventing their sound for the electronic dancefloors, Guetta created pop alchemy. The ensuing hits such as \u2018I Gotta Feeling\u2019 with Black Eyed Peas, \u2018When Love Takes Over\u2019 with Kelly Rowland and \u2018Sexy Bitch\u2019 with Akon propelled him to superstardom. They also set a new template for the sound of commercial radio. This was instrumental in turning electronic music into the biggest youth movement since hip hop.\n\nOf course, his own groundbreaking accomplishments cannot be overlooked either. 50 million album and single sales; over 10 billion YouTube and Spotify plays; numerous #1 singles and Platinum and Gold certifications across the globe; two Grammys for Best Remixed Recording and four further nominations; one of the most successful club nights Ibiza has ever seen; one of the biggest social media followings of any DJ/producer; the first DJ to be on the cover of Billboard, the list goes on and on and on\u2026\n\nWith all his success as a chart-topping producer, it\u2019s all too easy to forget about his hallowed heritage as a highly respected DJ. Promoting raves in his native Paris with nothing more than photocopied flyers, he rose through the influential \u2018French touch\u2019 era that saw the likes of Daft Punk come to fame, but was soon forging his own path through the dance music scene. Whether he\u2019s playing at one of his residencies at XS and Encore in Las Vegas or Ushua\u00efa Ibiza or playing mega festivals like Tomorrowland (where he has performed since its first year) and Ultra Music Festival, he never forgets those humble roots. His \u2018classical\u2019 training in the art of mixing combined with his enduring appeal and continual relevancy ensured him the #6 spot on the DJ Mag Top 100 and a Billboard award for Top Dance/Electronic artist most recently.\n\nCiting his role in the studio in the vein of a classic producer, Guetta sits as the musical brain at the center of the project, bringing it all together. His incredible list of collaborators over the years has included Madonna, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, Usher, Sia, John Legend, Nicki Minaj, Kelly Rowland, Showtek, Avicii, Ne-Yo, Akon, Afrojack and Nicky Romero for starters, but he has also been a keen supporter of lesser-known talent. The likes of Sam Martin and Chris Willis have both enjoyed continual support from Guetta, showing that he\u2019s not just about the A-listers but also about championing hot new names. \u201cOf course it\u2019s amazing to work with famous people,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut the reason behind their fame is their talent. But I also love finding talented people who are not famous, it\u2019s equally amazing to put the spotlight on them.\u201d\n\nAlways in high demand outside of the clubs, festivals and studios, Guetta\u2019s extra-curricular activities have ranged from providing the original soundtrack and musical direction for the UEFA Euro 2016 football championship to being a key partner for UNICEF and an early supporter of groundbreaking legal mix uploading platform Dubset. Never hesitating to help charities, David joined forces with the United Nations in support of \u2018\u2019The World Needs More\u2019\u2019 campaign to raise funds for humanitarian emergencies.\n\nOne of his latest releases Would I Lie To You is seeing him return to the club dancefloors, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019ll never be defined by just one side of his career. His passion for music remains undying, and while the world continues to watch his every move with anticipation, he\u2019ll ignore the pressure and continue his ongoing search for that perfect beat.\n\nHis latest release Shed A Light is a dance pop ballad that is bound to leave a lasting impression across the globe. The track shot to the charts and has reached a Golden status in Italy, The Netherlands and Sweden up until now. More than anything the deeply moving song sends a message of hope, urging us to heed the call of our hearts. The track has the emotional fire that Guetta aims for in all his productions.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/insomniac"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Zach Matari ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9071729.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "R&b Soul", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Humble, kind, courteous and authentic are just a few of the words you will hear fans use to describe Zach Matari!\n\nZach Matari, the \u201cNew\u201d Jersey Boy, Pop/R&B singer/songwriter sensation & musician born and raised in North Jersey with musical talent that is far beyond his years.

Recently, Zach signed a singles deal with Clippers Sounds for his song \u201cTossin Turnin\u201d ReMix ft. Chris Bedore.\n\nZach has been touring throughout the country and has also opened for artists such as Fetty Wap, Fifth Harmony, Mario, R5 & Jacob Whitesides, garnering more and more recognition with his nostalgic style of music and dance. Performing in over 100 cities across the country, his fan base has grown to thousands of devoted and loyal fans.\n\nIn addition to his passion for music, Zach is an advocate for Anti-Bullying and has been on the road with the Teen Nation Tour - a peer-to-peer community service program to educate and entertain youth about bullying in a way students can relate; through music. To date, Zach has spoken and performed for over 40,000 students and hopes to continue spreading his anti-bullying message throughout the country. Zach is also an active member of Musicians On Call, bringing the healing power of music to children\u2019s hospitals around the country. Zach has been visiting pediatric patients in hospitals in the NY & LA area delivering live, in-room performances to patients undergoing treatment or who are unable to leave their beds.\n\nZach is currently performing around the country with his band members. As a song writer, Zach is actively writing new music which is scheduled to be released later this year.\n\n\u201cUltimately, life is the best gift we could ever receive and good music is a blessing. I\u2019ve been passionate about music since I was able to talk and have a deep appreciation for all genres. Music is my life expressed through songs.\u201d \u2013 Zach Matari\n\nPress Links for Zach: http://www.reverbnation.com/zachmatari/press\n\nPress Links for Zach:\n\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/zachmatari/press\nwww.twitter.com/zachmatari\nwww.facebook.com/zachmatari\nwww.instagram.com/zachmatari\nwww.youtube.com/zachmatari", "otherInfo": "Private zoom performances in a city near you!

This young and exceptional New Orleans native began playing the saxophone at seven years old, and producing and writing music at fourteen. Royal\u2019s musical talents were nurtured at the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts (NOCCA) High School, in classrooms once shared by jazz greats such as Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Terrence Blanchard, and Donald Harrison.

Catching his break after winning a Beatport remix contest in 2012 with his dubstep-\nfocused version of Above & Beyond\u2019s \u201cYou Got to Go\u201d, Seven Lions, born Jeff Montalvo, garnered early support\nfrom the likes of Skrillex and his OWSLA label. 2013 tour dates with Porter Robinson and Krewella pushed\nMontalvo and his genre-bending production style to the forefront of the modern electronic music scene.\nPutting sheer technical production prowess to work in soulful, deep, hybridized creations all distinctly his\nown, the multi-talented musician is single-handedly changing the sonic landscape for future generations to come\nby bridging the gap between the soaring, ethereal vibe of trance and intensely adrenalizing bass music. His\nproductions have seen stages at world-renowned festivals such as Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival\n(New York and Las Vegas), Electric Forrest, Electric Zoo, South by Southwest, and HARD.\nAfter several successful releases under the OWSLA label (his debut EP, Days to Come, reached #2 on\nthe iTunes Dance charts), Montalvo released his highly anticipated 2014 follow-up EP, Worlds Apart, on Republic\nRecords\u2019 dance imprint Casablanca. Containing several notable features which include Ellie Goulding and Tove\nLo, Worlds Apart debuted at #1 on the iTunes Dance charts, and the title track was also featured in Billboard\u2019s\n\u201cTop 10 Electronic/Dance Songs of 2014\u201d list. The EP also featured the smash hit and canonical dance track\n\u2018Strangers\u2019, featuring superstar vocalist Tove Lo. \u2018Strangers\u2019 was a definitive track in what was perhaps the peak\nof American electronic dance music, and solidified Seven Lions as one of the scene\u2019s premier artists.\nIn 2015, Seven Lions began releasing music in EP formats, devoting each EP to a cohesive idea and\nworld found within the Seven Lions universe. 2015\u2019s \u201cThe Throes of Winter\u201d hints at a larger seasonal theme, to\nbe continued through to his future releases. When asked about the spark for this vision, he explains, \"Since\nartists aren't releasing proper albums anymore, it makes sense to create something that's digitally artistic with real\ncohesion as opposed to tossing out singles and just haphazardly seeing what sticks\u2026 I wanted to start making\nthe music more thematic, interesting, and part of something larger.\u201d\nBucking more trends and breaking from convention, his 2016 Creation EP [Casablanca Records] followed\na different path for his latest body of work. \u201cThis time, songwriting really took place on guitar,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere\nare more acoustic elements in the songs, and that ties it together. I wanted to get a little more experimental. I\ndidn\u2019t worry if something was going to be a big banger on the dancefloor or not. I just made what felt right at the\ntime.\u201d Ultimately, Seven Lions continues challenging himself and musical genres. \u201cI want to do something\ndifferent,\u201d he concludes. \u201cEverything doesn\u2019t have to fit into just one genre. I want people to walk away loving\ndifferent kinds of music and sounds.\u201d\nThis year saw Seven Lions once more travel across the country on his There and Back Again club-\nfocused tour, in addition to hallmark festival appearances at Tomorrowland, EDC Las Vegas, Life in Color, EDC\nJapan, Middlelands, Electric Zoo, and Paradiso, amongst others. This summer the sound-sculptor unveiled his\nhighly-anticipated Where I Wont Be Found EP as well, continuing his always growing world, identified via these\nannual EP projects. The eight-track offering is a wondrous journey from start to. From the heavily streamed and\ncritically praised \u201cFreesol,\u201d to the energetic future bass collaboration \u201cRescue Me\u201d with scene upstart Unlike Pluto,\nWhere I Wont Be Found reminds fans of what made Seven Lions who he is today - a singular talent in electronic\nmusic, and a producer who has always forged his own lane.\nIn support of the EP and the year as a whole, Seven Lions will wrap up 2017 with a 20 date North\nAmerican headlining tour with Tritonal (and Kill The Noise as support). Playing some of America\u2019s largest\ntheatres, the Horizon Tour hits LA (2 nights at the iconic Palladium), NYC (Brooklyn\u2019s Hangar), Boston,\nPhiladelphia, San Francisco (Bill Graham), Toronto, and many other key locales.\n\nJeff started 2018 in a new direction \u2013 his very own record label. Called Ophelia Records, the imprint has\nalready seen a handful of strong releases: Calling You Home, Ocean, and Horizon. \u2018Ocean\u2019 in particular has\nalready cemented itself as a quintessential Seven Lions track, racking up over 1.7 million Spotify streams in just a\nfew weeks. He has also expanded on his touring business, unveiling the \u2018Chronicles\u2019 concept \u2013 an event series\nthat takes the Seven Lions experience and kicks it up a notch.

It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label. Two Tomatoes moved into a real office in New York City, with real staff including Shannon Chirone, John Waldman (Great Knight Productions), Corinne Barlow, Katie Messer, Michelle Puskas, Justice Longshore, and publicist Elizabeth Waldman Frazier.\n\nIt's one big happy family!", "otherInfo": "Laurie Berkner is doing daily Facebook lives during the COVID-19 school and community closures.

In the wake of the conflagration, future possibilities flourish out of the ashes.\nReigniting a brotherhood dating back nearly two decades, As I Lay Dying rise together on their seventh\nfull-length and debut for Nuclear Blast, the aptly titled Shaped By Fire. The San Diego quintet\u2014Tim\nLambesis [vocals], Jordan Mancino [drums], Phil Sgrosso [guitar], Nick Hipa [guitar], and Josh Gilbert\n[bass]\u2014rally together and recharge the precise and pummeling metallic assault that transformed them\ninto a turn-of-the-century heavy music phenomenon.\n\nThese eleven tracks mark their first body of work together since 2012 and represent the dawn of a bold\nnew era.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is the most meaningful As I Lay Dying record,\u201d states Nick. \u201cEvery album encapsulates who\nyou are and what you\u2019ve gone through. At this point in time, we\u2019ve gone through more than I ever\nimagined, but we all grew. I\u2019m so proud of my bandmates and what we\u2019ve done. We became better\nmusicians and better people. People will hear a positive resolve to our journey so far.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith everything that\u2019s happened and all of the time away, there really was no other option than to be\nthe best version of As I Lay Dying we could possibly be,\u201d Tim declares. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we\nmade an album that represented our best selves. Individually and collectively, a similar rebirth\nhappened.\u201d\n\nThe rebirth remains rooted in an impressive legacy. Since forming in 2000, the group sold over 1 million\nalbums worldwide, garnered a 2008 GRAMMY\u00ae Award nomination in the category of \u201cBest Metal\nPerformance,\u201d notched two Top 10 debuts on the Billboard Top 200, generated hundreds of millions of\nstreams, sold out shows around the globe, and took home \u201cUltimate Metal God\u201d at MTV2\u2019s Music\nAwards in 2007. Following a five-year hiatus amidst personal struggles, the musicians reconnected in\nearly 2018.\n\nBefore a note of music, they focused on where everything began: the friendship.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to ease into things,\u201d recalls Phil. \u201cWe connected as friends again first. Then, we began to\ndiscuss what we could do musically. A lot of ideas floated around, and we decided to do a show in San\nDiego.\u201d\n\nThe show, which rapidly sold out in two minutes, served as the first in a series of \u201csmall goals,\u201d as Josh\nputs it. Backed by overwhelming support, they recorded and unleashed the hard-hitting \u201cMy Own\nGrave,\u201d which clocked 13 million Spotify streams in a few months\u2019 time. Concurrently, the musicians\nwrote and recorded what would become Shaped By Fire, taking the reins in terms of production and\nengineering with a little help from longtime friend and collaborator Killswitch Engage\u2019s Adam D. This\ntime around, recording happened individually, allowing for the best possible performances. Meanwhile,\ncommunication was at an all-time high as a respectful atmosphere encouraged constructive criticism.\n\n\u201cEveryone wanted to expand the sound, but keep it somewhat familiar,\u201d Phil says. \u201cIt had been six years\nsince we worked together. We realized what our strengths were internally and honed in on how to\nperfect them as much as possible. We trimmed the fat and filler and added different textures and\nlayers.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy tracking myself, I was able to get comfortable and best represent my own ideas at the beginning,\u201d\nadds Tim. \u201cWe found a new sense of respect for each other musically and personally. We connected\nbetter than ever.\u201d\n\nThe first single and title track \u201cShaped By Fire\u201d steamrolls forward on airtight riffing and bludgeoning\ndrums before a soaring arena-size refrain.\n\n\u201cThe chorus sums up the collective band experience over the last seven years,\u201d Tim admits. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty\ndirect.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the opener \u201cBlinded\u201d gallops forward with undeniable urgency as it poses questions for the\nfrontman. \u201cI\u2019m asking, \u2018Can there be change?\u2019,\u201d continues Tim. \u201cI want to show people over time it\u2019s\npossible.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, \u201cTorn Between\u201d tempers pensive lyrics and robust musicality as it discusses an internal\ndivide. \u201cA lot of times, we feel like we have two options and need to choose one or the other,\u201d he goes.\n\u201cSometimes, the third option is the best. I was between this blackened heart and a blue, bruised, and\nbeaten heart. The song concludes on getting rid of them both and starting from scratch.\u201d\n\nFittingly, Shaped by Fire culminates on what might be the record\u2019s heaviest catharsis emotionally, \u201cThe\nToll It Takes.\u201d A stark admission cuts deep as they lock into what Phil dubs, \u201ca special moment.\u201d\n\nIn the end, As I Lay Dying burn brighter than ever before.\n\n\u201cThis is the next chapter,\u201d affirms Tim. \u201cI\u2019m more excited for the overall direction we\u2019re heading in than\nI\u2019ve ever been. Hopefully, our fans can sense that when they hear this record. The As I Lay Dying story is\nin an exciting place in this moment and time, but there\u2019s even more to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that music can obviously touch people and change their lives for the better,\u201d Phil concludes. \u201cSo,\nfor anyone who is going through a hard time, if they were to hear this record, it would do something\npositive for their lives, or it would help motivate them. The power of music is so strong that maybe this\nwould help somebody who needed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope people feel empowered by this,\u201d Nick agrees. \u201cWe always put so much love into what we do.\nThere\u2019s the optimism of being able to turn things around, heal, grow, and persevere.

For Sam, his writing is a vehicle that often serves to document darkness, but predominantly is also concerned with finding beauty, however hard that may be. A multi-instrumentalist, his songwriting process is personal (perhaps sacred), often cathartic but rarely a collaborative experience. However in terms of recording and performance, Sam has very much an open-door policy, inviting friends to join him wherever and whenever possible. While Sam may claim otherwise, his music feels inextricably bound in the concept of \u201chiraeth\u201d, a Welsh-language word for which there is no direct translation. This idea is something that constantly and perhaps subconsciously informs and underlies his work; a sense of nostalgia, homesickness tinged with grief, and a longing for the past - maybe more specifically his own past and upbringing on Anglesey, an island off the north-west coast of Wales. However, Sam would argue his music rarely exists in just one place, whether in a geographical or musical sense. It is both stark and expansive, something he hopes is also reflected in the live show when joined by a full band, while still retaining the pin-drop reverie that his solo performances have been credited with. His debut album \u201cIn Darkened Rooms\u201d is a collection of songs that have led Sam to this moment in time. \u201cI guess usually a debut record is a snapshot from a certain time in an artist\u2019s career..\u201d, says Sam, \u201cbut as this was made over a longer period than most I think stylistically maybe reflects a wider palette of influence, and as a result it sees me sonically exploring a few different routes\u201d. The result is a record that audibly draws inspiration from a number of places, including confessional indie-folk, post-rock, americana, and traditional folk music, along with other cultural and literary influences. But ultimately, says Sam \u201cit all still comes from the same voice - these are my songs, and I live and die by them\u201d. In light of this, many of these tracks are recent but some have had different lives, and the hope is that they will continue to do so. Sam is very much of the belief that a studio recording doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the definitive version of a song, and with this in mind he often changes arrangements for live performances too. This concept has also extended to his time in the studio where over time he learnt not to be overly precious with his initial visions for songs and their structures, something gained partly by watching the Wilco documentary \u201cI Am Trying To Break Your Heart\u201d. The title of the record is a lyric taken from the track \u201cIn The Morning\u201d but also reflects the winter period during which Sam finished writing the record. Despite for the past few years living in the musically-rich but landlocked city of Leeds, Sam returned to the coastlines of North Wales where he spent a week alone, overlooking the mountain range of Snowdonia (which is depicted in the cover art, shot by longtime friend and collaborator Sam Bond). Between sessions he would gather his thoughts on long walks, and was struck by just how quickly and dramatically the light and scenery could change. Consequently, Sam took his ideas back to Leeds where he recorded with producer and friend Whiskas, engineer Paul Thompson, and the help of his bandmates and musical friends. Older songs are revisited on the record; the lyrics to intro track \u201cCamera Lens\u201d taken from a poem written by Sam as a teenager, and the inclusion of \u201cThe Blackout\u201d, an early single which on its initial release was named BBC Radio Wales\u2019 track of the year. The newest songs, however, hint at a future musical direction - from the bravely sparse and introspective \u201cLacuna\u201d (partly inspired by watching Michel Gondry\u2019s \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u201d), to album closer \u201cNantucket\u201d, with its slow build, whispered harmonies, and its textured, crashing finale. Along the way there have been both triumphs and setbacks, and while Sam is the first to admit that this process has taken considerably longer than he\u2019d have hoped, his own record has not always been the only priority. Sam co-runs respected Leeds-based label Hide & Seek Records, and in the past year alone has overseen releases from Post War Glamour Girls, Dancing Years, Mi Mye, and Department M, 3 of which were albums. In the past few years, Sam has been booked to play festivals such as Latitude, Leeds festival, Festival No 6, Kendal Calling and Bluedot Festival, and most recently has played multiple sold-out dates on tour with Matthew & the Atlas. In many ways a songwriter\u2019s songwriter, his musical admirers include Midlake, Damien Jurado, Sharon Van Etten, Daughter and Anais Mitchell, most of which he has shared a stage with, along with shows and tours with the likes of The Low Anthem, Villagers, Willy Mason, Lucy Rose and Benjamin Francis Leftwich. In Leeds, Sam has gathered huge crowds at headline shows and festival appearances, including playing the city\u2019s prestigious town hall, and most recently a special sold-out show at Holy Trinity Church, an ambitious collaboration with friends performing Bon Iver\u2019s \u201cFor Emma, Forever Ago\u201d in full, an event endorsed by Justin Vernon himself. In addition to this, Sam has also benefited from support and radio plays, interviews and live sessions on many shows across the BBC network, and his champions include Huw Stephens (BBC R1), Lauren Laverne (BBC 6 Music), Steve Lamacq (BBC 6 Music/R2), along with continual support from BBC Radio Wales\u2019 Adam Walton and Bethan Elfyn. In relation to the making and release of his record, Sam stressed the importance of \u201cthe time needing to feel right, which hasn\u2019t always been the case\u201d. Eventually, though, you have to let things go, to put them out into the world and just see what happens\u201d. For Sam, this certainly feels like the time.

As the son of Irish singing sensation Dominic Kirwan, it comes as no surprise that Barry had showbiz aspirations from a very early age. Growing up, Barry was a committed member of his school\u2019s choir and devoted much of his time performing in school productions or competing in various solo singing feis\u2019. At the age of 5 he joined the Seamus Kerrigan School of Traditional Irish Dance where he stayed until the age of 18. Here Barry had the amazing opportunity to travel throughout Ireland taking part in a range of competitions, such as the All Ireland Dancing championships and Sc\u00f3r to name a few. A triple threat, Barry can also add acting to his ever increasing list of talents after the years he spent as a member of the Hazel Wand drama school in his hometown of Omagh. No stranger to the stage, Barry was destined to return and seize the spotlight later on in life. At age 11, Barry fell in love with drumming and excelled from grade 1-8 within the space of five years. His passion for the instrument led him to further study in London at Drumtech college, part of the British and Irish Modern Music Institute (BIMM) schools. Shortly after college Barry decided to join his father\u2019s band as his drummer and provided backing vocals for over 4 years. Constantly growing as a musician, Barry left Dominic\u2019s band in September 2010 and had the opportunity to live with his brother Colm in Nashville. During his time in the US he stayed with close friends, American country duo Joey & Rory where he had the incredible honour to play drums for 4 of their US shows. As January 2011 came to a close Barry had began to work with Ireland\u2019s princess of country, Lisa McHugh and performed with her until September 2011 before becoming the drummer and backing vocalist for the hit recording artist Derek Ryan. During his 4 and a half years working with the Derek Ryan band, Barry toured all around Ireland, the U.K and Australia. With every show in every city, Barry\u2019s desires became more apparent and in February 2016 he left the Derek Ryan band to pursue his own dream of a solo career in the Irish country music scene. For the past 4 months he has been touring with his father as the support act on the \u2018Here For A Good Time\u2019 tour throughout the UK and Ireland which has proven to be an excellent platform to prepare before his own live shows this summer. On 6th May 2016, Barry released his first solo single \u2018\u2018Keep It In The Middle Of The Road\u2019 from his debut studio album. The song shot to No. 1 spot on the Irish iTunes Country chart and No.2 in the UK iTunes Country chart - a foretelling of the successful career this rising star will undoubtedly have in the years ahead.

The critically acclaimed five-piece was down to just four members, and while the obvious solution may have been to simply replace their departed comrade, the group instead made the bold choice to completely reimagine their lineup and their catalog, carrying forward as a quartet with an ambitious new approach to writing and recording. The result was a genuine sonic rebirth, a wild musical awakening that brought Parsonsfield closer together than ever before and yielded their most exhilarating and adventurous record yet: Happy Hour On The Floor.\n\u201cRecording this album marked our first time working in the studio as a four-piece, and it was really liberating,\u201d says lead vocalist Chris Freeman. \u201cOnce the lineup changed, we realized that there weren\u2019t any restrictions on what we could do. It came with this boundless sense of musical freedom where anything felt possible.\u201d\nProduced by Benjamin Lazar Davis (Joan As Police Woman, Okkervil River), Happy Hour On The Floor fuses Parsonsfield\u2019s rustic instrumentation and timeless sense of songcraft with dreamy synthesizers and vintage drum machines. The arrangements here are broad and spacious, often built off spare, hypnotizing loops that fuel the songs\u2019 mesmerizing drive, and the band\u2019s performances are deliberate and economical to match, substituting lean, careful construction in place of the strummed exuberance that defined much of their early work. The result is a record all about finding happiness in simplicity, a captivating collection more reminiscent of modern indie pop than old-school string bands that pushes the group far beyond the perceived boundaries of its sound even as it shines a spotlight on the heart and soul of what\u2019s always made them such a joyous revelation.\nHailed by Folk Alley as \"the most jubilant and danceable indie roots music this side of the Carolinas,\" Parsonsfield\u2014Freeman, mandolinist Antonio Alcorn, guitarist Max Shakun, and drummer Erik Hischmann\u2014first emerged in 2014 with Poor Old Shine, an ecstatic acoustic collection that prompted The New York Times to praise them as \"boisterously youthful yet deftly sentimental\u201d and No Depression to rave that they'll \"give you rich five-part harmonies one minute [and] sound like bluegrass on steroids the next.\" The band grew more experimental on their 2016 follow-up, Blooming Through The Black, and the collection earned them both glowing reviews and dates with everyone from Josh Ritter and The Jayhawks to Mandolin Orange and The New Pornographers. That same year, the group saw their music featured in the hit AMC series \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and teamed up with the prestigious FreshGrass Festival to compose a score for the 1922 silent classic Nanook of the North, which they performed live alongside the film at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art.", "otherInfo": "Live stream at https://live.bandsintown.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Saint John and the Revelations ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/440517.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Alt Folk, Alternative, Folk Rock, Rock, Indie Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"...I feel like the guy who discovered U2\" - Indie Music Express\n\n\"...these guys are Smiths 3.0\" - Eat Sleep Drink Music\n\n\"Halo demonstrates that this band from Venice, CA comes with\nremarkable depth\" - Caught in the Carousel\n\nSaint John was born in Victoria, BC, Canada.

Connor recorded the track in Nashville, and tinges of country blend seamlessly with Sixties and Seventies beach-pop here. It\u2019s a promising sign for this newcomer, and all that retro flavor never stops this song from sounding like right now.\"\n\u2014 ROLLING STONE\n\n\"If you didn\u2019t know singer-songwriter Mara Connor hailed from Los Angeles, the breezily glum sound of her debut single 'No Fun' would be a giveaway. Playing brightly deliberate strumming and briskly grand strings against Connor\u2019s bell-clear voice....\"\n\u2014 ROLLING STONE\n\n\"Performed as a duet with Langhorne Slim and released via the newly launched label Side Hustle, 'Someone New' is an airy, atmospheric breakup ballad that examines romantic wreckage from both sides of the split.\"\n\u2014 ROLLING STONE\n\n\"'No Fun' is also an elegant charmer - Connor's drawn-out, yet lucid vocals are set against a majestic string arrangement and gleaming jangly guitars, wrapped around a melody that a band like Big Star could've written in their more tender moments.\"\n\u2014 THE DELI MAGAZINE\n\n\u201cAs for the song that landed at No. 1, Mara Connor\u2019s 'No Fun,' I thought 'stone cold classic pop song' the first time I listened to it. And I thought 'stone cold classic pop song' the 100th time I listened to it...strings-swept and swoon-worthy, a confessional that\u2019s equal parts girl-group pop and \u201970s AM radio finery, her buttery voice somewhere between Allie Crow Buckley and Lana Del Rey.\u201d\n\u2014 BUZZBANDS (Favorite Song of 2018)", "otherInfo": "Live stream at https://live.bandsintown.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Houston Bernard Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10353012.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Country & Southern Rock, Country And Original Material, Country", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Houston Bernard may reside in the city, but his country roots run deep.

She had been touring the band\u2019s 2016 album 'A Man Alive', a critically acclaimed, bone-shaking reckoning about her relationship with her absent father. She was scoring commissions, guest-hosting the podcast Song Exploder, and exploring other paths as an artist. She bought a house with her girlfriend; they\u2019re married now.\n\nIn the past 15 years, Thao has avoided being fully out in her public career, having been raised in\u2014and deeply loving\u2014a family and culture distanced from mainstream America\u2019s social progress. As she confronted the division, shame, grief, and silence in her life, Thao found new ways to live in her own skin, and forced her own hand to make a new, different record. In doing so, she created a space wherein she can finally exist as her full self.\n\n\u2018Temple' is the fifth full-length album from Thao & The Get Down Stay Down. Produced by Thao and bandmate Adam Thompson, who shares songwriting credit on five tracks, it is also their first self-produced album.

Golden, longing pop meets punk roots. Rock draws from hip-hop, funk, and folk rhythms for intricate, danceable beats. The poetic lyrics are expansive, yet shatteringly personal, inspired in part by the work of writers like James Baldwin, Octavia Butler, and Yiyun Li.. Rage, honesty, clear-eyed regret, and optimistic wisdom run parallel, finding a new way forward.\n\nA temple is a place of worship and sanctuary. We spend our lives searching for temples where we can belong and be loved, but those spaces can also be a kind of confinement. \u2018Temple' is an album that pushes open boundaries for a different kind of sanctuary, where you don\u2019t have to whisper.", "otherInfo": "Watch Thao & The Get Down Stay Down (https://youtu.be/Xe-sTQEioi0) in their 2016 Galaxy Barn performance for Pickathon #AConcertADay!

Country Artist JD Shelburne grew up on a tobacco farm in Taylorsville, KY, a tiny town southeast of the Ohio River near Louisville KY. At age 19, he found a guitar after the death of his grandmother and began learning to play and sing on his own. By his sophomore year of college, he had found a few gigs at some local bars in the Louisville/Lexington, KY area and developed a fan-base that eventually landed him on some of the biggest stages in the business, opening for some of the nation\u2019s hottest stars. Eventually, Shelburne was adding original songs into the set mix, in addition to producing songs of his own material.\n\nIn 2002, Kentucky fell in love at first sight with Shelburne, then college student/ small-town country boy with a wide smile, natural singing voice and a love of faith, family and his hometown of Taylorsville, KY. But that small-town image is merely a fond memory now that he has moved on to Nashville down the path to music stardom.\n\nNow find him soaking up the music scene, touring cities, building a fan-base and celebrating a decade of success playing venues all across the southeast trying to get his big break. Today he\u2019s among the most hard working and relevant country singers in the business. They say Nashville doesn\u2019t work that way anymore \u2013 that talented musicians with very few connections don\u2019t stand a chance. But Shelburne proved that Music City\u2019s engine still runs off of talent and persistent driven antics. Critics find him credible. Fans pack his shows. Venues strive to book him. There are very few new artists recording songs today about whom that can be said.\n\nDuring his whirlwind career explosion, he has performed with over 50 national acts ranging from stars such as Montgomery Gentry, Craig Morgan, Jamey Johnson, Kellie Pickler, Steve Wariner to Clay Walker and Johnny Lee, performed at some of the region\u2019s most famous venues such as the Historic Ryman Auditorium, Rupp Arena, Murphy Center, KFC Yum Center, Freedom Hall, Churchill Downs and Old Cardinal Stadium which recently drew the Kentucky State Fair\u2019s largest crowd of the concert series. Shelburne performed \u201cGod Bless America\u201d prior to the 2016 Quaker State 400 NASCAR race at Kentucky Speedway to over 100,000 attendees. He has also been featured in Country Weekly Magazine, Kentucky Alumni Magazine, Kentucky Monthly Magazine amongst many other national publications including the Huffington Post. His debut music video \u201cFarmboy\u201d gained him thousands of new fans by airing on the TNN Top Ten Countdown nationwide on Heartland TV network and ZUUS Country Network. In 2015, he made his Nationwide debut on GAC \u2013 Great American Country Network and also CMT.com in October with his second music video entitled \u201cHometown\u201d written about the demise of his smalltown. On October 21, 2015, Shelburne debuted as #1 trending artist on CMT.com edging out Taylor Swift, Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean! Shelburne has performed over 1000 concerts all over the southeast as well as over 300 festivals. Shelburne\u2019s outfit has been featured on display at the Kentucky Derby Museum at Historic Churchill Downs from his appearance at the 2015/2016 Kentucky Derby. In 2016, Shelburne was invited to perform in the Kentucky State Capitol for the State Senate as well as the House of Representatives where he performed his own rendition of \u201cMy Old Kentucky Home\u201d for both parties. JD was named an Honorable Kentucky Colonel and was also presented honor of \u201cAdmiral\u201d by the Commonwealth of Kentucky \u2013 Energy and Environment Cabinet recently. Also in 2016, the University of Kentucky\u2019s College of Communication and Information named JD Shelburne their 2016 Most Outstanding Alumnus!\n\nMost recently in 2017, Shelburne launched his world premiere official music video for \u201cBetter Man\u201d that was filmed in Midway/ Millville, KY. The video also made it\u2019s Network Television Debut on Great American Country (GAC) on June 23, 2017 and is currently in Nationwide rotation.

prolific Brill building pop Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and \u2013 fingers crossed - Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music - and give them an experience that they will never forget.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Every Monday live @ 5!

On tour, in the unpredictable adventures and characters they cross, in the endless blur of skylines and rest stops and dressing rooms and hotels, that's where they find their greatest inspiration, where they hone their art, and where they crafted their brilliant new album, Transient Lullaby. \"When you travel like we do, if your antenna is up, there's always something going on around you,\" reflects guitarist/singer Chris Masterson. \"Ideas can be found everywhere. The hardest thing to find is time.\" For the last seven years, The Mastersons have kept up a supremely inexorable touring schedule, performing as both the openers for Steve Earle and as members of his band, The Dukes, in addition to playing their own relentless slate of headline shows and festivals. It was Earle, in fact, who pushed the duo to record their acclaimed debut, Birds Fly South, in the first place. \"Before we hit the road with him in 2010, Steve said, 'You'd better have a record ready because I'm going to feature you guys during the show,'\" remembers fiddler/tenor guitarist/singer Eleanor Whitmore. \"We didn't even have a band name at the time. We were going through all these ideas and Steve suggested, 'Why don\u2019t you just be The Mastersons, and that was that.\" Upon its release in 2012, Birds Fly South was a breakout critical hit on both sides of the pond, with Uncut awarding the album 9/10 stars and Esquire dubbing The Mastersons one of the \u201cBands You Need To Know Right Now\u201d. Two years later, they followed it up with Good Luck Charm, premiered by the NY Times and praised by Mother Jones for its \"big-hearted lyrics, tight song structures, and sweetly intertwined harmonies.\" Pop Matters ranked it \"among the top Americana releases of 2014,\" while American Songwriter called it \"a perfect soundtrack for a summer of warm nights and hot, lazy days,\" and the Austin Chronicle praised the band's \"spunky wit and rare measure of emotional maturity.\" The album earned The Mastersons slots on NPR's Mountain Stage and at festivals around the world, from San Francisco's Hardly Strictly Bluegrass to Australia's Byron Bay Bluesfest. With endless touring came new levels of comfort and confidence, and when it was time to record Transient Lullaby, The Mastersons knew they wanted to take a different approach than their first two releases. The band set up shop at Arlyn Studios in Austin, TX, where Chris shared production duties with longtime friend and collaborator George Reiff (Ray Wylie Hubbard, Band of Heathens). Together, they chased a sound that was subtler and more evocative, deeper and more contemplative. \"A lot of what we listen to when we have some rare time off is what we consider late night music,\" explains Chris, who previously played guitar with Son Volt and Jack Ingram among others. \"The last record was bright and jangly and we wanted this one to be vibey and dark. A lot of the stuff is very performance-based and not at all fussed with. We've grown so much more comfortable in our skin that we really weren't trying to sound like anyone other than ourselves this time around.\" \"We've had a lot of time and a lot of miles to refine our sound and our style of singing,\" adds Eleanor, whose resume includes work with Regina Spektor and Angus & Julia Stone. \"I think the depth of our songwriting has really grown, too. Part of the time we're writing on a tour bus with Steve Earle, and the bar for poetry is pretty high when you're within earshot of one of the greatest songwriters alive.\" Rich with Eleanor's stirring string arrangements and Chris's masterful guitar work, the songs on Transient Lullaby more than live up to the challenge. The album opens with \"Perfect,\" a loping duet written partially in Washington, DC, and partially in Newcastle, England, that paints a portrait of two broken lovers who still manage to find a strange optimism in this challenging world. Spare and affecting, the song puts the spotlight on the duo's intoxicating vocal harmonies and makes for an ideal entry point into an album full of characters facing down difficulty and darkness with all the grit and humility they can muster. \"Fight,\" written in a downtown Cleveland hotel, is a wry wink at the battlefield of marriage (\"I don't wanna fight with anyone else but you\"), while the fingerpicked \"Highway 1\" twists and turns on a California road trip through an emotional breakup. \"Life's not easy,\" reflects Chris. \"It's hard for everybody, and I don\u2019t see it getting any easier. All you can hope for yourself is grace when walking through it, and someone to prop you up when you need a little help.\" Though it's a deeply personal album, Transient Lullaby is not without its political moments. The Mastersons found themselves on tour in Lexington, KY, during the height of Kim Davis' obstinate stand against the Supreme Court's same sex marriage decision, and so they penned the infectious \"You Could Be Wrong\" in a dressing room before taking the stage with \"Love Wins\" draped across their guitars. \"This Isn't How It Was Supposed To Go\"\u2014a cosmic country duet written in Cologne, Germany\u2014has taken on new layers of political meaning in 2017, while \"Don't Tell Me To Smile\" is a tongue-in-cheek feminist anthem, and the gorgeous, slow-burning \"Fire Escape\"\u2014which came to life in a hockey rink locker room in Alberta, Canada\u2014suggests that the only solution to a polarized world of fear and distrust is to find strength and guidance in our loved ones. \"As we look at the world political landscape, global warming, a refugee crisis and the uncertain times we\u2019re all living in, rather than lose hope, we look to each other,\" Chris says. \"It\u2019s a little brighter than Cormac McCarthy\u2019s The Road, but not much.\" Ultimately, the road is at the core of everything The Mastersons do. \"Happy When I'm Movin'\" reflects their constant need for forward momentum, both physically and emotionally, and the title track paints the pair as \"pilgrims of the interstate\" on an endless voyage. \"No I don\u2019t unpack my bag / Traveling from town to town,\" they sing in beautiful harmony. \"Set \u2019em up and knock \u2019em down / Where there\u2019s work and songs to sing / You\u2019ll know the place where I\u2019ll be found / If you don\u2019t want to be alone / Then come along.\" For The Mastersons, all that matters is where they're headed, and the songs they'll write when they get there.

I\u2019m Ruth\u2026welcome to my little world! I\u2019m just an ordinary girl-next-door with an extraordinary dream. (Dreams are good. I hope you have lots of them:)\nI grew up in rural western NY on a vineyard that\u2019s been in my family for over a hundred years. My grandma was the farmer\u2019s daughter and my grandpa worked on the grapes with her dad. That\u2019s how they met\u2026 Cute huh?\nMusic has been a part of my life since forever. I started playing piano and fiddle when I was three. I sang my first solo at church that year \u2013 and I also wrote my first song titled \u201cMr. Bluebird\u201d \u2013 my mom swears it was the same every time I sang it! Three was clearly a big year for me! But it was middle school when I fell in love with country music. This was 90s country at it\u2019s best \u2013 artists like Garth Brooks, Jo Dee Messina and Faith Hill were killing it on country radio and I couldn\u2019t get enough. I loved the stories they were telling through their songs. In high school it all came together when I started writing and playing the guitar. I was hooked.\nI get asked all the time how a girl from NY could possibly sing country music. Well I have a couple things to say about that: A) They play George Straight in the Wal-Mart where I\u2019m from too and B) My high school mascot was the Fredonia Hillbillies\u2026doesn\u2019t get much more country than that, does it?\nAfter graduating high school I attended Berklee College of Music where I majored in songwriting and made some lifelong friends. I fell in love with Boston (go Red Sox!) but I struggled to find my artistic voice during those years. So with hope in my heart I decided to make the move to Music City.\nWhen I moved to Nashville I started to write with everyone I could. I wrote all the time, sometimes several songs in one day and I was blessed by the support and feedback of so many talented co-writers. Within months, I finally felt like I was writing songs that were me, and through these songs, I found my voice.\nDuring this time I formed the duo Wild Honey, with another local songwriter, Victoria Gibson and we were featured on Season 1 of CMT\u2019s Can You Duet. Being on Can You Duet was the wildest experience. One week I\u2019m waiting tables and the next I\u2019m moving into the Opryland Hotel for a month of filming. Suddenly there were cameras and lights shoved in our faces almost 24 hours a day. The stakes were raised in a big way. The best way I can put it is this\u2026 where I\u2019m from, a tiny little town in NY, I never dared to dream that big\u2026 It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want to sing for stadiums of millions of people\u2026 It\u2019s just that I never believed that it could happen to a small town girl like me. But all of a sudden, there I was competing on national television for a major label record deal. Can You Duet gave me the push I needed to realize that dreams do come true\u2026even for normal little people like me.\nAfter Can You Duet, it was on. I worked as hard as I could, writing everyday and back to waiting tables, sometimes till 4 in the morning to make ends meet. All that changed when I signed with Curb Records and Curb Publishing in the summer of 2011. That was a quite the summer! Within 3 months I got married, bought a house and signed a record deal! Whew\u2026 let me tell you, that was a much needed honeymoon:)\nI still live in Nashville, TN, now with my sweet husband and our two tiny dogs (Emmylou and Hazel). And I am so blessed to get to do music everyday. Sometimes when I\u2019m driving down to Music Row in the morning, (that\u2019s where the magic happens here in Nashvegas) I\u2019ll stop for a second and think \u201cI get to hang out my friends today and write a song\u201d???!!!! \u201cLike for my job\u201d???!!! Crazy!\nIt is a crazy life, but it\u2019s mine and I love it! I\u2019m currently recording my first album for Curb Records and it\u2019s SO exciting!!!\nThis record is the result of years of writing songs about the hurts and heartbreaks, joys and blessings, wild rides and sunny days that we all experience. This album represents everything I\u2019ve gone through while chasing down and exploring this wonderful adventure called music. In these songs, I tried to express the emotion we all go through while searching through the storm to find the light, love and home. I hope you love it!:)\nSo that\u2019s my story\u2026 That\u2019s me\u2026 I\u2019m just an ordinary girl-next-door with an extraordinary dream. As I\u2019m out there chasing mine, I hope you\u2019re somewhere out there chasing yours!", "otherInfo": "Announcing the Cold Comfort from Home Concert Series!\nWhen it sunk in that I wouldn't be playing any live shows back home or on the road for at least a couple months I knew it was time to get creative so that we can all stay connected in music while staying safe at home.

The New Orleans-based septet scored a game-changing hit with \u201cWish I Knew You,\u201d a wistful song from their third album, Men Amongst Mountains. Guided by dynamic percussion and punchy horns, the single features a contagious hook and feel-good chorus that has resonated with fans across all different genres. Though the album was released in July of 2015 (debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard Alternative Albums chart), the band's break out single \"Wish I Knew You\" has a rare and undeniable staying power. The song steadily picked up steam in 2016 spending over 40 weeks on the Billboard Adult Alternative Chart where it peaked at #1 and maintained for multiple weeks. By 2017, the song crossed to Alternative radio rising quickly to #1 and breaking the Billboard chart record for most single-week spins ever at Alternative radio. \u201cWish I Knew You\u201d then peaked inside the Top 15 at Adult Pop Radio and ultimately spent 9 weeks in the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe meaning behind \u201cWish I Knew You\u201d is up for debate and the band could not be happier about it. \u201cSome of the best songs are the ones that don\u2019t have just one meaning,\u201d says vocalist David Shaw. \u201cWe love hearing all the different interpretations our fans have. Of course the song talks about the idea of wishing for more time together earlier in life, but we\u2019ve heard all different takes on who that someone is, what the message means, and even what point of view the lyrics are coming from. We hope that people make our songs their own and \u2018Wish I Knew You\u2019 is like a canvas that our fans have filled with their imaginations and personal experiences. That is what we want our music to do.\u201d\n\nThe success of \u201cWish I Knew You\u201d has opened many doors for the band, earning them praise from the likes of Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, Buzzfeed, Flaunt, Paste and Interview, nabbing them a nod as a \u2018YouTube Artist on the Rise,\u2019 and landing them performances on Jimmy Kimmel Live! (the host called the song his \u201csummer jam\u201d), Conan, The Today Show, and The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where Shaw shared a rare and impromptu mid-performance dance with the star. \"That was a surreal moment for us,\" he marvels. \"Never in my wildest dreams did I think I\u2019d be dancing with Ellen DeGeneres!\u201d\n\nComprised of acclaimed musicians David Shaw [lead vocals/guitar], Zack Feinberg [guitar], Andrew Campanelli [drums], George Gekas [bass], Ed Williams [pedal steel guitar], Rob Ingraham [saxophone], Michael Girardot [keyboard & trumpet], The Revivalists are recognized as an extraordinary live band. And while \u201cWish I Knew You\u201d has had a seismic effect on their career, The Revivalists\u2019 relentless touring over the past several years has played a major part in getting them to this point.\n\nThe band has sold-out headlining tours in 2015, 2016, and 2017, and performed sets at such marquee festivals as Bonnaroo, Governor\u2019s Ball, Outside Lands, and Austin City Limits. This past year they were invited to perform on the main stage at New Orleans\u2019 Jazz Fest (after six years playing the second stage) for 40,000 people, attracted 5,000 fans to their show at Central Park\u2019s SummerStage in New York City, and visited cities like Toronto for the first time playing to packed houses.\n\n\u201cWe did it by building a live audience and our fans bringing their friends to see us,\u201d says Campanelli. \u201cSo when we got a song on the radio, it was tens of thousands of people saying, \u2018Our band is on the radio!\u2019 That has allowed it to expand because our fans are excited about it and are telling their friends. When we play the single, the new people who come to see us are not just holding up their phones for a video then leaving. They\u2019re singing every word because they\u2019ve become fans as well.\u201d \u201cPlaying live is the life blood of this band,\u201d agrees Shaw. \u201cIt\u2019s how we connect. There\u2019s no substitute for getting out there in someone\u2019s face, letting them see the veins popping out in your neck, or sweat dripping off your knuckles as you strum a guitar.\u201d\n\nThe four years that The Revivalists spent touring in support of their second album, City of Sound, informed many of the songs on Men Amongst Mountains, which was recorded live in just 21 days with producer Ben Ellman (Galactic, Trombone Shorty). Album opener \u201cKeep Going\u201d serves as an anthem for these road warriors. \u201cSometimes it was all of us packed into one hotel room,\u201d Shaw recalls of that time. \u201cIf we were lucky, we got two or three hotel rooms to split, so there was no personal space. You're eating fast food because you don't have any money. Those were trying times and all of that hardship went into the lyrics.\u201d The album\u2019s title was inspired during the band\u2019s stopover in Colorado where they were awestruck by the majestic grace of the surrounding mountains. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a metaphor for being small in a vast, expansive universe and knowing you are essentially insignificant, but standing amongst the mountains, you are among the greats, so it kind of elevates you,\u201d says Feinberg. \u201cIt's an uplifting title.\u201d\n\nAll members of The Revivalists share songwriting duties, with Shaw writing the lion\u2019s share of the lyrics. \u201cI draw inspiration from what is happening in my life and what I\u2019m being influenced by at the time,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen life is tumultuous, I write more. When I\u2019m in the light, a person like me is almost seeking the dark. But when I\u2019m in the dark, I\u2019m like \u2018Get me out of this hole.\u2019 Songwriting is an escape; a way to externalize a lot of internal feelings.\u201d\n\nBy making the personal universal, The Revivalists have managed to attract a wide range of listeners who are also no doubt drawn to their eclectic rock sound, which has a bit of swing and a gritty Southern roots vibe. It\u2019s inspired perhaps not sonically \u2014 they are not a heritage brass band \u2014 but spiritually by their adopted hometown. \u201cThe mood we create in a room makes people feel like they\u2019re in New Orleans,\u201d says Campanelli of the band\u2019s free-wheeling show, which is filled with audience interaction and improvisation. \u201cWherever we go, we bring that vibe, spirit, energy, and looseness to the room that wasn\u2019t there the night before. We played a show in St. Louis and people lost their minds dancing. Afterward they told us, \u2018Wow, people don't dance in St. Louis.\u2019 That\u2019s what we bring. We make a Tuesday night in your town feel like New Orleans on a Saturday night.\u201d\n\nThe seeds of The Revivalists were planted in 2007 when Feinberg, out riding his bike, came across Shaw sitting on his front porch belting an original song called \u201cPurple Heart\u201d (which wound up on The Revivalists debut album Vital Signs). Shaw had moved to New Orleans two weeks prior for its rich musical history and because he had heard the city was in need of construction workers to help rebuild the city after Hurricane Katrina. (He had just graduated from Ohio State with a degree in construction management.) Feinberg had also moved to New Orleans for the music scene and to study psychology at Tulane University. He had only been in the dorms for an hour when everyone was forced to evacuate due to the impending hurricane. That day in August 2007, Feinberg and Shaw struck up a conversation and instantly began to jam and collaborate, establishing an immediate musical connection and friendship. Within weeks they had invited Campanelli, whom Feinberg had met through workshops at New Orleans music venue Tipitina\u2019s, to join them. Rounding out the band\u2019s line-up is Ingraham, Gekas, and Girardot, whom Feinberg and Campanelli knew from Tulane and Loyola respectively, as well as Williams, whom they all knew from the local music scene.\n\nThe Revivalists played clubs like Checkpoint Charlie\u2019s in New Orleans and Bamboo Willie\u2019s in Pensacola, which Shaw equates to The Beatles\u2019 \u201cHamburg Years,\u201d because of the epically long shows. \u201cWe played four to five hours a night and didn\u2019t have that much material, so we had to stretch and find ways to engage the crowd,\u201d he says. \u201cWe made it our mission to grab every single person\u2019s attention, which is what happened. By the end of the first set, everyone who had been standing at the bar would be standing at the front of the stage. That\u2019s when I started to realize we had something special.\u201d\n\nThey called themselves The Revivalists, which felt fitting given what the city was going through two years after the devastation of Katrina. \u201cNew Orleans was finally starting to rebound, and seeing it get back on its feet at the same time that this band, which respects older styles of music, was getting together, it just felt right as a name,\u201d says Feinberg. \u201cIt\u2019s about the excitement of this great American city, this great musical city, coming back to life.\u201d", "otherInfo": "David Shaw and Zach Feinberg to preform for Justice Aid Livestream: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8HCM_DCpPcJh_CIF45FToQ"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Charlie Worsham ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10382852.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer.

Already rewarded for her musicality with All-State recognition and roles in Summer-stock theatre, songwriting came naturally to this young talent who has quickly proven herself a prolific writer of thought provoking jazzy pop songs in the vein of Fiona Apple, Jewel, Ani Difranco, and Nellie McKay.\n\nSince her recent graduation from Wesleyan University with a BA in Music, Flo has made Washington DC her home. She has opened for Eli Matthson (America's Got Talent) and Emi Meyer at the National Cherry Blossom Festival, has played Celebrate Fairfax (headliners included Joan Jett, Blues Traveler, and Ok Go), opened for Theresa Andersson, a Swedish musician featured in 'Rolling Stone', at DC9, and played with Rosi Golan at Bloombars. Flo heads the local chapter of Just Plain Folks, an international music networking organization and has performed and sold out of her debut cd in venues across New England and the Mid-Atlantic states.\n\nThe last two years have proven to be a whirlwind for Flo. She shot a music video for her song Uh Oh which won the Grand Prize on OurStage.com! The same song was one of 5 finalists in a Cosmo Radio contest, winning her an interview and airplay on Sirius Radio. After a live audition, she was selected for the 2010 Artist Roster at the world renowned Strathmore Music Hall and invited to play the mansion in 2012. Flo was the only DC based musician selected to play Merriweather Post Pavilion as part of the Virgin Mobile Free Fest's Busking Brigade, where she joined an impressive bill: Weezer, Blink 182, the Bravery, and Franz Ferdinand. She was selected for a CMJ showcase in NYC, a GAP campaign in Charlottesville, and a feature video on the website for the National Association of Broadcasting. She has played for the Secretary of the Interior, performed at the National Press Club, and sung the National Anthem at a Washington Freedom game.\n\nFlo's new album, \"No Dustbunnies\", recorded with Chris Keup (O.A.R., Erin McKeown), Stewart Meyers (Lifehouse), and Brian Jones (Dave Matthews Band, Mandy Moore), has been a best seller on both CDbaby and Digstation and is getting radio play in NY, CT, and the DC metro area.

May\u2019s songwriting reveals her innate ability to emotionally engage with her audience through her lyrics. She shows us her heartbreak, but she also shows us her empowered and emboldened spirit. In her quest to find her most authentic self, May gifts each listener with a powerful, emotional experience that immediately connects her to us.\n\nRaised in a home full of art and music, Erlewine began writing songs at a very young age. As a teenager she hitchhiked across the country, honing her skills as a performer and absorbing the kind of stories and landscapes that would inform her music. She came to know the land and the pulse of the people. Her songs show a very real connection and concern with everyday folk. In the following years, Erlewine would perform in every kind of venue imaginable, from street corners to festival stages to the live-FM airwaves of A Prairie Home Companion.\n\nErlewine draws from a wide variety of influences to create her sound. Lyrically, her songs are rooted in hard-wrought wisdom, joy and sorrow, simplicity, and stories from her own everyday experiences. Musically, these messages are wrapped up in traditional folk roots, Americana, old-time country, swing, soul, and even rock n\u2019 roll. As a live performer, she is just as magnetic when fronting a seven-piece dance-party funk band as she is playing solo acoustic songs in a living room house concert.\n\nWith a long list of full length albums, two EPs, and numerous collaborations, Erlewine\u2019s catalog is proof of her creative power. Her work has been spotlighted by Rolling Stone and NBC\u2019s The Voice. National acts who have covered her songs include Greensky Bluegrass, Railroad Earth, Sawyer Fredericks (Season 8 winner of The Voice), Joshua Davis (Season 8 finalist of The Voice), Lindsay Lou & The Flatbellys, and others.\n\nErlewine uses her music as a platform for positive change. She considers her job a service-oriented one and carries the torch of the folk singer activist. Her voice on stage encourages connectedness and stresses the importance of environmental advocacy, social justice, creative empowerment and community building as necessary work in our world. May's body of work has become an anthem and an example of why we need to listen to women, and why we need to hear their stories.\n\nMay\u2019s music has touched people all over the world. Her words have held solace for weary hearts, offered a light in the darkness, and held a lot of space for the pain and joy of being alive in these times. When she starts to sing, there\u2019s no way around it: welcome in, everyone. The door is wide open.", "otherInfo": "Weekly check in with songwriter May Erlewine Songs and sentiments for lifting our hearts and holding space for all the feels.

Simple while funky. Classic but contemporary. Straightforward in the way it breaks down complex ideas and genres. And, at the end of the day, undeniably human. That said, it isn't quite a rebirth for the Nashville-born artist, who after stints living in New York and Los Angeles has returned back home to Music City. She's long had that lithe and smoky voice and an intensely expressive mastery over the piano. For those paying attention, Kandace's second album finds her unleashing what was there all along, all at once, for the first time.\n\nFor Kandace it boils down to a question that connects past to present: \u201cWhat would Nina Simone do if she had the technology of today? You could never put Nina in a box\u2014she would do a blues followed a classical piece, a jazz standard and then a Beatles cover. This LP took a lot of inspiration from that\u2014it\u2019s a mix of everything that I am.\u201d Indigo offers a fairly plausible answer to that impossible query: songs that swirl classical composition with quiet-storm cool, jazz poise with hip-hop swing, tropical warmth with soulful depth, and earthen groove with airy psych. With all but two of the tracks here produced by the mighty drummer-producer Karriem Riggins\u2014the living bridge spanning Oscar Peterson and Diana Krall to Erykah Badu and J Dilla\u2014Indigo creates a vibe as familiar as it is previously unheard.\n\nTake \u201cIndigo Part 1,\u201d and \u201cIndigo Part 2,\u201d a pair of interludes that give the album its title, where allusions\u2014Rachmaninoff, Portishead, Sade\u2014emerge and melt into the liquid soundscape. It feels like magic. And then there's \u201cDon\u2019t Need The Real Thing\u201d with a breezy dancehall beat that'd sound at home in today's Top 40, except far more musical and almost hypnotic in its combination of plaintive bass and busy percussion. Kandace\u2019s versatility is underscored when one juxtaposes \u201cBreakdown,\u201d a pop ballad stunner that Kandace co-wrote with the track\u2019s producer Jamie Hartman (Rag'n'Bone Man), and \u201cUnsophisticated,\u201d a sultry jazz ballad that features Roy Hargrove's trumpet playfully intertwined with Kandace's voice and keys.\n\nAsk our heroine how Indigo became the name of the entire project and she replies, with an air of mystery, \u201cThe album is an exotic flower, its own kind.\u201d The more you listen, the more that makes sense. In fact, she could be describing herself.\n\nKandace grew up the bi-racial daughter of a soul singer in a country-western town. Her dad Scat Springs had his own band but also sang backup for an incredible array of musicians: Brian McKnight, Chaka Khan, Aretha Franklin, Michael McDonald, Donna Summer. He did voices on Nashville radio too, while Kandace's mother had a full-time gig raising three talented daughters at home. Kandace's first passions were drawing and cars. \u201cMy dad gave me a Matchbox muscle car and my mom gave me a Barbie,\u201d she says. \u201cI drew a mustache on Barbie and never played with her again. I still have the Matchbox.\u201d\n\nShe collects, rebuilds, and resells cars to this day, but her plans to one day study automotive design were put on hold at age 10 when Scat brought home an upright piano (side note: Kandace still plans to pursue her dream of going to automotive school one day). She couldn't leave the keys alone, and soon mom started taking her to lessons, while dad let her tag along to sessions and led his own three-girl choir in the living room. \u201cHe'd make us do hymns but we hated it,\" Kandace laughs. \"We'd be singing and crying at the same time.\u201d\n\nHer father instilled in Kandace a love of the greats\u2014Nina of course, but also Ella Fitzgerald, Eva Cassidy, Luther Vandross\u2014and eventually they grew closer than ever through music. He helped her record a demo at 15 and got it into the hands of the production team Evan Rogers and Carl Sturken, who have written hits for the likes of Shakira, Christina Aguilera, and Kelly Clarkson, and are best known for discovering Rihanna as a teen and signing her to their production company SRP. They offered Kandace a deal but it was too much, too soon. \u201cMy dad said, \u2018If you sign with these guys, I'll never get the chance to make an album with you,\u2019\u201d says Kandace. \u201cI'm so glad I waited.\u201d She and Scat made that album when she was 17 and though it was never released, a piece of it appears on Indigo. Scat suffered a stroke in early 2017 that rendered him unable to sing, so she pulled one of his original vocals from their record and set it to new music. Powered by her signature Rhodes electric piano, \u201cSimple Things\u201d is the beating heart of this LP.\n\nWhen the time came, Evan and Carl got Kandace into Blue Note Records to audition for president Don Was. She performed a Bonnie Raitt song that he'd originally produced, and he was sold. Her 2014 self-titled EP found her teaming with cutting-edge hitmakers like Pop & Oak and won her late-night TV appearances on Letterman, Kimmel and Fallon, plus sets at festivals like Bonnaroo and Afropunk. Her 2016 full-length Soul Eyes took a different tack. Grown, stripped, and refined, it was essentially a live album\u2014solid, unfussy bedrock for future experimentation. All that history, and the fact that she featured on a couple Ghostface Killah cuts, made Karriem exactly the right person to work with Kandace to catalyze the best parts of various interests into something new.\n\n\u201cI love crossing genres and the direction on Indigo was to marry all the different things to tell her story,\u201d says Karriem, who tracked his drums at various studios while on the road with Krall, and chopped and reassembled his and Kandace's recordings into what you hear. \u201cIt sounds organic because everything was built around the songwriting. She says so much on the piano, and her voice is amazing\u2014it's the focal point of the whole sound. I kept it simple, added a little punch.\u201d\n\nKandace also co-wrote several songs with her longtime collaborators Evan and Carl including \u201cPiece of Me\u201d which finds Kandace channeling Sade to stunning effect. The three also wrote \u201cFix Me\u201d together, taking inspiration from Chopin\u2019s Prelude No. 4, and the groovy lament \u201cLove Sucks\u201d which was produced by Evan and Carl along with the UK\u2019s Jimmy Hogarth (Amy Winehouse, Corinne Bailey Rae).\n\nSome of Indigo's greatest songs are its most unadorned: \u201cBlack Orchid\u201d highlights the acoustic strum of guitarist-songwriter Jesse Harris (who struck Grammy gold with Kandace's early hero Norah Jones by penning her breakout hit \u201cDon\u2019t Know Why\u201d); a cover of The Stylistics' \u201cPeople Make the World Go Round\u201d drifts languidly over Karriem\u2019s drum programming; the remake of Gabriel Garz\u00f3n-Montano's \u201cSix Eight\u201d is molasses slow and crystalline pretty; and the Roberta Flack-popularized torch song \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\u201d (a crowd favorite at Kandace\u2019s live shows) radiates light from the white space between notes. That one was special for Kandace. \u201cPrince picked it for me to play for Purple Rain's 30th anniversary at Paisley Park in 2014,\u201d she says. \u201cHis band played behind me. He stood off to the right. It's something I'll never forget.\u201d That was Kandace's first big break. The legendary artist saw her on YouTube before she'd released a single note and invited her out. It's testament, again, to the power and potential that's been in Kandace this whole time.\n\nIf you listen closely, you'll hear a nod to Prince in the lyrics of \u201cFix Me,\u201d but the best tribute she could pay to him, Ms. Simone, and the humble legacy of the man who introduced her to music, her father, is by, as Karriem words it, \u201ccreating something that adds to the art form.\u201d With Indigo, an album that couldn't have been made by anyone but her, Kandace Springs does exactly that.\n\nFor more information contact Cem Kurosman at Blue Note Records\n(p) 212.786.8634 (e) cem.kurosman@umusic.com", "otherInfo": "Justice Aid Livestream: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8HCM_DCpPcJh_CIF45FToQ"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Leyla McCalla ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9571371.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Folk", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Leyla McCalla finds inspiration from a variety of sources, whether it is her Haitian heritage, living in New Orleans, or dancing at Cajun Mardi Gras. Leyla, a multi-instrumentalist, cellist and singer whose distinctive sound is impossible to replicate.\n\nLeyla\u2019s music reflects her eclectic and diverse life experiences, projecting a respect for eloquent simplicity that is rarely achieved. Born in New York City to Haitian emigrant parents, Leyla was raised in suburban New Jersey. As a teenager, she relocated to Accra, Ghana for two years. Upon her return, she attended Smith College for a year before transferring to New York University where she studied cello performance and chamber music. Armed with Bach\u2019s Cello Suites, Leyla moved to New Orleans to play cello on the streets of the French Quarter.\n\n\nIt is the move to New Orleans that signaled a journey of musical and cultural discovery for Leyla. \u201cNew Orleans always felt like home to me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe more I learned about the history of Louisiana, its ties to Haiti and French speaking culture, the more sense of belonging I felt and continue to feel.\u201d Most recently, Leyla has fallen in love with the late Louisiana Creole fiddlers Canray Fontenot and B\u00e9b\u00e9 Carri\u00e8re and has explored their fiddling styles on the cello.\n\n\nLeyla\u2019s move to New Orleans also signaled a new stage in her career. It was while playing on the street that she caught the attention of Tim Duffy, the founder and director of the Music Maker Relief Foundation. He invited Leyla to join the Music Maker Relief Foundation family and introduced her to the Carolina Chocolate Drops, a renowned African-American string band. After appearing on the band\u2019s GRAMMY-nominated album Leaving Eden and touring extensively with the group, she now focuses on her solo career.\n\n\nVari-Colored Songs: A Tribute to Langston Hughes, Leyla\u2019s debut album, is set for a February 2014 release. The album, which has been years in the making for Leyla, was given a push after a successful Kickstarter campaign in which she surpassed her $5,000 goal by four times to ultimately raise over $20,000. Vari-Colored Songs consists of compositions she has written to Langston Hughes poetry, Haitian folk songs and original pieces.

Cole has infused wit and poetry in seven albums of original work over a twenty-plus-year-career. In performance, Cole gives of herself to such a degree that she elicits tears and gasps and goose bumps from audiences. In her lyrics, she writes of inner life, of redemption, a woman\u2019s perspective; of social justice.\n\nAs the first woman in history to solely produce and receive the Best Producer Grammy nomination for her work, \u201cThis Fire\u201d, Cole broke boundaries with a searcher\u2019s spirit. Recently Paula is celebrating the 20th anniversary of \u201cThis Fire\u201d, and will be performing \u201cThis Fire\u201d in its entirety at select concerts. She has released a new video of \u201cWhere Have All The Cowboys Gone?\u201d, and a 20th anniversary-memento-live album entitled, \u201cThis Bright Red Feeling\u201d.\n\n\nFrom a small town Rockport, Massachusetts, Paula was raised in a musical family, learning standards that would eventually become \u201cBallads\u201d. She attended Berklee College of Music as a jazz singer, graduated in 1990, fervently writing and recording her original work. In 1993, Peter Gabriel heard her then-unreleased debut album \u201cHarbinger\u201d and invited Cole to join his \u201cSecret World Live\u201d tour. While touring internationally with Gabriel, Cole\u2019s \u201cHarbinger\u201d debuted in 1994 to critical acclaim. She toured non-stop and released her second album, 1997\u2019s \u201cThis Fire\u201d for which she won the Grammy for Best New Artist along with seven nominations. Cole led the pack at Lilith Fair\u2019s opening years, and in 1999, followed her muse to release \u201cAmen\u201d, a genre-crossing, social-spiritual album to diverse audiences.\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus to raise her daughter Sky, who battled childhood asthma, Cole returned to her \u201csecond, more authentic career\u201d releasing five more albums, \u201cCourage\u201d (2007), \u201cIthaca\u201d (2010), \u201cRaven\u201d (2013), \u201c7\u201d (2015), and \u201cThis Bright Red Feeling\u201d (2016), touring consistently over the last decade.\n\nCole walks her path with her fans, writing out her life, sharing her connection at concerts and over social media. Cole\u2019s compositions have been covered by a diverse range of artists (jazz legend Herbie Hancock, Annie Lennox, Katherine McPhee, JoJo, hip-hop duo THEY), she has sold approximately three million albums, performed with icons such as Peter Gabriel, Dolly Parton, Herbie Hancock, Emmylou Harris; Amy Lee of Evanescence, Burt Bacharach, Counting Crows, Matchbox 20, and currently has over three hundred thousand monthly listeners on Spotify.

Perez, the band\u2019s drummer, once called their powerhouse mix of rock, Tex-Mex, country, folk, R&B, blues and traditional Spanish and Mexican music \u201cthe soundtrack of the barrio.\u201d Three decades, two more Grammys, a worldwide smash single (\u201cLa Bamba\u201d) and thousands of rollicking performances across the globe later, Los Lobos is surviving quite well -- and still jamming with the same raw intensity as they had when they began in that garage in 1973. The band chronicles a key moment of their expansive journey on Disconnected In New York City, a dynamic live album that marks the band\u2019s 40th anniversary and launches their new association with 429 Records.\n\nRecorded over two nights in December 2012 at The City Winery in NYC, the engaging 12-song set celebrates Los Lobos\u2019 great legacy as a freewheeling and unpredictable live band, which most recently includes touring in Europe with Neil Young and Crazy Horse in June 2013. Disconnected in New York City features fresh interpretations of songs from throughout their three decade recording career, including their first ever live recording of \u201cLa Bamba,\u201d their worldwide pop crossover hit from the 1987 film which reached #1 on the U.S. and UK singles chart and whose video won a 1988 MTV Music Video Award. The collection covers the band\u2019s 25 year studio discography, from \u201cGotta Let You Know\u201d (a bouncy zydeco rocker driven by Hidalgo\u2019s accordion from How Will The Wolf Survive?) through \u201cTin Can Trust,\u201d a bluesy rock ballad that was the title cut from their last studio release in 2010.\n\nBy design, Disconnected in New York City has songs that have been longtime staples of Los Lobos\u2019 tours mixed with other gems that had somehow fallen by the wayside over the years. The mix includes the mid-tempo shuffling rocker title track from The Neighborhood (1990); the easy flowing and whimsical (thanks to Berlin\u2019s jazzy sax solo) \u201cOh Yeah\u201d (from This Time, 1999); the spirited, traditional flavored, Rosas penned Spanish language \u201cChuco\u2019s Cumbia\u201d (from The Town and the City, 2006); the graceful and spiritual \u201cTears of God\u201d (from By The Light of the Moon, 1987); \u201cLa Venganza de Los Pelados,\u201d a fiery burst of Latin rock fusion with mariachi textures (from The Ride, 2004); the soulful, simmering blues of \u201cLittle Things\u201d (from The Town and The City, 2006); the Latin blues funk classic \u201cSet Me Free Rosa Lee\u201d (from By The Light of the Moon); and two mid tempo funk pop/rock tunes from 2002\u2019s Good Morning Aztlan, \u201cMaria Christina\u201d and \u201cMalaque.\u201d\n\nAs per the literal meaning of its title, Disconnected In New York City sets itself apart from Los Lobos\u2019 other acclaimed live recordings (most notably, 2005\u2019s Live At the Fillmore) by stripping down the instrumentation for a mostly acoustic affair. Lozano, who drives the grooves with his bass and also plays the deep-bodied Mexican 6-string acoustic bass called the guitarron, says, \u201cIt\u2019s funny because when the venue hired us, they specifically requested that we do something acoustic to fit its smaller dinner house vibe. The idea popped into our heads to ask them if we could record it and they were cool with that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well known for our electric, high energy performances but we\u2019ve done acoustic stuff for certain smaller auditorium tours,\u201d he says. \u201cPlaying these songs acoustically makes them feel more intimate. We notice that when you play softer and quieter, the audience tends to pay attention to everything we\u2019re doing. When you play rock, they\u2019re thinking more about rhythm than melodies and lyrics, but playing them this way allows for more subtle elements of the songs to stand out.\u201d\n\nPerez laughs when he calls the Los Lobos Unplugged experience \u201cfolk music for the hearing impaired - it\u2019s still loud because the acoustic instruments are amplified! The idea of making a record like this came from never having the opportunity to work some of our favorite songs from over the years into our usual sets. Because most tours are done in support of new albums, the fresh material we play means that some favorite older tunes fall away over time. When we thought about making another live album and what would make it different, the logical concept was to revisit songs we haven\u2019t played in a while but had been requested by a lot of fans. We had already documented our rock show with Fillmore, so we felt kind of liberated to take another approach with this one.\n\n\u201cThere are two challenges releasing a live album, though,\u201d Perez continues. \u201cOne is choosing certain songs over other ones. It\u2019s like having kids. We love Tommy as much as Johnny but one day Johnny gets to go the park today and Johnny stays home. In spite of this, we do cover a lot of ground. The biggest problem is the way people sometimes perceive live albums, like they\u2019re an afterthought put out to fill some kind of gap. Bands love doing them but fans don\u2019t always pay attention. But historically, it can be a license for great creativity. Jimi Hendrix did Band of Gypsies to fulfill his last recording commitment, but it was one of the most incredible recordings he ever made. Because Disconnected in New York City marks a key anniversary and the start of us working with a new label, we put a lot of thought into the project, from its design and structure and how we performed the songs.\u201d\n\nSteve Berlin is Los Lobos\u2019 saxophonist, flutist and harmonica player who met the band while still with seminal L.A. rockers The Blasters. He joined the group after performing on and co-producing (with T-Bone Burnett) their breakthrough 1983 EP \u2026And A Time To Dance. Though he wasn\u2019t jamming with the others way back in the \u201cKrypton days\u201d (as Perez calls it) in the barrio garage, Berlin felt it was important to find a special way to mark his cohorts\u2019 40th year--just as they had done on their 30th by inviting special guests (Dave Alvin, Bobby Womack, Elvis Costello, Mavis Staples) to be part of their 2004 date The Ride.\n\n\u201cTrying to figure out a way to acknowledge 40 years as a band is harder than you might think,\u201d he says. \u201cWe got to play with all of our heroes on our 30th so what was something we had not done? So, like Louie said, we thought the best thing was to bring back songs we rarely if ever play and put them into a fresh context. We wanted to create something of value for our fans that would reflect the mutual appreciation we share with them \u2013 starting, of course, with \u2018La Bamba,\u2019 which we had never documented live before. I think it was important also that once we knew the set lists for the shows that we would eventually choose the final tracking from, we didn\u2019t over-think the arrangements. We only rehearsed these shows for a single day. The coolest part of how Disconnected worked out is that we hadn\u2019t been doing some of these songs long enough to worry about how to pull them off. And because we performed them acoustically, we couldn\u2019t just blast everyone with power and skate through them. We had to be present and make the choices that occurred to us in each moment.\u201d\n\nAround the time of their last big anniversary Rolling Stone magazine summed up that distinctive, diverse and spontaneous Los Lobos aesthetic perfectly: \u201cThis is what happens when five guys create a magical sound, then stick together for 30 years to see how far it can take them.\u201d Most fans know that the group came together from three separate units. Hidalgo, the band\u2019s lead vocalist/guitarist (whose arsenal includes accordion, percussion, bass, keyboards, melodic, drums, violin and banjo) met Perez at Garfield High in East LA and started a garage band. Rosas, who plays guitar and mandolin, had his own group, and Lozano launched a power trio. \u201cBut we all hung out because we were friends and making music was just the natural progression of things,\u201d says Perez. \u201cLike if you hang around a barbershop long enough, you\u2019re going to get a haircut.\u201d\n\nLooking back at the historical and cultural sweep of the band, Lozano sees the release of Disconnected In New York City as Los Lobos coming full circle. \u201cA lot of people forget that though we were rock musicians when we got out of high school, the band started off as an acoustic outfit,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted to play Mexican folk music because those were our roots and there was this whole Chicano awareness thing happening back in the early 70s. We started to pay attention to our traditions and culture, and focused on those styles of music for years. We studied music from every region of Mexico, learned how to play all these authentic instruments. So that\u2019s what we did for ten years until we decided to play rock again by bringing in drum and electric bass.\n\n\u201cWe were playing this restaurant gig for two years, and some small local clubs, playing the same songs, when people in the crowd started shouting out, \u2018Do you know any Beatles or Grateful Dead tunes?\u2019\u201d Lozano adds. \u201cSoon we got fired from the restaurant and headed back to the garage to write our first original songs that were rock with some accordion on them: \u2018Let\u2019s Say Goodnight\u2019 and \u2018How Much Can I Do?\u2019 We made a little tape and gave it to the guys in The Blasters, which included Steve Berlin, when we went to see them live on Sunset Strip. They loved our tunes and invited us to open their show at the Whiskey-A-Go-Go, which was the first time Los Lobos performed on the other side of the Los Angeles River. We played some originals and old favorites by Hendrix, Cream, The Yardbirds and Beatles \u2013 all the stuff we loved as kids. The icing on the cake is that the audience loved it, too.\u201d", "otherInfo": "David Hidalgo to perform for Justice Aid Livestream: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8HCM_DCpPcJh_CIF45FToQ"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "David Hidalgo ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-18", "Genre": "Blues, Americana, Folk, Latin", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "David Hidalgo (born October 6, 1954, Los Angeles, California) is a singer-songwriter, best known for his work with the band Los Lobos.

At age 12 she was appearing on Knoxville TV, and at 13, she was recording on a small label and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. When she graduated from high school in 1964 she moved to Nashville, taking many traditional elements of folklore and popular music from East Tennessee with her.\n\nParton's initial success came as a songwriter, with her songs being covered by Kitty Wells, Hank Williams, Jr., Skeeter Davis, and a number of others. She signed with Monument Records in late 1965, where she was initially pitched as a bubblegum pop singer, earning only one national chart single, \"Happy, Happy Birthday Baby,\" which did not crack the Billboard Top 100. Additional pop singles also failed to chart.\n\nThe label agreed to have Parton sing country music after her composition \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\" as recorded by Bill Phillips (and with Parton, uncredited, on harmony) went to No. 6 on the country charts in 1966. Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but didn't write), reached No. 24 country 1967, followed later the same year with \"Something Fishy,\" which went to No. 17. The two songs anchored her first full-length album, Hello I'm Dolly, that same year.\n\nIn 1967, Parton was asked to join the weekly syndicated country music TV program hosted by Porter Wagoner, replacing Norma Jean. She also signed with RCA Records, Wagoner's label, during this period, where she would remain for the next two decades. Wagoner and Parton immediately began a hugely successful career as a vocal duet in addition to their solo work and their first single together, a cover of Tom Paxton's \"The Last Thing on My Mind,\" reached the top ten on the U.S. country charts in late 1967, and was the first of over a dozen duet singles to chart for them during the next several years.\n\nParton is a hugely successful songwriter, having begun by writing country songs with strong elements of folk music in them based upon her upbringing in humble mountain surroundings. Her songs \"Coat of Many Colors\" and \"Jolene\" have become classics in the field, as have a number of others. As a composer, she is also regarded as one of country music's most gifted storytellers, with many of her narrative songs based on persons and events from her childhood.\n\nIn 1987, Parton left her longtime label, RCA, and signed with Columbia Records, where her recording career continued to prosper, but by the mid 1990s, Parton, along with many other performers of her generation, found that her new music was not welcome on country radio playlists. She recorded a series of critically acclaimed bluegrass albums, beginning with \"The Grass is Blue\" (1999) and \"Little Sparrow\" (2001), both of which won Grammy Awards. Her 2002 album \"Halos and Horns\" included a bluegrass version of the Led Zeppelin classic Stairway to Heaven. In 2005, Parton released Those Were The Days, her interpretation of hits from the folk-rock era of the late 1960s through early 1970s. The CD featured such classics as John Lennon's \"Imagine,\" Cat Stevens' \"Where Do The Children Play,\" Tommy James' \"Crimson & Clover,\" and the folk classic \"Where Have All The Flowers Gone\", as well as the title track.\n\nIn 2007, Dolly paved new musical ground by forming her own record label, Dolly Records. The label's first release - Backwoods Barbie - debuted at #2 on the Billboard country albums charts and marks Parton's first mainstream country album in 17 years.

Their big commercial breakthrough came with their fifth album \"Metallica\", also known as the Black Album. They've been a huge influence for plenty of new metal bands.\n\nOn October 28th 1981, drummer Lars Ulrich made guitarist/vocalist James Hetfield an offer he couldn't refuse: \"I\u2019ve got a track saved for my band on Brian Slagel's new Metal Blade label.\"\n\nIn fact, Lars didn't have a band at that time, but he did when James joined him. The two recorded their first track on a cheap recorder with James performing singing, rhythm guitar and bass guitar duties. Lars dutifully pounded the drums, helped with musical arrangements and acted as manager. Hetfield's friend and housemate Ron McGovney was eventually talked into taking up bass and Dave Mustaine took lead guitar.\n\nThe band adopted the name Metallica after a suggestion from Bay Area friend Ron Quintana, and they quickly began gigging in the Los Angeles area opening for bands like Saxon. Eventually recording a fully-fledged demo called No Life Til Leather, Metallica quickly saw the tape whistle around the metal tape-trading underground and become a hot commodity, with San Francisco and New York particularly receptive.\n\nMetallica performed two shows in San Francisco and found the crowds friendlier and more honest than LA's \"there to be seen\" mob. They also caught up-and-coming band Trauma, and most importantly their bass player, Cliff Burton. Cliff refused to move to Southern California: it was enough to convince Metallica to relocate to the Bay Area, and Cliff subsequently joined Metallica.\n\nIn New York, a copy of No Life Til Leather made its way to Jon Zazula's record shop, the aptly named Metal Heaven. Zazula quickly recruited Metallica to come out east to play some shows and record an album. The band made it to New York in a stolen U-Haul. Dave Mustaine, at that point the band's guitarist, was proving to be more problematic than even these loose young chaps could handle. Thus Mustaine was kicked out due to his drug and alcohol abuse (then going on to form the successful Megadeth), with roadie Mark Whitakker suggesting Kirk Hammett from Bay Area thrashers Exodus. Two phone calls and one flight later, on April 1, 1983 Kirk Hammett joined Metallica.\n\nMetallica's first album, Kill 'Em All, was released in late 1983 and some ferocious touring which saw the band's reputation soar both in the US and Europe. In 1984 they went to work with producer Flemming Rassmussen in Copenhagen at Sweet Silence Studios on their second album. 'Ride The Lightning' proved that Metallica were not some thrash-in-the-pan one trick pony, the writing and sound illustrating a growth, maturity and intensity which saw them immediately targeted by major management in QPrime, and a major label in Elektra. Both deals were done by the fall of '84 and their reputation continued to grow worldwide.\n\nReturning to the same studios in 1985, the group recorded 'Master Of Puppets', mixing in LA with Michael Wagner and releasing in early 1986. They quickly secured a tour with Ozzy Osbourne, and that stint (plus a top 30 album chart position) saw their fan base and name take a quantum leap. What had seemed so unlikely was nearer than ever to coming true; world domination.\n\nOn September 27th, 1986, that dream was given the most shattering of blows. Somewhere in Sweden on an overnight drive, the bands' tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, killing Cliff Burton. His influence on the musical growth of the band was enormous. Burton combined the DIY philosophies of jamming and experimenting with an acute knowledge of musical theory, and Hetfield in particular found a lot in his playing and personality. It was impossible to imagine Metallica without him. Yet Cliff would equally not have cared for people throwing in the towel because he wasn't around. And so it was that after a brief yet intense mourning period, Lars, James and Kirk decided to fight on. Jason Newsted was chosen from over 40 auditions to be the new bassist, the Michigan-born four-stringer leaving Arizona based Flotsam & Jetsam to take on the chance of a lifetime. The quartet immediately jumped into a tour, and then quickly recorded an EP of cover tunes titled Garage Days Re-Revisited (the band literally did the dirty work in Lars' garage!).\n\nWith Jason fully established, the band went back to record their fourth full-length album, ...And Justice For All, released in August 1988. The explosion that had been threatening for sometime finally happened. It reached #6 on the US charts, received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal/Hard Rock album, the band blew headliners Van Halen off-stage during the Monsters Of Rock tour and subsequently embarked upon an enormous worldwide tour. It was even the moment they finally delved into video territory, although the footage for 'One' was most certainly the most 'anti' video of it's era.\n\nThe band took the show back out on the road and toured extensively to all parts of the world. ...And Justice For All produced two US singles and the band's very first venture into music video for the song One.\n\nIn 1991 Metallica released the self-titled album, and saw their popularity soar to stratospheric heights. With new producer Bob Rock, this album was a subtle departure from the previous album with shorter songs, a fuller sound and simpler arrangements. It went straight to number one all over the world, stayed there for several weeks and ended up selling in excess of 15 million copies worldwide, spawned several legitimate singles as well as earning a Grammy and MTV/ American Music Awards. The band toured for close to three years, playing a solo arena tour in 'An Evening With Metallica', with Guns N' Roses on the duos' joint-headline stadium tour, and as headliner at many festivals. It meant that by the time the fall of 1993 rolled around, the four members were shattered both physically and mentally. Save for some Summer Shed action, there was little major activity as the band allowed their real lives to catch up with their rock lives.\n\nNearly four years would pass before the next Metallica album saw the light. Called Load, and recorded at The Plant in Sausalito California, it was the longest Metallica album to date with 14 songs, and signaled some significant changes for the band. Produced by Bob Rock, the material was loose, powerful and eclectic, the sound thick and punchy and the image one which screamed out change and freedom from enslavement to the Black album era. So many songs came from the sessions, that a second album titled ReLoad, followed in 1997. The Load tour was spectacular, encompassing cutting-edge technology, stuntmen, two-stages and an epic two-plus hours of performance. What ever doubts people might have had were swiftly blown away, and whilst Load could never match the heights of the Black album sales wise, it became a phenomenally successful album in it's own right.\n\nIn 1998, they re-packaged all the old B-sides, covers and the two previous Garage Days sessions and ran into The Plant to slam down 11 new covers. Electric, exciting and raw, the double-disc Garage Inc. was great reminder that for all the success, Metallica's heart still lay in the music. This point was further proven in 1999, when with conductor/composer Michael Kamen, Metallica embarked upon collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony to bring new dimension to classic material. Any potential skepticism of the project was blown away by two nights in April at the Berkeley Community Theater which proved to be epic milestones in the group's history. Far from their material being compromised, the arrangements of songs such as 'Master Of Puppets' gave symphonic instruments the chance to explode into the spaces and fill them with greater, heavier power than ever before. Having recorded and filmed the shows on the off-chance it might turn out alright on the night, Metallica released the S&M double-disc and DVD in late '99, marking yet another significant chapter in a Hall Of Fame - like history.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Metallica took yet fresher steps towards establishing freedom from convention, proving that it was possible to assemble, and headline, your own stadium tour without promoting a record. Summer Sanitarium, Hetfield's back not withstanding, was a huge success, and anticipation grew as to when the band would hit the studio again.\n\nThe anticipation was replaced by fear at the turn of 2001 when, after several rumors, Jason Newsted departed the band. No one reason can be fairly the cause, more several long-standing issues that silently grew beyond their initial molehills. Of course many assumed that this would precipitate the break-up of the band, when of course it merely provided a conduit to newer levels of creativity and understanding.\n\nThe band realized there was much work to be done on both their personal and creative relationships, and spent the first part of 2001 investigating spontaneous avenues of discovery both in and out of the studio. They set up shop at an old ex-Army barracks called The Presidio, jammed together at length and made a decision not to rush the process of finding a new band member, opting instead to have producer Bob Rock do all bass parts.\n\nIn the middle of 2001, James Hetfield reached a place in his life where he felt rehabilitation, rest and re-focus were necessary for him to not only continue but also flourish. It meant that for many months, the members of Metallica embarked upon various levels of deeper discovery about themselves, the band and their lives both as a band and human beings. The results were to manifest themselves two-fold: when they came together again in the Spring of 2002 there was a deeper respect and appreciation for each other than ever before. And they were finally ready to make a new album, free of outside expectations, free of inner expectations and independent of anyone.\n\nSettling into their new HQ, the band set about making 'St Anger' with Bob Rock. Those early Presidio sessions had certainly helped shape the freeform thinking and expression that was to come, but no-one, least of all the guys themselves, could've known just how fierce, raw and passionate the 'St Anger' material would turn out to be. With Rock always offering prompt and support, lyrics were written by everyone, writing was shared and performance was off the cuff, spontaneous and a 180 degree turn from the months of cut-and-paste which had become a part of the Metallirecording process in the past.\n\nIt was in the Fall of 2002 that the band decided it was time to search for a new bassist, and after some closed auditions with personal invitees over a few months, ex-Suicidal Tendencies/Ozzy Osbourne bass player Robert Trujillo was chosen to be the new member of Metallica. Note, member. Not bassist or hired gun or replacement. But a band member. His whole demeanor, happy, relaxed, warm, enthusiastic blended with over 15 years of experience and a ferocious finger-picking style made Robert the only natural choice.\n\nThe \u201cSt.Anger\u201d era kicked off on April 30th/May 1st with the small matter of a video shoot at San Quentin prison for the same-titled track, and continued in earnest with an MTV Icons tribute show a week later, where peers such as Ko\u042fn and Limp Bizkit lined up to pay tribute to the chaps. The guys also performed live, marking the first \u2018official\u2019 live appearance of Robert Trujillo as well as James Hetfield\u2019s first public performance since his stint in rehab.\n\nThen came the small matter of rehearsals which Metallica chose to do in front of their loyal fan club members over 4 nights at the historic Fillmore Theatre in San Francisco\u2026and then it was off to Europe in June for the start of what would end up being 19 months of touring, with the festival circuit taking the early brunt, Metallica successfully playing to multiple 60,000-plus crowds. \u201cSt.Anger\u201d saw it\u2019s release on June 5th, a raw, feral, unrestrained slab of molten Metallica stuffed with abrasion, aggression and the overspill of four years excitement, anger, frustration and ultimate fruition. For those who thought it would signal a radio-hohned band, \u201cSt.Anger\u201d was a big, fat slap in the face. Indeed, it was actually too heavy for some! Oh, and as if to prove that this \u2018new\u2019 Metallica were not a bunch of ginger-snap panty-waists, the boys played three shows in three different Parisian clubs in one day during mid-June, each venue harboring a temperature of not less than 100 degrees.\n\nIn the US, Summer Sanitarium followed, with Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit amongst the support acts on another series of stadium sell-outs. In the meanwhile, the fervor was slowly building for \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019, the documentary film by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky about the world of Metallica between 2001 and 2003. Ostensibly slated to be about the making of an album, the filmmakers found a whole new project developing when James went into rehab, and thus having been projected as a marketing tool, the end product ended up being an incredibly revealing 2 hour 20 minute documentary.\n\nAs the Mighty Metallica continued ploughing on through the world (going back to Europe, Japan and then onto Australia in January), SKOM was debuted to enormous critical acclaim at the 2004 Sundance Independent Film Festival in Utah during January.\n\nAnd the year continued in the way that you\u2019d imagine a Metalli-year does, deciding to play (seemingly) every single town capable of hosting a major arena gig in North America (some 80-plus dates) with Godsmack in support. Result? Oh well, the usual sell-outs you\u2019d expect for this \u2018in-the-round\u2019 two hour thirty minute set which saw no song off limits and many a fan favorite raised from retirement for a gleeful airing. (p.s\u2026.there was another Grammy in February for Best Metal Performance \u2013 \u2018St.Anger\u2019).\n\nJuly saw the theatrical debut of \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019 which opened to enormous critical acclaim and went on to hold it\u2019s own in North American theaters for three months before going through Europe. And August also saw the release of the first official Metallica book, \u201cSo What! The Good, the Mad, and the Ugly\u201d, an edited compilation of the band\u2019s fan club magazine spanning 10 years from 1994 to 2004.\n\nAnd still the \u2018Madly In Anger With The World\u2019 tour continued, selling out venues right through to it\u2019s final date in San Jose, California on November 29, 2004.\n\nThey did publicly state that the majority of 2005 would be spent re-charging those creative and mental batteries, and true to their word it was a quiet year, except for two little hometown gigs with the Rolling Stones at SBC Park in November. We all knew an entire year would not pass without at least a sighting of the guys!\n\nWith batteries re-charged after the two shows with the Stones, the guys hit the studio in early 2006 to start writing a new album and were excited to announce that they would be working with a new producer, Rick Rubin. The spring and summer found them escaping from the studio once again with shows in South Africa (their first ever visit to the continent!), Europe, Japan and Korea. \u201cThe New Song\u201d made its debut in Berlin, Germany on June 6 to give us all a little taste of things to come in 2007 with the remainder of the year scheduled for more writing and jamming.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Stephen Paul ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10376241.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-19", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A singer-songwriter from the Louisiana Bayou, Stephen Paul\u2019s music is inspired by his cajun roots and classic country.
