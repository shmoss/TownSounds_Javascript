He\u2019s on a mission to be a passionate voice defining the sound of Jazz in this age while also bringing street cred to the trombone with a bold, tight sound.\n\nBorn into the musical world (Mom Sherry Finzer is an international flutist), Finzer developed a fascination for the music of Duke Ellington and found himself, in high school, performing at the annual Essentially Ellington competition of Jazz at Lincoln Center. It was then that he decided to pursue a life in music himself. His budding talent was recognized by Wycliffe Gordon who began a life-long mentorship by writing four pieces for the young Finzer while he attended the Eastman School of Music. Nick went on to get his masters at Juilliard\u2019s prestigious Jazz program where he was mentored by the trombone legend Steve Turre.\n\nIn 2011 Nick was the winner of the Eastern Trombone Workshop\u2019s National Jazz Trombone Competition and was a finalist in the 2010 International Trombone Association\u2019s Carl Fontana Jazz Trombone Competition.\n\nIn January of 2013 Nick released his recording debut as a bandleader and composer with \u201cExposition\u201d (Outside In Music). Two tracks appearing on the album garnered Finzer a pair of accolades: The prestigious American Society of Composers and Performers (ASCAP)\u2019s Herb Alpert Award for young composers (2013 & 2015)\n\nIn 2014, Nick composed a new album-length work, \u201cThe Chase.\u201d Nick's sophomore album debuted in July of 2015 on Origin Records to rave reviews, a feature article in Downbeat Magazine, and peaked at #6 on the JazzWeek Charts.\n\nFamed trombonist and mentor Wycliffe Gordon called Finzer \u201ca new voice [in] the pantheon of upcoming trombone greats in the making\u201d and added \u201cNick's CD is a glowing example of things to come.\u201d\n\nWhen away from NYC, Finzer can be found touring the globe not only with his own projects, but as part of YouTube sensation, Scott Bradlee\u2019s Postmodern Jukebox. Finzer has joined the group on television, in viral videos with millions of views, and on tours across North America, Australia, New Zealand and Europe.\n\nFinzer has performed at top Jazz clubs and concert halls with Wynton Marsalis\u2019 Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, Lucas Pino\u2019s No Net Nonet, Ryan Truesdell's Gil Evans Project, Bob Stewart\u2019s Double Quartet, Frank Wess, Terrell Stafford, Lewis Nash, the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, Walt Weiskopf, Slide Hampton, Frank Kimbrough, Carl Allen, Steve Turre and many more.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1000 Morris Ave, Union, NJ 07083", "Artist": "Mark Toland ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8645060.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.233109, 40.680565], "Date": "Tue Apr 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-14", "Genre": "Variety", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Kean University", "moreBioInfo": "Mind Reader\n\n\"Mind Blowing!\" - The Chicago Tribune\n\"The best we've ever seen!\" - Windy City Live\n\"He must be THE DEVIL.\" - WGN TV\n\n2-Time TEDx Speaker\nAs Seen On: NBC, ABC, WGN, CBS, NPR, Sirius XM, and more\n\"Chicago Theater Award - Best Special Event\"\n\"Best of Fringe\" - FRIGID NYC\n\"Audience Choice\" - FRIGIC NYC\n\"Pick of Fringe\" - Orlando Fringe\n\"Best of Fringe\" - KC Fringe\n\"Top Selling Show\" - Chicago Fringe", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "18 W 18th St, New York, NY 10011", "Artist": "Samuel Miller ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10251295.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.993278, 40.739003], "Date": "Tue Apr 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Books of Wonder", "moreBioInfo": "author - a lite too bright (harper-collins, 2018)", "otherInfo": "Samuel Miller, along with Cole and Jordan of Paradise Fears, bring the Redemption Prep Book Tour to Books of Wonder in New York City!"}, {"Address": "6 Delancey St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Lime Cordiale ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9055034.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.993383, 40.720353], "Date": "Tue Apr 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-14", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Bowery Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "Hailing from Sydney\u2019s northern beaches, brothers Oli and Louis Leimbach of Lime Cordiale command legions of dedicated fans with their incredible live set. They say there\u2019s an innate bond between siblings, a relationship is forged that can last a lifetime. Now, take that intuitive understanding and translate it into music; magic can happen. This is exactly the case for the brothers of Lime Cordiale, whom growing up within a creative, musical family on Sydney\u2019s Northern Beaches, it was natural for the pair to make music together.\n\nLime Cordiale express their feelings that people need to break the rules in order to progress, with Oli stating \u201cyou don't have to take the conservative route. You don't need to necessarily plan out your life in your twenties or thirties\u201d. With the brothers compassionate and progressive awareness, the band are focussed on using their love of music to keep Sydney\u2019s music scene alive, along with the support from their surrounding communities and the Australian community as a whole.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the pair are passionate, and overly sensitive to the effect humans have on Australia\u2019s environment after being raised on an island home and in coastal areas while growing up. The band\u2019s vegan lifestyle and plastic free rider may not be to everyone\u2019s tastes, but their response is simply - \u201cfuck \u2018em\u201d.\nIn addition to the hectic schedule and life-band balance, Louis is an avid artist holding regular showcases, but notes that whether he is cutting lino or painting, this side of his life is kept secluded, \u201cLino cutting is a very time-consuming art form, requires a lot of attention and I find myself doing it alone\u201d says Louis. His art form though does cross over to band-life, with Louis designing all album art, posters and merchandise and states that the creative process can take time to think up ideas and sometimes his work can get so out of control he has to go into hiding, but he calls it \u201cmeditative and an escape\u201d and likes the process itself over the end result.\n\nWhen they aren\u2019t busy playing shows, cutting footage for films or designing some form of artwork, Oli and Louis return to their roots, the ocean. Though they love being close to the CBD, sometimes the inner-city pressure means they need to get back to the freedom that the ocean can give, Oli tells \u201cyou can be working in the dirt and grind of the city just behind you, but out there on the waves the world is yours\u201d.\n\nLime Cordiale received no airplay from triple j, FBI or commercial radio with the release of their debut album \u201cPermanent Vacation\u201d in Oct 2017, but this essentially underground band was in no need of the tastemaker radios support. Lime Cordiale were happy touring Australia, brewing a strong following along the way. With the release of their single \u201cDirt Cheap\u201d (Nov \u2013 18) the band exploded to the charts of triple j, then after only 3 short months the single placed #86 on triple j\u2019s infamous Hottest 100 countdown.\n\nIn Feb 2019, Lime Cordiale released their latest single \u201cMoney\u201d to accompany their fast selling tour of the same name. The extensive run of shows includes Melbourne, New Zealand and Sydney, and will continue in April to Tasmania, Adelaide, Western Australia and regional New South Wales. So far selling out every show (bar one) they\u2019ve performed (14/20 sold out) and over 5300+ tickets sold. Meanwhile the single was succeeding by its own right, featuring on Spotify\u2019s New Music Friday, iTunes\u2019 Best of the Week and by week 2 was #1 most played on triple j.\n\nThe road ahead looks bright and busy for Sydney based band Lime Cordiale, with a new album just over the horizon and a long-awaited European tour set to unite their international audiences.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Grace Minnick ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10105490.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Tue Apr 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-14", "Genre": "Folk, Cobalt", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Grace Minnick\u2019s crafted, story-centered lyrics move people to laugh, cry, and sing along.

Brash and outspoken \u2014 her shaven head, angry visage, and shapeless wardrobe a direct challenge to the popular culture's long-prevailing notions of femininity and sexuality \u2014 O'Connor irrevocably altered the image of women in rock; railing against long-standing stereotypes simply by asserting herself not as a sex object but as a serious artist, she kick-started a revolt which led the way for many female performers. O'Connor ranked among the most distinctive and controversial popular music stars of the 1990s, the first and in many ways the most influential of the numerous female performers whose music dominated airwaves throughout the decade. Her first album, The Lion and The Cobra, was released in 1987, and its popular and critical acclaim made her a star of pop music. She produced her second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, a critical success that included her hit single \"Nothing Compares 2 U,\" a song written by Prince. O'Connor was as well-known for her political beliefs as for her music (she once shredded a photo of Pope John Paul II on U.S. television), but in recent years she has been less publicly controversial. In 2003 she announced her retirement from the music business. In 2000 released her album \"Faith and Courage\". Another album, Throw Down Your Arms was released in 2005.

Can a song be so intensely personal that it somehow manages to reach beyond itself towards something universal? With this record, Dylan turned the American Songwriter into a definite vocation, a job that\u2019s core responsibility was the nearly impossible task of simply and honestly singing your own story, and somehow mysteriously manage to speak for all of us.\n\nWhile Caroline Spence may not look like one of the road-hardened troubadours of America's past, with the release of Spades & Roses, the young songwriter from Charlottesville Virginia proves she is every bit as serious. Having won numerous songwriting awards from industry mainstays like the Kerrville Folk Festival and American Songwriter Magazine, and garnered nods and admiration from both Miranda Lambert and her fellow writers in the Nashville underground, Caroline has delivered a record to meet the expectation: Quite simply, 11 songs of gorgeous Americana that remind us of why we fell in love with the genre in the first place.\n\nIt\u2019s is a rare but unmistakable authenticity and emotional resonance that can't be faked, all delivered from a voice that somehow manages to be both ethereally pristine and yet profoundly raw and human-- a disarming union of self-assuredness and vulnerability that runs throughout the record. Under the guidance of Producer Neilson Hubbard, \"Spades and Roses\" strips away all of the sonic barriers that might stand between Caroline and her listener, allowing her fragile melodies and first person confessionals to do their work-- reaching out and empathizing, providing a soundtrack to our own hidden stories. Every song on the record--whether pop or meditative, glib or heartbreaking-- asks the essential question of whether or not the listener can recognize himself.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a song like \"Southern Accident,\" a strikingly personal and heartbreaking account of the lingering effects of her parents divorce on her own search for love and commitment, or \"Softball,\" an extended anthemic metaphor for the all-to-real injustices of the gender gap in modern life, Spades and Roses is Caroline's unflinching testimony and reminder as to why songs are important: It\u2019s about paying attention. It's about whether you can take a handful of chords and find those still points of peace and clarity and joy amidst the basic confusion, struggles, and emotional wreckage of our everyday lives. Most importantly, it\u2019s about finding a way to make it beautiful.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1090 Wyckoff Ave, Queens, NY 11385", "Artist": "Jeauxsmeaux ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.902137, 40.694328], "Date": "Wed Apr 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "H0L0", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Jeffrey Pepper Rodgers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8737520.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Wed Apr 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-15", "Genre": "Acoustic", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Online songwriting workshop", "moreBioInfo": "Jeffrey Pepper Rodgers is a grand prize winner of the John Lennon Songwriting Contest, a contributor to NPR\u2019s All Things Considered, and the founding editor of Acoustic Guitar magazine.\n\n\u201cJeffrey Pepper Rodgers\u2019 songs ring true and new.

That 2008 release, with its gorgeously melodic writing and improvising and deft use of indie-rock, electronica and hip-hop elements, established Parks as one of the most gifted and original young voices in jazz. \u201cThis is the natural successor to that record,\u201d says the New York-based artist, 34. \u201cIt\u2019s taking the ideas of that project and doubling down on them\u2014fully committing to that direction.\u201d\n\nLittle Big also marks the recorded debut of the intuitive working group that gives the album its title (and which takes its name from a fantastical novel by John Crowley\u2014a favorite book of Parks and, the pianist notes, Wayne Shorter). Parks handled the production duties, with engineering by Daniel Schlett (whose credits include The War on Drugs and Ghostface Killah). The album was mixed by both Schlett and Grizzly Bear bassist/producer Chris Taylor, the latter of whom Parks met in a Seattle big band at the age of 10. \u201cWe put a lot of time and care into the way this record sounds, and the result\u201d\u2014simultaneously crystalline and warm, postmodern and natural\u2014\u201cmakes me really happy,\u201d Parks adds.\n\nAfter experimenting with various lineups and sessions, Parks landed on three musicians ideally suited for this atmospheric, genre-bending new work. \u201cThis feels like a real band, one that will be around for a while,\u201d he says. Greg Tuohey is the longest-running member, a guitarist who places taste and tone ahead of chops-focused bravado\u2014or, as Parks puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s chasing Miles Davis\u2019 phrasing with Jimi Hendrix\u2019s attitude.\u201d On electric bass is David \u201cDJ\u201d Ginyard Jr., a left-handed player with a distinctively lyrical approach and an aptitude for seeing the bigger musical picture. \u201cHe really understands what the bass does, and he thinks super compositionally,\u201d Parks says, noting how some of Ginyard\u2019s basslines have become integral to the songs. Anchoring the unit is Tommy Crane, a forward-looking, stylistically resourceful drummer who brings both explosive creativity and a producer\u2019s knack for precision. \u201cHe has a very unique ability to internalize and commit to the particular heartbeat of each song,\u201d Parks explains, \u201cbut always with this vital and elastic human element, which is rare to hear in combination with the kinds of grooves we\u2019re exploring.\u201d\n\nTogether they interpret a panoramic set of Parks\u2019 original compositions\u2014from the 21st-century fusion of \u201cKid,\u201d to the odd-metered studio jam \u201cProfessor Strangeweather,\u201d to the trip-hop ambiance and folkish melody of \u201cBells.\u201d The psychedelic \u201cAquarium\u201d\u2014\u201cprobably the sexiest tune on the album,\u201d Parks says, chuckling\u2014conjures up the trippy, sultry neo-soul vibe of Meshell Ndegeocello, before Tuohey offers a solo that channels Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood. \u201cDigital Society\u201d somehow manages to evoke Afrobeat, bluegrass and Aphex Twin. \u201cLilac\u201d is, as Parks describes it, \u201ca solo-piano pop tune.\u201d The leader\u2019s \u201csecret favorite\u201d cut, \u201cDoors Open,\u201d seeks inspiration in late Talk Talk and the \u201cearnestness\u201d of Brian Blade & the Fellowship Band. That closing track is \u201cdefinitely not afraid to go straight for your heart,\u201d Parks says with a laugh.\n\nA prodigal talent raised outside of Seattle, Parks moved with his family to study at the Manhattan School of Music when he was 16. Two years later, on the recommendation of a teacher, NEA Jazz Master Kenny Barron, he was invited to join trumpet great Terence Blanchard\u2019s band. That tenure began the relationship with Blue Note that would yield Invisible Cinema, released when Parks was just 24. In The Guardian, John Fordham called the album \u201ca real independent vision,\u201d adding that \u201cParks is a fast-rising star.\u201d In the September 2008 issue of JazzTimes, Parks was named a \u201cNew Jazz Visionary\u201d alongside current giants like Esperanza Spalding, Robert Glasper and Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah. Over the ensuing decade, Parks certainly made good on that early promise. He was an essential presence in Kurt Rosenwinkel\u2019s band, including on the guitarist\u2019s well-received double album from 2012, Star of Jupiter. As a member of the supergroup James Farm, also featuring saxophonist Joshua Redman, bassist Matt Penman and drummer Eric Harland, Parks put out two celebrated albums on Nonesuch. In 2013 he released his first disc as an ECM Records artist, Arborescence, which DownBeat\u2019s J.D. Considine called \u201ca forest-invoking solo-piano effort marked by wonderfully detailed narratives and a harmonic palette worthy of Ravel.\u201d Find the Way, an ECM trio session with bassist Ben Street and drummer Billy Hart, followed last year and garnered equally enthusiastic reviews.\n\nOn Little Big, Parks taps into the lessons he\u2019s absorbed throughout those far-reaching experiences, while also progressing some of the au courant sounds he investigated on Invisible Cinema. \u201cThis feels like the most personal record I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d he says. What\u2019s more, the album reflects his worldview, an outlook in which optimism and inclusion supersede politics. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot out there right now to protest against, and it feels like it\u2019s the artist\u2019s duty to create music that reckons with the issues of the day. Nonetheless, this is not a protest record. It\u2019s not against anything; it\u2019s much more for something. What we\u2019re aiming to do is blend genres and ideas in an open and fluid way, so that structure and freedom work together to serve the larger concept of the song. It\u2019s a way of working together that feels representative of the kind of world I could imagine many of us might want to live in.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "80 E Ridge Rd, Ridgefield, CT 06877", "Artist": "Dante Palminteri ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8679019.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.49241, 41.28225], "Date": "Wed Apr 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-15", "Genre": "Pop Singer Songwriter", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Ridgefield Playhouse", "moreBioInfo": "Growing up between the East and West coasts, American singer-songwriter and actor Dante Palminteri matured his musical styling at an early age, drawing inspiration from John Mayer's lyrical mastery of the human psyche and Ed Sheeran's genre-defying melodies.

The limitless combined talents of blues harmonica virtuoso and sly, soulful singer Estrin, guitar mastermind Kid Andersen, keyboard wizard Lorenzo Farrell and endlessly creative drummer Derrick \u201cD\u2019Mar\u201d Martin take Estrin\u2019s inventive, original songs to new and unexpected places. On stage, the band\u2019s ability to deliver an unpredictable, no-holds-barred show is unmatched.\n\nNow, Rick Estrin & The Nightcats return with their fourth studio album, Contemporary. With the band kicking everything up a notch, Estrin and the Nightcats explore some different sounds, instrumentation and grooves, while maintaining the trademark Nightcats style. Produced by Andersen and Estrin and recorded at Andersen\u2019s now-famous Greaseland Studio in San Jose, California, Contemporary delivers twelve surprising, wise-cracking, foot-stomping songs, including nine by Estrin (one co-written with Andersen), one each by Andersen and Farrell, and one obscure Bobo Jenkins cover. From the noir-ish romp I\u2019m Running to the hilarious title track to the sardonic Resentment File (co-written with Estrin\u2019s friend of over 50 years, Joe Louis Walker), Contemporary packs a modern blues punch. According to Estrin, \u201cRecording at Greaseland, we all had so much fun and were so relaxed, the genius ideas just started pouring in from all sides. I really expect this record to blow some minds.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Estrin\u2019s celebrated songwriting and spectacular harmonica playing, he and the band are among the most entertaining and colorful showmen around. Estrin\u2019s flashing harmonica solos, quick wit and signature hipster-cool look, Andersen\u2019s off-the-cuff guitar pyrotechnics, Farrell\u2019s mighty organ and piano work and D\u2019Mar\u2019s dynamic drumming bring instant fun to their live performances. \u201cPeople don\u2019t go out to see people who look like themselves,\u201d says Estrin. \u201cThey want to see something special. I was schooled in this business to be a showman, and that\u2019s what you get when you come to see us perform. We know how to put on a show. I feel sorry for anyone who has to follow us.\u201d\n\nEstrin was schooled by some of the very best blues musicians. While still a teen, he was tutored by San Francisco\u2019s famous musician (and pimp) Fillmore Slim. He was mentored by Oakland\u2019s legendary Rodger Collins, and gigged with blues stars Lowell Fulson and Z.Z. Hill. Estrin moved to Chicago when he was 19 to work with Windy City bluesmen Johnny Young, Eddie Taylor, Sam Lay and John Littlejohn, and even jammed with Muddy Waters. He returned to California and continued to hone his craft. By the time he joined forces with guitarist Little Charlie Baty and formed Little Charlie & The Nightcats in 1976\u2014a band he would front for the next 30 years\u2014Estrin was a seasoned performer with plenty of talent and a newfound knack for writing killer original songs.\n\nUpon Baty\u2019s retirement from touring in 2008, Estrin recruited high-flying guitar wunderkind Christoffer \u201cKid\u201d Andersen and formed Rick Estrin & The Nightcats. The band quickly became a worldwide favorite with blues fans as well as critics and radio programmers. \u201cKid\u2019s a fearless nut on the guitar,\u201d says Estrin. \u201cHe\u2019s really the only guy who could fit in with us.\u201d With an uninhibited style that perfectly meshed with Estrin\u2019s wildly imaginative songs, the new band charged out of the gate. Billboard called them \u201cfabulous, remarkable and original.\u201d\n\nSince the 2009 release of Rick Estrin & The Nightcats\u2019 celebrated Alligator Records debut, Twisted, the 2012 follow-up One Wrong Turn, 2014\u2019s crowd-pleasing You Asked For It...Live!, and 2017\u2019s Groovin\u2019 In Greaseland, the band has toured the world, earning high praise and standing ovations everywhere they go. The Chicago Sun-Times said, \u201cThese are serious musicians having a hotter than hot good time. It\u2019s tough to stay in your seat when Estrin and his musical cohorts get cooking.\u201d They\u2019ve performed at festivals and concert stages from San Francisco to Chicago to New York, and everywhere in between, plus tours of the United Kingdom, Norway, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Poland, Australia, Israel and recently Estonia and Russia. The band\u2019s worldwide popularity helped Estrin win five Blues Music Awards, including two nods for Song Of The Year (1994 and 2018), Best Instrumentalist\u2014Harmonica (2013) and Traditional Blues Male Artist Of The Year (2018). The full band, Rick Estrin & The Nightcats, won the highly coveted 2018 Blues Music Award for Band Of The Year.\n\nAccording to Estrin, \u201cContemporary is the most fully realized expression of who Rick Estrin & The Nightcats really are and what we\u2019re capable of as a band. With the group\u2019s help, everything I envisioned for the songs got turned up a notch, with everyone getting more and more inspired.\u201d This is modern blues at its most potent and powerful, with phenomenal musicianship and lyrics that cut with a wink and nod. According to the UK\u2019s Blues & Rhythm, \u201cRick Estrin & The Nightcats have crafted an instantly identifiable sound. They serve up insightful, original blues combined with tough rock\u2019n\u2019 roll. This band is superb.\u201d\n\nRick Estrin (harmonica, vocals)\nRick Estrin was born in San Francisco, California in 1949, and grew up fiercely independent. As a 10-year-old boy, he made his way to the tough Market Street area and befriended many of the neighborhood characters. When he was 12, his older sister gave him a copy of Ray Charles\u2019 The Genius Sings The Blues, and he became infatuated with the music. Albums from Jimmy Reed, Champion Jack Dupree, Mose Allison, Nina Simone and others soon followed. By the time he was a teenager, Estrin had immersed himself in the urban, African-American culture surrounding him. He got his first harmonica at age 15, and by age 18 was proficient enough to begin sitting in at black clubs around the city. He first jammed with blues master Lowell Fulson and immediately was hired to open five shows for R&B giant Z.Z. Hill. He worked five nights a week for almost a year with guitar legend Travis Phillips in a band fronted by famed pimp/bluesman Fillmore Slim (who was the centerpiece of the acclaimed Hughes Brothers documentary American Pimp). Slim introduced Estrin to singer Rodger Collins, the man who would become Rick\u2019s first real musical mentor. Collins schooled Rick on the finer points of songwriting and show business. At 19, Estrin relocated to Chicago and worked with some of the city\u2019s best bluesmen. He met and jammed with the legendary Muddy Waters, who told Rick, \u201cYou outta sight, boy! You got that sound! You play like a man!\u201d Muddy wanted Estrin to go on the road with him, but Estrin missed Muddy\u2019s phone call and it never happened. Estrin eventually moved back to the Bay Area, met guitarist Charlie Baty and formed Little Charlie & The Nightcats. With Charlie\u2019s retirement from touring in 2008, Rick brought in guitar virtuoso Kid Andersen and formed Rick Estrin & The Nightcats.\n\nEstrin cites Sonny Boy Williamson II, Percy Mayfield and Detroit bluesman Baby Boy Warren as his major songwriting influences. His work on the reeds is deep in the tradition of harmonica masters Sonny Boy Williamson II and Little Walter Jacobs, while at the same time pushing that tradition forward with his innovative songs. And his sly and soulful vocals are the perfect vehicle for driving those songs home.\n\nKid Andersen (guitar)\nChristoffer \u201cKid\u201d Andersen was born in Telemark, Norway. A blues fan since childhood, Andersen fell in love with the music of Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, Junior Watson, and the Kings (B.B., Albert and Freddie). By the time he was 18, he was backing all the American blues stars who came through Norway, including Homesick James, Nappy Brown and Willie \u201cBig Eyes\u201d Smith. He moved to California when he was 21. Once in the U.S.A., Andersen earned a green card as an \u201cAlien of Extraordinary Ability.\u201d Andersen released four solo albums before joining blues harmonica legend Charlie Musselwhite\u2019s band in 2004, a gig that lasted until he joined Rick Estrin & The Nightcats in 2008. In addition to being an expert multi-instrumentalist (guitar, bass, keyboards, percussion), Kid\u2019s talents as engineer and producer keep his now-famous Greaseland Studio fully booked. Winner of the 2017 Keeping The Blues Alive Award, Greaseland has been featured in The San Jose Mercury News as well as on NPR.

He\u2019s traveled the world, played stages in historic clubs, in massive stadiums and at cultural landmarks, recorded a solo album, appeared on national television and performed for two sitting U.S. presidents.\n\nHis collaborations range from pop idols to jazz legends, and the list reads like a lineup for the best New Orleans Jazz Fest ever. He\u2019s worked with Stevie Wonder, Quincy Jones, Alicia Keys, The Jonas Brothers, Wyclef Jean, Justin Bieber, Diddy, Natalie Cole, James Ingram, Wynton Marsalis, Ravi Coltrane, Chris Botti along with many, many more. (See Artists.) And to think\u2026 so little of that might have been possible if he\u2019d gotten his wish 21 years ago.\n\nWhen the music teacher at Seattle\u2019s Sacajawea Elementary School led a musical instrument presentation for 4th graders in the school library, young Jumaane, then 9 years old, was immediately drawn to the French Horn and asked to play the instrument. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take this instead,\u201d she replied, explaining that the school had no French Horns. Jumaane \u201csettled\u201d for the trumpet and his life was never the same.\n\nIt took some time to build a foundation. \u201cFor the first few years I was horrible,\u201d he admits, \u201cand when I would practice, my mom would make me go outside in the yard because she didn\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d But Jumaane was a quick learner and a voracious student. From his earliest experiences, he established a career-long aptitude toward absorbing anything that would make him a better musician and person.\n\nBy 16, while most kids are content with getting a driver\u2019s license, Jumaane was on a plane for the first time headed to Europe. As a member of the Roosevelt High School Jazz Band under the direction of Scott Brown, he spent three weeks performing at such events as the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland and the North Sea Jazz Festival in Den Hague. He was also able to see many jazz greats in concert. The tour was a defining experience. After that, Jumaane recalls, \u201cI was hooked on music and becoming a great musician myself.\u201d Back in the States, thirsty for more knowledge (and the rush of adventure), he started sneaking backstage at shows to talk to musicians, soaking in an extracurricular education of his own design.\n\nOnly a few years later, Jumaane was living in New York, attending New School University on scholarship. Classrooms were his secondary education as New York\u2019s many Jazz clubs offered a live and lively education. He made connections in the jazz scene by catching shows and performing at jam sessions.\n\nWhile Jumaane was headlining his first gig in New York City he met legendary jazz drummer Rashied Ali, who happened to live a few blocks from the club. Mentored by the great John Coltrane, Rashied in turn became Jumaane\u2019s mentor and a true father figure to the young musician and man. Ali kept him grounded, but taught him to accept the boundless potential of music. He coached him to acquire as much knowledge as he could, but to research and come to his own conclusions rather than take anything at face value. They were great lessons from a great man.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t long before another legendary jazz musician would mentor this budding talent. Jumaane was still living in Seattle when he first met Wynton Marsalis. In fact, it was Marsalis who first recommended that he make the big move to the Big Apple. Now, a year into living in New York City, Jumaane was one of 17 musicians (including only 4 trumpeters) invited to join the inaugural class of Jazz Studies at Julliard \u2013 a program developed by Marsalis.\n\nSuddenly the classroom was the place to be. Jumaane immersed himself in trumpet technique, classical repertoire, jazz technique and jazz repertoire, orchestration and arranging from both classical and jazz perspectives, music production, music preparation and even music software notation. Meanwhile, Marsalis took him (and only one other student) on for one-on-one private trumpet instruction through Jazz Studies at Juilliard, a practice he hasn\u2019t engaged in since. That relationship had a profound effect on Jumaane. \u201cWynton is probably the most disciplined person I\u2019ve ever gotten the chance to be around and learn from,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel very fortunate to have him as a mentor to this day.\u201d\n\nGood fortune is only a small part of it, however. Jumaane, by nature recognizes and seeks opportunity. More than that, he strives constantly to earn it. Even before he graduated from Julliard\u2019s four-year curriculum, his hard work paid off with some great professional opportunities.\n\nIn 2002, Marsalis awarded him a scholarship to attend the Academy of Achievement Summit in Dublin, Ireland. The attendees were some of the greatest thinkers alive: world leaders such as Gorbachev and Bill Clinton, Hollywood giants such as James Earl Jones, Nobel Prize winners. Asked the night before the event\u2019s gala finale, Jumaane and a fellow student performed a duet for the event under pressure with no repertoire prepared, \u201copening\u201d for Chuck Berry. One year later, as February was being declared African-American Music Month, Jumaane and the Jazz Museum in Harlem All-Stars performed for George W. Bush in the East Room of the White House.\n\nIn 2005, thanks to the recommendation of a Julliard classmate, Jumaane was invited to audition for Michael Bubl\u00e9\u2019s band. Almost seven years later, Jumaane continues to perform, record, travel and learn as a part of the Bubl\u00e9 family. \u201cThe experience has been what I imagine post-graduate school to be like,\u201d he says. \u201cMichael Bubl\u00e9 is a wonderfully humble, down to earth and extremely generous person who thrives off of his family and friends realizing their own hopes, dreams and goals. It has been truly inspirational working with him.\u201d\n\nFrom touring the world with Bubl\u00e9 to playing the Grammy Awards show with Stevie Wonder and the Jonas Brothers to recording \u201cAs I Am\u201d with Alicia Keys to appearing on the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d soundtrack to scoring and performing music for the film \u201cHandsome Harry,\u201d Jumaane\u2019s accomplishments go on and on. The recordings he\u2019s appeared on have sold more than 25 million copies worldwide, garnered four Grammy nominations and earned three Grammy wins. The TV shows he\u2019s appeared on total an audience of around 100 million viewers.\n\nJumaane has relished, with gratitude, every experience he\u2019s had as a musician, and intends to embrace new opportunities to work with amazing talents. But finally, after years of conceptualizing, the time has come to take a big step forward into the spotlight, to turn his own ideas into reality. In 2010, he entered the studio to begin work on his debut album, \u201cI Only Have Eyes For You.\u201d A celebration of the Great American Songbook with the theme of love and romance, the album includes interpretations of classic tunes full of personal emotion and meaning for Jumaane.\n\n\u201cI imagine that it is very rewarding to see your own project become successful,\u201d he says. \u201cAs the leader, you get back what you put into it.\u201d Now only time will tell how a lifetime of learning and all-star mentorship will pay off.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "289 10th Ave St, New York, NY 10001", "Artist": "DJ Politik ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8635854.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.002675, 40.750051], "Date": "Wed Apr 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-15", "Genre": "Hip Hop, Edm", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Marquee New York", "moreBioInfo": "DJ Politik cut his teeth in the L.A. nightlife scene by sneaking into exclusive Hollywood nightclubs while still in high school.

Usually, when we cannot deal with pollution ourselves, when the dimensions of the product do not allow us to wash it in a machine (carpets are so accurate), and also when the cut and weaving are so complicated that it will be almost impossible to smooth them after an independent washing.\n\nDry cleaning of carpets and upholstered furniture solves two main problems:\n\nIt does not change the shape of the product;\nShe does not crumple it, so there is no need to smooth it.\nIn addition, water can have a negative effect on some types of stains, and instead of removing them, you get only stains.\n\nDry cleaning of furniture and textiles got its name due to the type of cleaner used. Its composition is similar to ordinary powder, but in reality it consists of a huge number of micro-sponges soaked in a cleaning agent. As a result, contaminants of any origin, starting from oily stains and ending with street-household stains, are easily removed from the surface of the fabric.\n\nThe price of dry cleaning is slightly higher than wet, due to the need to use powerful equipment and expensive cleaning products. At the same time, it allows you to remove dirt as delicately as possible without harming the shape, color and durability of the product.\n\nDry cleaning is suitable for luxury furniture, expensive carpets and textiles.\n\nCleaning after disinfestation. Features and nuances\nInsects and pests are a very unpleasant thing in itself. And after disinsection, you can still find them in a dead form for a long time throughout the room. The simplest and most correct solution in such a situation is to conduct a comprehensive cleaning or order the services of a professional cleaning company.\n\nWhat should be done:\n\nWipe with a damp cloth all exposed surfaces in the room, on which particles of insecticidal preparations could remain;\nVacuum the carpet and carpets with a powerful washing vacuum cleaner using deep cleaning products;\nWash or dry-clean all textile items, including bedding, curtains, curtains, covers for upholstered furniture, etc.;\nWash dishes, ceramics, indoor plants and other interior items that were not taken out during disinfestation.\nBut there are some nuances like showed on https://bestcleaneradviser.com. Firstly, if cleaning is carried out immediately after the destruction of insects, then not all places can be processed. Since insecticidal preparations have a prolonged effect, that is, they continue to kill parasites for several days after spraying, it is better not to touch the places where insect egg clutches were found for some time.\n\nSecondly, it is better to completely abandon the use of folk remedies. No matter how reliable you consider the folk method of cleaning, it will not help you get rid of the remnants of aggressive chemistry. As a matter of fact, pest controllers treat the room with poison, so it is unlikely that you can remove it qualitatively using, say, a solution of water with baking soda.\n\nCleaning after disinfestation requires care, accuracy and willingness to pay attention to detail. If you doubt that you can do everything right, it is better not to expose yourself to unnecessary risk and order a professional cleaning immediately after the persecution of insects."}, {"Address": "66 North 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Lime Cordiale ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9055034.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.96168, 40.71925], "Date": "Thu Apr 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-16", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Music Hall of Williamsburg", "moreBioInfo": "Hailing from Sydney\u2019s northern beaches, brothers Oli and Louis Leimbach of Lime Cordiale command legions of dedicated fans with their incredible live set.

Sadly, I attempted violin as a young child and was brutally bad. My parents had some how had me listening to classical music at that time which probably explains the violin attempt. Then a miracle happened\u2026First, the Beatles arrived so, bye bye classical & then my aunt who was buying a new piano (the wealthier end of the family) offered me her old one. I\u2019m 8 1/2 so I was still agreeable to anything so I promised to take lessons and really work at it.\nI lied\u2026After a year and a half I quit\u2026..until I discovered Elton John. That was it! I was determined to be a musician. In the late 70\u2019s I joined a fairly succesful 50\u2019s/60\u2019s band called Slick. I played 6 nights a week and worked full time at a department store as a stock man (person in this politically correct universe). Exhaustion wasn\u2019t considered. I went to gigs with a thermos of tea and lemon since I was always sick. This lasted until the early 80\u2019s. I joined a band called Loose Change which (under my direction) played anything from the 1960\u2019s- whatever was current. That lasted 12 years. Many years of putting my ears in harms way and breathing in way to much bar smoke told me it was time to quit. This was somewhere around 1993/94 (I don\u2019t remember). The next time I played live was in 2004 at my local block party. That\u2019s what I needed to get the itch to play again but, I was working in retail at Sam Ash Music and simply had no time to gig. In 2007 I was offered a better job which offered me a 9-5 existence. The economy turned sour and earning extra cash became a priority. And then it happened\u2026.I walked into a local Italian restaurant called Vera\u2019s Trattoria to pick up a pizza and lo and behold (fancy words ehh?) a piano player was pumping out Jazz licks. Can you imagine? Live music! I decided to approach the owner to see if I could score a gig. He decided to try me the following week. I was hired as a permanent fixture on Saturday nights. Thus The Richie G Review was born. \u201cA one man band Piano/vocals using backing tracks and a voice harmonizer to create a full band sound. My current song list represents over seventy artists including Elton John, Billy Joel , James Taylor, The Beatles and hits from the 1960\u2019s thru today. Over 500 tunes and counting\u2013 Booking email onemanbandrichieg@gmail.com .\u201d I played at Vera\u2019s for 14 months and then a new owner took over. He decided that entertainment was unnecessary. I got to work recording a CD of covers and creating business cards. The hard work paid off! I\u2019m a permanent Wednesday night fixture at the Woodcliff lake Hilton as well as sprinkling in various weekend gigs.\nRidgewood Street Fair 2013-2014\n\n392561_413258562028352_398683286819213_1318553_160572558_nRIDGEWOOD\n\nChapter 2- Ginger Martini was Born Right around St Patty\u2019s Day of 2012, I was performing at the Elm Street Grill in Oakland NJ. I was approached by my soon to be partner Wendy Kelly. I was on the floor wiring up my equipment as she, asked me questions about what I do (kind of music, etc). I was excited believing that I was going to be hired for a private party. During the break, she handed me her card.It turned out she was interested in joining me. I wasn\u2019t looking but, I agreed to see what she sounded like at my rehearsal space (haha my basement). Three songs later I was convinced. We sounded great together. A week later, we had 50 plus songs ready for prime time. She joined me at The Paris Inn in Wayne NJ. Ever since we perform around 50% of my gigs together and get an incredible response. Wendy started a seasoned veteran of the Broadway, Standard, and Country Genres. She has since dragged me into her country word as I dragged her into my pop/rock world. An amazing combination was born!", "otherInfo": "Located in the heart of Nanuet, Jacqueline's Wine on Main serves the finest wine and tapas.\n\n\n\nWhether it's a night out with friends, or a setting for an informative business meeting, our venue provides the highest quality atmosphere, food, and drink.\nhttps://www.jwineonmain.com"}, {"Address": "337 Newark Ave, Jersey City, NJ 07302", "Artist": "Kishi Bashi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6714051.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.051506, 40.724972], "Date": "Thu Apr 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-16", "Genre": "Electro Pop, Chamber Pop, Pop", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "White Eagle Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Having collaborated and toured with indie strangelings of Montreal, Regina Spektor, and Sondre Lerche, singer, violinist, and composer, K Ishibashi (aka Kishi Bashi), embarks on a epic orchestral solo project.

That\u2019s the way Texas native Lance Kotara and Colorado belle LeAnna Kaufman live their lives. It was no surprise the two songwriters would find each other in Nashville. Their undeniable creative chemistry exploded, forming the duo, Lance and Lea.\nLance describes their first songwriting session together as nothing short of amazing. \u201cIt was so magical how the songs just fell out of the air. Right away we knew we were onto something special.\u201d\nOn a typical day, you can find the duo in their home studio, writing and laying down a new track. Lea says their determination and commitment to the music is indestructible. \u201cTo get our music out there, we had to learn how to record ourselves.\u201d It\u2019s been tough at times, but they both know it\u2019s beneficial. \u201cThe hard work, the time, it\u2019s all worth it. We\u2019ve honed our craft, and every day we learn something new.\u201d Marked by heart pounding harmonies, prominent guitars, and emotional lyrics and melodies, their collaborative genius is on fire, with over 200 songs already penned. And they were right. It was worth it. In 2016 the duo signed with Nashville\u2019s Number One Group, and their first album with producer Paul Worley is scheduled for release in mid-2017. Their music is making the rounds internationally, garnering airplay in the UK, Ireland, and in Music City, Nashville Tennessee.\nLance knew he wanted to be a musician at a young age. \u201cMusic has been my passion since I started playing the guitar at thirteen,\u201d he said. Growing up in the small town of Beeville, Texas, he saw music as self-expression, and once he started, he couldn\u2019t stop. The desire to play brought Lance to Austin, where he formed a band and played the live scene, sharing the stage with influencers like Snow Patrol, Jars of Clay, and even Vince Neil of Motley Crue. Lance found a love for songwriting and relocated to Nashville to hone those skills and make a name for himself. He was lucky enough to land a major label single with country artist Laura Bell Bundy, and have a song in the 2016 Share a Song/Share a Coke campaign.\nLea says her love for music grew from her days singing alongside her sisters in church. \u201cI was born into an Amish family, and though music wasn\u2019t encouraged, I always dreamed of having my own guitar and singing on stage.\u201d The loss of her father pushed that desire. \u201cDeath has a way of changing your reality and altering your perception on life. It wasn\u2019t until my Dad passed away that I picked up the guitar and started writing my own songs. The first song I ever wrote was about him.\u201d Songwriting opened up a new outlet for creative expression for Lea. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t long before I found myself in Nashville working alongside producer/songwriter Wayne Wilkins, who\u2019s worked with Natasha Bedingfield and Beyonc\u00e9, and since then, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to record with some of Nashville\u2019s finest musicians.\u201d\nThe duo hasn\u2019t forgotten their past but uses the present for inspiration.

O'Connor ranked among the most distinctive and controversial popular music stars of the 1990s, the first and in many ways the most influential of the numerous female performers whose music dominated airwaves throughout the decade. Her first album, The Lion and The Cobra, was released in 1987, and its popular and critical acclaim made her a star of pop music. She produced her second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, a critical success that included her hit single \"Nothing Compares 2 U,\" a song written by Prince. O'Connor was as well-known for her political beliefs as for her music (she once shredded a photo of Pope John Paul II on U.S. television), but in recent years she has been less publicly controversial. In 2003 she announced her retirement from the music business. In 2000 released her album \"Faith and Courage\". Another album, Throw Down Your Arms was released in 2005.

When asked if he'd consider himself a \"blue-collar\" bluesman, Ellis, in his trademark wit, quips, \"No. I'm part of the no-collar crowd.\" His imaginative songs tell stories of common, shared experiences in uncommon ways, all fueled by his high-octane, infectious, hard-rocking guitar playing.

Though inspired by all three Kings (B.B., Albert and Freddie), as well by Carlos Santana, Hound Dog Taylor and others, Ice Cream In Hell is pure, unadulterated Tinsley Ellis. The 11 Ellis originals range from the nod to Stax-era Albert King, Last One To Know, to the Peter Green-flavored Everything And Everyone to the Hound Dog Taylor-esqe romp Sit Tight Mama before ending with the hair-raising, slow-burning ballad, Your Love's Like Heroin.

He began studying the piano at the age of eight, and five years later switched to electric guitar. He soon discovered his passion for improvisation and jazz, and during his high school years he began to travel regularly to Tel Aviv to study with Israel\u2019s leading musicians, and to participate in workshops and master classes. At the age of 16 he started performing professionally with jazz bands around the country and leading several projects with his original music. At 19, Yuval wrote an original composition for his hometown\u2019s string quartet and for the renowned Oud and Violin player Yair Dalal. His music was selected by one of Israel\u2019s leading composers and music educators Michael Wolpe, and was performed in concert halls across Israel. Soon afterwards he started studying at The Jerusalem Academy of Music and the Rimon Jazz School in Tel Aviv and participated in various musical projects. In 2005 Yuval moved to Paris. He quickly made his way into the local jazz scene and started playing in Paris clubs and venues. The following year he studied at the Jazz department of the Paris Region Conservatory, graduating two years later. Since 2008 Yuval leads his quintet, the Yuval Amihai Ensemble, with whom he performs music which is strongly influenced by his childhood in Israel. The ensemble has won numerous awards, including the Grand Prize and the 1st composition prize at the \"La D\u00e9fense\" National Jazz Competition in 2009, The 1st prize in the Saint-Germain Jazz festival Contest in Paris (2008), and the 3rd prize in the international jazz competition of Hoeilaart, Belgium.

Afterwards he released \"Chamber Music\", \"Siderata\", \"Plan\", \"Revision\", \"Expansion\" and in 2008 his acclaimed debut album on Nonesuch Records: \"Pagina de Buenos Aires\" .\nAfter the release of \"Material\" in 2009 by Warner Music, his new album entitled \"Vital\" (World Village) won the Latin Grammy for Best Classical album in 2010.\nIn 2012 he recorded \"Romance\", a chamber music work which offers a collection of original compositions that draw from traditional elements of Argentine music , but are decidedly cosmopolitan. While meticulously constructed, they also at times involve the freedom of improvisation. The new album was released on February 2013 by Soundbrush Records.\nHe has written music for orchestra, chamber ensembles, string quartet, choir, and solo instruments as piano, violin and cello, being many of his compositions commissioned and premiered by performers like the Kronos Quartet\n-like \"The Cherry Tree\". premiered in Carnegie Hall in February 2008- and the Imani Winds ensemble. Among his recent works he wrote a Solo Violin sonata for Nick Danielson, Solo Piano Works for Krisztina Wajsza, a Cello Concerto for Inbal Segev, piano trios for the Ahn Trio, and an album for two pianos performed by himself and Yana Reznik.\nDue to the nature of his compositions and performance, he was embraced by both New York classical and jazz scenes. He has performed with legendary bassist Eddie Gomez (who introduced Otero as one of the pianists of the new generation) , flautist Dave Valentin, the Arturo O\u2019Farrill Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra, and was featured in the Grammy Award-winning album Funk Tango by reed maestro Paquito D\u2019Rivera, with whom he has also performed at Birdland, Blue Note, and the Caramoor Classical Music Festival. Fernando Otero has written and produced soundtracks for movies and recorded in more than 40 albums.\nReviewing Fernando Otero's performance at New York's Symphony Space in February 2012, Steve Smith wrote in The New York Times: \"Mr. Otero's writing vibrantly summoned tango ancestors while also acknowledging Bartok and Prokofiev. His brilliant playing bore traces of jazz pianists like Bill Evans and Don Pullen. The resulting synthesis proposed bold new directions for a venerable tradition.\n\"Mr. Otero, a resourceful pianist and composer from Buenos Aires, recently released a darkly ravishing album with the plain but connotative title of \u201cRomance\u201d (Soundbrush). This concert will feature that material, a sensuous blend of tango and classical and chamber jazz, with a cohort that includes the vocalist Kristin Norderval, the bandon\u00e9on player Juan Pablo Jofre Romarion, the clarinetist Ivan Barenboim and a string quartet headed by the violinist Nick Danielson.\" Nate Chinen, New York Times,March 2013.\nMr. Otero hails from Argentina, where romance has often been cast as a kinetic pursuit. The expressive drama of tango generally animates his compositions, which also involve aspects of classical chamber music and jazz improvisation.\"Beginning with \"El Circulo Rojo,\" which appears on both recent albums, Mr. Danielson and Mr. Otero locked in tightly, playing a compact melody in sync and then spiraling outward to set up some counterpoint. During one passage in the piece, and on a brisk subsequent composition, there was a faint echo of the dynamic that existed between the pianist Chick Corea and the violinist Jean-Luc Ponty some 30 years ago\u2026\" Nate Chinen, New York Times, February 2008\n\"Otero is a seriously talented pianist, and his orchestrations are equal parts Bernard Hermann and Charlie Parker.

I loved Sergio Mendes\u2019 songs, liked John Hartford on the Glenn Campbell Show and really got into James Taylor and Joni Mitchell who I still consider my two main influences. I also loved the singer-songwriters of the time including Carole King and Laura Nyro and later fell in love with Steely Dan\u2019s music, and just wore out my copy of Hubert Laws\u2019 Rite Of Spring. I was completely self-taught, by llistening to records and playing them over and over, teaching myself tablature from a great James Taylor book and modal tunings from Joni Mitchell\u2019s For The Roses song book. I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit. Other long term members include drummer Ray Levier and keyboardist Peter Vitalone, both of whom have been with KJ since\u201998 and \u201899. I am always interested in stretching myself and performing my music in different ways. The Lucky 7 recordings feature some wonderful pairings of great players that I don\u2019t always get to tour with but who have appeared in with me at The 55 and are wonderful friends too.\nKJ manages between 120-140 performances a year. New music, places to play and new festivals are what she\u2019s about these days \u201c\u2026 so we can keep on performing for new audiences.

Nick went on to get his masters at Juilliard\u2019s prestigious Jazz program where he was mentored by the trombone legend Steve Turre.\n\nIn 2011 Nick was the winner of the Eastern Trombone Workshop\u2019s National Jazz Trombone Competition and was a finalist in the 2010 International Trombone Association\u2019s Carl Fontana Jazz Trombone Competition.\n\nIn January of 2013 Nick released his recording debut as a bandleader and composer with \u201cExposition\u201d (Outside In Music). Two tracks appearing on the album garnered Finzer a pair of accolades: The prestigious American Society of Composers and Performers (ASCAP)\u2019s Herb Alpert Award for young composers (2013 & 2015)\n\nIn 2014, Nick composed a new album-length work, \u201cThe Chase.\u201d Nick's sophomore album debuted in July of 2015 on Origin Records to rave reviews, a feature article in Downbeat Magazine, and peaked at #6 on the JazzWeek Charts.\n\nFamed trombonist and mentor Wycliffe Gordon called Finzer \u201ca new voice [in] the pantheon of upcoming trombone greats in the making\u201d and added \u201cNick's CD is a glowing example of things to come.\u201d\n\nWhen away from NYC, Finzer can be found touring the globe not only with his own projects, but as part of YouTube sensation, Scott Bradlee\u2019s Postmodern Jukebox. Finzer has joined the group on television, in viral videos with millions of views, and on tours across North America, Australia, New Zealand and Europe.\n\nFinzer has performed at top Jazz clubs and concert halls with Wynton Marsalis\u2019 Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, Lucas Pino\u2019s No Net Nonet, Ryan Truesdell's Gil Evans Project, Bob Stewart\u2019s Double Quartet, Frank Wess, Terrell Stafford, Lewis Nash, the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, Walt Weiskopf, Slide Hampton, Frank Kimbrough, Carl Allen, Steve Turre and many more.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: http://www.instagram.com/nickfinzer"}, {"Address": "157 Montague St, Brooklyn, NY 11201", "Artist": "The Cactus Blossoms ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8935702.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.993095, 40.694581], "Date": "Fri Apr 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-17", "Genre": "Indie, Americana, Rockabilly, Country Western, Folk, Country", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "St. Ann & the Holy Trinity Church", "moreBioInfo": "Blood Harmony. Whether it\u2019s The Beach Boys, Bee Gees or First Aid Kit, that sibling vocal blend is the secret sauce in some of the most spine-tingling moments in popular music. The Cactus Blossoms \u2013 Minneapolis-based brothers Page Burkum and Jack Torrey \u2013 offer compelling evidence that this tradition is alive and well, with a deceptively unadorned musical approach that offers \u201ccreative turns of phrase, gorgeous harmonies, and an ageless sound\u201d (NPR All Things Considered), not to mention spine tingles aplenty. Their 2016 debut You\u2019re Dreaming, a stunning and transporting collection of original songs, earned high praise from Rolling Stone and Vice Noisey, tour stints with Kacey Musgraves and Lucius, and a perfectly cast performance on the third season of David Lynch\u2019s Twin Peaks. Now their unlikely rise continues with new album Easy Way, to be released on their own label Walkie Talkie Records.\n\nWhile many bands would have been content to stick with the winning formula of their debut, the Blossoms refused to repeat themselves. If You\u2019re Dreaming celebrated their vintage country and rock influences, Easy Way reveals a songwriting style that has changed, evolved, and gotten more modern. Dan Auerbach, another artist who knows from bedrock influences, co-wrote two songs on the album. \u201cDan\u2019s love for songwriting was inspiring, just the kick in the pants we needed to start writing again after being on the road,\u201d says Page.\n\nThe brothers\u2019 decision to produce the new album themselves no doubt led to the new sound. \u201cWe wanted the freedom to experiment with our own weird ideas,\u201d says Jack, \u201cWe used to joke that the working title album should be Expensive Demos.\u201d As they crisscrossed the nation on tour, the brothers would stop through Alex Hall\u2019s Reliable Recorders studio in Chicago to chase the new sound they were after. The result joins together what would otherwise be distant corners of the American songbook. Both the traditional twang of Chicago pedal steel guitarist Joel Paterson (Devil in a Woodpile, The Western Elstons) and the primal wail of free jazz saxophonist Michael Lewis (Bon Iver, Andrew Bird) are at home on the album.

They have shared digital space on comps with Real Estate, The Front Bottoms, Nicole Atkins, La Sera and have shared stages with Rye Coalition, TAB the Band, Elliot Easton (The Cars), Clem Burke (Blondie) to name a few.

A mix of power pop, raging guitars and strong melodies, it gained ground in the press, social media and on radio including WDHA 105.5FM, one of the biggest rock stations in New Jersey. The band toured heavily throughout 2013 into 2014 in support of the album culminating in a 10 city East Coast tour in October 2014. The tour kicked off with Lost Romance being chosen as one of only a handful of bands to play ReverbNation's showcase at the CBGB Festival 2014 in NYC and ended up taking the band as far south as Florida.\n\n2014 also saw the recording of Lost Romance's first full length album. Going back to basics, the new tracks were recorded at LR bassist Dan Haag's (The Astrojet, Benzos, Jody Porter & The Black Swans) basement studio on four track cassette.

JUDAS PRIESTESS has performed at many festivals,motorcycle rallies, charities and special events. The band shared the stage with Twisted Sister at Dee Snider's Bikers for Babies charity rally for the March of Dimes in Long Island, NY and they have opened up for legendary pioneers of doom metal, Pentagram. In Spring 2011, Cape Fear Harley Davidson sponsored JUDAS PRIESTESS performance at North Carolina's Rock Shop Music Hall and they immediately followed that date as the headline attraction opening weekend at Myrtle Beach Bike Week in South Carolina - a triumphant return for the band at SBB 4-Corners. Myrtle Beach Bike Week is one of the four top biker events in the U.S.A. with over 300,000 people from around the world attending. At Harley Bike Week the band was such a hit that they scored the cover of The Sun News KICKS! Section (June 17, 2011) in an article about the world?s best tribute bands that perform in that international tourist mecca, Myrtle Beach. The band also captured the attention of new 'biker' show, \"Ride On America\" and is featured in an episode. In September 2011, JUDAS PRIESTESS headlined the Indian Larry Motorcycles Block Party in Brooklyn, NY, the annual day-long outdoor event that memorializes one of the motorcycle world's most acclaimed, creative and beloved icons, Indian Larry. October 2011 they headlined a special Halloween event in NYC's iconic Penn Station, sharing the spotlight with world famous Madame Tussand's, and Broadway's \"Rock of Ages\", among others, as 100,000 commuters passed through the train station during the rush-hours. JUDAS PRIESTESS headlined HIXONFEST in NYC (2010) with Richard Christie of Iced Earth and the Howard Stern show jamming on drums with the band onstage. The band also headlined Massachusetts's first all-girl band festival Metal Galz Rule! Judas Priestess spectacular front woman, MilitiA, has been called by the French Music Press \"the true cross between Rob Halford and Tina Turner\". MilitiA has been Dee Snider's lead vocalist in his heavy metal orchestra \"Van Helsing's Curse\"; has toured Europe with Jesus Christ Superstar; has performed with Nancy Sinatra, Cyndi Lauper, Living Colour, among other known musical artists. MilitiA's vocal prowess and stunning stage presence combined with the impressive and stellar musicians that comprise Judas Priestess: In 2013, Judas Priestess welcomed a new lead guitarist, Rena Sands. This highly skilled shredder is an authentic and well-respected Metal Queen known and revered from her days with Meanstreak. She is a true musician's musician! Josette, also on lead guitar, a member since late 2010, comes with a renowned reputation as a 'kick ass female guitarist.\" She got her rock training in her first band, the all-girl Hari Kari managed by Eric Carr from KISS. Bassist Gyda Gash (co-founder) has a long-standing solid gold reputation as the first lady of doom from her days in Angel Rot and has many laudable and interesting achievements under her belt. Behind the kit is the heavy metal drum goddess Hillary Blaze from the Boston based all-girl band Jaded. Ms. Blaze is notorious for \"bringing the FIRE\" and the thunder!

Still, Couvares is determined to age gracefully in an increasingly crestfallen era of draconian politics and disenchantment on his upcoming release, When This All Ends (out April 24), mixed by Charlie Stavish (Jenny Lewis, Interpol, Weezer) and mastered by Robin Schmidt (The 1975, The Japanese House, Ben Howard).\n\nWhen This All Ends is a coming of age tale for Couvares, who plans to keep exuberance intact but yearns to jettison reckless abandon and feckless joy, now a 26-year-old working-class citizen; and while he may not be The Only Living Boy in New York, he\u2019s not impervious to loneliness. Swallowing the dregs that remain of youthful naivet\u00e9, the unassuming crooner yields wistful, spirited coos akin to Ezra Koenig and Morning Benders era Chris Chu. Through character-driven exploits of the heart and semi-autobiographical accounts, Couvo\u2019s lyrics take precedence, though his big-hearted choruses on songs like \u201cStill Hanging On\u201d and \u201cGloria Steinem\u201d remain unaffected, and equally poignant.\n\nOn \u201cStill Hanging On,\u201d Couvares manages to wax humor alongside poetry, by capturing an awestruck revelation - the field noise of a would-be laureate outside of Roberta\u2019s Pizza & Bakery on Moore Street, who exclaims, \u201cWait, wait, wait - but also - we can do takeaway,\u201d as if struck by a bolt of lightning. Although Brooklyn is quite the bitter pill at times, Couvares invites all of his high school friends from Manchester, CT inside the studio to wrangle warmth and nostalgia on the chorus of \u201cStill Hanging On\u201d; the first half of the track presents minimal instrumentation, with caj\u00f3n, a charming piano cadence, acoustic and electric guitar balladry and soothing vocals, only to give rise to a bigger and jazzier arrangement, replete with a Clarence-esque sax solo, a full drum kit, and the aforementioned chorus of dear friends.\n\n\u201cTo all my friends that I grew up with, who I don\u2019t see anymore/To all those nights when we had no idea what it was that we were living for/You know those days are over/We\u2019re all just getting older/And I know those years are gone/My dreams, they\u2019ve been a little bent and bruised/But they\u2019re still hangin\u2019 on.\u201d\n\n\u201cGloria Steinem\u201d sedates the listener with sizzling auxiliary percussion, ethereal guitar swells, rapturous saxophone, and another big chorus that presupposes the taxing journey and romantic interest of a rich girl who exhibits a duality in the spirit of Roxanne Gay\u2019s Bad Feminist: on one hand, she\u2019s \u201ccoked out of her mind/Lower East Side all the time,\u201d and on the other, the narrator reveals, \u201cShe had this little letter that she wrote when she was seven/To the person she\u2019d become/How she would be a doctor, and a lawyer and a mother, and the president all at once,\u201d illuminating (quite literally) the ridiculous laundry list of gratuitous expectations society places on women, and the letter is - in turn - upended by a zippo lighter. Meanwhile, the narrator explains, \u201cAll she ever wanted was to be Gloria Steinem/ But the gig was already booked.\u201d It\u2019s the story of a rich girl and a poor boy, talking in circles as they try to relate to one another, and all the while, not being ready for any burdensome chapters that come with being an adult in real-time. Then again, who is?\n\n\u201cGoon Squad,\u201d which Couvares describes as \u201cthe heart of the record,\u201d continues the boy-meets-world-and-falls-in-love-with-a-girl, drunk-on-a-Summer-day-in-Brooklyn narrative, with just a dash of spite at the behest of blame, as the unreliable narrator is called out on truths that, perhaps hit too close to home; Couvares also begs the question, how does anyone truly know what\u2019s best for their significant other, as we try, earnestly, not to burst any bubbles, in the name of love? \u201cAnd if I\u2019m another boy like the rest/You\u2019re a question mark in a Summer dress,\u201d Couvares declares.\n\n\u201cThe older I get, the harder it is to feel anything,\u201d says Couvares, and as we all know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Skylarking aside - and when we strip all the trivial pursuits of escapism away from our lives - it\u2019s hard to proclaim what one should focus on when they pore over both socioeconomic status, and even harder to occasionally enjoy one\u2019s adulthood in the ghost of their youth, without first considering what\u2019s left behind, when this all ends.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "149 7th St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Jenny Owen Youngs ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6178929.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.991761, 40.673627], "Date": "Fri Apr 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-17", "Genre": "Rock, Indie Pop, Indie, Alternative, Songwriter, Singer, Folk, Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "The Bell House", "moreBioInfo": "Jenny Owen Youngs is a feisty, hyper-sensitive, disease-free singer/songwriter/former girl scout who wants to be your friend.

I loved Sergio Mendes\u2019 songs, liked John Hartford on the Glenn Campbell Show and really got into James Taylor and Joni Mitchell who I still consider my two main influences. I also loved the singer-songwriters of the time including Carole King and Laura Nyro and later fell in love with Steely Dan\u2019s music, and just wore out my copy of Hubert Laws\u2019 Rite Of Spring. I was completely self-taught, by llistening to records and playing them over and over, teaching myself tablature from a great James Taylor book and modal tunings from Joni Mitchell\u2019s For The Roses song book. I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit. Other long term members include drummer Ray Levier and keyboardist Peter Vitalone, both of whom have been with KJ since\u201998 and \u201899. I am always interested in stretching myself and performing my music in different ways. The Lucky 7 recordings feature some wonderful pairings of great players that I don\u2019t always get to tour with but who have appeared in with me at The 55 and are wonderful friends too.\nKJ manages between 120-140 performances a year.

Whether through design or destiny, that\u2019s a precept the SteelDrivers know all too well. Throughout their career --one that encompasses four highly acclaimed albums and any number of awards and accolades --the band has demonstrated the ability to adapt to change with unwavering persistence. Their\u2019s is a lingering legacy defined by quality and consistency. It\u2019s one in which they\u2019ve never stopped looking forward, successfully marshalling their resources for wherever that trajectory takes them. Ultimately, it\u2019s all about the music. \u201cOur dedication and determination remain intact,\u201d says singer, songwriter and fiddler Tammy Rogers. \u201cWe honor our older music by always putting our focus on the songs. Some people describe our music as being bluegrass based, but the fact is, we\u2019re not bound to any one regimen. I liken us to what the Rolling Stones would sound like if they played banjos, fiddles and mandolins \u2013 it\u2019s that rock-n-roll edge played on traditional instruments. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true, but we are primarily a band that\u2019s centered around songwriting and also just happens to have a bluegrass background.\u201dThat persistent push could be called the key to SteelDrivers\u2019 success. Each step in their journey has created a new chapter, one that finds them building on the past but consolidating their strengths as they build for the future. That\u2019s also been the case since the beginning, when Rogers, multi-instrumentalist Mike Henderson, bass player Mike Fleming, banjo player Richard Bailey, and singer/guitarist Chris Stapleton first convened after a series of songwriting sessions between Henderson and Stapleton. What began as a casual get-together to jam in the late summer of 2005 became a fully committed band that signed with Rounder Records in 2007. They released their eponymous debut album at the beginning of 2008, garnering a GRAMMY\u00ae nomination for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for one of the songs in that set, \u201cBlue Side of the Mountain.\u201d That honor was followed two years later, when they received two more nominations for Reckless, their sophomore set -- one for Best Bluegrass Album and another for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals courtesy of its song \u201cWhere Rainbows Never Die.\u201dWhen Stapleton left the fold for a highly successful solo career in April 2010, the band closed one chapter and began another anew, while literally never missing a beat. Singer/guitarist Gary Nichols, a highly accredited artist in his own right, was brought on-board for the recording of the band\u2019s third album, 2012\u2018s Hammer Down, which subsequently climbed all the way up to number one on the Billboard Bluegrass charts, their highest placement yet. Nevertheless, the real journey had just begun. When Henderson left the band at the end of 2011, musician and producer Brent Truitt was brought in as his replacement. If there was any proof needed that the momentum had been maintained, The SteelDrivers\u2018 highly acclaimed fourth album, 2015\u2018s The Muscle Shoals Recording (featuring guest contributions from Nichols\u2019onetime bandmate Jason Isbell), garnered the group that long elusive GRAMMY\u00ae win with a notable nod for Best Bluegrass Album. In addition, it garnered three IBMA nominations --Album\nof the Year, Song of the Year (for \u201cLong Way Down\u201d), Songwriter of the Year (for Rogers) and Best Liner Notes (for writer Peter Cooper). Still, one more major development was left to come. Nichols departed in August 2017, leaving yet another void the band was left to fill. Once again, the group rose to the challenge, selecting Kentucky native Kelvin Damrell after Rogers\u2018 daughter spotted him singing on a YouTube video. He fit in just fine, and today again, The SteelDrivers\u2019 saga continues unabated. Part of the lure is undoubtably due to the freedom each musician gets to express themselves without any reservation, even as the group maintains the consistency of its sound. Rogers, a former member of the all-star Dead Reckoning music stable, is widely recognized as one of the most versatile and expressive fiddlers on the scene today. Truitt and Bailey are certified string benders who take their respective instruments to new levels of innovation and expertise. Damrell\u2019s vocals and fretwork add a fresh voice to the mix, while Fleming continues to anchor it all with rock solid rhythm and a firm foundation. It\u2019s a sound The Tennessean once described as \u201cGutsy, gritty bluegrass songs.\u201d The Philadelphia Inquirer put it even more succinctly. \u201cYou can call it power-bluegrass or country soul, but whatever you call it, Nashville\u2019s Steeldrivers have bushels of it.\u201dIn fact, The SteelDrivers\u2019 success lies in their consistent growth and ability to reinvent their regimen. It\u2019s also nurtured the various influences that each member brings to the band. With the emphasis on song structure as to parceling out their parameters, elements of Americana, country, blues, rock and soul all enter the equation. Yet their consistent standing at the IBMA awards --which began when they were voted Best Emerging Artist -- testifies to the fact that they\u2019ve been able to maintain a fierce following even while growing their audiences at every interval. The band plays approximately 75 shows a year, including major festival appearances at Bonnaroo, Merlefest, Wintergrass, Bristol Rhythm and Roots and Telluride Bluegrass Festival. It\u2019s their populist approach that finds their devotees -- self-proclaimed \u201cSteelHeads\u201d-- traveling hundreds of miles to see them in repeat performances. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been ten years since our first album,\u201d Rogers muses. \u201cAnd yet, even with all the change and transition, we still have the same joy and enthusiasm that we did in the beginning. Even as the trajectory changes, the story continues to unfold.\u201d\n\n\nThe SteelDrivers are:\n\nRichard Bailey - Banjo\n\nGrammy nominated banjo player, Richard Bailey has recorded with such diverse artists as Al Green and George Jones.

While Somna is somewhat of a relatively fresh name to the trance scene, his discography and accolades read that of a seasoned veteran, which comes as no surprise considering his career spans over a decade in the scene under different guises and co-writing / production projects behind the scenes. His singles can be found on a few of the biggest trance labels in the world including Armada Music, Future Sound Of Egypt, AVA Recordings, Black Hole Recordings, Perfecto and Go On Air Recordings.\nAs a performing artist, Somna fuses together traditional mixing with current technologies in a way that creates an atmosphere for fans into a journey of what trance is truly about. His experiences with prior aliases over the years has led to performances at Global Gathering, Creamfields, Coloursfest, Eden (Ibiza), The Arches (Scotland), LoveFest (USA), and shows across Canada, UK, USA, Japan, Spain, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nJust a peek into support from the world\u2019s top trance DJs includes regular premieres on universally popular podcasts such as A State Of Trance, Group Therapy, Corsten\u2019s Countdown, Global DJ Broadcast and more. Recognition from A-list DJs includes Armin Van Buuren, Above & Beyond, Ferry Corsten, Markus Schulz, Paul Van Dyk, Gareth Emery, Andy Moor, TyDi, Lange, Cosmic Gate, Paul Oakenfold, Guiseppe Ottaviani, Heatbeat, Mark Sixma and many more. The abundance of support stands as a true testament to the quality of Somna\u2019s music.\n\nAs a prolific multi-genre producer and engineer, his track alongside Andy Moor \u201cOne Thing About You\u201d featuring Amy Kirkpatrick, reached #1 on Beatport and stayed in the top 10 for three weeks. Adding to Somna\u2019s Beatport success, \u201cOne Thing About You\u201d won the 2015 award for the most streamed trance track on Beatport.\n2015 and 2016 also saw multiple Somna releases reach the top 10 on Beatport, with tracks featuring the likes of Jennifer Rene & Michele C. To mark Lange Recordings\u2019 200th release, Somna was invited to team up with Johnny Yono and Monoverse. The result was \u201cHijackers\u201d, a triple threat labor of love which reached #3 on the Beatport charts. During these years, Somna also made two label debuts (Armada Captivating and Future Sound Of Egypt Excelsior) and joined the trance elite as he had the honor of mixing a 3 disc compilation alongside Andy Moor for AVA Recordings' 10 year anniversary. Coupled by a truly rare triple play on A State Of Trance (episode #791), 2016 was fantastic year for Somna.\n\nHis success carried over into 2017 as Somna showed no signs of slowing down. As one of the few trance artists hitting 100k+ monthly listeners on Spotify, Somna has an average monthly listener base of 140,000+ and the yearly collected data showed a staggering 13.4 million plus minutes streamed for his music on the #1 streaming platform.\n\nWith 2018 only just begun, it's already becoming a powerhouse year for Somna with a new single on Armada's Captivating label as well as hitting the landmark 1 million streams for his single \"Look Back\" on Spotify!\n\nAs the label manager, A&R and co-owner of AVA Recordings, Somna continues to make strides while playing an important role within the scene. His monthly radio show entitled \u201cReanimate Music\u201d broadcasts every second Monday on Afterhours.fm, the #1 trance radio station in the world. The coming year looks nothing short of bright for Somna with forthcoming releases scheduled on Armada Captivating, AVA Recordings and he is delighted to share a plethora of new music with fans in 2018.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}]
