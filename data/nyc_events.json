The right vocalist can make you fall in love at first listen, elicit tears, or bring you back to a different era altogether. A microphone and a stage remain the only necessities. That holds true for New York-based singer and songwriter Morgan James. On her full-length debut for Epic Records, Hunter, she casts an unbreakable spell with a powerhouse voice equally inspired by smoky soul, swaggering R&B, theatrical swing, and a virtuosic classical poise.\n\nThe Idaho native discovered her passion for music early on and pursued it\nwholeheartedly at the prestigious Juilliard School. While in the midst of the institution's rigorous academic program, she soon realized that her path would diverge from the classical world. \"I didn't want a career in opera, but Juilliard still shaped me,\" she confesses. \"The traditional training really made me a disciplined singer. I carry that with me to this day.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Morgan spent the next few years facing the proverbial struggles of being a young artist in New York. Low on money, she bounced back and forth between bartending and restaurant gigs while fighting to survive. Immersed in classic sixties and seventies soul records, she concurrently experienced a pivotal revelation. \"Out of that frustration came this other voice,\" she says. \"It was my true voice, and I feel like I discovered it in the middle of so much hardship just trying to be heard. I embraced who I was at that very moment.\"\n\nSoon, she would be heard in a big way. In 2008, Morgan booked her first Broadway show\u2014appearing in The Addams Family alongside Nathan Lane, as well as in prominent and leading roles in Wonderland, Godspell (Turn Back, O Man), and Berry Gordy's Motown The Musical as Teena Marie. The latter set the stage for her to\nproperly launch her solo career. Gordy recognized the vocalist's immense talent, and introduced her to Doug Morris and L.A. Reid, opening the door for a deal with Epic Records in 2012.\n\nAround the same time, Morgan booked a landmark show at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, where she paid tribute to Nina Simone with a set of songs that were closely associated with the legendary artist. The incendiary show was recorded and released as the critically acclaimed Morgan James Live on Epic Records. It also proved to be the perfect segue for her first studio album, released in June of 2014.\n\n\"I always knew to make a neo-soul pop record,\" Morgan says. \"The foundation is all real ingredients, and those roots of soul and R&B are pretty strong. It's the culmination of my musical life up to this point. The painful songs are straight out of a bad relationship with someone from my past. The joyful moments are wonderful memories. It's all coming from me. I've lived every one of these stories, and I love the genres I'm representing. It's one point-of-view\u2014mine.\"\n\nThe title track and album opener \"Hunter\" boasts a seductive hook with cinematic noir flair. Flaunting the singer's immense delivery and dynamic presence, it's an undeniable and classy come-on that proves as animalistic as it does magnetic. \"From a woman's perspective, it's such an empowering and sexy song,\" she smiles. \"It totally makes me feel like a warrior! Music is so sensual and life-affirming. That's what I look for. You don't often see a girl take this position, and that's what I love about it!\"\n\nMorgan assumed co-writing duties on eight of the collection's fourteen tracks and even performed all of her own background vocals and harmonies. From the empowering farewell of \"Fed Up On You\" to the mournful rumination of \"You Never Lied\", she continually bares it all\u2014both emotionally and musically. \"I sing like I'm never going to sing ever again,\" Morgan affirms. \"I wanted to capture that power and passion every time. At some moments, it might sound flawless; at others, it might sound like it's going to break. I'm revealing something about myself with\nevery song. You've got to do that. My favorite artists, whether Joni Mitchell or Michael Jackson, are and were, always honest.\"\n\nThere's a unique structure to the album. The first five songs boast electronic elements, while the last six don't have any. \"There's a gradient of the record that goes down,\" she says. \"By the time you get to the last song, it's just piano and voice. It starts with a song about power and ego, and it ends on one about surrender and selflessness. I have all of that in me. Maybe we all do.\"\n\nUltimately, her honesty permeates everything that Morgan James does, and it's why you'll always remember her voice. \"I want people to walk away from this album feeling fulfilled. That's the way it used to be. Often, I think I'm from another time,\u201d she says, her voice trailing off. \u201cI just want to bring back the power of the singular legacy voice.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "123 W 43rd St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "The Magnetic Fields ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7487637.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.984563, 40.756023], "Date": "Sat Apr 4 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-04", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "9:45 PM UTC", "Venue": "The Town Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Band.

Either way, allow us to present the real story from the horse\u2019s (man\u2019s) mouth\u2026\n\nDISCLAIMER 2: (No animals were harmed in the making of this bio.)\n\nThroughout over three decades in music, Steve Poltz did it all and more\u2014often shared by way of his rockin\u2019 countrified folk slices of sardonic Americana (hatched in Halifax). Of course, he co-wrote Jewel\u2019s multiplatinum Hot 100-topping megahit \u201cYou Were Meant For Me,\u201d but he also went on a whale watch with her and a few federales that turned into a drug bust. The two still share the story at every festival they play together. He made his bones as the frontman for underground legends The Rugburns, who burned rubber crisscrossing the continent on marathon tours and still pop up once in a while for the rare and quickly sold out reunion gig.\n\nIn 20 years since his full-length solo debut, One Left Shoe, he blessed the world\u2019s ears with twelve solo records, spanning the acclaimed 2010 Dreamhouse and most recently Folk Singer in 2015. NPR summed it up best, \u201cCritics and fans alike now regard Poltz as a talented and prolific songwriter.\u201d By 2016, he survived a stroke, endured anything the music industry could throw at him, and still performed like \u201c280 days a year.\u201d\n\nHowever, he still never lived in Nashville, which represents a turning point in the story and the genesis of his 2018 Red House Records debut, Shine On\u2026\n\n\u201cMy girlfriend Sharon sold the condo we were living in, and I was ready to live in a van, which seemed like a good idea for one night\u2014then I decided I wanted a kitchen and a closet,\u201d he admits. \u201cSharon wanted to move to Nashville, because she thought it would be good for me. It caused a huge fight. I\u2019d been in San Diego since 1980, and that\u2019s where I cut my musical teeth. I thought I\u2019d never leave. In fact, at the height of our fight, I said, \u2018I\u2019m not leaving San Diego. I am San Diego!\u2019 This makes me laugh now. As soon as I got to Nashville, I immediately knew I wanted to make a record in \u2018Music City\u2019.\u201d\nSo, the man who once protested \u201cI am San Diego\u201d made Shine On in his new home of Nashville with one of its elder statesman behind the board, Will Kimbrough [Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell]. Holing up in the studio at Kimbrough\u2019s house, nothing would be off limits. Together, they unlocked the kind of creative chemistry you only hear about in band bios\u2014but for real.\n\n\u201cI respect Will so much, and I\u2019d always wanted to work with him,\u201d says Steve. \u201cLike two mad scientists, we just took our time and had fun. We didn\u2019t overthink things. Everything felt organic. We ate soul food and drank lots of really good coffee. We tried out weird sounds, and the songs always started with voice and guitar\u2014no click track, just how I\u2019d play them. I road tested many of them, and they were ripe for the picking when recording time came around.\u201d\n\nEvoking themes of \u201chope, love, contemplation, celebration of Wednesday, pharmacists, and the fact that windows are not inanimate objects and they sometimes have conversations with each other,\u201d the record represents Steve at his most inspired and insightful. The opener and title track \u201cShine On\u201d pairs a delicate vocal with lithely plucked acoustic strings as he urges, \u201cShine on, shine on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe song was a gift,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI woke up really early in Encinitas, California at Sharon\u2019s sister\u2019s house. The sun was just coming up. I was all alone in perfect solitude. My guitar was there. The sky was gorgeous. I wrote it as a poem. Everyone always told me, \u2018Never start a record with a really slow song.\u2019 So, seeing that I have O.D.D. (Oppositional Defiance Disorder), I started my record with one. I love the mood it sets. It\u2019s almost like my mission statement, trying to find some semblance of positivity and light in a sometimes ruthless world.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cPharmacist,\u201d rustling guitar and harmonica propel a tale of \u201cthis dude having a crush on his pharmacist.\u201d It also serves as an extension of his friendship with neighbor Scot Sax\u2014with whom he shares the podcast \u201cOne Hit Neighbors\u201d (since they\u2019ve both had one hit song). Meanwhile, he joined forces with Molly Tuttle on \u201c4th of July,\u201d which, of course, came to life on the 3rd of July. \u201cBallin On Wednesday\u201d drew its title and chorus from a diner checkout girl (with a super cool gold tooth) who Steve paid with a $100 bill and she replied, \u201cOooh, ballin\u2019 on a Wednsday.\u201d The finale \u201cAll Things Shine\u201d skips along on sparse instrumentation as Steve sends a message.\n\n\u201c\u2018All Things Shine\u2019 came about after one of the many mass shootings on this planet,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI was feeling overwhelmed. So, I wanted to put my feelings into words and melody. I was thinking that even if we\u2019re feeling hopeless that there is still beauty. All things shine in their own way.\u201d\nWho could contend that?\n\nIn the end, for everything you can call him \u201csearcher, smartass, movie freak, lover of technology, news junkie, baseball fan to nth degree, lapsed catholic who still believes in god even though all his friends are atheists and think he\u2019s an idiot, and maker of fun,\u201d you might just call Steve that little light in the dark we all need in this day and age.\n\nOr Nashville\u2019s Canadian Jiminy Cricket\u2026\n\n\u201cI hope Shine On makes listeners smile and feel welcome, and they want to share it with their friends,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cMusic means energy to me. All things. It connects us, makes us move, helps us relax, and inspires us to change things up.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "18 Bleecker St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Abigail Washburn ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8282477.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.993239, 40.725416], "Date": "Sat Apr 4 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-04", "Genre": "Pop, Indie, World & Chamber Music., Blues, Folk", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "The Sheen Center for Thought & Culture", "moreBioInfo": "\"A daring, definite talent, whose feel for the folk idiom results in moving material. Soulful is the word\"-- Wall Street Journal\n\n\"Washburn stomped and skipped through fiery Appalachian takes on the local songs of Sichuan. Her bilingualism's no gimmick; she nails the dips and peaks of pitch while leading her band in scorching variations on simple, repetitive traditional melodies\u2026\u201d \u2013 L.A. Times\n\n\u201c{Abigail Washburn is} an artist who best embodies the notion of Americana as a worldwide musical language\" \u2013 The Tennessean\n\nBeijing. A smoke-filled club bustling with people, clanging of bottles, chatter. There is a woman on stage with her banjo. She begins to sing old-time Appalachian music in Chinese. The effect produced is entirely original, a cultural mash-up between two distant yet not so different worlds. The crowd quiets down to listen.\n\nAbigail Washburn never set out to be a songwriter, recording artist or a producer. Her performance at that smoke-filled Beijing club would prove to be an important step toward international acclaim and attention from discerning critics. Abigail has created a new sound \u2013 a sound that challenges traditional notions of culture and countries.\n\nAbigail planned to move to China after a road trip up the east coast, but instead she stumbled upon a professional music career. This east coast trip included a stop at the International Bluegrass Music Association conference in Louisville, KY where she intended to learn a few banjo tunes but walked away with a demo session for a record deal in Nashville, TN. She canceled her one-way ticket to China and moved to Nashville. Shortly thereafter in 2004 she joined Uncle Earl. The \"all G'earl\" group released two records on the Rounder label, She Waits for Night (2005) and Waterloo, TN, (2007) the latter of which was produced by John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin.\n\nIn the midst of touring with Uncle Earl, Washburn released her first solo debut, and bilingual album, Song of the Traveling Daughter, (Nettwerk). At that point, Abigail joined cellist, Ben Sollee, in performing her music around the globe. In 2005 Abigail, Ben and a few talented friends (B\u00e9la Fleck on banjo and Casey Driessen on fiddle) formed the Sparrow Quartet and toured China. In 2006, the US State Department and the American Center for Educational Exchange requested that the group come back to lead the first official tour of a US band in Tibet.\n\nIn May 2008, the Sparrow Quartet released Abigail Washburn & the Sparrow Quartet (Nettwerk) which was praised by critics and appeared on several \u201cbest of\u201d lists from prominent publications. Produced by B\u00e9la Fleck and composed/arranged by the unconventional foursome, Abigail Washburn & The Sparrow Quartet became an \"intimate exploration of crossing global and cultural lines,\" says Abigail, who feels a reverence for both American and Chinese cultures. The unprecedented combination of two banjos (clawhammer and three-finger-style), cello and five-string fiddle unfolds -live and on record- in a dreamlike chamber suite. From the flawless \u2018Overture\" and harrowing revival, \"Strange Things,\" to the interplanetary, Puccini-inspired old-time fairy tale, \"Great Big Wall in China,\" this record highlights the brilliant musicianship of each individual, but is at the same time much larger than the sum of its parts.\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, Abigail Washburn and the Sparrow Quartet toured extensively throughout the US and Canada with appearances at festivals including New Orleans Jazz & Heritage, Merlefest, Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, Vancouver Folk Festival and many more. They were invited by the US State Department to play in China including several performances in Beijing during the 2008 Olympic games. In addition, the were filmed on National Geographic Live in Washington, DC and were invited to be a part of the Clearwater Concert, a benefit concert in celebration of Pete Seeger's 90th birthday along with a line-up of some of the most prominent, established musicians in the world. For Abigail and the Sparrow Quartet, 2008 was a year full of accomplishments and successes.\nBut Abigail does not stop. She is a force of nature that continually attracts others to become a part of her art. Enter The Shanghai Restoration Project (SRP) producer Dave Liang. Abigail and Dave first collaborated to produce two electronic remixes of Sparrow Quartet songs released in April 2009.\nIn December 2008, Abigail served as a resident teacher at the Sichuan University Art School teaching traditional US music. In the hours after school was finished, she volunteered for Sichuan Quake Relief performing at earthquake relocation schools. The experience with the students and teachers after the performances left her wanting to do something to help.\nIn early March, 2009, Abigail had the idea to create Afterquake, a benefit EP in memory of the May 12, 2008 Sichuan Earthquake which left more than 5 million people homeless and hundreds of thousands dead. Abigail and The Shanghai Restoration Project united again to go to Sichuan Province, to the relocation schools and into the disaster zone to capture the voices of those affected by the earthquake and sample sounds from the schools and the disaster zone. They sampled, recorded and produced Afterquake in two and a half weeks in Sichuan province. The final result is a beautiful, timeless, intelligent and accessible musical document that blends folk and electronic sounds with post-earthquake samples. A portion of all proceeds will go to the Sichuan Quake Relief organization.\nWhether playing her banjo, or producing an electronic album, there is an undeniable element of Abigail Washburn in every project she embraces. Abigail's spirit and philosophy translate from language to language and bind countries, cultures and genres.\n\"As more and more people engage in this struggle for a new direction for the human spirit, we'll recognize that we're morphing into a global species.\"\n---Abigail Washburn", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1 Media Crossways, Woodbury, NY 11797", "Artist": "Rob Appelblatt (Splatt) ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9147449.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.489258, 40.805829], "Date": "Sat Apr 4 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-04", "Genre": "Folk, Country, Americana, Blues, Classic Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "News 12", "moreBioInfo": "Rob aka \u201cSplatt\u201d by his friends is a New Yorker living on Long Island.

While other children dreamt of being astronauts or building rocket ships out of mega blocks, Dan was ready to jam on stage with the greatest of the great.\n\nWhen he got a bit older, he accompanied his brother Michael to Sam Ash music store, where he needed to pick up a saxophone for middle school band. They may have been at the store for his brother, but that day will forever be the one where Dan\u2019s daycare dreams began to grow into a reality.\n\nThere, standing in the guitar department, Dan was encouraged to pick up and strum along to the beat inside his soul, and his passion began to take shape.\n\nAs years passed, Dan became more and more accustomed to the guitar, and fell more and more in love with performing. He surrounded himself with mentors from diverse backgrounds \u2013 Dennis DelGaudio (Billy Joel), Chris Justino (Broadway), Artie Blaurock (Sweet Revenge, Dorian Grey, Needulhed), & Rick Stone (Jazz Guitar at Hofstra University). Each of these amazing talents provided him with a unique perspective on guitar stylings and teachings.\n\nTaking that knowledge to the next level, Dan joined the likes of Indie/Alternative Rock band Face the King (CI Records) and performed across the continental US for a multitude of shows, including a full leg of Vans Warped Tour, Rockstar UPROAR Festival, the main stage at the CBGB Festival in Times Square, NY (with Billy Idol and Jane\u2019s Addiction!), as well as the world\u2019s largest music festival - Summerfest, in Milwaukee, WI.\n\nFace the King was chosen as a National Finalist for the Ernie Ball Vans Warped Tour competition alongside PVRIS, and are three-time winners of the Ernie Ball Battle of the Bands. Their full-length album, \u201cOnce More Is All I Am,\u201d was released in November of 2017.\n\nDan is also collaborating on songwriting and performing with two up-and-coming Alt/Indie groups, Don\u2019t Believe in Ghosts (Forward Thinking Records), and A Second Life. These bands have received high acclaim, as shown by their multiple plays on retail radio playlists and on Spotify, national plays on Sirius XM Radio, and a number of live shows including Bowery Ballroom, The Paramount, NYC Marathon, and an upcoming appearance at the world-famous South By Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, TX.\n\nIn 2017, Don\u2019t Believe In Ghosts released their debut full-length album, \u201cGive it Meaning\u201d, and A Second Life released their first four singles, \u201cCivil War\u201d, \u201cJust Whisper\u201d, \u201cBeautiful Distraction\u201d, and \u201cYou\u2019re Missing From Me\u201d.\n\nTo take a listen to the alt-vibes of Face the King, Don\u2019t Believe in Ghosts, and A Second Life, check them out on Spotify:\n\nFace the King: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Rg22QdAlQc1KrhWuNwGWq\n\nDon\u2019t Believe in Ghosts: https://open.spotify.com/artist/5uLKc9jyRkcyoTNF1JLWe1\n\nA Second Life: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1FJj42V3fVy1sdxs0OgTQ5\n\nAs a session musician, Dan has performed with countless artists from different Genres \u2013 Robbie Rosen (American Idol), MarissaAnn (The Voice), Alessandra Guercio (The Voice), The Frankel Sisters (X Factor), Julia Lambert, Nicoletta Slapo, Sammi Rae Murciano, The 00\u2019s Band, and with Hank Lane Music Productions for weddings in the tri-state area.

To steal a line from Dan\u2019s favorite movie, Forrest Gump \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know if we each have a destiny, or if we\u2019re just floating around accidental \u2013 like on a breeze. But I think maybe it\u2019s both.\u201d\n\nIn Dan\u2019s case, it is most definitely a touch of both. A destiny come true, thanks to years of training and mentorships, as well as a dream that started at the age of 5 and blossomed into today\u2019s amazing career.\nBut the dream doesn\u2019t stop here. Dan DelVecchio is always looking for new opportunities to expand his horizons in music, to follow the breeze and see where it takes him. Are you interested in learning from or playing with Dan?

Whether performing with his own quartet or supporting Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett on tour, Newman\u2019s expert trumpeteering and effervescent stage presence reignited a big band scene in New York City, and has since enticed a new generation of jazz fans across the globe. The Verve Recording artist continues to reign at his weekly residency in New York, as well as appear on television programs and in special performances across the United States and Europe.\nNewman is known for his impeccable horn playing and rendition of romantic favorites. But what sets him apart is his ability to command a room not only with his musical talent, but as a bandleader who makes each person in the audience feel as if they are a part of his performance. His fusion of music playing and easy going banter captures the vivacity of great bandleaders of the past. This exuberance is evident on Newman\u2019s 2016 debut album, Eyes on the City, which pays tribute to his musical journey in New York.\nAlong with his Quartet, fellow musicians from Cincinnati\u2019s College-Conservatory of Music, Newman has allured audiences during his residencies at some of New York\u2019s most iconic venues. His first foray into creating an old school big band night was at the elegant Duane Park for \u201cAfter Dark,\u201d a jazz and burlesque revue on the downtown scene in Tribeca. \u201cAfter Dark\u201d lead to a weekly residency at the legendary Oak Room at The Plaza Hotel, a venue steeped in history which was frequented by the likes of Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli and countless others over its one hundred year history. Newman and his Quartet played each Wednesday to a mixed crowd seeking a slice of history, welcoming Lady Gaga as a surprise guest, until the venue closed in 2011. Currently, Newman performs every Tuesday and Thursday, as bandleader in a residency at Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel, and select Friday nights at NYC\u2019s legendary Rainbow Room with his orchestra. Brian also routinely appears for special live performances with a diverse array of musical acts, which have included Tony Bennett, Jose Feliciano, Stevie Wonder, Mark Murphy, Dierks Bentley, Willie Nile, Molly Ringwald, David Loeb, Steve Wynn\u2019s Orchestra, Ray Benson\u2019s Asleep at the Wheel and Tommy London.\nNewman\u2019s personal style, which meshes classic suits, vintage tattoos and rock-n-roll, has attracted commercial brands such as Jack Daniel\u2019s, Marc Jacobs and Tiffany & Co., who have collaborated with Newman for special events and performances. The Jack Daniel\u2019s partnership in 2012, which launched the brand\u2019s Sinatra Select premium Tennessee Whiskey, brought Newman alongside Frank Sinatra Jr. himself, in a performance in Cannes, France.\nBrian married burlesque star, Angie Pontani of the World Famous Pontani Sisters in February 2013, with whom he most notably performs in connection with Pontani\u2019s New York Burlesque Festival and Burlesque-a-Pades shows. The couple have a daughter, and reside in the neighborhood of Brooklyn.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "127 E 23rd St, New York, NY 11226", "Artist": "Hot Chelle Rae ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9945290.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98492, 40.7399], "Date": "Mon Apr 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-06", "Genre": "Rock, Pop", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Gramercy Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "DON'T SAY GOODNIGHT: http://smarturl.it/DontSayGoodnight", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1650 Broadway, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "Marcia Ball ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9873048.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983533, 40.761865], "Date": "Mon Apr 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-06", "Genre": "Americana, Boogie-woogie, Blues, Swamp Blues", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "The Iridium", "moreBioInfo": "\"Fifty years have passed in a flash,\" says Texas-born, Louisiana-raised pianist, songwriter and vocalist Marcia Ball of her long and storied career. Ball, the 2018 Texas State Musician Of The Year, has won worldwide fame and countless fans for her ability to ignite a full-scale roadhouse rhythm and blues party every time she takes the stage. Her rollicking Texas boogies, swampy New Orleans ballads and groove-laden Gulf Coast blues have made her a one-of-a-kind favorite with music lovers all over the world. With each new release, her reputation as a profoundly soulful singer, a boundlessly talented pianist and a courageous, inventive songwriter continues to grow. Her love of the road has led to years of soul-satisfying performances at festivals, concert halls and clubs. The New York Times says, \"Marcia Ball plays two-fisted New Orleans barrelhouse piano and sings in a husky, knowing voice about all the trouble men and women can get into on the way to a good time.\" The Houston Chronicle says simply, \"She's as perfect as an artist can be.\"\n\nWith her new album, Shine Bright, Ball set out to, in her words, \"Make the best Marcia Ball record I could make.\" In doing so, she has put together the most musically substantial, hopeful and uplifting set of songs of her five-decade career. Produced by Steve Berlin (Los Lobos) and recorded in Texas and Louisiana, Shine Bright contains twelve songs (including nine originals), ranging from the title track's rousing appeal for public and private acts of courage to the upbeat call to action of \"Pots And Pans,\" a song inspired by renowned Texas political writer and humorist Molly Ivins. From the humorous advice of \"Life Of The Party\" to the poignantly optimistic \"World Full Of Love,\" the intensity of Ball's conviction never wavers while, simultaneously, the fun never stops. Shine Bright is exactly the album Ball set out to make. \"It is a ridiculously hopeful, cheerful record,\" she says, in light of some of the album's more serious subject matter. The secret, according to Ball \"is to set the political songs to a good dance beat.\"\n\nBorn in Orange, Texas in 1949 to a family whose female members all played piano, Ball grew up in the small town of Vinton, Louisiana, right across the border from Texas. She began taking piano lessons at age five, playing old Tin Pan Alley and popular music tunes from her grandmother's collection. But it wasn't until she was 13 that Marcia discovered the power of soul music. One day in New Orleans in 1962, she sat amazed as Irma Thomas delivered the most spirited and moving performance the young teenager had ever seen. A few years later she attended Louisiana State University, where she played some of her very first gigs with a blues-based rock band called Gum.\n\nIn 1970, Ball set out for San Francisco. Her car broke down in Austin, and while waiting for repairs she fell in love with the city and decided to stay. It wasn't long before she was performing in local clubs with a progressive country band called Freda And The Firedogs, while beginning to sharpen her songwriting skills. It was around this time that she delved deeply into the music of the great New Orleans piano players, especially Professor Longhair. \"Once I found out about Professor Longhair,\" recalls Ball, \"I knew I had found my direction.\"\n\nWhen Freda And The Firedogs broke up in 1974, Ball launched her solo career, playing clubs around Austin, Houston and Louisiana. She signed with Capitol Records in 1978, debuting with the country-rock album Circuit Queen. Creating and honing her own sound, she released six critically acclaimed titles on the Rounder label during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1990, Ball\u2014collaborating with Angela Strehli and Lou Ann Barton\u2014recorded the hugely successful Dreams Come True on the Antone's label. At the end of 1997, Marcia finished work on a similar \"three divas of the blues\" project for Rounder, this time in the distinguished company of Tracy Nelson and her longtime inspiration, Irma Thomas. The CD, Sing It!, was released in 1998 and was nominated for a Grammy Award.\n\nMarcia Ball has appeared many times on national television over the years, including the PBS special In Performance At The White House along with B.B. King and Della Reese, Austin City Limits and HBO's Treme. She performed in Piano Blues, the film directed by Clint Eastwood included in Martin Scorsese's The Blues series which aired on PBS television nationwide in 2003. Marcia also appeared on The Late Show With David Letterman with The New Orleans Social Club, where she not only reached millions of people, but also helped to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina. In 2012, she had a role in the independent film Angels Sing starring Harry Connick, Jr., Lyle Lovett and Willie Nelson. In 2017 she performed on NPR's A Jazz Piano Christmas, live from The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nBall joined Alligator in 2001 with the release of the critically acclaimed Presumed Innocent. The CD won the 2002 Blues Music Award for Blues Album Of The Year. Her follow-up, So Many Rivers, was nominated for a Grammy Award, and won the 2004 Blues Music Award for Contemporary Blues Album Of The Year as well as the coveted Contemporary Blues Female Artist Of The Year award. Her next release, Live! Down The Road, released in 2005, also garnered a Grammy nomination, as did 2008's Peace, Love & BBQ (the album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Blues Chart). 2010's Grammy-nominated Roadside Attractions and 2014's The Tattooed Lady And The Alligator Man successfully grew her fan base even further. Altogether she holds ten Blues Music Awards, ten Living Blues Awards, and five Grammy Award nominations. She has been inducted into both the Gulf Coast Music Hall Of Fame and the Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame. The Texas State legislature named her the official 2018 Texas State Musician. As her hometown Austin Chronicle says, \"What's not to like about Marcia Ball?\"\n\nSince joining Alligator, Ball has blossomed as a songwriter. Each album has been filled with fresh, original songs, never more so than on Shine Bright. Ball easily draws her listeners deep into her music with instantly memorable melodies and imaginative imagery. Her songs paint vibrant musical pictures richly detailed with recognizable characters, regional flavors, universal themes and colorful scenes, both real and imagined. Living Blues declares, \"Her originals sound like timeless classics and southern soul masterpieces that no one else can imitate.\"\n\nNow, with Shine Bright, Ball's new, aggressively hopeful songs are energized by Steve Berlin's inventive and exciting production, creating electrifying music that is daring, inspired, poignant and timely. The Boston Globe calls Ball \"a compelling storyteller\" who plays \"an irresistible, celebratory blend of rollicking, two-fisted New Orleans piano, Louisiana swamp rock and smoldering Texas blues.\"\n\nOf course, Ball will bring the party on the road, playing her new songs and old favorites for fans around the globe. \"I still love the feel of the wheels rolling,\" she says, \"and the energy in a room full of people ready to go wherever it is we take them.\" With both her new album and her legendary live performances, Marcia Ball will shine a light into the darkness, making the world a brighter place one song at a time.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Svetlana ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9301408.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Mon Apr 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-06", "Genre": "Swing, Jazz, Sophisti-pop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Back Room - New York - CANCELLED", "moreBioInfo": "\"Breakfast at Tiffany's Meets Some Like It Hot\" (Lucid Culture)\n\"Outstanding vocalist\" (Wall Street Journal)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1650 Broadway, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "Marcia Ball ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9873050.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983533, 40.761865], "Date": "Mon Apr 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-06", "Genre": "Americana, Boogie-woogie, Blues, Swamp Blues", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "The Iridium", "moreBioInfo": "\"Fifty years have passed in a flash,\" says Texas-born, Louisiana-raised pianist, songwriter and vocalist Marcia Ball of her long and storied career.
