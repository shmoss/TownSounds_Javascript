In '87 Jask began djing at the age of 13. Influences consisted of soul, jazz, funk, r&b, hip hop, rock, new wave, disco, early electro & freestyle. A year later he would soon discover and quickly embrace a passion for the music that was coming out of Chicago & New York, known as the underground house sound. Jask was one of the major players to introduce the acid jazz sound to Tampa & most of central Florida in the early 90's. He held Tampa's longest running eclectic loungin' night called, \"Martini Jazz\". It took place every Thursday night at a club called the Castle which ran from '94 to '96. The \"Martini Jazz\" night brought some notoriety to Jask, which eventually led him to assist in the promotions of \"Groove Collective's (NYC) first ever performance in the Tampa area. In December of 1995, Jask started Tampa's first weekly soulful underground house night called, \"Jacks House\".

In her childhood and adolescence she studied painting, flute, theater, music, acting, piano, guitar, saxophone and singing.

Unfortunately, the group was unsuccessful and they split up the next year.\n\nSoon after, she began preparing to be a solo artist. When Natalia was 17, Loris Ceroni gave her the opportunity to be in a pop/rock group under his guidance, but when she wasn't sure, he encouraged her to go solo.\n\nAlthough LaFourcade didn't join the group, Loris Ceroni produced her first LP under the label of Sony Music. It was recorded in Italy and was cowritten with Aureo Baqueiro. Sabo Romo played in 2 songs. Natalia Lafourcade's music is a mix of pop, rock, bossa-nova and latin rhythms. It features the songs Busca un Problema, Elefantes, Mirame, Mirate and her biggest hit: En el 2000.\n\nIn 2003, she was nominated for a Latin Grammy in the Best New Artist category (she lost to David Bisbal) for her debut album.

The band's last release was 2011's \"100 Years Of Robert Johnson.\" Joined by special guests including B.B. King, Charlie Musselwhite, Hubert Sumlin, David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards and more, BHTM paid tribute to the blues legend both in the studio and on the road. The band recently recorded a new studio album in Chicago, set for release in 2014, with producer Steve Jordan (Bob Dylan, Cat Stevens) and engineer Niko Bolas (Neil Young, Warren Zevon). On 2012's \"Last Summer on Earth Tour,\" BHTM played some of the nation's biggest arenas alongside Barenaked Ladies and Blues Traveler. In August 2012, the band presented its inaugural Ride Festival in Telluride, CO. The lineup included Ben Harper, Lucinda Williams and The Lumineers, among others. At the 2nd Annual Ride Festival in July the lineup featured David Byrne and St. Vincent, Rodrigo y Gabriela, Cake and more. BHTM are giving their fans exactly what they want in 2013: cross-country stops at intimate theaters, and two full sets every night. This summer BHTM is headlining the inaugural LP Tour which recently included a show at the baseball stadium Target Field, home of the Minnesota Twins. The longevity of BHTM's career is a testament to the quality of the music. More than a quarter of a century later, fans are still convinced that the best is yet to come.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

In 1964, she graduated from Sarah Lawrence College and in 1968 she founded The House, a company dedicated to an interdisciplinary approach to performance. Her performances influenced many artists, including Bruce Nauman, whom she met in San Francisco in 1968. In 1978 Monk formed the ensemble called Meredith Monk and Vocal Ensemble (modelled after similar ensembles of musical collagues such as Steve Reich and Philip Glass) to explore new and wider vocal textures and forms which often were contrasted with minimal instrumental textures. Powerful and influential pieces from this time include Dolmen Music (1979), which also was recorded for her first album released at Manfred Eicher's record label ECM in 1981. In the 1980s she wrote and directed two films, Ellis Island (1981), and Book of Days (1988), which developed from a single idea; \"One day during summer of 1984, as I was sweeping the floor of my house in the country, the image of a young girl (in black and white) and a medieval street in the Jewish community (also in black and white) came to me\", as Monk recounts in the liner notes of the ECM-recording. Apart from the film, different versions exist of this piece: two for the concert hall, and an album, explained by Meredith Monk and Manfred Eicher as \"a film for the ears.\" In the early 1990s Monk composed an opera - Atlas which premiered in Houston in 1991. More recently, while continuing her work for her ensemble, she began writing for instrumental ensembles and symphony orchestra - her first symphonic work, Possible Sky (2003), and Stringsongs (2004), commissioned by the Kronos Quartet. In 2005, events were held all over the world celebrating the 40th anniversary of her career. These included a concert in Carnegie Hall, featuring Bj\u00f6rk, whose singing is fundamentally indebted to Monk's, and others, including the composers Terry Riley, DJ Spooky (who has sampled her on his album \"Drums of Death\"), and John Zorn and the new music ensembles Alarm Will Sound and Bang on a Can All-Stars, along with the Pacific Mozart Ensemble.\n\n\nShe has won many awards including a MacArthur Fellowship, and she holds honorary Doctor of Arts degrees from Bard College, the University of the Arts (Philadelphia), The Julliard School, the San Francisco Art Institute and the Boston Conservatory.\n\nHer music was used in films by Joel and Ethan Coen (The Big Lebowski, 1998) and Jean-Luc Godard (Nouvelle Vague, 1990 and Notre musique, 2004).\n\nIn a recent interview she said that her favourite music includes Brazilian music, especially Caetano Veloso's recordings, the music by Mildred Bailey (\"the great jazz singer from the \u201830s and \u201840s\"), and Bartok's cycle for piano Mikrokosmos.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/virtuallemonaid"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Buffy Sainte-Marie LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6304611.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Folk", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Academy Award winner Buffy Sainte-Marie\u2019s audacious attitude to life on and off the stage has inspired people around the world for over five decades.", "otherInfo": "Virtual LemonAid - Northern New Mexico\u2019s Festival for Covid-19 Relief\n\nMay 8, 2020 at 8:00 PM MDT\n\nBenefiting All Together New Mexico Fund and the Santa Fe County Connect Fund.

If you require a set of vocal jazz standards for the first set, sing along favorites for the second and then full on dance music for the third set, Ryan 7 offers that kind of flexibility.\n\n\n\nRyan 7 are a duo of seasoned pros who understand how to interpret a crowd and to deliver exactly what is needed.\n\n\n\nRyan7 is made up of two seriously magnificent forces of nature: Mighty Mike Hilliard and Sassy Sabrina Weeks.\n\n\n\nCurrently, Ryan7 has over 500 songs in our repertoire and we are constantly adding new material.\n\n\n\nWe offer several shows to choose from:\n\n50s 60s Show\nThis show bounces you between greaser and hippie, between dancing the twist, the mashed potato and catching butterflies in a Psychedelic Haze. Some of the songs included in this set are Let's Do the Twist, We're Having a Party, Shake, Rattle and Roll, Tracks of My Tears, Love the One Your With, Proud Mary, Together, Heard it Through the Grapevine, and many more. This is one of our most requested shows. This show can be up to 3 sets of 60 minutes each.\n\n\nClassic Rock Show\nThis show is a mostly uptempo dance show.

This show can be up to 3 sets of 60 minutes each.\n\n\nRockin' Country Hits Show\nThis is one of our favorite shows to perform. We perform the best of rockin' country starting with classic country such as Patsy Cline and Willie Nelson and then strongly focus on the country from the 80s and 90s such as Garth Brooks, George Straight, and Lorrie Morgan. Then we add some current country such as Miranda Lambert, Taylor Swift and the Band Perry to make the evening complete. This show is a guaranteed crowd pleaser for any country fan. This show can be up to 3 sets of 60 minutes each.\n\n\nLight Dinner Music (including acoustic jazz and blues) Show\nThe best thing about Ryan7 is the flexibility that we offer. We can easily start off your event with acoustic jazz and blues dinner music performed at exactly the right volume. We also offer a complete evening of this if that is what your event requires. Some sample songs performed in this show are Stormy Monday, Can't Hear a Word You Say, God Bless the Child, Wonderful World, At Last, Sunday Kind of Love, and much more. This show can as short as a mini set or up to 3 sets of 60 minutes each.\n\n\nBest of the Hits (50s to Current) Show\nNot sure what you'd like? That's ok too. We can play a little of all the popular genres and create a fun dancing or listening environment for your event attendees.

For over 3 decades he has elevated and shaped an entire genre and remains one of the leading forces in the global music scene today.\n\nHis most recent works have taken him from the DJ booth of the worlds hottest nightspots and festivals to the studio producing soundtracks for Hollywood blockbuster movies. His diversity in artistry and ability has earned him accolades from critics and fans alike. Garnering him not 1 but 2 Grammy Nominations for his works.\n\nBut lets take a step back. The son of a musician, Paul came up as a young DJ in the late '70s spinning Funk in Covent Garden. Not what some might have expected from one of Trances preeminent masters. But he knew then music would be his life. In the '80s 2 life-changing trips took place. The first in 1984 where he spent several months living in New York City working as A&R man for the famed Champion Records signing DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, as well as Salt-n-Pepa. He also became promoter and British agent for the Beastie Boys and Run-D.M.C.\n\nThe second trip and more contemporary influence was in 1987 which brought Paul to the White Isle of Ibiza. Here he discovered the Balearic sound that flowed through the Ibiza air at clubs such as Amnesia. Inspired, he took the music and experiences back to the UK and became its ambassador. Paul returned often holding residencies at Amnesia and Pacha in Ibiza. Around the same time Ministry Of Sound in London was opening and tauted Paul as their first resident. However it was his famed residency at UK super-club Cream in Liverpool that brought Paul global respect as a master of his art. It was some say the catalyst to what has made him a touring legend.\n\nThis residency was celebrated through the Grammy nominated 2004 compilation \u2018Creamfields\u2019 (Paul went on to receive a second Grammy nomination in 2007 with his artist album, \u201cA Lively Mind\u201d and then again in 2009 for his production work with Madonna).\n\nOakenfold\u2019s stature as a DJ and entertainer has taken him beyond the normal club and festival circuit, playing landmark gigs that have changed the face of electronic music. Highlights include three worldwide tours warming up for Madonna and U2 (with both artists insisting on a DJ set from Paul instead of a support band); performing physically on the Great Wall of China and two sold out dates playing to 30,000 people at the Hollywood Bowl in California.\n\nA year after that first visit to Ibiza, Perfecto was born. Founded in 1988, Oakenfold\u2019s groundbreaking Perfecto record label played an integral role in the birth of trance music, with Paul at the helm producing massive international hits such as \u201cNot Over Yet\u201d, \u201cBullet In The Gun\u201d and \u201cSouthern Sun\u201d. With countless high profile releases and remixes in its path, Perfecto Records is still the benchmark to which so many labels measure themselves. 20+ years later, Perfecto remains as cutting edge and popular as ever, even resurrecting its Perfecto Fluoro sublabel in 2011. Probably Perfecto\u2019s most notable release was the recent double album \u201cPerfecto Las Vegas\u201d which held the #1 spot on the US iTunes dance chart for several weeks. This release solidified Paul\u2019s stronghold as an International DJ power player achieving the highest selling DJ compilation ever released in US history \u2013 with over half a million sales.\n\nPaul has produced for megastars such as U2, Madonna (including her latest release \u201cCelebration\u201d) and The Happy Mondays. As well as three acclaimed artist albums under his own name. He has remixed Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones and Justin Timberlake and released over 20 DJ mix compilations. In recent years Paul has also been responsible for creating some of the most breathtaking film scores and cues for a long list of Hollywood blockbusters \u2013 including The Bourne Identity, Matrix Reloaded, Shrek 2, Swordfish and Collateral. But his most anticipated release is yet to come. Paul Oakenfold\u2019s newest artist album \u2018Pop Killer\u2019 is scheduled for imminent release featuring The Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Gnarls Barkley, OneRepublic and B.O.B.\n\nAstonishingly, despite all his success in the worlds of chart music and film, Oakenfold has found time to keep in touch with his roots as a club DJ. Over the past 3 years he has held a weekly residency at the legendary Rain nightclub in The Palms, Las Vegas. Planet Perfecto is a fully produced show with 75 circus performers, cutting edge visuals and special effects - giving the 3,000-strong crowd a truly unique experience.\n\nWhether you are listening to a CD, watching a commercial, going to a club or playing a video game; Paul\u2019s omnimedia presence is felt everywhere.

In 1964, she graduated from Sarah Lawrence College and in 1968 she founded The House, a company dedicated to an interdisciplinary approach to performance. Her performances influenced many artists, including Bruce Nauman, whom she met in San Francisco in 1968. In 1978 Monk formed the ensemble called Meredith Monk and Vocal Ensemble (modelled after similar ensembles of musical collagues such as Steve Reich and Philip Glass) to explore new and wider vocal textures and forms which often were contrasted with minimal instrumental textures. Powerful and influential pieces from this time include Dolmen Music (1979), which also was recorded for her first album released at Manfred Eicher's record label ECM in 1981. In the 1980s she wrote and directed two films, Ellis Island (1981), and Book of Days (1988), which developed from a single idea; \"One day during summer of 1984, as I was sweeping the floor of my house in the country, the image of a young girl (in black and white) and a medieval street in the Jewish community (also in black and white) came to me\", as Monk recounts in the liner notes of the ECM-recording. Apart from the film, different versions exist of this piece: two for the concert hall, and an album, explained by Meredith Monk and Manfred Eicher as \"a film for the ears.\" In the early 1990s Monk composed an opera - Atlas which premiered in Houston in 1991. More recently, while continuing her work for her ensemble, she began writing for instrumental ensembles and symphony orchestra - her first symphonic work, Possible Sky (2003), and Stringsongs (2004), commissioned by the Kronos Quartet. In 2005, events were held all over the world celebrating the 40th anniversary of her career. These included a concert in Carnegie Hall, featuring Bj\u00f6rk, whose singing is fundamentally indebted to Monk's, and others, including the composers Terry Riley, DJ Spooky (who has sampled her on his album \"Drums of Death\"), and John Zorn and the new music ensembles Alarm Will Sound and Bang on a Can All-Stars, along with the Pacific Mozart Ensemble.\n\n\nShe has won many awards including a MacArthur Fellowship, and she holds honorary Doctor of Arts degrees from Bard College, the University of the Arts (Philadelphia), The Julliard School, the San Francisco Art Institute and the Boston Conservatory.\n\nHer music was used in films by Joel and Ethan Coen (The Big Lebowski, 1998) and Jean-Luc Godard (Nouvelle Vague, 1990 and Notre musique, 2004).\n\nIn a recent interview she said that her favourite music includes Brazilian music, especially Caetano Veloso's recordings, the music by Mildred Bailey (\"the great jazz singer from the \u201830s and \u201840s\"), and Bartok's cycle for piano Mikrokosmos.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Black Tones LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9182827.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Garage Rock, Blues-punk, Blues-rock, Afropunk", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Black Tones album title Cobain and Cornbread is a description of the band that lead singer/guitarist Eva came up with playing at a show, in answer to the most commonly asked question, \u201cWhat does your band sound like?\u201d This tasty adroitly description sums up her and her twin drummer Cedric David\u2019s Seattle-spawned punk-blues. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t even sound like our influences,\u201d she explains, \u201cSo the best way I found to describe The Black Tones was to talk about our environment we were raised around, which was a bunch of southerners living in the Northwest.\u201d\n\nLouisiana-bred, though born and raised in Seattle, The Black Tones\u2019 reference to grunge god Kurt and the Native American quick bread cuisine, evokes \u201cSouthern influences in the grey of the Northwest,\u201d Eva says. \u201cIt sort of creates this offspring of rebellion and soul. We eat gumbo in our flannel shirts, and we eat red beans and rice while head-banging!\u201d\n\nMusic was a huge part of Eva and Cedric\u2019s childhood, their first shared fandom being for \u201cTurn Your Love Around\u201d by iconic vocalist and guitarist George Benson, which they would dance to together every time the radio played it. They enjoyed looking in at what their older siblings were digging on MTV, such as Jay Z, Nirvana, Blind Melon, Michael Jackson, and \u201c90s pop music was awesome too! And R&B like SWV, En Vogue, etc.,\u201d Eva says. In high school their tastes had drifted; Eva was introduced to Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd. After high school she researched and grooved on the old blues and folk that had influenced those classic rock bands. At the same time, she and Cedric were also big World-Wide Wrestling fans \u2014 \u201cwe loved wrestling! Cedric loved it before I did, but then I became a fanatic too.\u201d They really enjoyed the hard rock music used in bouts, drawing them closer to heavy metal.\n\nAbout this time Cedric had started to play the drums and wanted to hear the songs that Eva was writing, which she found exciting. He matched drum parts to songs she had only worked out so far on guitar, later on getting a bass player and another guitarist. As soon as they had a few arranged, they were ready to start performing. They went through some changes: The Black Tones as a four piece only lasted for a while, then became a trio, \u201cbut Cedric and I were the founders and the only consistently reliable members, so now we just keep it as a duo, while hiring other musicians to play instruments live with us.\u201d Eva had also been in an all-girl punk band called BUST, but she ended up channeling everything into The Black Tones with Cedric.\n\nThrough countless shows supporting a few early singles, The Black Tones felt they finally got their first big breakthrough opening for Death Cab for Cutie in an anniversary benefit for the Paramount Theater. \u201cThat was the biggest show we\u2019ve done!\u201d Eva exclaims. She gives credit for reaching that height to NighTrain, the all black female punk band that she says discovered and championed them when they had freshly started.\n\nFor Cobain and Cornbread, The Black Tones are returning from their singles to work with the renowned, glorious grunge producer Jack Endino, introduced to them by Eva\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and music writer Jake Uitti. Jake had interviewed Jack and sent him their song \u201cWoman in Black\u201d without Eva\u2019s knowledge and Jack replied how much he loved it and wanted to work with The Black Tones.\n\n\u201cI was never really big on recording in a studio,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m a live show nut, I just love performing. Being in studios was always very stressful for me, but when we worked with Jack, that totally changed! It was the best recording experience I\u2019ve ever had. Jack is like a scientist, a chemist behind the soundboard. He had great ideas that strengthened each song. I\u2019ve never met anyone with an ear like his, it\u2019s unbelievable, though he\u2019s a calm, humble, kind, efficient, honest and very intelligent guy \u2014 I was so intimidated at first, I mean, here\u2019s the guy who recorded the Melvins, Nirvana, Soundgarden, and the list goes on. And now he\u2019s working with us and he\u2019s really into it!\u201d\n\nCobain and Cornbread also features help from their friend Mason Lowe from Bread & Butter, on \u201cChubby and Tubby\u201d (a frenetic garage rock instrumental ode to the landmark Seattle variety store) and \u201cWelcome Mr. Pink\u201d (the band\u2019s autobiographical anthem). \u201cMason has a great ear and was really amazing to work with.\u201d Ed Brooks mastered all the songs on the record, with Jack checking back in to make sure he was looped on everything. \u201cAs a band we are of course rooting for the record, but it\u2019s even more special when everyone else is as well!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something very unique about the songs (all originals save for a cover of \u201cRiver of Jordan\u201d) and sound unique about the minimalist sound Jack helped The Black Tones achieved, reminding one of the debuts from The Ramones to the Stooges to the Modern Lovers. Eva acknowledges the brute power of the album\u2019s sound, \u201cit\u2019s pretty vulnerable and raw and I like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are songs like \u2018Welcome Mr. Pink\u2019 where you can hear the click sound from me pressing down on the button to turn on my reverb pedal.\u201d Or in their righteous, ferocious Black Power anthem, \u201cKey of Black (They Want Us Dead),\u201d \u201cafter the second guitar chorus when I go back to the solo, I almost forgot to press my Wah Wah pedal back on so it comes in a little late.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not factory made or even ever scratch the surface of perfection, we\u2019re real people, this is real life and these little details remind me of the imperfections of life,\u201d she says. \u201cLife\u2019s real, life\u2019s the blues, coming from the heart.

It not just a lyric\u2014it\u2019s a suggestion, a warning, a plea, a wish. This request is woven throughout Likewise, her forthcoming solo album, amidst dramatically shifting motifs. Some are jubilant, some are dreamy and abstract, and a few are sinister, but within each dark void that Quinlan explores, there is a light peering back at her.\n\nFrances Quinlan has built an identity for herself over the past decade as the lead songwriter and front-woman of the Philadelphia-based band Hop Along, and her distinct voice is among the most recognizable and inimitable in music. While the band began as Quinlan's solo project (originally titled Hop Along, Queen Ansleis), Likewise (out January 31st on Saddle Creek) is Quinlan's debut under her own name. To make the record, she enlisted the virtuosic skills of her bandmate Joe Reinhart, and together they produced the album at his studio, The Headroom, recording in stints over the course of a year.\n\nWith a renewed openness to explore different sounds, Quinlan supplements her typical guitar-based instrumentation with synthesizers, digital beats, harps, strings, and a wide variety of keyboards. The shifting and exploratory nature of these musical arrangements allow her lyrics and vocals\u2014which have always been at the forefront of her music\u2014to reach emotional depths like never before. Her vocal tones beckon a kaleidoscopic range of emotions across all nine songs on the album, from soft and ruminative to enraged and commanding; from conveying powerful messages to highlighting small, yet poignant, moments.\n\nQuinlan is a voyaging songwriter. Throughout Likewise, she confronts what confounds her in the hopes that she will come out on the other side with a better sense of what it is to be human. She presents listeners with a complicated, albeit spirited vision of what it could mean to truly engage with another person, to give a small piece of oneself over to someone else without expectation.

His tracks have proven to be bona fide dance floor gold, blasting through sound systems at Madison Square Garden, the EDC Vegas Main Stage, and countless other venues. Above & Beyond and many others continue to see massive crowds surge with excitement whenever they drop a Jason Ross track. The balance of powerful emotion and electrifying energy created in his productions is proving to be a perfect yin and yang, earning him the \u201cfuture face of trance\u201d crown by Electric Daisy Carnival creators Insomniac. Since \u201cBurma\u201d he has released a sequence of galvanizing tunes on the label, including \u201cElements,\u201d \u201cCairo,\u201d and his collaboration with Wrechiski, \u201cAtlas,\u201d which quickly shot up to the #1 spot on the Beatport Trance chart. Most recently, \u201cCoaster\u201d and \u201cMonarch\u201d have been heaping up praise, including support from the Anjunabeats core of A&B, Andrew Bayer and ilan Bluestone, along with Seven Lions, Armin van Buuren, Gareth Emery, Andrew Rayel, Andi Durrant, Markus Schulz, Ben Gold, Andy Moor, Cosmic Gate, Super8 & Tab, Dennis Shepherd, Kyau & Albert and many more. Jason\u2019s first vocal single, \u201cMe Tonight\u201d featuring Lauren Ray, shot up the Beatport charts to become his second Beatport Trance #1. As the lead single off of the \u2018Anjunabeats Worldwide 06\u2019 compilation, curated and mixed by Jason himself, \u201cMe Tonight\u201d set the tone for an exhilarating, forward-thinking musical journey of Anjunabeats\u2019 exclusives. The compilation is highlighted by six of Jason\u2019s own originals, remixes and collaborations, including two new tracks alongside labelmate ilan Bluestone and a stellar remix of Seven Lion\u2019s hit \u201cCreation.\u201d The compilation charted in the Top 5 of iTunes Dance Albums in seven major markets, including Australia, India, and the United States. Jason is embarking on his first solo headlining tour in support of the compilation, spanning 14 dates and cities across North America, in addition to supporting Above & Beyond at their ABGT200 celebration in September.", "otherInfo": "Join us with Alpha 9, Christopher Lawrence, Gabriel & Dresden, Infected Mushroom, Jason Ross, Paul Oakenfold, and more for Dreamstate!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Samantha Margret LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10353252.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Singersongwriter, Pop", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Samantha is a singer songwriter and San Francisco native.

At the age of 22 years old, he has already made a name for himself as a successful singer/songwriter, dancer, and actor who believes in taking his career into his own hands.

Underpinning her contemporary narratives and musical sojourns with a solid respect for tradition and a passion for adventure and travelling to new lands, both real, and musical.\n\n\u2018I am Irish,\u2019 she says, \u2018but there is a real sense of place in Australia in my music. It\u2019s not strictly Irish and it\u2019s not Australian. I am so proud of the musical heritage I come from. The sense of tradition musically is earthing and grounding, but tradition in its essence has boundaries, expectations, and ingrained rules. Leaving home made me push my own boundaries of music and self. It has given me permission to break the rules,\u2019 she says. \u2018I have learned to dip from that deep well, but I value the freedom I have to express it in my way and I have Australia to thank for that.\u2019\n\nHer unique musicianship and an equally deft touch with a killer hook or a heartrending lament has attracted the attention of many celebrated musicians in Ireland and Australia, including Glen Hansard who mentored her 2017 EP release \u2018Fledgling Fall\u2019. Tyrrell\u2019s seductive, mournful voice, atop a stirring Celtic soul romp, is given a little extra finesse by her friend Hansard on her the single \u2018Don\u2019t Be Left Crying\u2019. The song climbing to Number One on Ireland\u2019s national broadcaster RTE\u2019s Independent Music Charts on her first ever release in Ireland.\n\nThat\u2019s just part of the story that continues to unfold for the Australia-based Irish singer Tyrrell on her extraordinary journey. The gypsy spirit runs strong in Tyrrell who spent 2017 on back to back musical odysseys across Europe, Ireland and Australia packed with guitars, banjos, tin whistles, and three kids aboard a bus. As if touring venues and playing world class festivals across the world wasn\u2019t enough for Tyrrell, she used the time in Ireland to record her new self-titled album due for release in 2018 with funding from Creative Victoria. The album is a musical journey across her homeland collaborating with long time musical producer, Mark Stanley (The Mary Janes) as well as Liam O\u2019Maonlai (Hot House Flowers), Joe Doyle and Colm Mac Con Iomaire (The Frames), Karl Odlum (The Mary Janes) and Declan O\u2019Rourke.\nHer new album is something of a homecoming both musically and physically as Tyrrell returned to the places and the people that made her including her father, Se\u00e1n Tyrrell, one of Ireland\u2019s most revered and enduring folk singers.\n\u2018The ethos of the album was coming back to find the source. My first album was very personal and it was cathartic for me to be able to pick up the pieces after a destructive relationship. This album is about my being who you I am; It\u2019s about embracing all the stories who create who we are. When I left Ireland years ago I had stopped playing. Australia gave me the space to pick up my instrument and the courage to sing my stories. Bringing them home has been incredible. I found my voice 15,000 kilometres over the sea and I was heard and embraced by my country when I returned.\u2019\n\nTyrell\u2019s own story in itself is the stuff of quiet cinematic inspiration.\n\nThree years ago, after a traumatic relationship break-up, the singer left home in Victoria with her three young children to travel across Australia in a 1966 Bedford bus. The coach not only became home and carried the singer to shows and festivals all over the country and to the various locations where she and Stanley recorded her first album \u2018Queen of Swords\u2019, including an underground cave in the South Australian mining town of Coober Pedy, it became her passage to freedom.\n\nTyrrell\u2019s passionate music draws from a number of styles and influences. Certainly traditional Irish folk is in her blood, but so too are elements of country, soul and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Her upbringing in County Clare and in the United States (her mother is American) and her new-found love of Australia also means she is drawing from many cultures in her writing.\n\nThe last two years have been huge for Tyrrell. In addition to her own massive touring schedule, she joined Paul Kelly, Shane Howard, Pauline Scanlon, Declan O'Rourke, John Spillane and her father on the national concert tour Exile, a line-up of outstanding Irish and Australian artists who came together for a celebration of Irish influence in Australia, creating a rich tapestry of stories, imagery and music. 2016/17 saw Tyrrell perform successful headline tours around Australia, Europe and Ireland as well as performing at Woodford Folk Festival, Adelaide Fringe, Mullum Music Festival, Cygnet Folk Festival, Bello Winter Music, and many others and Electric Picnic in Ireland. She has earned the reputation of being an unmissable live act.\n\nThis year the \u2018Queen of Swords\u2019 stakes her claim and invites you to share the stories of her journey, and her soundtrack to salvation. Her self-titled album is a call to arms, a siren\u2019s wisdoms and warnings, and most importantly the soundtrack of a woman who walks her own beat.\n\n\n\"Soul, intelligence, wit and wisdom, history and mystery and a voice that brings it al together.

As a consequence of growing up within a culture that did not support the notion of a woman becoming a musician - let alone a genre bending, thought provoking, ass shaking contemporary hip hop artist - she was forced to overcome some serious obstacles in her journey.\n\nAfter a few short years of exploring her voice, Nardean has cemented herself as a force to be reckoned with in the Australian Hip Hop scene. Traversing rap, singing and poetry, her music is an eclectic mix of heartfelt lyricism and honest self reflection, contrasted with queen anthems and middle finger raising bangers.\n\nNardean has coined the term \u201cpost hop\u201d to describe her style. She is heavily influenced by hip hop, while also drawing on elements of neo-soul, electronica, glitch and RnB. She sits in a pocket of the musical realm that is mostly uncharted, yet buzzing and burgeoning.\n\nShe released her debut record \u201cCreatress\u201d in 2019. This record saw her receive national airplay, numerous Spotify and Apple Music playlists, as well as being selected to showcase at BIGSOUND 2018.\n\nNardean is ready to unleash her second EP, with funding and support from both CreateNSW and Campbelltown Art Centre\u2019s new initiative \u201cConscious.\u201d\n\nA warm presence, a commanding magnetism and the occasional giggling fit ensure that Nardean will continue to captivate audiences, while contributing significantly to the changing face of Australian music.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/nardeannn"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Celeste Carballo ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bersuit Vergarabat ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9713862.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bersuit Vergarabat, formed in 1989, is one of the most important Argentine rock bands of the 1990s/2000s.\n\nAfter 2 albums of underground transgressive rock, the band started mixing it with Latin American rhythms such a cumbia, chacarera, candombe and cuartetazo.

She managed to record two full-length albums and tour with some of the music world's biggest names even before she hit the age of 20. Her first album drew rave reviews from most critics and put her on the often rocky road toward stardom.\n\nDevon was born in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in the spring of 1982. She grew up in a household filled with music and family and friends. She admits some of her influences include Bikini Kill, Frank Zappa, and even some of the classic rock & roll groups her parents loved, like the Beatles. At a young age, Devon practiced vocal harmony with her father. Later she used his old guitar to strum out her first tentative notes. By the time she was 15, she was putting her musical talents to work, playing in front of local places for change from those who stopped to listen. There was never any other dream in her mind but music, and luckily no one to tell her it was the kind of dream that was out of reach.\n\nWhen Devon was still in her teens, she recorded her debut album, a self-titled offering filled with original songs. That album -- really, her voice on that album -- drew a lot of interest, and in the end landed her a spot touring as a side act with the very popular Dave Matthews Band. One tour turned into two. For 2001, Devon released a second album, LONG SLEEVE STORY, under the Three Word Records label. She had some pretty impressive help on her sophomore release, such as drummer Nate Brown, bassist David Saull, trumpeter John D'earth, and bass player Stefan Lessard, who also served as producer for the album.\n\nDevon's 2003 CD, UPSTATE SONGS, (City Salvage Records) was included in Rolling Stone's \u201cCritics Top Albums of 2003\u201d. Critic Julie Gerstein called the record \u201cperhaps the sweetest and most honest folk-pop album recorded this year,\u201d and added, \u201cSproule's vocal and lyrical beauty is unmatched.\"\n\n2007 brought the release of her 'getting-married' (to songwriter Paul Curreri) CD, KEEP YOUR SILVER SHINED (City Salvage/Waterbug). Produced by Jeff Romano in the heart of Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge mountains, this CD highlights Sproule\u2019s talent for combining Appalachian, folk and jazz influences. From the front porch thump of \"Old Virginia Block\" to the high lonesome traditional \"The Weeping Willow,\u201d featuring fellow Virginia-native Mary Chapin Carpenter, the record finds Sproule making another important contribution to the Great American Songbook. The New Yorker magazine: The nimble singer-guitarist Devon Sproule chronicles her ongoing love affairs with humanity, nature, and the state of Virginia. She performs with a sweet, round diction that shines through even her most ornate imagery and rambunctious melodies. In July 2007 Devon graced the cover of fRoots magazine in the UK; the first American artist on the cover this decade.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lady Bird ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8818186.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Royal Tunbridge Wells,United Kingdom", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Formed in the archetypal english town of Tunbridge Wells, Lady Bird\u2019s shared desire to spread lofty ideas has led to them creating some of the most exciting music to come out of anywhere in the country.\n\nWhile Punk can sometimes be seen as a reductive term, Lady Bird hark back to its deeper meaning, exemplifying an attitude of rebellion, freedom and bold ideas.

His first club hit was Gym & Tonic, a track produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, featuring vocals illegally taken from a Jane Fonda fitness tape. The Bob Sinclar persona was based on a character from Philippe de Broca's film Le Magnifique.\n\nSinclar is famous for popularizing the \"french touch\" of house music, with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. His track \"Feel for You\", a tribute to french musician Cerrone, from his second album Champs Elys\u00e9es, hit #9 in the UK Top 40.

Her musical talent was discovered early on and fostered by Helena Guimar\u00e3es Galo and Arnaldo Estrella (student of Alfred Cortot and friend of Villa Lobos), at the Conservatory of Antwerp student of Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge, student of Arthur Schnabel>Leon Fleisher>Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge.\n\nShe played a first recital at the age of 5 in the Teatro Mesbla in Rio de Janeiro. First TV performance at age 6 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Alceo Bocchino with a Haydn concerto, and another two times the same concerto conducted by Eleazar de Carvalho and Isaac Karabtchevsky with the Orquestra Sinfonica Brasileira. At age 7 she performed Mozart KV488 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Edouard van Remoortel (Rio de Janeiro).\n\nIn the USA she received the \"special prize\" of the jury at the Van Cliburn competition, and she made an indelible impression with Beethoven\u00b4s piano concerto n.4 at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium.\n\nAfter the \"wonderkind\" and \"competitions\" happenings, she received invitations to perform in more than 25 countries. Her intelligence and brilliant musical feeling allow her to play a repertory of 61 piano concertos.\n\nIn 1990 she took up composing again, producing brilliant and at times mischievous cadenzas for her concertos. In 1994-95 she wrote her 15 Momentos Musicais and composed the Sonate Oubli\u00e9e with themes from her childhood. Her characteristics have remained unchanged: simplicity and spontaneity, feeling and imagination, technique, perfection without affectation, a delight for the eye and ear.\n\nIn February 1998 Rodrigues' Bach-CD was recorded. The critics describe her improvisations and paraphrases on works for the organ as: \"The sonorities go back to the scale of more than 3 centuries of piano literature and link perfectly well up with the richness in colour of an independent way of pianistic thinking, they have their own new life, a fascinating transfiguration, full of phantasy.\"\n\nAstonishment, admiration and even incredibility caused her Suite n.1 \"Rio de Janeiro\" for piano and orchestra, that was first performed on 9 August 2000. She plaid and recorded in St. Petersburg the 5 concerto's for piano from Sergei Prokofiev with the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n1998 - 2014 she is invited in a.o. Amsterdam, Antwerp, Brussels, Den Haag, Lisbon, Moscow, New-York, N\u00fcrnberg, Rotterdam, St. Petersburg, Volgograd, Z\u00fcrich.\n\nOver the last few years Eliane Rodrigues has also won great acclaim as a conductor. She has trained with Herbert Slegers (theory), Alexander Dmitriev, Edward Serov, Dmitri Liss and Juozas Domarkas (practical), Gloria Rodrigues-da Silva, prima ballerina (choreographer/kinematics).\n\nShe can now lead the orchestra to produce great classical compositions as she has already done for example with Beethoven\u2019s piano sonatas.\n\nEliane Rodrigues is professor on the Royal Conservatory of Antwerp.", "otherInfo": "Come join Eliane at home and listen to various pieces of her vast repertoire!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rinaly ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9178985.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Trance", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Rinaly is a Japanese music producer and DJ since 2014.

He trained for ten years, developing a distinct passion for Jazz. Soon after the sound of Hip Hop provoked him to not only form his own band but also to start his foray into DJ'ing and production. Then came house as Satoshi became fascinated by the early Chicago mix-tapes he was hearing.\n\nA Japanese cosmetic company asked Satoshi to produce a track for their forthcoming promo parties where the legendary DJ Frankie Knuckles was performing. Knuckles saw the potential in Satoshi's music and asked if he was interested in collaborating. The final result of their partnership was \"Tears\", a defining moment in vocal house and a song now commonly regarded as an all time classic. Satoshi soon took the leap and moved to New York. Since his seminal hit \"Tears\" with Knuckles back in 1989, he has gone on to become a major part of the acclaimed Def Mix crew. Tomiie has remixed and worked with the likes of Photek, Kosheen, Simply Red, David Bowie, U2, Mariah Carey, and Misia (Japan's #1 R&B artist), just to name a few.\n\nIn 2000 Satoshi wrote and produced his debut album for Sony entitled \"Full Lick\" featuring performances by Kelli Ali, former front woman for the Sneaker Pimps, Diane Charlemagne, Robert Owens and others. The album has been met with critical acclaim by his fans and the press with each single enjoying top ten dance chart success. \"Up in Flames\", garnered a number one dance hit in the UK and included mixes from John Digweed. In the US, \"Up in Flames\" and \"Darkness\" established Satoshi's presence in the alternative music scene as well as the dance music scene. The Global Underground compilation mixed by John Digweed also featured \"Love in Traffic\" the most recognizable single from \"Full Lick\" in addition to three other \"Satoshi\" productions/ remixes.\n\nIn 2001, Satoshi Tomiie launched his own label \"SAW.RECORDINGS\". The word SAW comes from \"SAW is one of the names of the sound wave (Sine, Square, Triangle and so on). These are used by various kinds of electronic music producers regardless of the style; most of them use and tweak these waveforms to compose music. Regardless of the style, SAW.RECORDINGS would like to introduce quality music to the music scene. We also would like to be a tool for DJ's (as SAW).\" states Tomiie.\n\nIt was Satoshi's desire to create a platform from which he would be able to showcase ideas and creativity that are more experimental. SAW\u00d5s first single release \"Paranoize\" by Bipath caused major excitement from DJ's worldwide. Follow up singles, Madam \"Penetration\" and Tomiie\u00d5s own \"Virus\" gave SAW world recognition.\n\n2002 has brought forth singles and EP\u00d5s from the likes of Akadoma, Jerry Bonham and Tigerhook, with a debut production from the remix team Gabriel & Dresden entitled \"Lament\" at the end of the year Tomiie\u00d5s Saw label is forging ahead. 2003 brings Echomen \"Perpetual\" the first vocally driven record for the Label. Tomiie's ongoing philosophy to push the envelope and expose new talents has assisted in the launch of such new producer / dj\"s as Trendroids and Lexicon Avenue. If SAW.RECORDINGS is an example of the direction that Satoshi is heading in, he is acknowledging the changes in the dance music scene, thus shifting what House music is. House music never stops evolving and expanding its borders and Satoshi Tomiie is in the forefront of this movement.\n\nSatoshi is the first American based DJ to be asked to record a NuBreed album (#6) for International label Global Underground. Nubreed is known for only working with the leading cutting edge DJ's. With a world tour under way, Tomiie launched the North American leg with a Spundae party in San Francisco and continued traveling throughout the USA, Europe, of South America, Asia, and Australia. His Nubreed album is the fastest and highest selling Nubreed album to date.\n\nReceiving the highest honor as a DJ, in December Satoshi Tomiie was voted by the public into the #30 spot of the World\u00d5s Top 100 DJ List. Satoshi is also finding International recognition now as a Label owner besides his proven talents as a DJ, Producer / Artist and Musician. 2003 Satoshi has again launched his world tour on the west coast of the United States and will be touring well into the fall.\n\nHe released Satoshi Tomiie presents Ice entitled \"Scandal in New York\" and has just completed a DJ Mix compilation titled UNDULATION 1.

We've been mates since school but got the 'get a job, get a life' mantra drilled into us so we each went about getting a job and trying to get a life we enjoyed for a while.\n\nAlways jammed and played music, sometimes together - Spud went and played with Sack, toured with Morrissey and lived a little, Nipper and Neilo played garage music in Obi-Wan, Joe was a journo in New York for a while and Keith worked for Sky.\n\nLast year we got together and figured we'd prefer to have no job and enjoy life. Came together as Hybrasil and started writing and playing. Its been a good year - signed to FIFA Records, released our first EP - We Got Music (Top 40) and played with some pretty cool bands already - The La's (their first show in 10 years - got plastered with them so pay no attention to anyone that tells you Lee Mavers is a recluse - he's a pure gent), Wags (from The Happy Mondays), Idlewild, The Chalets.\n\nJust toured UK for the first time a few months back and the crowds went fairly nuts for us so that's where the near future lies for us. We Got Music got into the top ten in the UK college charts upon its release in February in the UK. Our next single, When I'm Yawning, will be out on July 27 with tours of Ireland and the UK to follow. That's about where we are now.\n\n---\n\nAnother Hybrasil was based in Boston, fronted by CHRISTIAN MCNEILL.

Coming up near Chicago in the early 90s, Intel grew up in the early days of Hip Hop with a fascination for turntablism. He quickly hit the decks with a set of turntables and a mixer he \u201cborrowed\u201d from his brother, and started off on the path that Chicago DJ legends like PNS and Tone B Nimble paved. Between the house parties and the B-boy battles, Intel quickly made a name for himself across the Midwest.\n\nIntel still holds down the decks for the B-boys, but his scope and style--fueled by his limitless passion and innovation--have evolved. The kid honing his craft on hand-me-down tables now shares (or steals, depending on your perspective) the stage with Hip Hop legends (Lupe Fiasco, Afrika Bambaataa, Wu-Tang Clan, ?Love), EDM greats (Amon Tobin, Kid Koala, Nero, The Prodigy) and three time world DMC champion DJ Qbert, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. He holds down quite a few residencies in Chicago, including the world famous Smart Bar, rips up stages at huge music festivals (Lollapalooza, North Coast Music Fest, SXSW) and works everything from charitable events to openings to fashion shows for clients like: Adidas, Red Bull, Scion, AT&T and Microsoft.\n\nWNUR and the DJZTRIP.com community both voted DJ Intel \u2018Best MixTape DJ.\u2019 The New York Post and Entertainment Weekly both love him.

The music emanating from the DJ booth is that perfect club mix of driving percussion and soaring musicality, bursting out of the speakers, soaking everyone in melody, drenching them in sound. On the floor, where it really matters, the crowd experiences all the peaks and troughs that make Warren\u2019s sensibility so unique. He might start with his deeper take on house, then gradually morph into harder territory; then, once Warren has the throng fully in his grip, sweating and losing themselves in the grooves, moving on instinct, he takes them to points unknown they never expected to go. That's why Nick Warren is so respected: he knows how to truly work a crowd, delivering again and again, yet taking them somewhere they\u2019ve never been before. That's what comes with vision and, just as importantly in Warren\u2019s case, experience.\n\nTo this day, Warren remains at the forefront of club culture: he packs clubs and arenas worldwide from London to Los Angeles to Taipei, transfixing dancefloors with his distinctively forward blend of credible progressive sounds, cutting-edge techno, atmospheric breaks and any other crucial grooves Warren deems appropriate for his turntable alchemy. 2008 also finds Warren reaching other milestones. He\u2019s releasing his eighth mix CD for the Global Underground series, GU035: Lima; he\u2019s also completing his fourth studio album with Way Out West, Warren\u2019s pioneering electronic/band collaboration with Jody Wisternoff. Warren also recently became head of A&R for Hope Recordings, keeping him immersed in the shifting tides of new dance-music movements. \u201cI\u2019m doing same thing I did when I started\u2014just playing music I love,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s as inspiring as ever. In Lima, we did the party for the Global mix on the grass in front of a stadium, and the crowd was as enthusiastic and curious as any I\u2019ve ever had. It was one of the best parties I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nWhat makes Warren\u2019s vision continue to resonate is that he\u2019s honed it over the years. He was there for the dawn of today\u2019s club culture, and the original ethos of bringing integrity and a forward, future-looking aesthetic to what he does never left him. Warren began spinning at free parties in fields during acid house\u2019s halcyon \u201cSummer of Love\u201d back in \u201988: then, the revelry typically ended around lunchtime two days after the rave began, and seminal electronic artists like Leftfield and Orbital were making their mark with their first tracks. The culture was so new, DJs weren\u2019t considered the icons they are today; if you were behind the decks, you were doing it for the music above all else, not money or fame. Despite Warren\u2019s continuing success, that original motivation has never left him. \u201cWe never wanted to be \u2018superstar DJs,\u2019\u201d Warren says of himself and his peers that rose to fame out of the dance-music revolution. \u201cThere was no such thing. I was just lucky to be there at the beginning. In those days, we were focused on creating and playing the next thing\u2014music no one else had ever heard.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s DJ sets always were set apart by their moody atmosphere\u2014a key element of music from his Bristol hometown. Warren ascribes that to the influence of the city\u2019s multicultural makeup, which found punters of all races attending dub parties from the likes of Jah Shakti. \u201cSeeing him make so many sounds with just one turntable was incredible,\u201d Warren recalls. \u201cIt was all about moving hips, about reverb, about the space between sounds. That epic silence in the right place became the sound of Bristol.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018control freak\u2019 side that every DJ has still comes out in me whenever I play music in a dark room,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhether it\u2019s 600 people in a club or 10,000 at a festival, I love that I can take the crowd anywhere. It\u2019s amazing I\u2019m still surprised every day. When I stop searching for music, I\u2019ll have to quit. But the moment, I\u2019m as excited as I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.residentadvisor.net/dj_profiles.asp?ID=58", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "C-Raze ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sounds of A&R ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10274337.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "BILLBOARD and Jazz Week Chart Artist\n\nAward Winning jazz duo!

Her unique vocal approach draws from a wide range of influences such as Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She sings with a rustic warm tone and strong articulation. April May is the first female to graduate from The William Paterson University Jazz Education program where she studied under the leadership of the late Mulgrew Miller.\n\n\"Enter April May! A young singer who is a naturally talented as she is cultivated...She is at once, lyrical and soulful. April is definitely one to watch out for - a singer that can go in almost any direction.

Randall utillizes the trumpet with great emotional expression. His sound continues to look towards the future, while paying homage to Fats Navarro, Clifford Brown, Clark Terry and Miles Davis. Randall became the youngest person ever to perform with the prestigious Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. Randall's associations with Wynton Marsalis and Marcus Roberts have enabled him to perform with jazz legends such as: Art Farmer, Jackie McLean, Frank Foster, Milt Grayson, and Ed Thigpen.\n\nSounds of A & R have been making their mark in the New York scene, wowing audiences on stages such as The Birdland Jazz Club and the legendary Apollo Theater. In their self-titled debut album, the listener will be taken on an artistic journey through and array of colors in modern jazz. While standards like 'September in the Rain' and 'Midnight Sun' will be reminiscent of the Clifford Brown and Sarah Vaughan classics, S.O.A.R. finds their unique sound with wonderfully crafted arrangements of their own original compositions such as 'Love's Dilemma' and the beautifully earthly 'Nobody Knows'. Jazz Lovers and pop fans alike are sure to enjoy the fresh approach S.O.A.R. renders to pop classics such as 'All I Do' and 'Blackbird'.

Sinclar started DJing in 1986, when he was just 18 years old, specializing in funk and hip-hop music, with the name Chris The French Kiss. His first club hit was Gym & Tonic, a track produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, featuring vocals illegally taken from a Jane Fonda fitness tape. The Bob Sinclar persona was based on a character from Philippe de Broca's film Le Magnifique.\n\nSinclar is famous for popularizing the \"french touch\" of house music, with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. His track \"Feel for You\", a tribute to french musician Cerrone, from his second album Champs Elys\u00e9es, hit #9 in the UK Top 40. On track \"Darlin'\", he worked with vocalist James \"D-Train\" Williams.\n\nSinclar has also worked under other pseudonyms. Under the aliases The Mighty Bop and Reminiscence Quartet, he has dabbled in hip-hop and acid jazz. He also created the Africanism project, where an ensemble of artists produce house music with a combination of latin, jazz, african and tribal flavors. In 2005 he scored a hit with his single \"Love Generation\", that reached #1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts and the German Media Control Single Charts in 2006. The song was a huge success throughout Europe, also peaking at no. 2 in the Dutch Top 40. The followup hit was \"World, Hold On\", that features Steve Edwards and also managed to chart in the top ten in most of the European countries. \"Rock this Party (Everybody Dance Now)\" followed on August 22, 2006.\n\nThe remix of \"World, Hold on\" by E-Smoove is nominated for a Grammy 2007 in the category \"Remixed Recording\". Also, \"World Hold on\" was chosen by Billboard Magazine as the number one Hot Dance Club Play Single of 2006, beating Madonna and Christina Aguilera.\n\nThe fourth single of the album 'Western Dream' called 'Tennessee' was supposed to be released in April 2007, but has been cancelled due to the rumour of a new album being released.\n\nThis album is Soundz Of Freedom.

First TV performance at age 6 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Alceo Bocchino with a Haydn concerto, and another two times the same concerto conducted by Eleazar de Carvalho and Isaac Karabtchevsky with the Orquestra Sinfonica Brasileira. At age 7 she performed Mozart KV488 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Edouard van Remoortel (Rio de Janeiro).\n\nIn the USA she received the \"special prize\" of the jury at the Van Cliburn competition, and she made an indelible impression with Beethoven\u00b4s piano concerto n.4 at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium.\n\nAfter the \"wonderkind\" and \"competitions\" happenings, she received invitations to perform in more than 25 countries. Her intelligence and brilliant musical feeling allow her to play a repertory of 61 piano concertos.\n\nIn 1990 she took up composing again, producing brilliant and at times mischievous cadenzas for her concertos. In 1994-95 she wrote her 15 Momentos Musicais and composed the Sonate Oubli\u00e9e with themes from her childhood. Her characteristics have remained unchanged: simplicity and spontaneity, feeling and imagination, technique, perfection without affectation, a delight for the eye and ear.\n\nIn February 1998 Rodrigues' Bach-CD was recorded. The critics describe her improvisations and paraphrases on works for the organ as: \"The sonorities go back to the scale of more than 3 centuries of piano literature and link perfectly well up with the richness in colour of an independent way of pianistic thinking, they have their own new life, a fascinating transfiguration, full of phantasy.\"\n\nAstonishment, admiration and even incredibility caused her Suite n.1 \"Rio de Janeiro\" for piano and orchestra, that was first performed on 9 August 2000. She plaid and recorded in St. Petersburg the 5 concerto's for piano from Sergei Prokofiev with the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n1998 - 2014 she is invited in a.o.

She has trained with Herbert Slegers (theory), Alexander Dmitriev, Edward Serov, Dmitri Liss and Juozas Domarkas (practical), Gloria Rodrigues-da Silva, prima ballerina (choreographer/kinematics).\n\nShe can now lead the orchestra to produce great classical compositions as she has already done for example with Beethoven\u2019s piano sonatas.\n\nEliane Rodrigues is professor on the Royal Conservatory of Antwerp.", "otherInfo": "Come join Eliane at home and listen to various pieces of her vast repertoire!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jade Bird ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8997011.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Alternative", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jade Bird is fast becoming one of the most exciting new British voices.

Answering someone\u2019s questions about who you are has always seemed a strange way to approach the task of telling others about yourself and your life\u2019s mission. Because who knows you better than you do?\n\nIn order to alleviate that emotion of seeming vanity, I decided to take on the job myself.\n\nI was raised by people who found life hard and wonderful at the same time. A farm in central Kentucky is what I call my homeland. The tender shoots that sprang from my grandfather\u2019s carefully plowed rows were lessons about life. Planting, reaping, seedtime, and harvest, these are the bases of all of our existence, really. We planted each spring to make sure we survived the winter\u2019s dark days. Spiritually we are nothing if we are not farmers planting seeds for the Master\u2019s great wedding day harvest.\n\nWe celebrated the rain after weeks of drought, always decidedly giving glory to God for His provision.\n\nWe fed and housed ornery old Angus and Herford cows as if they were better than we were. We sweated through the heat of tobacco season and we prayed before every meal. We were fed on the baby food of \u201cevery good gift comes from the Father.\u201d As we matured, we graduated to the meat of \u201cthough He slay me, yet, I will praise Him.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, no one has ever asked me how I came to follow Jesus. Of course my parents and grandparents held my feet to each precept of Christianity, but just because that is so does not mean salvation for me. Actually, I was wooed. For years, I sat and listened to the congregational songs, and their gospel plucked strings in my heart. It was not until I went to youth camp that it became clear that I had to take part in my Savior\u2019s death by repentance. After camp, I did just that. There was not a parade. There were no fireworks. There were no flaming tongues falling at the front pew where I knelt. It was just Mrs. Davenport and me kneeling there. She prayed the words first, and I repeated them. I have repeated them in some fashion every day since. \u201cLord, forgive me for I am a sinner.\u201d After words that heavy, God does the great and awesome remaking of a human heart. Nothing is ever the same then. Thank God for that.\n\nThough I did not come from a musically literate family, music has always been a part of me. Each week my mother cleaned the small Baptist church where we attended. My job was to vacuum the never-ending sea of sanctuary carpet. Mom allowed me to take a turntable from our home and listen to records as I swept. At the time, I only owned two LP\u2019s. One I got from a mail order ad of Keith Green. The record was sent on a \u201cjust send what you can\u201d basis from Keith\u2019s ministry. \u201cSo You Wanna Go Back to Egypt?\u201d was the title. Keith impacted my life by allowing me to pay for the recording with what I had, which was $2.50. Another LP landed in my pile of two from God only knows where. It was The Gaither Trio recording called \u201cWe Are Persuaded.\u201d I would listen to that music for hours, and would often look at Gloria\u2019s smile. I remember being envious of their happy faces and locked arms as they skipped down the sidewalk together. I understood that music then, but understand it even more deeply now. \u201cBecause He Lives\u201d was on that recording. I swept, dusted, picked up discarded bulletins, and sang, \u201cI know who holds the future, and life is worth the living just because He lives.\u201d\n\nLast weekend I got off the Gaither\u2019s bus at the arena. I walked along side of Bill into the auditorium. He seemed to be skipping, and so I skipped along beside him. He stuck a microphone in my face on the last verse of Because He Lives and I sang as fine as I could sing. I think my arm made an involuntary sweeping motion.\n\nPlanting and reaping. Jesus planted in me. And still today, He is reaping what He has sown. Like Jesus, I am also a planter now. I plant the strange supernatural seeds of faith, love, mercy, forgiveness, trust, and joy\u2026 and I do it for the child who vacuums the auditoriums of life.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Monkey Union ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10359059.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Everything is a nuisance.", "otherInfo": "L\u00f6rdag 9/5 streamer vi tv\u00e5 grymma band direkt fr\u00e5n Lagret.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Arkells ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8887204.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie Rock, Rock", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Arkells fifth studio album Rally Cry is the band\u2019s most pointedly powerful effort thus far.

Originally expressing his talent via visual art, Levi took an early interest in painting, which he studied at college in St. Petersburg, FL. It was in St. Pete that Levi\u2019s musical talents first revealed themselves. At the close of a significant relationship, he was drawn to writing songs \u2013 songs of his life and relationships. It wasn\u2019t long before Levi realized his need to move back home to cultivate his songwriting craft; so back to Nashville he went. Levi began to make his imprint on the Nashville community through regular co-writes with his father, Marcus Hummon (Grammy Award winning songwriter), and a regular rotation of writers who would join them. Levi loved relating to a listener through the stories he could craft. It wasn\u2019t long before word spread of Levi\u2019s talents, and he found himself writing with the greats such as 2014 ACM Songwriter of the Year Shane MacAnally, Andrew Dorff, Josh Osborne, Jonathan Singleton, Nathan Barlowe Brandy Clark, Trevor Rosen among others, and of course, Marcus Hummon. Learning to always bring in his own ideas and point of view to a writing session, Levi quickly streamlined his unique style. \u201cYou\u2019re letting someone into your world which is really vulnerable,\u201d says Levi. \u201cI write from a reflective & personal place and ultimately I couldn\u2019t see anyone else singing these songs.\u201d As a member of a multi-generational music family, Levi Hummon certainly appreciates his roots. While Levi is very much his own person & artist, he strongly values giving credit where it is due \u2013 and he finds himself fortunate to have his family be part of his journey. In addition to his father\u2019s musical foundation, Levi draws inspiration from his mother, Becca Stevens, who founded the socially conscious & philanthropic organization, Thistle Farms (a residential program and social enterprise made up of women who have survived prostitution, trafficking, and addiction). This became a natural place for Levi to become involved where he further witnessed how music can provide a healing effect to those whom have suffered tremendously. \u201cThistle farms has always been a family to me,\u201d says Levi. \u201cThere is so much knowledge to gain from spending time with the women. It makes me want to always forgive, never take anything for granted, and love everyone.\u201d Continuing to develop his personal sound, Levi found himself in great company while in Nashville. Marcus and Becca casually had their friend and Hall of Fame Songwriter, Desmond Child over for dinner, where Levi played a few songs. Desmond\u2019s reaction was profound and immediate \u2013 he insisted on working with Levi. Soon after, Levi\u2019s tune \u201cMake it Love,\u201d was featured in Child\u2019s film, Two: The Story of Roman & Nero, which appeared on the short list of nominations for the Oscar\u2019s \u201cBest Original Song\u201d. That was just the beginning for Levi. With overwhelming support from Nashville\u2019s music community, Levi signed with Fletcher Foster\u2019s new management and entertainment company, Iconic Entertainment Group. Levi has recently signed with The Valory Music Co (Big Machine Record Label) artist roster, which includes Reba, Justin Moore, Brantley Gilbert, Thomas Rhett, The Mavericks & RaeLynn. \u201cAs our Country format ebbs and flows, it\u2019s always so important from an A&R perspective to look past what\u2019s happening now and make some moves on the future direction,\u201d said BMLG President & CEO Scott Borchetta. \u201cLevi\u2019s unique vision and incredible artistry is exactly the kind of musical move we want to make now.

The music needed to exist, and it was as much an emotional exercise as a creative one.\n\u201cI think every other record that I've written, I wrote knowing that the songs would have an outlet,\u201d Costa says \u201cAnd for this one, I really didn\u2019t. It was just a process I was going through, clearing myself of these feelings and thoughts.\u201d\nThe songs were like Costa\u2019s letters to himself, with the honesty and intimacy of something that was not meant to be heard. \u201c I feel really close to them for that reason,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of my favorite writing is like that - Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s Dear Theo, or Steinbeck\u2019s A Life in Letters. Those are really revealing, because it\u2019s not intended as part of their body of work. There\u2019s something really special about that. But at the same time, I write songs and perform for a living. So it's hard to think these songs will never see the light of day.\u201d\nAnd now, of course, they have. Yellow Coat is a masterpiece of heartbreak from a preternatural tunesmith, its raw emotion channeled into gently swinging, hooky love songs, most of them awash in strings and mellotron and harmonies and groove. From the insinuating acoustic riffs and lo-fi beats of \u201cAvenal\u201d and the snappy fatalism of \u201cSlow\u201d to the almost church-like fragility of \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d Yellow Coat is equal parts lost \u201860s AM radio hits, folk-pop beauty and dark night of the soul music.\nAt the time that Costa started writing, he had stripped things down not only emotionally, but in terms of his surroundings. He had moved into a Laguna Beach studio - as in the size of his living quarters, not a recording complex - with just the bare minimum of furniture and instruments. Instead of a bedside table, a Wurlitzer Sideman drum machine.\nThe Wurlitzer eventually got used and sampled on \u201cAvenal,\u201d which Costa and his friend Chase Perkowski (Iris and the Shade) wrote on a going-nowhere road trip a few hundred miles northeast of L.A. \u201cI was in a searching headspace,\u201d Costa says. \u201cRunning away from something, trying to find something, trying to find myself. We stopped at a gas station overlooking highway 5. Chase was strumming a few chords as the gas was pumping, and I sat under a tree humming a melody and frantically writing down lyrics. By the time the car was fully fueled I asked him to play back the chords to me as I sang the song.\u201d Back on the road, the next sign said \u201cAVENAL: 2 Miles\u201d and Costa had both his opening track and song title.\nThe 37 year-old Costa has a lot of music and artistic growth under his belt, particularly in the last six years. He was 21 when he made his first EP, having immersed himself in music after a bad skateboard landing sidetracked what might have been a pro career. Coming out of that world, he had a punk side, but also became enamored of Scottish folk, and Brian Jones\u2019 guitar style in the Rolling Stones.\n\u201cOne of my first shows that I played was with a band that was all about things like At The Drive-In,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI went up there with my acoustic guitar and played like a Pixies song, and a Donovan song, and then an original of mine. And I remember thinking, What am I? Do I even belong here?\u201d But at no point did he ever think, \u201cOkay, I'm just going to be a guy with a guitar. I always heard bigger arrangements.\u201d\nHe began his career on Jack Johnson\u2019s Brushfire Records, where both his 2006 debut, Songs We Sing, and 2008\u2019s Unfamiliar Faces were produced by No Doubt\u2019s Tom Dumont. Costa produced 2010\u2019s Mobile Chateau himself, while 2013\u2019s self-titled effort brought him to Scotland, where producer Tony Doogan (Beck, Air) assembled a backing band drawn from the ranks of Belle and Sebastian. In 2013, he began a several year period of restless wandering, working on soundtracks such as the 2017 documentary Orange Sunshine and releasing short EPs experimenting with different aspects of his artistry. Then, in 2018 with Santa Rosa Fangs, he found a new home at Dangerbird. The record, a winding story about a family of characters in Northern California, was a rebirth of sorts and a second act to a long and storied career.\n\u201cI've always had freedom in making my records and songs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with Dangerbird, and the last records, they really trusted me to follow my instincts, which is a pretty special place to be.\u201d\nEven before writing \u201cAvenal,\u201d Costa had done a fair amount of home recording. Once an album seemed to be in the cards, the label suggested he connect with producer Alex Newport (At the Drive-In, Death Cab For Cutie, Bleached), as much because they would get along personally as creatively. They worked on three songs that were in varying states of completion, including \u201cLast Love Song\u201d (a simple home recording), \u201cSlow\u201d (a demo) and \u201cMake That Change\u201d (a bare-bones solo acoustic track that Costa and Newport fleshed out from start to finish). Then they kept on going.\nCosta plays a bit of everything on the record, but he also brought in touring drummer Cory Gash and one-woman string section Alexis Mahler (she plays both violin and cello). Costa and Mahler had previously done a lot of remote recording, but this time she came down to California for a week. \u201cWe worked up a bunch of arrangements together that lifted up a lot of the songs in a nice way,\u201d Costa says. \u201cI wanted to really pull up some of the emotional stuff with string and things\u201d (said \u2018things\u2019 being the mellotron, which can evoke so many different tones, as well as Costa\u2019s layered vocals).\nCosta had been playing \u201cSlow\u201d at solo shows before recording it, but it was first written around a rhythm track. With its snappy bass and doo-wop-inspired backing vocals, it feels like a song that could have been plucked from a Scorsese movie, except made in 2020. The sweeping, soulful \u201cJet Black Lake\u201d is equally cinematic, with Costa pushing his vocal range into falsetto.\nBut it\u2019s \u201cLet Love Heal\u201d and \u201cLast Love Song\u201d that are perhaps the heart of the record, bittersweet evocations of love\u2019s power to both soothe and devastate. When Costa first wrote what became \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d it had a different title, and was meant to be an anniversary gift. Instead, it turned into a break-up song, its sadness as palpable as the sound of Costa\u2019s fingers on guitar strings.\nLife does go on, however: the record ends with the last song Costa wrote for it, \u201cSo I Say Goodbye,\u201d which provides a sense of closure, its piano-driven tunefulness feeling both uplifting and melancholy. And since finishing Yellow Coat, Costa has written and released an even newer piece of music, \u201cHuman Kind of Song,\u201d which he lyrically crowd-sourced with fans on Instagram while sheltering in-place. Like every other songwriter, he doesn\u2019t know when he will next play live in front of people, so the experience provided some community. And while Yellow Coat may have started as an album about heartbreak, its sense of sadness, hope and perseverance also feels completely universal.\n\u201cEveryone's going through personal trials all the time,\u201d says Costa. \u201cAnd it can be isolating. But now everyone's going through something. And as difficult as that is, there's comfort in that too. Because we're all in it together, and we have been the whole time. Except now we can actually feel it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Clive Carroll ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8963113.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Acoustic, Folk", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "CLICK HERE FOR TOUR DATES\nhttp://www.clivecarroll.co.uk/concerts.html", "otherInfo": "Hello!

Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "WAVEDASH ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8735547.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://secretskyfest.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Spillane ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10338686.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "John Spillane", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "John Spillane is a musician, songwriter, performer, recording artist, storyteller, poet and dreamer.

His mind will have to come to bear the weight of everything that was left behind and forgotten. Archiving the inaccessible. Celebrating the abandoned and mourning the destroyed. The city burials.\u201d (Anders Nystr\u00f6m, Katatonia)\n\nRevered masters of melancholy for nearly 30 years, Katatonia have always pursued a profound emotional connection with their music and those who listen to it. Formed in Stockholm in 1991 by now vocalist Jonas Renkse and guitarist Anders Nystr\u00f6m, this most free-spirited of modern metal bands have taken a slow and steady but endless fascinating journey from primitive beginnings in the extreme metal underground to their current status as darlings of both the metal world and the progressive rock scene.\n\nFrom early attempts to channel their sorrow like seminal 1993 debut Dance Of December Souls and its much lauded follow-up Brave Murder Day (1994) through to post-millennial masterworks like Last Fair Deal Gone Down (2001) and Viva Emptiness (2003), Katatonia\u2019s ever-evolving sound and utterly unique atmospheric identity has cast its spell over generations of music fans, culminating in a recent run of flawless records and ever-more celebrated live performances that few modern bands could hope to match. Most recently, the Swedes\u2019 tenth full-length album The Fall Of Hearts (2016) was universally acclaimed and seemed to herald a long-deserved surge of popularity and prominence: acknowledgement, perhaps, that Katatonia have clicked into yet another higher gear.\n\nBut for all the momentum generated by their story so far, the band surprised their legions of admirers by taking an unexpected break from Katatonia, following the conclusion of the last album\u2019s tour cycle. Joyously, 2020 brings the news that they are not only back, but newly armed with arguably their finest album to date, the enormously vivid and powerful City Burials.\n\n\u201cAfter the whole tour cycle was over, we decided to have a little bit of a break,\u201d explains Renkse. \u201cIt was the first time we\u2019d ever done that with Katatonia. We\u2019d been doing the band for such a long time we thought we might all focus on something else for a while, to see if we still have the drive and the hunger to do Katatonia. As it turned out, we all missed it very much. It\u2019s been a good thing, because it really showed us that Katatonia is a very crucial part of our lives and we need to move forward with it.\u201d\n\nAlthough diehard fans will instantly recognise Katatonia\u2019s amorphous but unmistakable atmospheric imprint, City Burials is yet another example of how this band are in an exhilarating state of perpetual evolution. This time round, Jonas Renkse has written the vast majority of music and all of the lyrics, resulting in a record that is perhaps even more personal to the singer than previous efforts. Nonetheless, he assures us all that the band\u2019s collaborative instincts are as strong as ever.\n\n\u201cActually I had the ideas for this one. It\u2019s hard to explain, but it has never been like, \u2018I want you to write five songs and I\u2019ll write five songs!\u2019\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s more down to whoever is creative during that particular period and who\u2019s not. Anders, this time, didn\u2019t write very much, but he\u2019s been at my side at the production helm to make sure everything is right for the band. We still have very good cooperation within the band, even if I wrote all the music for this album.\u201d\n\nThe proof of Jonas and Anders\u2019 enduring artistic bond is displayed throughout City Burials\u2019 absorbing 58 minutes of meticulously crafted melodies and inspired, idiosyncratic arrangements. From the spine-tingling dynamics of opener Heart Set To Divide through and the simmering menace of Lacquer to the wildly evocative sorrow-scapes of City Glaciers and the exquisitely delicate Vanishers (featuring a guest vocal from Anni Bernhard, of Stockholm art rockers Full Of Keys) Katatonia\u2019s eleventh studio album is a showcase for a partnership that was magical from the very start. Recorded at three different studios, with vocals being recorded at Jonas\u2019 own home studio, and produced by the band themselves, City Burials is both a reaffirmation of musical values and a brave leap forward.\n\n\u201cWhenever me or Anders come up with something that is in the Katatonia frame, it\u2019s always going to end up sounding like Katatonia, even if it\u2019s a side-step or an unexpected musical turn \u2013 it will always end up sounding like something very natural,\u201d Jonas notes. \u201cI think it\u2019s because our relationship goes back many, many years and we\u2019ve known each other for such a long time. We\u2019ve collaborate musically since we were kids, basically. So we know exactly what to expect from the other person, and we know what to add to each other\u2019s ideas to make them even better. We totally trust each other.\u201d\n\nBeyond their core creative duo, Katatonia are very much a full-blown band, and the chemistry between Jonas, Anders and their band mates \u2013 bassist Niklas Sandin, drummer Daniel Moilanen and most recent recruit, guitarist Roger \u00d6jersson \u2013 has never sounded more potent. As Jonas points out, City Burials is the first album Katatonia have made since \u00d6jersson became a full-time member, and his contributions have been extremely significant.\n\n\u201cRoger started playing with us right after the previous album was mixed. He actually did a couple of solos on that album but everything else was already recorded when he joined the band. So it means he\u2019s been with us for about four years and this was the first album he actually played on. It was really nice to have a full band with two guitar players again, and also having his expertise in the studio, because he\u2019s a really good guitar player.\u201d\n\nInspired by an injection of fresh blood into Katatonia\u2019s creative brew, City Burials is an album that sees the band reclaim part of their heavy metal roots, via several moments of exuberant, old school classicism, deftly woven into these new songs\u2019 kaleidoscopic fabric. Although songs like Behind The Blood and Rein are as heart-rending and immersive as any in Katatonia\u2019s illustrious catalogue, it is both a surprise and a thrill to hear the band throwing caution to the wind and kicking some serious ass, albeit in moderation...\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a little bit unexpected for us to do that, but it\u2019s something that we wanted to play around with a little bit,\u201d Jonas grins. \u201cWe\u2019re not the youngest guys anymore and we all grew up with heavy metal music. On the last tour we did, we played a Judas Priest cover every night, Night Comes Down, and it was so fun to do it, we thought that maybe we should have some \u201880s heavy metal stuff thrown into our music for the hell of it and see how it works out. I think it works really well. it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll probably enjoy doing live, that kind of riffing and the solos. It\u2019ll be fun to take that to the stage.\u201d\n\nThe music on City Burials may boast some of Katatonia\u2019s most direct and explosive moments to date, but these songs dwell firmly in the band\u2019s perennially enigmatic and ill-defined conceptual world, wherein the power of emotions \u2013 of loss, of love, of sadness and joy \u2013 are always too overwhelming for specifics or prosaic declarations. Instead, the thematic red line that runs from Heart Set To Divide through to Untrodden speaks of the intensity of fragile emotions unsettled by the passing of time.\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re both from Stockholm, we grew up here and we explored it when we were younger,\u201d Jonas explains. \u201cWe don\u2019t know all of it but certain parts of this town are very well known to us. I was thinking about it once when I was walking through where I used to live when I was a kid, and I started thinking that I had so many memories from certain streets or even specific houses in this particular part of town, and I thought that everything that\u2019s a memory now feels somehow buried. Every memory is a loss, in a way, because it\u2019s something you can\u2019t grab anymore. We\u2019re reaching that age where the end of life is within our reach, so maybe you start thinking about the things you\u2019ve seen and experienced.\u201d\n\nAs Jonas notes with a wry chuckle, City Burials is \u201cnot a comeback!\u201d Katatonia simply took a breather and subsequently realised that their shared urge to make extraordinary music had, if anything, intensified over the years. The result is an album that looks certain to push the band ever further into the spotlight. With grand plans for extensive touring around the world in support of their latest and perhaps greatest album, Katatonia are wringing fresh hope from life\u2019s gloom-sodden tapestry. And it sounds incredible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited to present this album to the world,\u201d Jonas concludes. \u201cI guess people from our generation are still waiting for great albums, they still have the attention span for it. But even with my own kids, it\u2019s very different these days. They just listen to the same songs over and over again. The album as a concept is unknown to them. But you have to respect that as well. We can\u2019t change that. But hopefully if people hear a song on this album and they like it, they might try a few more!\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Porter Robinson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10023632.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Electronic, Electro House", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "A.G.

Leading a wave of new skool D+B talent from Europe with his blend of uplifting, melancholic melodies and heavy dancefloor bass + beats, Netsky\u2019s popularity is astounding. A celebrity in his own country, he has received numerous awards and accolades and continues to impress audiences across the world with his Netsky LIVE! show with full band. Netsky signed exclusively to Hospital in late 2009; his first release was the iconic \u201cMemory Lane\u201d (as featured on \u201cSick Music 2\u2033 in 2010) and this was swiftly followed up by his chart topping debut album \u2013 \u201cNetsky\u201d\u2013 in May of the same year. Following virtually unanimous praise and hype from all corners of the globe, it plunged Netsky firmly into the limelight, where he has remained ever since, delivering a potent mix of dancefloor anthems, vocal led classics and that clean cut new jungle sound which has become his trademark. Since then, Netsky\u2019s profile as a remixer has been affirmed by his huge remixes of ubiquitous club anthems such as Pendulum \u2013 \u201cWitchcraft\u201d, Plan B, Leftfield \u2013 \u201cRelease The Pressure\u201d, Audio Bullies \u2013 \u201cOnly Man\u201d, Swedish House Mafia \u2013 \u201cOne\u201d, Jessie J \u2013 \u201cNobody\u2019s Perfect\u201d and Rusko \u2013 \u201cEveryday\u201d and more. Alongside all this, is Netsky\u2019s hectic DJ schedule and he seems to have a Midas touch, able to transform even the most subdued of parties into an ecstatic, bouncing rave within a matter of minutes. It is no coincidence that he was nominated for the Radio One \u2018Essential Mix Of The Year\u2019 in 2010. In April 2012, Netsky unveiled the incredibly impressive Netsky LIVE! show at Hospitality Brixton \u2013 a full live show with a band which he continues to tour the world with, having completed tours of the USA, Australia, New Zealand and Europe. The highly anticipated sophomore album \u201c2\u201d landed late in June 2012 and immediately hit the UK Top 30 and No. 1 in his home country of Belgium, later going on to reach platinum sales. 2013 has seen the ascension of Netsky LIVE! to even greater heights, with a highlight being the sell-out stadium show at the Lotto Arena in April. One thing\u2019s for sure, 2013 is looking to be another golden year for Belgium\u2019s premium D+B export. http://netskymusic.com http://twitter.com/netskymusic http://soundcloud.com/netsky http://instagram.com/netskyofficial", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Berendmuziek ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10352838.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Country, Pop, Rock", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "De 25-jarige Berend Riemersma, afkomstig uit Jirnsum, is in het dagelijks leven werkzaam in de buitenschoolse opvang maar zijn passie ligt bij de muziek.\n\n\n\nEind 2015 is Berend begonnen met het schrijven van eigen liedjes en om zich hier meer in te verdiepen heeft hij de hulp ingeroepen van Sytse Broersma van De Kast.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rony Rex ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10370838.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Bass, Electronic, House", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "As a self-described unicorn breeder and club counselor, Rony Rex has come up the old school way by proving himself to be a vital DJ talent, headlining major festivals and clubs in his native country Finland before even producing a tune.

Answering someone\u2019s questions about who you are has always seemed a strange way to approach the task of telling others about yourself and your life\u2019s mission. Because who knows you better than you do?\n\nIn order to alleviate that emotion of seeming vanity, I decided to take on the job myself.\n\nI was raised by people who found life hard and wonderful at the same time. A farm in central Kentucky is what I call my homeland. The tender shoots that sprang from my grandfather\u2019s carefully plowed rows were lessons about life. Planting, reaping, seedtime, and harvest, these are the bases of all of our existence, really. We planted each spring to make sure we survived the winter\u2019s dark days. Spiritually we are nothing if we are not farmers planting seeds for the Master\u2019s great wedding day harvest.\n\nWe celebrated the rain after weeks of drought, always decidedly giving glory to God for His provision.\n\nWe fed and housed ornery old Angus and Herford cows as if they were better than we were. We sweated through the heat of tobacco season and we prayed before every meal. We were fed on the baby food of \u201cevery good gift comes from the Father.\u201d As we matured, we graduated to the meat of \u201cthough He slay me, yet, I will praise Him.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, no one has ever asked me how I came to follow Jesus. Of course my parents and grandparents held my feet to each precept of Christianity, but just because that is so does not mean salvation for me. Actually, I was wooed. For years, I sat and listened to the congregational songs, and their gospel plucked strings in my heart. It was not until I went to youth camp that it became clear that I had to take part in my Savior\u2019s death by repentance. After camp, I did just that. There was not a parade. There were no fireworks. There were no flaming tongues falling at the front pew where I knelt. It was just Mrs. Davenport and me kneeling there. She prayed the words first, and I repeated them. I have repeated them in some fashion every day since. \u201cLord, forgive me for I am a sinner.\u201d After words that heavy, God does the great and awesome remaking of a human heart. Nothing is ever the same then. Thank God for that.\n\nThough I did not come from a musically literate family, music has always been a part of me. Each week my mother cleaned the small Baptist church where we attended. My job was to vacuum the never-ending sea of sanctuary carpet. Mom allowed me to take a turntable from our home and listen to records as I swept. At the time, I only owned two LP\u2019s. One I got from a mail order ad of Keith Green. The record was sent on a \u201cjust send what you can\u201d basis from Keith\u2019s ministry. \u201cSo You Wanna Go Back to Egypt?\u201d was the title. Keith impacted my life by allowing me to pay for the recording with what I had, which was $2.50. Another LP landed in my pile of two from God only knows where. It was The Gaither Trio recording called \u201cWe Are Persuaded.\u201d I would listen to that music for hours, and would often look at Gloria\u2019s smile. I remember being envious of their happy faces and locked arms as they skipped down the sidewalk together. I understood that music then, but understand it even more deeply now. \u201cBecause He Lives\u201d was on that recording. I swept, dusted, picked up discarded bulletins, and sang, \u201cI know who holds the future, and life is worth the living just because He lives.\u201d\n\nLast weekend I got off the Gaither\u2019s bus at the arena. I walked along side of Bill into the auditorium. He seemed to be skipping, and so I skipped along beside him. He stuck a microphone in my face on the last verse of Because He Lives and I sang as fine as I could sing. I think my arm made an involuntary sweeping motion.\n\nPlanting and reaping. Jesus planted in me. And still today, He is reaping what He has sown. Like Jesus, I am also a planter now. I plant the strange supernatural seeds of faith, love, mercy, forgiveness, trust, and joy\u2026 and I do it for the child who vacuums the auditoriums of life.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Rock ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8030110.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Blues, Rock", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Rock (born Dwayne Johnson on May 2, 1972) is a professional wrestler turned actor.

Bergson doesn't do predictable, but there's a visible thread of blues awareness running through the fabric of everything he writes, sings and plays: he is a concise and subtle guitarist and tough, grainy singer.\" The Blues Magazine (UK)\n\nWith MOJO Magazine's #1 Blues Album of 2008, Fall Changes, #2 Blues Album of 2011, Imitate the Sun, #3 Blues Album of 2014, Live at Jazz Standard and #3 Blues Album of 2017, Bitter Midnight , New York guitarist/singer Chris Bergson has established himself as \"one of the most inventive songwriters in modern blues music\" (All Music Guide), creating his own blend of blues, roots and soul. Chris Bergson has performed and/or shared the stage with Hubert Sumlin, Levon Helm, B.B. King, Norah Jones, John Hammond, Etta James, and Bettye LaVette, to name just a few.\n\n2014 CD RELEASE: LIVE AT JAZZ STANDARD\nLABEL: 2 SHIRTS / INNSBRUCK RECORDS MEDIA\n\nLive at Jazz Standard, the latest CD release from the Chris Bergson Band, was recorded live over two nights at NYC's Jazz Standard with Bergson's usual four-piece band (organ/wurlitzer, bass and drums) \"augmented with a horn section expert in the snap and crackle of bluesy soul.\" (The Blues Magazine UK) The fifteen song CD contains eight brand new original songs from New York guitarist/singer Chris Bergson \"...one of the most inventive songwriters in modern blues music.\" (All Music Guide) as well as new arrangements of five older originals from the band's back catalog. According to iTunes Editors' Notes:\n\n\"A fair number of hot shot guitarists can lay down licks with presence and panache, but that number shrinks drastically when you tally the ones who are also sharp-shooting singer/songwriters. That\u00eds what makes Chris Bergson an unusual triple threat and this live recording shines a spotlight on the strength of his material as well as the alternately simmering and fiery feel that he and his band serve up in a club setting. New York City native Chris Bergson is a bluesman of a distinctly urban stripe. Instead of swamps and rivers, his songs - many penned in collaboration with lyricist Kate Ross - are full of citified imagery from the midtown Manhattan locale of \"61st & 1st\" to the Brooklyn scenes of \"Gowanus Heights.\" The three-man horn section accentuates the soul leanings of tunes like \"The Only One\" and brings out the R&B shadings in Bergson's gritty growl. At times, the blend of Bergson's earthy vocals and terse, biting guitar with Craig Dreyer's organ evokes The Band. Yet whether the guitarist and his group are venturing into R&B, roots rock or straight blues, they create an invitingly organic feel on a recording that clearly captures the band in their element.\"\n\nSpecial guests include soul singer Ellis Hooks and a three piece horn section featuring baritone saxophonist Ian Hendrickson-Smith (Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings), tenor saxophonist David Luther (Bettye LaVette) and Grammy Award-winning trumpeter Freddie Hendrix performing horn arrangements by Jay Collins (Gregg Allman).\n\nJazz Standard has been a musical home for the Chris Bergson Band for the past ten years and provided an ideal venue for their first live record. The album was recorded and co-produced by award-winning producer/engineer Roman Klun whose credits include albums by the Spin Doctors, Joan Osborne and the Holmes Brothers.\n\nBergson has had the opportunity to play with two masters of American music - drummer/singer Levon Helm of The Band and Howlin' Wolf's guitarist Hubert Sumlin - and their influence can be heard throughout the album.\n\nNotable past performances include:\nMoulin Blues (Holland), Groningen Rhythm and Blues Night (Holland), Blues Open (Holland), Noct en Blues (Chaumont, France), Blues in Hell (Norway), Harvest Time Blues (Ireland), Leicester Blues Festival (UK), Waterfront Blues Festival (Portland, OR), Saratoga Jazz Festival (NY), Levon Helm's Midnight Rambles (Woodstock, NY), River to River Festival (NYC), Joe\u2019s Pub (NYC), The Blue Note (NYC), Jazz Standard (NYC), John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (DC), SXSW, and opening for B.B. King at B.B. King's Blues Club (NYC).\n\nBorn in New York City but raised in Somerville, Massachusetts, Chris Bergson returned to Manhattan in\n1995. While backing jazz singers Annie Ross, Dena DeRose, Sasha Dobson and Norah Jones, he released\nBlues for Some Friends of Mine and Wait for Spring on Juniper Records in 1997 and 2000,\nrespectively. In 2002 Bergson was appointed a Jazz Ambassador of the USA by the John F. Kennedy\nCenter for the Performing Arts and he toured Africa with his trio. Evolving to further embrace the blues\nwhile also adding pop influences, he followed up with Blues (2003), Another Day (2005) and his\ntriumphant artistic breakthrough, the widely acclaimed Fall Changes (2007) -- MOJO\u2019s #1 Blues Album\nof 2008 -- that established him as an eloquent, evocative and lyrical songwriter with a sharp urban vision.\nRecorded at Levon Helm\u2019s Woodstock studio, it led to Bergson being personally invited to perform at the\nfamed drummer\u2019s Midnight Rambles while opening the way for more stateside festivals and subsequent\ntours of Europe.\n\nClick here to read Kay Cordtz's in-depth profile of Chris Bergson in ROLL Magazine:\nwww.rollmagazine.com\n\nChris Bergson currently serves on the faculty of NYC's 92Y where he teaches Rock, Blues and Jazz guitar and is the music mentor for the Recanati-Kaplan Scholarship Program.\n\nBergson endorses McCurdy Guitars and Levy's Leathers Gig Bags.\n\nSelected Press\n\n\"Gut-busting, horn-bedecked NY blues...

Over three albums and countless tours, the five British Columbians have developed their signature sound by taking inspiration from the mountains they hail from and the people who inhabit them. Shred Kelly has seamlessly fused traditional instrumentation with modern rock, presenting a sound that is both unique and compelling. Shred Kelly has produced their most ambitious project yet with their fourth album Archipelago.

The result is a dynamic and cohesive collection of dreamy, yet explosively exciting songs dipped in themes of relationships and the world in the modern age. Using traditional instrumentation at the base of the songwriting, the album explodes into a symphony of sounds incorporating banjos, ukuleles, synthesizers, guitar hooks, harmonies and pulsing beats.

Originally expressing his talent via visual art, Levi took an early interest in painting, which he studied at college in St. Petersburg, FL. It was in St. Pete that Levi\u2019s musical talents first revealed themselves. At the close of a significant relationship, he was drawn to writing songs \u2013 songs of his life and relationships. It wasn\u2019t long before Levi realized his need to move back home to cultivate his songwriting craft; so back to Nashville he went. Levi began to make his imprint on the Nashville community through regular co-writes with his father, Marcus Hummon (Grammy Award winning songwriter), and a regular rotation of writers who would join them. Levi loved relating to a listener through the stories he could craft. It wasn\u2019t long before word spread of Levi\u2019s talents, and he found himself writing with the greats such as 2014 ACM Songwriter of the Year Shane MacAnally, Andrew Dorff, Josh Osborne, Jonathan Singleton, Nathan Barlowe Brandy Clark, Trevor Rosen among others, and of course, Marcus Hummon. Learning to always bring in his own ideas and point of view to a writing session, Levi quickly streamlined his unique style. \u201cYou\u2019re letting someone into your world which is really vulnerable,\u201d says Levi. \u201cI write from a reflective & personal place and ultimately I couldn\u2019t see anyone else singing these songs.\u201d As a member of a multi-generational music family, Levi Hummon certainly appreciates his roots. While Levi is very much his own person & artist, he strongly values giving credit where it is due \u2013 and he finds himself fortunate to have his family be part of his journey. In addition to his father\u2019s musical foundation, Levi draws inspiration from his mother, Becca Stevens, who founded the socially conscious & philanthropic organization, Thistle Farms (a residential program and social enterprise made up of women who have survived prostitution, trafficking, and addiction). This became a natural place for Levi to become involved where he further witnessed how music can provide a healing effect to those whom have suffered tremendously. \u201cThistle farms has always been a family to me,\u201d says Levi. \u201cThere is so much knowledge to gain from spending time with the women. It makes me want to always forgive, never take anything for granted, and love everyone.\u201d Continuing to develop his personal sound, Levi found himself in great company while in Nashville. Marcus and Becca casually had their friend and Hall of Fame Songwriter, Desmond Child over for dinner, where Levi played a few songs. Desmond\u2019s reaction was profound and immediate \u2013 he insisted on working with Levi. Soon after, Levi\u2019s tune \u201cMake it Love,\u201d was featured in Child\u2019s film, Two: The Story of Roman & Nero, which appeared on the short list of nominations for the Oscar\u2019s \u201cBest Original Song\u201d. That was just the beginning for Levi. With overwhelming support from Nashville\u2019s music community, Levi signed with Fletcher Foster\u2019s new management and entertainment company, Iconic Entertainment Group. Levi has recently signed with The Valory Music Co (Big Machine Record Label) artist roster, which includes Reba, Justin Moore, Brantley Gilbert, Thomas Rhett, The Mavericks & RaeLynn. \u201cAs our Country format ebbs and flows, it\u2019s always so important from an A&R perspective to look past what\u2019s happening now and make some moves on the future direction,\u201d said BMLG President & CEO Scott Borchetta. \u201cLevi\u2019s unique vision and incredible artistry is exactly the kind of musical move we want to make now.

The critically acclaimed HYMN World tour began in South America in September 2018 and will include over 125 shows, on 5 continents throughout 2020.\n\nOn November 15th, 2019, Sarah released her much anticipated \u201cHYMN In Concert\u201d film on DVD, Blu Ray, and Deluxe Special Editions (DVD/CD and Blu Ray/CD). \u201cHYMN: Sarah Brightman In Concert\u201d was captured from the Festspielhaus in the enchanted Bavarian Alps. Conceived and created by Sarah Brightman, Anthony Van Laast (\u201cMamma Mia\u201d, \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d), and Frank Peterson, the two-act performance is a hybrid of a musical film and a large-scale concert production.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Felix Jaehn ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9149522.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Melodic House", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u2192 Instagram: instagram.com/felixjaehn\n\u2192 Facebook: facebook.com/FelixJaehnMusic\n\u2192 Twitter: twitter.com/felixjaehn\n\u2192 Spotify Playlist: open.spotify.com/user/felixjaehn\n\u2192 Artist website: http://felix-jaehn.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "My Kid Brother ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://fearlessathome.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "As It Is ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8729540.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Pop-rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "we live in the great depression", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "backinhumanform ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10309400.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Indie Rock, Folk Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "backinhumanform is Joe Clarke.

That's been the case every time August Burns Red record an album, and it's quietly turned the Pennsylvania quintet-John \"JB\" Brubaker [lead guitar], Brent Rambler [rhythm guitar], Matt Greiner [drums], Jake Luhrs [lead vocals], and Dustin Davidson [bass]-into a two-time GRAMMY\u00ae Award-nominated heavy music torchbearer. Their journey began back in 2003 with marathon jam sessions on a farm belonging to Greiner\u2019s family in the egg refrigerator. Embracing a diehard Rust Belt work ethic, they tirelessly pushed towards the top of heavy music with a series of critically acclaimed albums and countless gigs. A hard-earned high watermark, 2015's Found In Far Away Places marked their second consecutive Top 10 debut on the Billboard Top 200. The single \"Identity\" notched a GRAMMY\u00ae Award nod in the category of \"Best Metal Performance.\" A streaming juggernaut, both \"Identity\" and \"Ghosts\" [feat. Jeremy McKinnon] crossed the 3-million mark on Spotify. When it came time to record their eighth full-length Phantom Anthem [Fearless Records] with longtime producers Carson Slovak and Grant McFarland, the game didn't change. The musicians put their heads down and rallied around the same shared goal, uncorking a barrage of infectious intensity, the boys augmented and amplified the touchstones of their signature style on Phantom Anthem. The musical equivalent of a clenched fist haymaker, the grooves hit harder, the hooks blaze brighter, and the instrumentation ignites even more intricacy.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Christina Martin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10321693.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Pop, Roots Rock, Singer Songwriter, Americana", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Christina Martin is a multi-award winning Canadian singer-songwriter whose style has been described as an effortless union between Americana and Rock. \u201cWith her vivacious personality, brightly sparkling voice and unerring love of hooky choruses and peppy rhythms, Christina Martin should\u2019ve easily slid into the cool waters of modern pop\u2014if only pop hadn\u2019t become a pimp for our shallowest tastes and sentiments.\u201d (Edmonton\u2019s Vue Weekly).\n\nRaised on Canada\u2019s East Coast, Martin moved to Austin, Texas in the summer of 1999. In the fall of \u201999 she moved to Salzgitter, Germany where she collaborated on a commercial pop project, marking her first experience singing in a professional studio. In May 2000 she returned to Austin to explore performing and song writing. Following her role as supporting vocalist and dancer for the Austin high-energy rock band Young Heart Attack in 2001, Martin launched her solo career in 2002 with an opening slot for Wilco and her debut album Pretty Things. Shortly after the album\u2019s release, she moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia and had her first commercial success when two of her songs were placed in the award-winning British-Canadian two-part drama Sex Traffic (2004) and in the TV drama series Snakes and Ladders (2004).\n\nWith her second album, Two Hearts (2008), Martin gained considerable attention as a hot up-and-coming artist with several East Coast Music Awards and Nominations. Her Two Hearts music video rose to #5 on the Much More Music Countdown, leading to tours across Canada, the US and Ireland. She performed high-profile shows with Canadian rock icon Matt Mays and sang on Parliament Hill in Ottawa for The Queen of England. You Come Home was placed in the internationally distributed teen drama series The Best Years (2010). Two Hearts won Martin two 2008 Music Nova Scotia Awards, and a 2009 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\nHer third album I Can Too (2010) received rave reviews and includes a collaboration with Blue Rodeo\u2019s Greg Keelor on her rendering of Andrew Sisk\u2019s Subject To Change. \u201cWhat sets I Can Too apart is Martin\u2019s commitment to honestly exploring complicated relationships.\u201d (Exclaim Magazine, October 2010). Following multiple East Coast Music Award Nominations and extensive touring across Canada with Juno nominated indie rock band Cuff The Duke, Martin began touring independently in Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nIn 2011 Martin worked on building her label Come Undone Records, and focused on developing a global online presence with fans via community-based projects. She worked with PledgeMusic.com to release A House Concert (2011) containing fourteen live acoustic versions of songs from her first three studio albums. Martin was nominated at the 2011 Music Nova Scotia Awards for Digital Artist of the Year and A House Concert was nominated at the 2012 East Coast Music Awards for Folk Recording of the Year. This project also raised awareness and funds for the Canadian Mental Health Association. During 2011-2012 Christina continued her community development initiatives with a yearlong Artist in Residency through Geriatric Medicine Research (GMR) at Dalhousie University and The Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 2014 she released an EP titled Remember Me, featuring five songs inspired by and dedicated to individuals affected by dementia. Co-produced and written by Dale Murray, the EP won the 2014 Music Nova Scotia Award for Inspirational Recording of the Year.\n\nSleeping With A Stranger (2012), Martin\u02bcs fifth award-winning album, reflects the artist\u2019s coming of age lyrically and musically. \u201cIt\u02bcs one of those rare albums where you have to listen to it all in one sitting. Like a good book that\u2019s hard to put down, Sleeping With A Stranger tickles the ears and within three bars you\u2019re completely hooked.\u201d (Americana UK, October 2012). The album won her the 2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Recording of the Year Award. It was nominated for three East Coast Music Awards Come Undone Records was nominated for Music Nova Scotia Company of the Year. What I Always Knew was placed in the CBC television drama Heartland and her single Falling For You remained on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 countdown for five months.\n\nMartin returned home from Europe in the spring of 2014, following eighty concert dates which included a performance at Rolling Stone Weekender Festival, a publicity partnership with PopUp Records in Hamburg, and an endorsement from the esteemed Duesenberg Custom Guitar Shop in Hannover, Germany. She secured relationships for her future from her home base as Artist in Residence in the city of Dachau, Germany.\n\nIt\u2019ll Be Alright (2015) found Christina attaining what her music has always suggested, a place where the ghosts of her musical heroes freely mingle with the architecture of modern music. Working closely with her long-time producer and guitarist Dale Murray, drummer Brian Murray and bassist Jason Vautour, Martin made a conscious effort to confound the expectations of those who have categorized her in the past. This record utilizes far more sonic textures, allowing Martin to explore the many sides of her musical personality. The album won a 2016 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year and her It\u2019ll Be Alright single rose to #6 on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 chart. You Ran From Me was voted the #14 most played Canadian song on Sonica for 2015, and Somewhere With You was placed in the CBC Television show Heartland.\n\nFollowing two years of touring across Germany, Poland, The Netherlands, The UK, Switzerland, Austria, France and Canada, Martin returned home briefly in 2016 to write her newest album. A fervent anthem for those who are lost and longing, Lungs Are Burning was the first single from her album Impossible To Hold (Released March 23, 2018). The first single was triggered by the rising Fentanyl drug crisis killing thousands of Canadians, with Christina\u2019s lyrics set to music by her and Dale Murray. With lyrics like \u201cwhile I\u2019m watching the babies\u201d and \u201cgot to go out and get some, baby\u201d, Martin captures the desperation of \u201cchasing the dream\u201d and the horror of living it. Murray\u2019s stately production brings that stark reality home with a bite. Martin: \u201cThe song is an modest attempt to bring light to the heavy topic of addiction, and reflects my own personal sense of loss, longing and a deep void, and the ache I feel from losing my brother and friends to addiction and mental illness.\u201d For her Canadian tour dates, Christina has partnered with Center for Addiction and Mental Health to increase engagement and awareness.\n\n\u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is Martin\u2019s sixth and strongest studio album, achieving a perfect balance between organic ambience and impeccable production. \u201cI\u2019m writing about faith and love more than ever with songs like \u2018Keep Me Calm\u2019 and \u2018Always Reminding\u2019, but I haven\u2019t shaken the need to write about the darker things that are part of our human journey\u201d. Combining good taste, passionate singing and thoughtful lyrics, \u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is where music and poetry meet. The album won the 2018 Music Nova Scotia Award for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\n\nAWARDS\n\n2018 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Impossible To Hold)\n2016 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (It\u2019ll Be Alright)\n2014 Music Nova Scotia Inspirational Recording of the Year (Remember Me \u2013 EP)\n2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Sleeping With A Stranger)\n2009 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n\nARTIST IN RESIDENCIES COMPLETED\n\n2013-2015 Dachau, Germany\n\n2010-2011 Halifax NS, Canada \u2013 Dalhousie Geriatric Medical Research & Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN)\n\nFESTIVALS/CONFERENCES\n\n2019 Ottawa Blues Fest - Ottawa ON, Canada\n2019 Area506 - Saint John NB, Canada\n2018 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto, Canada\n2017 Sonder Fest \u2013 Manchester, United Kingdom\n2016 Reeperbahn Festival \u2013 Hamburg, Germany\n2016 Rising Tide Festival @ Fundy National Park- Alma NB, Canada\n2016 Harmony Bazaar Festival \u2013 Lockeport NS, Canada\n2016 Maverick Festival \u2013 Suffolk, United Kingdom\n2013 Rolling Stone Weekender Festival \u2013 Weissenh\u00e4user Strand, Germany\n2011 Winter Olympics @ Atlantic Canada House \u2013 Vancouver BC, Canada\n2011 Canada Games \u2013 Halifax NS, Canada\n2011 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2010 Belfast Nashville Songwriters Festival \u2013 Belfast, Ireland\n2009 Folk Alliance \u2013 Memphis TN, USA\n2009 North By North East \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2009 Stan Rogers Festival \u2013 Canso NS, Canada\n2002 SXSW - Austin TX, USA", "otherInfo": "Join us for a Live Stream (on Facebook).\n\nChristina would have been performing at New Scotland Brewing in Dartmouth NS.

All enjoyed some humble acclaim and success one way or another. I acted for a time in the 90's as well (plays, television, movies). Good fun for sure, but my heart lies in music. After the Ted302 group disbanded in 1996, I headed to Europe with acoustic guitar in hand, as a solo performer, playing Ireland to the Czech Republic. My collection of original material from that period is found on my CD \"Go It Alone\".\n\nUpon returning home from the Czech Republic, I founded a Beatles Tribute group called The Sun Kings (2000 - present). I now get to be the voice of John Lennon in a successful tribute band (no caricature or dress up for us - just music). Talk about a coming around full circle! I also have a solo acoustic show called \"In The Spirit of Lennon\" and still another full band called \"Plastic Fauxno Band\".

The group -- which is composed of vocalist Briton Bond, guitarist/vocalist Cody Quistad, guitarist Seth Blake, bassist Chris Gaylord and drummer Stephen Kluesener -- formed in Ocala, Florida, in 2013 and instantly started playing all over the area, quickly getting signed to Fearless Records the old fashioned way: By sending a song to the label. From there the group linked up with the production team of Andrew Wade (Neck Deep, Motionless In White) and A Day To Remember vocalist Jeremy McKinnon who produced their 2015 debut Blueprints together and returned to produce the sophomore full-length Deadweight, which the band started writing immediately after they finished their debut. \"I'm very proud of Blueprints but a lot of those songs were written seven years ago so who we are as people and musicians these days is drastically different,\" Quistad explains -- and a listen to Deadweight confirms that statement. \"I think a big strength of this new record is the continuity of sitting in a room together and playing instead of trying to send files back and forth,\" he continues. \"We were truly grinding out songs and I think this album still sounds like Wage War but at the same it has some of our most melodic moments as well as some of the heaviest.\" The latter is evidenced on songs like \"Stitch\" which is certain to incite frenzied mosh pits for years to come and displays an aggression that the band have only hinted at in the past. \"We really tried to not overthink things on this record and just do whatever worked for the song, even if it was something that people might not necessarily expect,\" Quistad says. For this reason the band decided it made sense to enlist the aforementioned producers who truly understood Wage War on a deep level. \"There were so many early mornings and late nights making this record and it was such a pleasure to work with Andrew and Jeremy again because you could tell that they really cared about it and would go to any ends to make it the best that it could be.\" From the explosive production to the alternately screamed and sung vocals of \"Don't Let Me Fade Away,\" all seven of the people involved in the making of TBA worked as one unit in working toward the same collective goal. Lyrically, Deadweight sees the band exploring both personal to political issues in a way that's as raw and honest as the music that supports them. \"This record is very much a snapshot of the past year; we are all very positive people but in 2016 we went through so much from seeing the world for the first time to scraping the bottom at some point emotionally or with relationships,\" Quistad admits. From 3 a.m. run-ins with refugees in Europe to flying home only to be confronted with the aftermath of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, there was no shortage of content to draw from this time around. \"We didn't hold anything back when it came to this record, so hopefully it's as therapeutic for listeners as it was for us.\" In a heavy music scene that's increasingly formulaic, Wage War pride themselves on the fact that they listen to a diverse range of music. \"I'm a big fan of country music which surprises a lot of people and other guitarist Seth is really into pop music,\" Quistad explains. \"We have an appreciation for all kinds of stuff and I think that all of it bleeds into the album in some way even if it's not always blatant.\" Take the song \"Johnny Cash\" which recalls the country tradition of paying homage to a pioneer of a genre while still retaining the heaviness of the act. \"We get called metalcore a lot but we've never pledged allegiance to any genre because we always want to do something beyond that in the sense that we just listen to what we love and try to incorporate that into Wage War.\" More than anything though, the band can't wait to get back on the road and start playing the songs from Deadweight live. \"We played three hometown shows at the end of last year where we would include a new song and it was so cool to see the crowd react to the new material,\" Quistad says \u2013 and it's obvious that palpable excitement goes both ways. \"This album is the truest representation of Wage War in the sense that we wanted to put every part of us under the microscope and come up with something that we're not only proud of but also encompasses what we want to be as a band and the kind of musical statement we want to lay down,\" he summarizes. \"I would say this is a defining album for our band.\" Second album Deadweight featuring 'Witness' available now on Fearless Records.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Michael League, producer for David Crosby, Susana Baca, Bokant\u00e9, and all 13 Snarky Puppy albums, walks (quickly) through each step of the production process from start to finish, taking a simple idea from an iPhone voice note and showing its progression all the way to the final master.

But singer-guitarist Art Alexakis isn\u2019t about to start phoning it in now.\n\nAlthough the band hasn\u2019t released a new studio album since 2015\u2019s triumphant Black Is The New Black, Everclear continues to tour actively, in conjunction with a series of past-release anniversary dates and the annual Summerland Tour, which Alexakis created and has been running since 2012, featuring a rotating cast of \u201990s alt rock favorites. And while it\u2019s a virtual surety that no Everclear gig is complete without a rendition of \u201cSanta Monica\u201d and \u201cFather of Mine,\u201d lately the band has found that exploring the full range of past material\u2014especially the \u201cdeep cuts\u201d\u2014not only gives fans a rare treat, it also injects new life into the band\u2019s live dynamic.\n\n\u201cBy mixing it up and digging into the catalogue, it still makes it fun and relevant for us, and I think for the fans as well,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cIt\u2019s still important to play the hits, but by playing those other songs as well, it makes it all seem more vibrant and real. Even though I recorded some of those songs 20 years ago, I haven\u2019t played them in a long time, so it\u2019s like reinventing the wheel. I\u2019m having more fun now than I have in years. I think all of us are.\u201d\n\nFormed by Alexakis in 1991 in Portland, Oregon, Everclear has enjoyed a lengthy career spanning 11 studio releases, numerous videos, thousands of shows and accolades that include a 1998 Grammy nomination. Like a true survivor, Alexakis has soldiered on through multiple lineup changes over the years: During the \u201cclassic\u201d era, the band also included Craig Montoya on Bass and Greg Eklund on drums; the current touring lineup features longtime members Dave French (guitar) and Freddy Herrera (bass), as well as drummer Brian Nolan (also with American Hi-Fi), who has performed with Everclear on multiple past tours.\n\nThis incarnation of the band will hit the road for the 2018 Summerland Tour. As in prior years, Everclear will headline the latest installment of the festival, this time supported by Marcy Playground and Local H, and also featuring a special DJ set Alexakis will contribute, which honors the \u201990s in a refreshingly old-school way.\n\n\u201cThe Summerland Tours are all unique; they all have a different kind of feel to them,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cI think this year will be really cool, because it\u2019s usually guitar-based, but Marcy Playground is more acoustic-based, yet they still rock in their own way. Local H is just two guys, meanwhile, and they\u2019re great, too. So, it\u2019s just a different look at \u201990s alternative this year\u2026different facets of what it\u2019s about. With Everclear, we\u2019re going to play the hits we always play, but we\u2019re also going to mix it up. Every night will be a little different; there\u2019ll be a few surprises every show.\u201d\n\nFor Alexakis and Co., it\u2019s a continuation of a hectic couple of years. Everclear spent May and June of 2017 touring in honor of the 20th anniversary of So Much For The Afterglow, the band\u2019s massively successful sophomore major-label release. The 40-date run was an incredibly emotional and personally satisfying experience for Alexakis, who was able to perform obscure cuts from that time period for the first time in many years. Connecting with fans in that setting also reinforced the lasting impression the album has made.\n\n\u201cThe tour was phenomenal. It left me and the band stunned at how important that record was to so many people, and to be a part of that, both then and now,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cThe legacy of it is still vibrant for so many people. It was great just watching people react when we were playing not just the hits, but deeper songs on that record. I always liked the deeper songs\u2014they were usually my favorite songs\u2014and when the band would play those, it would be really exciting and important for me. That was fun, seeing that reaction, and just talking to people after the show.\u201d\n\nPrior to that, Everclear experienced a career resurgence thanks to 2015\u2019s Black Is The New Black, which not only proved the band could still rock, but also that Everclear remains creatively relevant, decades after their platinum years. As is common for many artists these days, Black didn\u2019t set records for traditional album sales, but the release did see significant streaming activity and sparked a heightened social media presence, putting the group firmly back in the listening public\u2019s mind. The band continues to ride this latest wave of interest.\n\n\u201cI personally think [Black] is one of the best records Everclear has ever made,\u201d Alexakis says. \u201cIt sounds like both old Everclear and new Everclear: It has a contemporary production sound, but it\u2019s just old-school, angry rock songs. It\u2019s kind of dark, very reminiscent of the early stuff. The sales weren\u2019t great on it, but a lot of people streamed it. It got millions and millions of streams, so people were listening to it, and it resonated.\u201d\n\nBut when you\u2019ve been a prolific band for more than a quarter-century, it\u2019s all part of the journey. Right now, Alexakis is feeling a reflective pull for the 25th anniversary of World Of Noise, the band\u2019s indie debut, which was recorded for $400 in a friend\u2019s basement in Portland. Although no official commemorative tour dates are confirmed as of this writing, Alexakis says he\u2019s considering playing some smaller, select shows this year as a tribute to the release. Much of the material rarely sees the light of day, but the 1993 album continues to enjoy a special place in Everclear history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d just had a baby, I was on public assistance and was working part-time jobs, I was very frustrated and very angry and there were a lot of emotions going on,\u201d Alexakis reflects. \u201cI made that record for $400, because that\u2019s all I had. I got this guy who had a basement studio to give me 40 hours\u2019 worth of recording at $10 an hour. We had 10 or 11 songs, so we went in and recorded them in a week and mixed them, and that\u2019s the album.\u2026From there we just hit the ground running. I still haven\u2019t stopped.\u201d\n\nThat rough and raw first attempt was just the nexus of the massive body of work Everclear and Alexakis have contributed since that humble beginning. When it comes to recording new material, at the moment Alexakis is focused primarily on writing and recording his first solo album, due out later this year. That precludes a new Everclear release\u2026for now.\n\n\u201cWe might make another record in a couple years,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe later on this year I\u2019ll feel like it. I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n\nThat said, the band\u2019s live itinerary certainly makes up for its recent studio absence. As the group prepares for another Summerland run, as well as numerous other future dates, Alexakis is excited to revisit songs from fan favorite records like Afterglow, Sparkle and Fade and the double album Songs From The American Movie, but also compositions from more underrated collections, like 2012\u2019s Invisible Stars.\n\n\u201cThere are people asking for songs, so we\u2019ll just try and learn songs as we go,\u201d Alexakis says. \u201cIf we get a lot of response from people to play a certain song, we\u2019re going to learn it and go on the road and play it. You don\u2019t think, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t sing that high anymore.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to worry about it. We\u2019re going to play some rock n\u2019 roll, and just do it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jack Lukeman ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9181195.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Everything", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Cutting his teeth on the bohemian busking circuit around Europe Jack Lukeman first came to prominence in the summer of 1995 when he and The Black Romantics took up a residence at The Da Club (Dublin Arts Club) in Dublin. The band played mostly Jacques Brel songs, with one or two of Jack's own, and recorded the album Wax in 1995.\nHis first solo album, released in 1999, called Metropolis Blue was universally lauded and went platinum in Ireland. John Walshe of Hot Press magazine states \"Lukeman's voice is powerful and fluid. His range too is impressive, from the deep baritone resonance of 'When The Moon Is High' to the aching falsetto of the magnificent 'Rooftop Lullaby' ... this is a timeless collection of fine songs, beautifully delivered, from an artist as unique as Ireland has ever produced\".\nThis was followed in 2001 by the album Universe; Hotpress' John Walshe had the following to say, \"... it is as if his older albums were made in black and white and Universe has been recorded in glorious technicolour\".\n2006 saw the release of 'Broken Songs',with such classics as Open your borders, many quoted Broken Songs Jack's best album yet.\nIt was closely followed by 'Burn On' in 2008 featuring the songs of the great Randy Newman.

But singer-guitarist Art Alexakis isn\u2019t about to start phoning it in now.\n\nAlthough the band hasn\u2019t released a new studio album since 2015\u2019s triumphant Black Is The New Black, Everclear continues to tour actively, in conjunction with a series of past-release anniversary dates and the annual Summerland Tour, which Alexakis created and has been running since 2012, featuring a rotating cast of \u201990s alt rock favorites. And while it\u2019s a virtual surety that no Everclear gig is complete without a rendition of \u201cSanta Monica\u201d and \u201cFather of Mine,\u201d lately the band has found that exploring the full range of past material\u2014especially the \u201cdeep cuts\u201d\u2014not only gives fans a rare treat, it also injects new life into the band\u2019s live dynamic.\n\n\u201cBy mixing it up and digging into the catalogue, it still makes it fun and relevant for us, and I think for the fans as well,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cIt\u2019s still important to play the hits, but by playing those other songs as well, it makes it all seem more vibrant and real. Even though I recorded some of those songs 20 years ago, I haven\u2019t played them in a long time, so it\u2019s like reinventing the wheel. I\u2019m having more fun now than I have in years. I think all of us are.\u201d\n\nFormed by Alexakis in 1991 in Portland, Oregon, Everclear has enjoyed a lengthy career spanning 11 studio releases, numerous videos, thousands of shows and accolades that include a 1998 Grammy nomination. Like a true survivor, Alexakis has soldiered on through multiple lineup changes over the years: During the \u201cclassic\u201d era, the band also included Craig Montoya on Bass and Greg Eklund on drums; the current touring lineup features longtime members Dave French (guitar) and Freddy Herrera (bass), as well as drummer Brian Nolan (also with American Hi-Fi), who has performed with Everclear on multiple past tours.\n\nThis incarnation of the band will hit the road for the 2018 Summerland Tour. As in prior years, Everclear will headline the latest installment of the festival, this time supported by Marcy Playground and Local H, and also featuring a special DJ set Alexakis will contribute, which honors the \u201990s in a refreshingly old-school way.\n\n\u201cThe Summerland Tours are all unique; they all have a different kind of feel to them,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cI think this year will be really cool, because it\u2019s usually guitar-based, but Marcy Playground is more acoustic-based, yet they still rock in their own way. Local H is just two guys, meanwhile, and they\u2019re great, too. So, it\u2019s just a different look at \u201990s alternative this year\u2026different facets of what it\u2019s about. With Everclear, we\u2019re going to play the hits we always play, but we\u2019re also going to mix it up. Every night will be a little different; there\u2019ll be a few surprises every show.\u201d\n\nFor Alexakis and Co., it\u2019s a continuation of a hectic couple of years. Everclear spent May and June of 2017 touring in honor of the 20th anniversary of So Much For The Afterglow, the band\u2019s massively successful sophomore major-label release. The 40-date run was an incredibly emotional and personally satisfying experience for Alexakis, who was able to perform obscure cuts from that time period for the first time in many years. Connecting with fans in that setting also reinforced the lasting impression the album has made.\n\n\u201cThe tour was phenomenal. It left me and the band stunned at how important that record was to so many people, and to be a part of that, both then and now,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cThe legacy of it is still vibrant for so many people. It was great just watching people react when we were playing not just the hits, but deeper songs on that record. I always liked the deeper songs\u2014they were usually my favorite songs\u2014and when the band would play those, it would be really exciting and important for me. That was fun, seeing that reaction, and just talking to people after the show.\u201d\n\nPrior to that, Everclear experienced a career resurgence thanks to 2015\u2019s Black Is The New Black, which not only proved the band could still rock, but also that Everclear remains creatively relevant, decades after their platinum years. As is common for many artists these days, Black didn\u2019t set records for traditional album sales, but the release did see significant streaming activity and sparked a heightened social media presence, putting the group firmly back in the listening public\u2019s mind. The band continues to ride this latest wave of interest.\n\n\u201cI personally think [Black] is one of the best records Everclear has ever made,\u201d Alexakis says. \u201cIt sounds like both old Everclear and new Everclear: It has a contemporary production sound, but it\u2019s just old-school, angry rock songs. It\u2019s kind of dark, very reminiscent of the early stuff. The sales weren\u2019t great on it, but a lot of people streamed it. It got millions and millions of streams, so people were listening to it, and it resonated.\u201d\n\nBut when you\u2019ve been a prolific band for more than a quarter-century, it\u2019s all part of the journey. Right now, Alexakis is feeling a reflective pull for the 25th anniversary of World Of Noise, the band\u2019s indie debut, which was recorded for $400 in a friend\u2019s basement in Portland.

The band has headlined across the world and played major festivals, including the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Fest.\n\nYet along the way, All That Remains have taken flak from just about everybody: extreme metal purists who accused the group of selling out, rock fans that don\u2019t get the screamy stuff, liberals who object to Labonte\u2019s right-of-center lyrics and conservatives that can\u2019t understand the singer\u2019s non-violent, Libertarian ways. Labonte\u2019s response \u2013 bring it on!\n\nMadness, All That Remains\u2019 eighth album, is the band\u2019s most musically eclectic, provocative release to date \u2013 full of undeniable hooks, incisive riffs, electronic samples and a variety of vocal styles. And, of course, the range of subject matter addressed pushes the band\u2019s limits further than ever.\n\n\"I don't mind if I piss off if it gets them to think about things. People know that I have strong opinions and I disagree with things. That's my whole deal.\"\n\nAs contrary as he wants to be, Labonte still values quality over confrontation. Madness, produced by Grammy award winning Howard Benson (Halestorm, Papa Roach, Chris Cornell), is All That Remains at their best, offering a level of accessibility and diversity lacking from much of today\u2019s hard rock and metal. The first single and title track, \u201cMadness,\u201d is a microcosm for the rest of the album.\n\nThe song starts on an experimental note with a barrage of amp static and the buzzing of ungrounded electricity accompanied by a sharp, simple drum intro. A pause later, the whole band kicks into gear, blending a propulsive rhythm with a kinetic groove that swings like a rope ladder in a thunderstorm. As the vocals enter, the guitars drop out, replaced by a delicate keyboard melody and electronic beats. Then, after Labonte sings, \u201cWhy should we escape ourselves? We are who we are in the end,\u201d the tone shifts back in a heavier direction, leading to a monster chorus more infectious than influenza.\u201d In true Labonte style, the tune is neither a love song nor a euphoric anthem about rocking out. \u201cIt\u2019s about socialism,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the repetition of bad ideas.\u201d\n\nOther songs on Madness are far more variegated. The leadoff track \u201cSafe House,\u201d which is about a man who lures robbers into his home and then kills them, is the heaviest track All That Remains has written since they played melodic death metal in the first half of the aughts. Driven by barreling beats, thrashy guitars, a crushing breakdown and metalcore screaming, the track pulverizes even as haunting keyboards and clanging percussion offer a brief respite from the jackhammer pounding.\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cFar From Home,\u201d which shifts between ringing acoustic guitars and forlorn vocals about being lost and alone, and a euphoric rock passage that shows that there\u2019s always light in the darkness.\n\nThroughout Madness All That Remains revisits the dichotomy between savagery and sensitivity. \u201cTrust and Believe\u201d contrasts double-bass drums, chugging riffs and melodic guitar licks with soaring guitar melodies and an anthemic chant-along chorus and \u201cHalo\u201d opens with a speedy electronic passage that sounds like a violin on hyper drive, then develops into a blazing number that balances melodic vocals with pain stricken howls.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted this record to be different,\u201d Labonte says,\u201d explaining the inclusion of electronic samples and the dramatic juxtaposition between roaring chaos and accessible craftsmanship. \u201cWe wanted to really push ourselves and push the boundaries of what we\u2019re allowed to do. We\u2019ve always pushed that envelope, but we wanted to push it more.\u201d\n\nAll That Remains started working on Madness in the spring of 2016, then in April Labonte flew from his home in Western Massachusetts to Los Angeles to start working on vocal melodies and lyrics with Benson. It was the first time the band didn\u2019t have fleshed out riffs and fully written rhythms to serve as guideposts for the vocals. At first, the process was difficult and the band members were uncomfortable, but the more they worked on the record the more excited they became about the way the songs were coming out. For the first time in years, they felt genuinely challenged and inspired to learn new ways to create.\n\n\u201cMe, Mike and Oli are the primary writers and we\u2019ve always written songs on guitars because we\u2019re all guitar players,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cIt was a totally different way to write songs. And I feel like it was really, really cool to do that because it gave us a fresh perspective. I\u2019d bring Mike and Oli the vocals and they\u2019d use what I had come up with to construct the riffs instead of the other way around.\u201d\n\nThe most difficult song for Labonte to create was \u201cRivercity.\u201d The song begins with a ringing telephone and progresses through an electronic beat, a melancholy, ballad-like guitar line and plaintive vocals. The track changes in intensity numerous times and injects various rhythm shifts before ending like it began. When he was working on \u201cRivercity,\u201d Labonte\u2019s then-wife was deployed in the Middle East in the Marines and the singer was left helpless at home while she risked her life on the front lines.\n\nWhile the title \u201cRivercity\u201d sounds like an innocent enough name for a song \u2013 the kind of title John Mellencamp might use about childhood memories -- for Labonte the term was very real and frightening. \u201cRivercity stands for \u2018reduced communications,\u2019 he explains. \u201cMe and my ex would be on the phone and she\u2019d be like, \u201cYo, the base is getting mortared. I gotta go.\u2019 If someone dies, they shut off communications until they can notify the families of the people that die. So we\u2019d be talking and she would say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to rivercity and hang up, and I wouldn\u2019t talk to her for three or four days and I wouldn\u2019t know what happened. The base is getting mortared. She might have taken a round or died. Being on the other end of that is agonizing.\u201d\n\nIntegrating excruciating personal experiences, political rants and controversial commentary with music that\u2019s just as confrontational, Madness is an unapologetic showcase of honesty and ingenuity. Inducing gentle head-bobbing one moment and inciting teeth-clenching fist pounding the next, All That Remains have created about 50 minutes of attitude-laden rock music. Pick a song: \u201cOpen Grave,\u201d their version of Garth Brook\u2019s \u201cThe Thunder Rolls,\u201d \u201cBack at You, \u201cLouder.\u201d There\u2019s something there to surprise, antagonize or incentivize.\n\n\u201cIf you ask someone, \u2018Is this what you expected?\u2019 It\u2019s always a \u2018no,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cAnd that makes me happy. Is anyone challenging what the listener expects anymore? We don\u2019t do stuff because we\u2019re supposed to.\u201d\n\nLabonte accepts he\u2019ll continue to be misunderstood. Some will love Madness, some won\u2019t, but the album will make an impression on everyone who gives it an honest listen. Asked how he\u2019d like to viewed, Labonte responds, \u201cI want to be the guy that really challenges people\u2019s ideas. I\u2019m fucking punk rock. Punk rock hasn\u2019t been punk rock for 30 years. For too long metal has been bullshit, milky pandering crap. What happened to metal? What happened to punk rock? What happened to being anti-establishment? I wanna bring that all back.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Snow Patrol ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10336343.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Alternative Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Twenty-five years of Snow Patrol: where did it all go right?\n\nGary Lightbody has had plenty opportunity to ponder that over the last couple of years. The band\u2019s seventh album, Wildness, their first in seven years, entered the UK charts at Number Two, went gold, and kept them on tour around the world for the best part of 18 months.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gigging time, but also a lot of thinking time.\n\n\u201cWhere did it all go right?\u201d echoes Lighbtody. \u201cNo idea!\u201d the singer and songwriter laughs. \u201cAfter 10 years of no success, no one \u2013 least of all us \u2013 expected us these last 15 years to sell 17 million albums, headline festivals and play to thousands of people all over the world.\u201d\nAdd to that: one billion global track streams, five UK platinum albums, an Ivor Novello award and Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominations. And, in the shape of Chasing Cars, a modern classic recently anointed by the PPL as the most played song on UK radio of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWhen we released Final Straw in 2003, I think there was general goodwill around us from the media,\u201d continues Lightbody, \u201cas people knew the story of the previous 10 years and were kinda glad for us to get a shot on a major label,\" he notes of their move from indie Jeepster (also original home of Belle and Sebastian) to discerning Polydor imprint Fiction. That \u201csea-change\u201d set in motion the next phase of the band\u2019s existence. Still, in music, as in life, nothing is a given. \u201cOf course the good grace of the press is hard won and easy lost, but radio kept on playing us. That\u2019s been the real key to our success, I firmly believe. Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. On those shows we did some of the songs close to how they sound on the Reworked album \u2013 for example, the new version of You\u2019re All I Have came directly out of playing those acoustic shows.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re All I Have is the opening track from 2006\u2019s Eyes Open, the album that also featured Chasing Cars. On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain. Iain came up with the beautiful, John Martyn-style guitar, and his version floored me when I heard it the first time. Iain\u2019s guitar playing has always been a joy to listen to and to have it feature so prominently on this album is just amazing.\"\n\nAlso presented in simple acoustic simplicity is Chocolate, the third single from Final Straw, and produced here in classy, \u201ctime-stopping\u201d style by McDaid. \u201cChocolate has been a live favourite since we released it. It\u2019s a song all Snow Patrol fans know \u2013 I can\u2019t attest that they all love it but they know it!\u201d its co-author laughs. \u201cAnd we wanted to rework the songs that the fans are the most familiar with. There's not much point in reworking songs people don\u2019t really know as there's not really a stark contrast.\u201d\nThat said, \u201cwe will be doing something with the first two albums before the release of Reworked as those two albums do not feature for that same reason,\u201d Lightbody teases.\nWhat of the recent Twitter \u201caccusation\u201d that SP have \u201cdisowned\u201d those albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It\u2019s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2001), because they don\u2019t play the songs live?\n\u201cNot true at all,\u201d he replies with a shake of the head. \u201cWe are very proud of them. It\u2019s just that when we play those songs live they negatively affect the atmosphere of the gig. And as Star Trek taught us: \u2018The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat need to entertain and surprise also informed the approach taken to Called Out In The Dark. The curtain-raiser from 2011's Fallen Empires now comes with an inventive synth throb that echoes the original.\n\u201cI had worried a little that the whole record was getting very downtempo,\u201d admits Lightbody. \u201cThe nature of recording in hotel rooms and dressing rooms is that things will invariably be low-key. Hard to rock out with a family of four in the next hotel room trying to sleep!\n\u201cSo when it came to some of the songs we recorded towards the end of the new album, we wanted to explore a slightly higher tempo \u2013 without, of course, leaning too heavy into the original version. Called Out\u2026 is certainly the closest to the original version of any song on Reworked, but I think distinct enough to warrant its place. It has an electro bent like the original but steers clear of any of its predecessor\u2019s tropes. I asked Iain to lift it up and he sure did.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the three new songs. First up, the lovely, heart-stopping Time Won\u2019t Go Slowly.\n\u201cJohnny and I wrote this in his house in LA. We\u2019re both massive fans of Frank Ocean, so we wanted it to sound like Frank Ocean crossed with Frank Sinatra. All the Franks! It\u2019s a classic crooner track. We just wanted to try something starkly different from anything we have done before.\n\"As for the lyrics, I guess I\u2019ve not written about love for a while and needed a fix,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI like the idea of the inherent tragedy woven into the fabric of time: time speeds up when we're having a great time and slows down when we're miserable. Although it\u2019s all perception, of course, not reality. And I like that, too. That distortion. Our minds are powerful and sometimes terrible things. I guess the song tries to wrap its head around that great cosmic joke. Also it\u2019s just a love song.\"\nThen there\u2019s I Think of Home, a folk-flavoured piano ballad with vivid, evocative and deeply personal lyrics. Lightbody wrote it in 2014, as part of a five-song contribution \u201cto a night dedicated to my greatest literary hero Seamus Heaney when he opened the Seamus Heaney Home Place in Magherafelt. They wanted me to play a few songs at the opening night.\n\u201cI set my own rules for the songs\u2019 content,\" he expands. \"They had to be inspired by what Heaney had been inspired by: home, family, Ireland, The Troubles, hope, the soil\u2026\u201d\nI Think of Home was later considered for inclusion on Wildness, but none of the versions the band tried out in the studio fitted.\n\u201cBut then we went on tour with Wildness and at shows in Ireland and Irish strongholds like Boston, New York, Sydney and Melbourne, I would play I Think Of Home acoustically on my own in the middle of gigs. It would always go down well.\n\u201cSo when it came to Reworked we had lived with the song enough to feel like we could do a great version of it. And Johnny produced a stunning version of it. I had been playing it a certain way for so long it was hard for me to hear it any other way. That can be dangerous \u2013 stagnation can set in. So when that happens you have to let someone you trust take it from you and remake it. So, in the spirit of what we were doing, it was great to get a reworked version of a song that had never even been released.\"\nThe third new song is Made Of Something Different Now, which is quietly sweeping, quietly epic and wholly devastating.\n\u201cOne of my favourite tracks we have done in ages,\" nods Lightbody. \"In keeping with the Reworked attitude of trying new things, it\u2019s unlike much of what we\u2019ve done before. Lyrically, it\u2019s the story of a dear friend\u2019s heartbreak. My own heart, having not been in a relationship in ten years, is unrisked so unbroken. A damning self-portrait if ever there was one! Writing this song \u2013 with Johnny \u2013 made me realise my own lack of bravery in that department. Hasn\u2019t effected any change yet, mind you, but it did start me thinking at least\u2026 Anyway, as us Celts say, it\u2019s a belter,\u201d he grins.\n\nThe final word should go to Take Back The City. Gary Lightbody\u2019s hymn to Belfast is the song that opens Reworked and is sure to be an emotive live highlight when Snow Patrol take Reworked on the road later this year. As he reflects on 25 years of Snow Patrol, how have his feelings about the city changed in the 11 years since the song was released?\n\u201cWell, as the song says, I love Belfast tonight and always. There are still things that drive me crazy about the place. But I think that's the same for everyone\u2019s home city \u2013 although my home town, of course, is Bangor.\n\u201cMy love has deepened though not waned. I see the conflict that still goes on in people\u2019s hearts, my own included, and yet there is this drive in most people \u2013 most people \u2013 to put the past behind us and move on. To lift each other up.\n\u201cWe need that now more than ever with the looming clusterfuck that is Brexit and the devastation it has the potential to bring to the whole of UK, but to Northern Ireland more than anywhere else. We need that will to put the past behind us and lift each other.\u201d\n\nHear, hear. Equally, with these 16 inspiring, enveloping tracks, this is also moment to embrace the past \u2013 and, like the man said, to use it to lift each other. This is Reworked. This is Snow Patrol\u2019s history, and their legacy. And it\u2019s their inspired next step.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Morgan Finlay ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9929320.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Vancouver,Canada", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Traveling the roads of Europe for fifteen years, Irish-Canadian singer-songwriter Morgan Finlay has woven his talent for melody, poignant observations and passion for humanity into a fan-made success story.

A choice of who you are, how you present yourself, and how you want to be remembered. And in the face of those daily choices \u2013 and ahead of the release of Upside Down \u2013 Set It Off has simply chosen to be more. More ambitious. More unified. More confident. More open-minded. More collaborative. And above all, more authentic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten stronger. We really have. As a whole. As a unit. We feel more together. When you go through struggle and you make it through, your bond strengthens. That\u2019s what Upside Down is about. That\u2019s the theme of this album. Going through struggle, and instead of taking it as defeat or a sign to give up \u2013 turning it into a positive and moving forward,\u201d declares Set It Off frontman Cody Carson. \u201cWe go through a lot every year, we\u2019re in the music industry, that\u2019s gonna happen. So we decided to band together, and just push forward.\u201d\n\nThe Tampa, FL-based band released Upside Down, their third full-length, on October 7th via Equal Vision Records. The album was recorded in Los Angeles, CA with producers Brandon Paddock (Panic! At The Disco, Avril Lavigne, Pentatonix), Erik Ron (Saosin, Panic! At The Disco) and Mike Green (5 Seconds of Summer, All Time Low, Cassadee Pope). The release was noted as one of the \u201cMost Anticipated Albums of 2016\u201d by Alternative Press Magazine and follows the band\u2019s sophomore album, Duality, which debuted at No. 18 on the Billboard Independent Chart, No. 81 on the Billboard Top Current Chart, and No. 86 on the Billboard Top 200 Chart; And the band\u2019s debut full-length, Cinematics, that was released in September 2012, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard South Atlantic Heatseekers Regional Chart, No. 4 on Billboard Heatseekers Chart, No. 9 on Billboard Next Big Sound Chart, No. 38 Independent Chart, and even broke into the Billboard Top 200 chart at No. 174. Set It Off formed in 2008 and is comprised of Cody Carson (vocals), Dan Clermont (guitar), Zach DeWall (guitar) and Maxx Danziger (drums).\n\nUpside Down sonically takes a brighter sound than previous releases and offers the band\u2019s most pop-driven anthems to date. Bold electronic elements guide loud, driving rock instrumentations with guitar riffs as catchy as the choruses and an overall feel-good, dance-worthy vibe throughout. On Upside Down, Set It Off commands attention and brings authenticity back to pop music in a bold and unapologetic way.\n\n\u201cI felt like a change was needed for Upside Down, so we decided to go back to our roots. Instead of focusing on what we think everyone else should hear from us or how they should perceive us, we went back to the roots of writing songs for the sake of wanting to write a good song. Opening our minds up to doing more co-writes and to collaborating more and just doing whatever it takes to chase that perfect song,\u201d he shares. \u201cAnd I feel like once we got out of our darker, more theatrical Cinematics era, writing became easier because we weren\u2019t inside of a box. So with Duality, the first time we started making the transition [to our roots], we started to open our minds to what Set It Off could become if we just didn\u2019t put any boundaries on ourselves and just wrote whatever came out of our minds and our hearts at that moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWriting Duality really showed me that a vibe is everything in writing. If I\u2019m excited and I\u2019m getting into it, then I\u2019m going to write better melodies. If I\u2019m feeling confident, I\u2019m going to write better melodies and have better ideas. I\u2019ve always heard that songwriting and producing is 99% confidence \u2013 and it\u2019s so true. Brandon [Paddock] brought out a writing side of us and a confidence that we\u2019ve never had. And I immediately became a better writer from that,\u201d notes Carson.\nDuality was our learning process of getting better and Upside Down is us \u2013 our system is on point now.\"\n\nDiscussing the band\u2019s hardships with people they\u2019ve worked with, how they\u2019ve coped with current events going on in the world, and reflecting on past personal relationships of past and present, Upside Down covers a wide spectrum lyrically \u2013 creating a dynamic and distinctly human experience. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s important to be honest, to be yourself.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON). The Allaire Show features John sharing the stage with local and up-and-coming talent as well as more experienced and established musicians, some who\u2019ve come from as far away as Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\n\nAWARDS\n- American Songwriter Assoc. \"Best Lyrics\" Award 2009 for \"Magnets\" (Nashville, TN)\n\n- Toronto Independent Music Awards \"Best Live Act\" (2009)\n\n- CBC Telefest top independent music video in Ontario (1989)\n\n- Top independent video in Canada 1989 as selected by MuchMusic\n\n- Canadian College and University Radio Assoc. top album of the month - \"All's Well\" (1989)\n\n- PROCAN (now SOCAN) independent songwriter award for \"Cry at Night\" (1987)", "otherInfo": "The (World Famous) ALLAIRE SHOW!!! 3pm-5pm Saturdays\n\nNow streaming live on The ALLAIRE SHOW Facebook page @theallaireshow 3pm Saturdays."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Underoath ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8572565.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Alternative, Experimental, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With eight years having passed since we last heard new music from Under\u00f8ath, that near decade-length absence weighed heavily upon music lovers\u2019 hearts. When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do. Having already established themselves both as melodic songwriters (2004\u2019s RIAA-Certified Gold record They\u2019re Only Chasing Safety) and as ambitious power merchants (2006\u2019s stentorian, gold-selling Define The Great Line and its majestic follow-up, 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound Of Separation), the evolution detailed on Erase Me finds them using the sonic dialects they\u2019ve crafted to reveal where they are now. Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems. Even with a comeback title seemingly marinating in self-fulfilling prophecy, nobody in their right mind would dare delete Under\u00f8ath\u2019s measurable contribution to the advancement of post-hardcore and heavy rock. The only thing you need to erase is your patience with their pretenders. Accept no substitutes and your culture won\u2019t feel destitute.

A bruising blend of ferocious rock and roll and inky blues, the album debuted in the Top 5 on the Billboard Top 200 and spun off three No. 1 Mainstream Rock singles, \u201cFucked Up World,\u201d \u201cFollow Me Down\u201d and 2014\u2019s most successful song at the format, \u201cHeaven Knows,\u201d which spent a total of 18 weeks in the top spot. Going to Hell\u2019s success meant strong live demand for the New York City band, which is anchored by its songwriters, singer-guitarist Taylor Momsen and guitarist Ben Phillips, who have been making music together in partnership for ten years, and rounded out by bassist Mark Damon and drummer Jamie Perkins. The Going To Hell Tour sent The Pretty Reckless off on four separate jaunts across North America and three trips to Europe. Their explosive shows earned them legions of new fans at home and overseas. Despite feeling physically and emotionally spent after returning from their two-year odyssey, Momsen and Phillips jumped right into writing the songs for their third album, the scorching yet soulful Who You Selling For, which will be released by Razor & Tie in October. \u201cWe had so much we wanted to say, it was like shaking a can of soda on tour, and then when we started writing we cracked the seal,\u201d says Momsen. \u201cThe touring life is very isolating. You look at the world through a bus or airplane window. But music is the healing factor. It\u2019s the one thing that is grounding and a true companion through the forest. It saved us \u2014 again.\u201d The necessity of music as a balm for the soul is a theme that threads its way through Who You Selling For, which finds Momsen and Phillips dealing with emotions ranging from confusion and frustration to depression and despair. \u201cI think we felt a dire need to express those thoughts,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cAnd they\u2019re things I think most humans feel on a daily basis but don\u2019t always have an outlet to express. In the end we\u2019re saying, \u2018Don\u2019t give up, your soul is all you have, so you\u2019ve got to hang onto that.\u2019\u201d The album\u2019s opening track, \u201cHangman\u201d (which was inspired by a poem by Chidiock Tichborne written on the eve of his execution), tells a story of having control over your own mind and soul no matter what is happening to you. From there, Who You Selling For delves deep into the psyche of Momsen and Phillips \u2014 two artists who believe very much in the fiery redemptive power of rock and roll. The album\u2019s first single, \u201cTake Me Down,\u201d is a story of desperation, with Momsen delivering such lyrics as \u201cI spend all night and day / How much harder can I play? / You know I gave my life to rock and roll?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about wanting something so much you\u2019d sell your soul for it,\u201d Momsen says, adding that she and Phillips were inspired by blues artist Robert Johnson\u2019s song \u201cCrossroads,\u201d which some have interpreted as Johnson singing about selling his soul to the Devil in exchange for his musical ability. \u201cBack To The River\u201d is about the desire to get away from everything, to go where no one can reach you, while the strutting \u201cWild City\u201d is influenced by being young and on your own in New York (\u201cWe wrote it while walking down Rivington Street on the Lower East Side,\u201d Momsen says). The most aggressive song on the album is \u201cOh My God,\u201d which Momsen describes as \u201cself-confession right out of a journal. I think it speaks for itself.\u201d And finally \u201cWho You Selling For\u201d testifies to music being a form of salvation and describes how the rest of the album reaches into all forms of rock and roll looking for \u201cThe Answer.\u201d The song inspired the album\u2019s title, asking listeners to take a look at their own lives with its provocative query. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a question that challenges what I\u2019m doing with my life,\u201d Momsen says. \u201cIt questions the meaning of my actions whatever they are. It also defines the record in a grander way by asking the listener to look into the meaning of each song past the obvious.\u201d Sonically, Who You Selling For alternates between blistering hard rock (\u201cOh My God,\u201d \u201cPrisoner,\u201d \u201cWild City,\u201d \u201cLiving In The Storm\u201d) and gentler, more downtempo moments (\u201cThe Walls Are Closing In,\u201d \u201cTake Me Down,\u201d \u201cBack To The River,\u201d \u201cWho You Selling For,\u201d acoustic ballad \u201cBedroom Window,\u201d and closing track \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Back\u201d), giving Momsen a platform to showcase the power and versatility of her voice. She is one of rock\u2019s most compelling contemporary frontpersons, capable of being both brash and confrontational and sultry and seductive, daring listeners to ignore her at their own peril with a fiery swagger that has only grown more fascinating as Momsen gets older. (She was 15 when The Pretty Reckless wrote and recorded their rock-grunge-blues debut album Light Me Up, which was released in 2010.) Momsen\u2019s voice sounds all the more intimate thanks to the unvarnished way that she and Phillips, along with their long-time producer Kato Khandwala, recorded the songs. \u201cIt\u2019s the most natural recording possible,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cIt\u2019s all performance-based, nothing was fixed. If Taylor walked in and sang the song and it didn\u2019t work, she\u2019d walk right out.\u201d When more than just guitar, bass, and drums were needed, additional musicians were invited in, including guitarist Warren Haynes (Allman Brothers), guitarist Tommy Byrnes (Billy Joel), and keyboardist Andy Burton (Ian Hunter), as well as backing vocalists Janice Pendarvis (David Bowie), Jenny Douglas-Foote (P!nk), and Sophia Ramos (Rod Stewart). \u201cIt was so great having that many musicians in a room playing together and just hitting the record button,\u201d Momsen says. \u201cIt\u2019s very gratifying to feel the players and singers represented as they are. It gave life to these songs that were written tucked away in a bedroom and it enabled us to really deliver the most honest performances possible. What you hear is what it sounded like, no frills. That\u2019s it.\u201d It\u2019s the band\u2019s willingness to bare their souls that has earned them such a passionate fan base \u2014 people who identify with the raw candor of the lyrics and fearless way they are expressed. \u201cI\u2019ve had such a strange life,\u201d Momsen says. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt on my own, running around the world on some mission that I barely understood. Our fans have been the ones who were really there for us. They have supported us through the good times and the bad. I owe them gratitude. They are the inspiration when things look too bleak to keep going. I know it\u2019s been said a million times, but it\u2019s true, I wouldn\u2019t be here today without them.

She\u2019s like the music scene\u2019s version of the protagonist in the film, \u201cThe Natural,\u201d having spent the \u201cprime of her career\u201d out of the spotlight -- in her case, tending to her family -- only to return from absolutely nowhere to wow and amaze. Where Robert Redford made all the fans sit up and cheer with mammoth home runs, Kerri Powers is going to make people listening to this album do the exact same thing with exceptional songwriting and equally exceptional delivery.\u201d -- Chip McCabe, Lonesome Noise\n\nKerri Powers was destined to be a musician from the start. While most kids her age spent their childhoods following frivolous pursuits, she spent hers reading, painting, writing stories, learning guitar and composing her first songs at the tender age of nine. By her own admission, she was a shy child, but her creative pursuits gave her an appreciation of the larger world around her. Those instincts seemed to have been bred naturally, given that there was undeniable talent embedded in her genes. Bing Crosby was a distant relative on her father\u2019s side, while her mother\u2019s relatives were said to be descended from author Herman Melville. Notably, too, Powers\u2019 paternal grandmother made her living by playing piano and providing musical accompaniment for silent films, making her a show business standby back in the day.\n\nNot surprisingly then, Powers was encouraged to pursue her own creative ambitions while still in adolescence. Her mother, a talented visual artist in her own right, owned an extensive record collection, which gave Kerri her initial exposure to irrefutable icons like Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and John Prine. \u201cI would sit in a wicker rocking chair by the record player and sing along to the songs,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI remember hearing John Prine\u2019s \u201cHello in There\u201d for the first time and feeling that something magical was happening. It was a momentary yet memorable trip to a sad but hopeful place of lonely old faces.\u201d\n\nPowers started playing professionally in local coffeehouses throughout her native New England and went on to release several well-received albums in the new millennium, culminating in Faith in the Shadows in 2009. Two of her songs were later featured on the Fox series \u201cRescue Me\u201d starring Denis Leary. After taking time off to get married and raise her young son she returned to performing, counting among her credits the Boston Folk Festival, Philadelphia Folk Festival, and Telluride Bluegrass Festival, among other prestigious gatherings. She\u2019s also toured Europe while opening for Canadian singer/songwriter Fred Eaglesmith in The Netherlands, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThis flurry of activity recently culminated in a new self-titled album, her first effort in five years. With a track list that includes eight searing self-penned songs along with incisive covers of Janis Ian\u2019s \u201cJesse,\u201d and The Bee Gees\u2019 \u201cTo Love Somebody,\u201d it ranks as Powers\u2019 most accomplished collection to date. \u201cThe recording was a last minute decision,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe idea was to cut a couple of tracks simply to see how it would go.\u201d\n\nThe results \u2013 a sound that\u2019s homespun, sparse and understated -- provide another ideal showcase for Powers\u2019 intimate and expressive songwriting, as well as her adroit ability to interpret the works of others.\n\nFully reenergized and excited about rebooting her career, Powers is looking forward to a return to touring both here and overseas. Clearly, the creative spark that was ignited so early on is fully fuelled once again.\n\nLee Zimmerman\n\nBooking Requests:\n\nNicholas DiSpagna/Airtight Management\n617-997-2131\nsilentgbooking@gmail.com\n\nEddie Camolli/ Hungry Ear Agency\n207-333-0281\nhungryearagency@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rye River Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9231579.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Americana", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "http://www.ryeriverband.com\n\nThe Rye River Band are a 5-piece live and recording band from Ireland.\nFormed in Leixlip Co.

The 26-year-old is home in her native Rochester, New York, reflecting on Delivery, her highly anticipated full-length album, as well as the hard journey the classically trained, defiantly original harpist had to travel to become the writer AND performer, she was meant to be.\n\n\u201cA lot of these songs came from feeling stuck and also like people were pulling me in a bunch of different directions,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cI wanted to say, \u2018Just wait for me. I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\nMikaela\u2019s plea for patience\u2013\u2013a little bit sweet, a little bit angry and raw\u2013\u2013fed a fierce 10-song collection. A joyride that pulls from rock, 70s and 80s pop, and funk, Delivery manages to be both daring and comfortable, full of not just risks, but hooks.\n\nProduced by Grammy winner John Congleton (St. Vincent, Angel Olsen, David Byrne, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah), Delivery is a triumphant next chapter. \u201cJohn tries to find that moment instead of the perfect take,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cThat made it all sound really special.\u201d Childhood friend Alex Cot\u00e9 (drums, percussion) and Shane McCarthy (bass) play on the record - already close from years of touring. Recently, Mikaela\u2019s ensemble became a family affair with the addition of Shane\u2019s older brother Cian McCarthy on guitar.\n\nMikaela\u2019s unconventional path to working songwriter began before high school, growing up in Rochester. With plans to join a symphony, she studied harp performance at Crane School of Music, but halfway through, she decided the traditional harpist\u2019s path wasn\u2019t for her. Following graduation, Mikaela moved to Brooklyn, following in the footsteps of artists who\u2019ve come before her. But in the city, she could never quite find her footing. She kept busy, toured, and recorded an album that would eventually be shelved. Feeling confused and alone, she retreated back to Rochester, unsure of her next move.\n\nThen, the last place Mikaela wanted to be saved her.

Summoning a thrilling spirit, with throwback sonic crunch, visual flair, and reckless live performances, PALAYE ROYALE has quickly earned a legion of obsessive cult-like loyalists, lovingly dubbed Soldiers of the Royal Council. PALAYE ROYALE draw as much inspiration from cinema and philosophy as they do from their musical muses, building a story with libertine reverence for Alan Watts and debauchery-fueled nights at the Chateau Marmont, for Johnny Thunders and The Stooges. This band is equally at home in the hallways of Los Angeles Fashion Week or climbing the lighting tresses at the Vans Warped Tour. They sold out theaters on their first-ever headlining tour and steal the show at each major festival.\nEach member of PALAYE ROYALE doubles as musician and visionary. The Pirate, The Vampire, and The Gentleman inspire a level of devotion reserved for My Chemical Romance or Twenty One Pilots, as their deep fan connection crosses genre-divides.\nKerrang! declared the band to be \u201con the cusp of next-level stardom\u201d and with good reason. PAYALE ROYALE went from support act on any tour that would have them to the cover of Rock Sound and Alternative Press. \u201cMorning Light,\u201d \u201cMr. Doctor Man,\u201d \u201cGet Higher,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Feel Quite Right,\u201d and \u201cMa Ch\u00e9rie\u201d amassed 30 million YouTube views (and counting). Boom Boom Room (Side A) paved the way for this year\u2019s hotly- anticipated follow-up, Boom Boom Room (Side B), heralded by the arrival of the overnight smash lead single, \u201cYou\u2019ll Be Fine.\u201d PALAYE ROYALE brought the juxtaposition of the glitz and grime of their teenage years spent in Las Vegas, when they relocated to Los Angeles in 2011. The ghost of Charlie Chaplin was surely some sort of unseen guide as they took up residence in his old home and rehearsed continuously in a basement. By the time they hit the road, borrowing their mother\u2019s Cadillac Escalade, Remington Leith, Sebastian Danzig, and Emerson Barrett were a tightly wound creative force. (Not long ago, they slept in that SUV outside a Motel 6, unable to afford to rent a room.)\nIt was Alex Burdon, daughter of The Animals singer Eric Burdon, who insisted Sumerian\u2019s founder see the band. (The label offered them a contract the same night.) Los Angeles radio personality and tastemaker Rodney Bingenheimer introduced PALAYE ROYALE to rock industry legend Kim Fowley, another strong supporter. James Iha of The Smashing Pumpkins/A Perfect Circle and Corey Taylor of Slipknot/Stone Sour also count themselves among the band\u2019s true believers, having worked with them as a producer and taken them out on tour, respectively. Sleeping With Sirens\u2019 Kellin Quinn made a guest appearance on Boom Boom Room (Side A). As their moniker itself evokes (Palaye Royale is the name of the Toronto dancehall where their grandparents met in the \u201850s), the brotherly trio is eager to connect themselves and this generation to the spirit of the past, but reinvigorated for today with eclecticism and fierce individuality. Their tours are like a traveling circus. Clad in scarves, hats, paisley shirts, and makeup, as the Soldiers of the Royal Council attest, it\u2019s the PALAYE ROYALE lifestyle. Gretsch guitar tones that shimmer with reverb, drums that shake and pound, vocals that claw forth with the electric urgency of the early punk movement, all swirling together with the swinging cool of the 1960s and the swagger of latter day Brit Pop bands such as The Libertines and early Arctic Monkeys. Each show comes with an element of unpredictability and danger, with the three guys playing as if their lives depended on it, pure showmanship over perfectionism.\nAs Classic Rock Magazine wrote, \u201cIf you want theatrics, these boys deliver in spades \u2013 and not just in their headline-grabbing threads and eye-popping stage show.\u201d The Rolling Stones, The Black Crowes, and The Doors collide with The Ramones and Iggy Pop within their songs, with a hint of the early blues that inspired Led Zeppelin. It\u2019s fast-paced dirty rock n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s glam and grime, spectacle and sweat, showmanship and songwriting. Rock Sound\u2019s in-depth cover story, drawn from an intense 72-hours with the brothers, called PALAYE ROYALE \u201cRock\u2019s Next Superstars,\u201d predicting they \u201cmight just change it all.\u201d Even as 2016\u2019s Boom Boom Room (Side A) and 2018\u2019s Boom Boom Room (Side B) document the story thus far, PALAYE ROYALE remain focused on the bigger picture. They\u2019ve built something grander than a band. It\u2019s an artistic movement. Ever self- assured in their ambition and staunch in their support of individuality, PALAYE ROYALE are \u201coutfitting the revolution\u201d (as they like to say).", "otherInfo": "We'll be performing live at Homeschool Festival on Saturday, May 9th at 8:25pm BST (12:25pm PT/3:25 ET) on the Alt Stage!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Crystal Skies ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9928074.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Electronic Dance Music, Electronic", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Melodic Bass Music.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.twitch.tv/cardinalnow"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Jive Aces ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9160947.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Jazz, Rockabilly, Jazz Blues, Jive, Trad Jazz, Blues, Swing, Skiffle", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The UK's No.1 jive and swing band, more info at http://www.jiveaces.com/meet-the-band", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/jiveaces"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Dears ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10278828.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Indie Rock, Prog-rock, Alternative, Art Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Dears, a critically acclaimed \u201corchestral-pop-noir-romantique\u201d rock'n'roll band from Montre?al, is shaped equally by nineties rock and a broad tableau of gospel, soul, and pop music.\n\nThe band formed in 1995 and released their first album, End of a Hollywood Bedtime Story, in 2000.

Sure, the pair met in Montreal in 2008. But as anyone who's been to Nevada's Black Rock Desert will tell you, Burning Man years are like dog years, and by that measure, Blond:ish has been together for a lifetime. As a youngster growing up in Canada, Vivie Ann aspired to be a computer hacker. Equally unique in her goals, Anstascia sought the acceptance of nerds. Both say they failed miserably. Eventually, their broken-heart trails converged and they created a midweek party in Montreal. Every Wednesday, they would promote, party, and DJ at the nightclub Cherry. These days, Viv and Anstascia are savy travelers. Their original productions and DJ sets are inspired, in part, by their travels and spiritual encounters. Tribal dudes chant and hum on the duo's new track, \u201cMoonbow.\u201d Dave Gahan, lead singer of Depeche Mode, provides the vocals in Blond:ish's remix of the legendary English band's \u201cShould Be Higher.\u201d Plus, they're driven to share their passion with the world, one listener at a time. \u201cA lot of people have never heard of us.

The music achieved critical acclaim and airplay across the country and into the US and even Europe. The first single from that album, \u2018Come Right Back To You\u2019 debuted on the iTunes Canada Top 200 RnB/Soul song chart at #23, while the album itself debuted at #11 on the Canadian iTunes Top 200 RnB/Soul chart.\n\nThe success of \u2018My Heart Away\u2019 led to the interest and attention of one of House music\u2019s hardest working artists from Sweden, StoneBridge. The Grammy award-nominated artist, Producer, and DJ has shared his talent on Billboard #1 hits for major artists like Ariana Grande, P!nk, Haley Joelle, Nelly Furtado & many others. One particular song from Avery\u2019s album, \u2018Pieces\u2019, captured the dynamic producer\u2019s imagination and \u2018Pieces \u2013 The Remixes\u2019, released in January 2020, with its already infectious melody and catchy hook, is being played in dance clubs and on dance radio all around the world. In fact, the song debuted on the Billboard Dance Club Song Chart at 50* and has quickly moved within the top 40, widening the appeal of this independent Canadian artist.\n\nThat achievement is merely one of many successes from this teenaged Contemporary Soul/Pop phenomenon. In fact, Canadian, recording artist Avery Raquel, started in the entertainment industry at a very young age. From television, for the likes of DreamWorks, to animation for Disney, voice-over work, commercials and radio, as well as a number of professional stage productions across Canada, Avery\u2019s passion for performing grew. All the while, Avery kept honing her craft as a vocalist of rare talent, which has led to an impressive list of career-accomplishments on her musical resume.\n\nThat talent caught the ears of award-winning Canadian producer/songwriter/musician Greg Kavanagh, in 2017, and their eventual collaboration of work has led to outstanding original songs that not only were featured on \u2018My Heart Away\u2019, but also on her second solo album, \u2018Without A Little Rain\u2019. That album debuted on the iTunes Canada Top 200 RnB/Soul album chart at #31.\n\nBeyond acquiring media attention, Avery\u2019s music consistently receives glowing reviews and continued airplay across Canada, and into the United States, affording her opportunities to perform her music across North America. From New York to Newport to Toronto and beyond, including venues and renowned music festivals, Avery continues to wow audiences with her fresh style and powerful vocal performances.\n\nAvery is compassionate as well, volunteering her time to regularly perform at sports, government, and charity events, donating her talents. She\u2019s even sung the anthem in front of 43,000 people at a Toronto Blue Jays Baseball game.\n\nOf course, she also has a passion for supporting causes close to her heart such as anti-bullying (going into schools talking and performing for students), and music education. To that extent, Heart of Indie Radio in the US, has named a scholarship in her honour. That scholarship, every year for the next 10 years, awards an individual in Canada, and one in the United States, with $500 USD towards their arts or music education.\n\nAvery continues to compose new music, challenging herself to appeal to multiple genres and audiences, and constantly performing and improving her craft. She also co-hosts an online radio show on heartofindieradio.com, talking about and playing music she loves from an era that still influences so many artists today.\n\nWhile constantly performing, and with new music always in production, especially with the support of successful artist-producers like Stonebridge and Greg Kavanagh, Avery is poised to be the breakout artist she is destined to become!", "otherInfo": "Join me and some of my artist friends for anoteher episode of Quarantini Cocktail Hour.

The Army of Broken Toys's stage show exorcises personal tragedies and cleaves its audience's hearts with rollicking apocalyptic waltzes and powerful rock ballads that seem to emerge from under their ringmaster Walter Sickert\u2019s top hat. While The Toys are on stage one feels psychically kidnapped to their \u2018Portable Carnival\u2019. The WIREFOREST boasts 7 musicians (guitars, upright bass, drums, viola, mandolin, broken toys, melodica, accordion, ukulele, flute...) and rolls with a surreal troupe of any number of midway and burlesque performers, The Bunny Collaborative. The Army of Broken Toys offers a unique rock club run-away to the circus experience.\n\nWalter Sickert & The Army of Broken Toys have been making as much noise nationally as they do locally. With a steady foundation of coverage by Boston press including The Boston Globe, The Boston Herald, the Noise and The Phoenix; the Army of Toys has also been featured nationally on NPR\u2019s Here and Now, All Songs Considered and on MuchMusic. Walter Sickert was named Best Artist 2011 and 2012 in the Boston Phoenix Reader's Poll and his visual art was part of the Art is Evil touring stage/music/art show and art book sponsored by Amanda Palmer\u2019s million dollar Kickstarter with a small group of artists like Frances Bean Cobain, Neil Gaiman, DJ Spooky, Shepard Fairey, David Mack etc. Walter has also been featured for the last six years as a part of the RPM challenge sponsored by New Hampshire\u2019s The Wire. The band has continued to participate in the challenge every year since its inception. The Toys have successfully funded two Kickstarter campaigns, and produced a 40+ show run of their original 'steampunk musical for people who hate musicals,' \"28 Seeds\" a cautionary tale for our time writ by the band's resident playwright/mustache, Meff and produced by Liars and Believers. The play originated from the \"last radio show\" RPM '10 project.\n\nThe \u201crollicking, raunchy sideshow of jolly, wheezing menace and delight\u201d live experience of Walter Sickert & The Army of Broken Toys have taken the band across the US and beyond, playing such revered venues as the Hynes Convention Center for First Night for four years, The Boston Center for The Arts, Boston Symphony Hall, 930 Club in DC, Webster Hall in NYC, Royce Hall in LA, Mod Club in Toronto, the Stone Pony in NJ, and the Melkweg in Amsterdam etc. Their live antics have earned them a Boston Music Award nomination for Best Live Act and headlining spots at Steampunk World\u2019s Faire. They have garnered opening spots alongside international contemporaries the Tiger Lillies, Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys, The Humans (featuring Toyah Wilcox, Bill Rieflin and Chris Wong), The Dresden Dolls, Amanda Palmer (solo), Chester French, etc. at several venues.\n\nWith their newest album, Soft Time Traveler and tour plans in the US and Europe, there is so much more to come from the BRoken TOys!\n\n\n(((((((((THE PRESS MONSTER))))))))))))\n\n\u201cThrough it all, Walter Sickert anchors the performance pounding out strong melodies and baying these fierce, fuming lyrics and damn if it doesn\u2019t come off as revelry...

Singer. Banjo player. Ashley Campbell juggles all three roles, armed with the ability not only to dream up a modern country song, but to deliver it, too.\n\nAlready known for her work alongside her father, country legend Glen Campbell \u2014 who, during his final years as a touring musician, leaned heavily on his youngest daughter as a banjo player, keyboardist and harmony vocalist \u2014 Ashley is now stepping out on her own. Her music is a mix of her wide-ranging influences, combining the old-school country sound popularized by her fa-ther during the '60s and '70s with contemporary Americana, rootsy folk and country-pop. Glen Campbell's longtime fans may hear something familiar in Ashley's melodies as she embraces these similarities while distinguishing herself as a talented frontwoman.\n\nGrowing up, Ashley's parents encouraged her to sing and play the piano. She did both, adding the acoustic guitar to the mix once she hit high school. A theater kid with comedic chops, she also landed roles in local musicals and improv groups, eventually heading to college as a theater major during her late teens. When a director cast Ashley in a role that required her to learn the banjo, though, she fell in love with the instrument. Inspired, and with the help of her godfather, legendary banjo player Carl Jackson, she began mastering her banjo technique, then started writing her own songs. No wonder Glen asked her to join him on his farewell tour not long after she graduated college, a tour that would eventually take his band \u2014 Ashley included \u2014 on a three-year ride around the world. The banjo sounded timeless, reminding her of the music she'd heard as a child.\n\nAshley kept writing new material during her days on the road. By the time her father retired from touring in 2012, she was ready to make her introduction not only as a sideman, but as a solo art-ist in her own right. Dot Records, an imprint of the Big Machine Label Group, was ready, too, signing Ashley to a roster that also includes Maddie & Tae, Steven Tyler and Drake White. She is currently working on her debut record. All of the tracks \u2014 including \"Remembering,\" a poignant tribute to her Dad that doubled as the first single of her career \u2014 were either written or co-written by Ashley, who also played multiple instruments throughout the recording process. The goal wasn't to create a perfect-sounding album featuring the best session musicians from Nashville. The goal was to be authentic and real, shining a light on a do-it-yourself artist who's carved out her own sound.\n\nAshley Campbell is a multi-talented entertainer. A singer and songwriter who plays her own in-struments. A newcomer with years of heavy touring under her belt. There's no denying her icon-ic country pedigree, but Ashley is attracting the spotlight these days with her style, talent and a unique sound all her own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "88bit ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8401210.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Classical, Piano, Video Game Music, Vgm", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "88bit is the alter ego of Cleveland-based pianist, Rob Kovacs, where he performs note-for-note piano arrangements of classic video game soundtracks from the original Nintendo Entertainment System.

Surrounded by a musical family, John first picked up the harmonica at the young age of 14. Heavily influenced by harmonica playing Grandfather + Uncle and by many other famous Harmonica greats. He spent hours on end emulating and playing along with friends and recordings. In 2003 when during a major life changing summer John decided to pack his entire life into his jeep and trek cross-country and relocated here in San Francisco. John now plays acoustic shows around The SF Bay Area and plays lead guitar in The American Economy.(www.reverbnation.com/theamericaneconomy + https://www.facebook.com/aeshenanigans) .

Love & Special Sauce ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10296588.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Country Blues, Jazz, Jazz Blues, Jazz-funk, Blues-rock, Rock, Blues", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cWhen you get the spark, you got to ride that energy,\u201d says G. Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage. Whether Love Saves The Day makes one dollar or a million isn\u2019t a big concern to him. It stands as a huge success because he made the gritty, honest album that he intended by \u201ckeeping it raw, keeping it immediate, keeping it real.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that he has honed over the years: \u201cbe original and be true to what you do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To Benefit Music Farm, Charleston"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alyssa Bonagura ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6905006.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Americana, Country", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A fixture on Nashville's Indie singer-songwriter scene - Rolling Stone\n\nStunning, Original, A Future star in the making. - Robin Gibb\n\nOne listen and it becomes crystal clear that Alyssa Bonagura was born to make music. With a voice that touches somewhere deep inside, Alyssa\u2019s soulful sound and powerful lyrics will send you jet-setting into a broad range of human emotions. Growing up on the open roads of America, with her RCA country recording artists parents, Baillie & The Boys, made it impossible for Alyssa not to witness the power and magic of music. At just 3 weeks old, her cradle was the gentle rocking of a tour bus. Her play ground encompassed sound checks at fairs and festivals and back stage dressing rooms at a slew of different venues including the Grand Ole Opry and Country Music Award shows, and her \u201cextended family\u201d consisted of managers, promoters, roadies, musicians and other fellow mainstream country artists.\n\nAt the age of 3, Alyssa performed on the Ralph Emory television show, Nashville Now. Where her version of the Leslie Gore classic; It\u2019s My Party brought the house down in front of millions of national viewers. At age 10, one of those major acts, Kenny Rogers, decided Alyssa was the perfect child singer to record a duet with him on his Christmas CD, Christmas From The Heart. By age 13, Alyssa had her first batch of songs written and received an endorsement from Gretsch Guitars. She had figured out her own unique style of guitar playing with open tunings inspired by Joni Mitchell. By age 16 she landed her first 50 date tour opening up for Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives. It soon became obvious that she was the real deal, not only as a musician and singer but as a prolific songwriter as well.\n\nWhile in high-school, Alyssa became a go-to session singer for people like Christian artist Matt Maher, where she created her own layered harmony vocal approach from years of hearing her parents sing together. Her songs started finding their way into television shows, (Switched! on ABC Family, MTV), movies, as well as getting her first cuts on other artists projects.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Alyssa received a full scholarship from Sennheiser to Paul McCartney\u2019s Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts in Liverpool England, where she would spend the next three years earning a degree in Sound Technology while continuing to perform in local venues throughout Europe. While playing at a venue called The Zanzibar in Liverpool, Alyssa was spotted by Liverpool Rock Star Pete Wylie and was asked to join his band playing electric guitar and singing background vocals. Alyssa of course said yes, and experienced what most artists never experience; a private performance requested by the Queen to help support one of Liverpool\u2019s local charities. A performance with Ringo Starr at the 800th Anniversary of Liverpool\u2019s, \u201cCapital Of Culture 2008\u201d event; a performance slot at one of the UK\u2019s largest music festivals; Knowsley Hall on the same bill as The Who, and from there on scored her own slots performing on the Acoustic stage at Glastonbury in 2009, and a UK tour opening for Raul Malo of The Mavericks.\n\nWhile at LIPA, Alyssa was inspired by their music community and the extreme amount of talented people attending the school. She lived in Lennon Studios, an apartment complex that used to be the old maternity ward where John Lennon was born. Her incredibly unique experiences abroad inspired her debut album, The English Diaries, an all acoustic intimate collection of songs she produced and recorded herself in her one bedroom Beatles inspired flat.\n\nAfter graduating LIPA and receiving her diploma from Paul McCartney himself, Alyssa returned to Nashville and signed her first publishing deal with Rondor Music. While signed to Rondor, she produced and released her sophomore album Love Hard which was backed by a 10k dollar Kickstarter Campaign and landed one of the biggest nationwide commercial placements of 2012 with her song, \u201cI Make My Own Sunshine,\u201d inspired by Liverpool\u2019s rainy weather. It was featured in a Lowe\u2019s commercial, earning over 50,000 downloads in its first 3 months and over 1 million plays on Spotify. She had no idea at the time that her song would later be heard by Steven Tyler and recorded on his first ever solo album, We\u2019re All Somebody From Somewhere and that she would be the only solo writer on his debut #1 billboard Country album.\n\nAlyssa\u2019s many other accomplishments in the singer/songwriter community include: Writing with Jeffrey Steele, Michelle Branch, Hunter Hayes, and JD Souther, writing three songs on Jessie James Decker\u2019s top 5 Billboard Country album \u201cComin\u2019 Home\u201d and co-writing top 40 billboard country radio single, \u201cLights Down Low\u201d, winning Canadian songwriter of the year and song of the year for \u201cI Only Smoke When I Drink\u201d by the Small Town Pistols, co-writing Jana Kramer\u2019s latest country radio single \u201cCircles\u201d and a #17 AC Billboard Chart Christmas duet with Matthew & Gunner Nelson called \u201cThis Christmas\u201d which she wrote with the twins and her father, Michael Bonagura. She\u2019s also had three #1 hits in Australia with Morgan Evans and Chelsea Basham and produced music for Jo Dee Messina & Rachel Reinert of Gloriana.\n\nAt 28 years old, Alyssa has become a songwriting seamstress for a number of artists, a producer, and a band member of the west coast folk & classic rock n\u2019 roll sounds of The Sisterhood Band with friend Ruby Stewart, all while simultaneously having a career as a solo artist. She\u2019s created life long friendships with fellow songwriters, artists and musicians, and has been called \u201cA fixture on Nashville\u2019s indie singer-songwriter scene\u201d by Rolling Stone. It\u2019s been over 4 years since she\u2019s released a solo project, but when you hear her newest record Road Less Traveled, you\u2019ll know it was worth the wait.\n\nAfter an entire summer of recording plans with an outside producer had fallen through, Alyssa turned to her boyfriend Graham Whitford for guidance on what was the best way forward for the songs she so much believed in. They decided to call long time friend and engineer Mark Petaccia to see if he was available to help record at his studio Petti Sound in Berry Hill. By a simple twist of fate, he had 7 days free.\n\nHer closest friends and family who are all a part of the Nashville underground music community decided to come together and help her create Road Less Traveled without the help of a label and purely for the love and support of their friend. The entire album was recorded live, produced by Alyssa & Mark Petaccia, Mastered by Richard Dodd and executive produced by Karen Whitford. Alyssa showcases her multi-instrumental talents by playing acoustic guitar in her signature open tunings, Piano, Ukulele, Lap Steel, Electric guitar, Bass, B3 and Harmonica. She\u2019s backed by Graham Whitford, Caleb Crosby, and Noah Denney (3/4ths of Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown), String arrangers and players Eleonore Denig and Molly Cherryholmes (Mountain Heart), Kevin McGowan, Tarka Layman, fellow artist and songwriter Davis Naish, and her father Michael Bonagura on Electric guitar.\n\nRoad Less Traveled showcases Alyssa as a solo artist in her truest form to date and shares the journey of finding her own voice and paving her own path as an independent Country artist. It encompasses elements of early Sheryl Crow mixed with Joni Mitchell like vocals. You'll hear so many iconic female influences on this project. Alyssa blends them all extremely well to come up with a sound that is familiar in its harkening back to the greats from multiple decades, yet completely unique and unlike anything else one would hear today. Road Less Traveled comes out for pre-order 8.19.16 and will be available 9.23.16.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Screaming Orphans ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9018890.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Pop, World Folk, Irish, Irish Rock, Celtic Folk, Celtic, Traditional Celtic, Irish Folk, Irish Festivals, Traditional Celtic Music, Folk, World Music, Celtic Rock, Celtic Folk Rock, World ., Celtic Pop, Irish Music.

And that makes Rodg one of the rare-breed. The humble Dutchman is one of the best kept Armada Music secrets, delivering top-notch releases on a regular basis.\n\nAn impressive string of features on various Armada compilations proved to be the stepping stone for Rodg, renowned for a sound that sticks out. Since, he has put out a slew of genre-defying cuts, changing the game entirely through massive collaborations and solid remixes for artists such as Paul Oakenfold, Armin van Buuren, Solid Stone, Cosmic Gate and Ruben de Ronde.\n\nThanks to extensive support from a gamut of top-tier performers (e.g. Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Above & Beyond, Markus Schulz, Gareth Emery, Nicky Romero, W&W, Andrew Rayel and even Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and David Guetta), Rodg has been getting the recognition he deserves, even touted \u201cOne of the best producers of 2016\u201d by Armin van Buuren. Seeing his in-studio diligence pay off, Rodg released his debut album in mid-2016 and grabbed early support from Armin van Buuren, Gareth Emery and Above & Beyond, all the while riding the US airwaves with title track \u2018High On Life\u2019, which accumulated over two million streams on Spotify to date.\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t stop there. After countless collaborations with long-time friend and production partner Ruben de Ronde, on came a collaborative effort that dropped jaws and pushed their sound to an even higher level. With their joint album called \u2018Togetherr\u2019, Rodg and Ruben de Ronde emerged with a body of work that serves as a testament to their consistent high-quality output and became Mixmag\u2019s \u201calbum of the month\u201d with a 9 out of 10 rating.\n\nOn the live front, the Rodg sound has become inseparable from Armin van Buuren\u2019s live sets and the Dutchman himself has since brandished his own sonic blend at A State Of Trance shows in Utrecht, Ibiza, and Mexico, Armada Nights, and various other unforgettable shows at H\u00ef Ibiza, Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival and more. He is the workhorse of the Armada family and a mainstay on countless worldwide Dance compilations. He is the present and the future of Electronic Dance Music, yet seemingly always underrated.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s positive or optimistic or whatever, but that's what's going on with me.\u201d\n\nBrendan Benson finds himself in an enviable spot as he enters the third decade of a remarkably creative, consistently idiosyncratic career \u2013 an accomplished frontman, musician, songwriter, producer, band member, husband, and dad. Benson\u2019s seventh solo album, and first new LP in almost seven years, DEAR LIFE is this consummate polymath\u2019s most inventive and upbeat work thus far, an 11-track song cycle about life, love, family, fatherhood, and the pure joy of making music. Produced and almost entirely performed by Benson at his own Readymade Studio in Nashville, the album sees the Michigan-born, Nashville-based artist \u2013 and co-founder, with Jack White, of The Raconteurs \u2013 reveling in a more modernist approach than ever before, fueled by a heady brew of cannabis, hip-hop, and a newly discovered interest in software drum programming. The result is an untapped playfulness that elevates expertly crafted songs like the opener, \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d and the first single, \u201cGood To Be Alive,\u201d with voluble arrangements, elastic grooves, and incandescent power. Imbued with revitalized ambition and confidence, DEAR LIFE is Brendan Benson at his very best.\n\nBeginning with his now-classic 1996 major label debut, ONE MISSISSIPPI \u2013 recently reissued by Third Man in its first-ever vinyl pressing \u2013 and its masterful 2002 follow-up, LAPALCO, Benson has always infused classic craftsmanship with contemporary invention. Along with his own critically acclaimed canon, Benson is of course co-founder \u2013 with Jack White, Jack Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler \u2013 of The Raconteurs. The band first convened in 2006, winning worldwide acclaim, GRAMMY\u00ae Award nominations, and a chart-topping smash single in \u201cSteady As She Goes,\u201d with their now-classic debut album, BROKEN BOY SOLDIERS. The Raconteurs returned two short years later with 2008\u2019s CONSOLERS OF THE LONELY. Like its predecessor, the LP proved a popular and critical phenomenon, earning the GRAMMY\u00ae Award for \u201cBest Engineered Non-Classical Album\u201d as well as a nomination as \u201cBest Rock Album.\u201d\n\nDEAR LIFE came about gradually and organically after a self-imposed creative hiatus rooted in the happy arrival of his son and later, a daughter. Having spent the majority of his adult life on the road, Benson decided he\u2019d prefer to stay home for a change and just be a dad.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so enamored with my kids, I just sort of lost touch with my career. I just didn\u2019t want to go back to work.\u201d\n\nInstead, Benson directed his musical energies elsewhere and fast proved an in-demand producer/engineer (Robyn Hitchcock, Young The Giant, Trapper Schoepp, The Greenhornes) and collaborative songwriter, with a CV that includes partnerships with Jake Bugg, Iain Archer (Snow Patrol), and The Kooks\u2019 Luke Pritchard, among others. Despite his successes, after a few years in this voluntary wilderness, Benson surprised himself in 2017 by writing and recording the rocker \u201cHalf A Boy (And Half A Man).\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just felt really good,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like I was like born again. Seriously, it was almost a religious experience, like, oh my God, I love making music. I had forgotten. That\u2019s how it started. It was kind of a spark. A re-ignition.\u201d\n\nThough Benson wasn\u2019t \u201cconsciously making a record,\u201d the songs kept coming. Rather than overthink every move, he simply let go. He got stoned in his studio and worked on music simply because it made him happy.\n\n\u201cI started dreaming again,\u201d Benson says. \u201cGetting lost in the music and just letting it take me. Not being so serious, not thinking I was some sort of great writer or producer. I just enjoyed myself. I wasn\u2019t racking my brain on how to from one chord to the next. I wasn\u2019t trying to come up with the best lyrics ever. I was just having fun.\u201d\n\nBenson worked with surprising intensity, most days skipping meals until long after dark. Determined to keep moving forward, he opted to play virtually every instrument on his own. Though a skilled drummer in his own right, Benson began working with Pro Tools and an array of other drum programming software.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a self-taught only child,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go elsewhere for things. If I want drums, I think, OK, how do I create drums? Well, I\u2019ve got to play them or I\u2019ve got to program them. It\u2019s all happening really quickly. I don\u2019t have time to wait for some guy to come over and learn the song, all that crap.\u201d\n\nWorking with programming helped free Benson from his previous creative habits, opening up uncharted paths and new approaches towards making his music.\n\n\u201cI may never go back to playing the drums,\u201d Benson says. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true, but it is a lot of fun. It\u2019s a different discipline entirely. On the drum kit, you feel it out, see what feels good or whatever. But with software drums, you\u2019re constructing beats with your hands, with a mouse, and with a keyboard. It\u2019s really weird. So of course you do things that you wouldn\u2019t do on a drum kit. It\u2019s like, wow, I never would have played that beat. And then the options are limitless. Everything is right at your fingertips.\u201d\n\nUnrestrained by anything other than his own imagination, Benson drew less from genre and more from his own instincts, melding jangle and crunch, hook and riff, pomp and subtlety, into something original and his own. Sonic motivation came from a range of unexpected sources, spanning hip-hop icons like Vince Staples and Kendrick Lamar to the top 40 hits his kids played around the house.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always kind of battling cynicism,\u201d he adds, \u201cbeing a cynic about music. So listening to what my kids listen to, it helps me break down the barriers in myself. The kids put on Justin Bieber and my knee jerk reaction is to turn it off. But I don\u2019t. I\u2019m forced to listen in and by God, I start liking it. I find something good in it and then that maybe pops up in my music.\u201d\n\nWith the aesthetic doors blown open, Benson saw his songs grow more complex, multi-tiered, and rhapsodic. From the future funk-fueled \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d through \u201cGood To Be Alive\u201d and the madcap \u201cFreak Out,\u201d to the elegiac finale, \u201cWho\u2019s Gonna Love You,\u201d his long vaunted knack for pure pop craftsmanship is paired with a progressive, left-of-center dynamism unlike anything in his body of work.\n\nWhile tracks like \u201cDear Life\u201d and the ecstatic \u201cRichest Man Alive\u201d are undeniably animated and even joyful, Benson is quick to note that there\u2019s more going on than necessarily meets the ear. The buoyant melodies and irrepressible hooks are tinted with self-doubt and instinctive irony, their affirmative messages colored by encroaching middle age and the songwriter\u2019s own mortality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just singing about me,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI\u2019m almost 50 and it\u2019s freaking me out so that\u2019s kind of coming up in the songs.\u201d\n\nAfter almost two years, DEAR LIFE was finally approaching completion. Benson signed on with new management and began talking with labels, ready at last to return to the fray. And then Jack called.\n\n\u201cMy wife was like, OK, off you go,\u201d he says. \u201cSeriously, I was stoked. That band is fun. I get to be in a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band, that\u2019s my dream. And I get to share it all with a bunch of guys that I love and respect.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a decade, The Raconteurs finally returned to action in 2019 with their critically acclaimed, chart-topping third LP, HELP US STRANGER, highlighted in part by a couple of songs Benson had been kicking around for his own LP, \u201cOnly Child\u201d and \u201cSomedays (I Don\u2019t Feel Like Trying).\u201d The Raconteurs\u2019 epic 2019 world tour proved equally successful, playing to ecstatic sold-out houses from Nashville to New Zealand and all points in-between. Still buzzing with big rock energy, Benson returned home and recorded two more for DEAR LIFE: the short, sharp \u201cI\u2019m In Love\u201d and the persistent slacker anthem, \u201cI Quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Raconteurs helped me get off my ass and get back into the swing of things,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI got to exercise that muscle again. I came home really excited just to get back to my thing. Whereas before, I think I was a little overwhelmed. It\u2019s daunting to make a record and get a band together and tour an album. But now I\u2019m really ready. It\u2019s not so daunting.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Benson is currently considering how to bring DEAR LIFE to life. Having made a record he can take unabashed pride in, he is determined to continue defying expectations and resisting easy pigeonholes. DEAR LIFE marks a milestone on what has already been an atypical artistic journey as well as a bold signpost towards future triumphs, a showcase for Benson\u2019s matchless gifts for wry introspection, insightful wordplay, and powerhouse melody, once again affirming his place among the finest singer-songwriters of this or any era.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Judah & The Lion ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8988380.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Bluegrass, Country, Folk-hop", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Over My Head: https://jatl.lnk.to/overmyhead", "otherInfo": "FRIENDS AT HOME FEST!

Pool had carved out a unique place for himself in the bass music community; performing under the moniker of SPL for over 10 years and releasing drum & bass, dubstep, and trap-oriented music on respected labels such as Barcode, Tech Itch, Evol Intent, Sub Human, Rottunn, and SMOG Recordings. SPL\u2019s music was fully immersed in sound design, a musical landscape comprised of melodic, dark, and refined touches. By the Summer of 2014, Pool came to the realization that he had pushed the SPL project to its sonic boundaries and in order to evolve musically, he would need a new project to explore lighter textures and richer melodies. Rooted in jungle and bass music and built around elements of blippy 8-bit sounds, arpeggios, and lush 80s synths, Champagne Drip launched as a decidedly tropical and uplifting sounding project. Operating at first in anonymity, Champagne Drip made a big splash thru the release of official remixes of Bassnectar (Amorphous Music) and Elliphant (Mad Decent). Shortly thereafter, he released his debut EP \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d on Mad Decent in September of 2014. Over the first year of the project\u2019s history, press outlets were fascinated with the unique sound, but also with uncovering the identity of the secretive producer behind the music. \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d was subsequently remixed by electronic upstarts Big Wild, Lazerdisk, Mayhem, and Son of Kick and released in the Spring of 2015 as \u201cRemix Bikini\u201d. In the Fall of 2015, Champagne Drip released his 2nd EP for Mad Decent, \u201cJourney Into The Champagne Sea\u201d. Whereas his first EP explored more overtly tropical overtones, \u201cJourney\u201d went into deeper and darker musical territory. After spending one full year refining his sound in the studio, he finally revealed himself as the former SPL in 2016; performing across the US at such festivals as Mysteryland, WTFest?, Imagine, Enchanted Forest, and Lights All Night. Building up anticipation for his next original recordings, Champagne Drip released the stand alone single \u201cOpen Your Eyes\u201d, which was featured on the official Bernie Sanders Presidential campaign fundraising compilation \u201cRave4Bernie\u201d. Official remixes for Grandtheft (Mad Decent), Cardinox (Warner Brothers), and Dillon Francis & NGHTMRE (Mad Decent) followed. Champagne Drip capped off an already busy 2016 with the release of two new EPs; \u201cPoseidon\u201d via Quality Goods Records and \u201cOf Course I Still Love You\u201d via Saturate Records. Official remixes for Zeds Dead & Diplo, UZ, and DAWN all saw early 2017 releases. Champagne Drip is set to have his biggest year yet in 2017, with multiple EPs scheduled for release on Deadbeats Records as well as forthcoming remixes for 12th Planet and Mayhem, which are due for Summer releases. https://twitter.com/champagnedrip https://soundcloud.com/champagnedrip https://www.instagram.com/champagnedrip Bookings: champagnedripbookings@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.twitch.tv/cardinalnow"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Melissa Etheridge ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10282232.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Country, Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Join the Official Melissa Etheridge Fan Club: https://melissaetheridge.com/store", "otherInfo": "#ConcertsFromHome"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Wheeland Brothers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6857251.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Surfy, Jimmy Buffett, Surf, Pirate, Islandreggae, Sandy, Soft Rock, Sand, Beach, Surf Rock, California Country, No Shoes, California Reggae, Surf Music E Reggae., Reggae-pop, Reggae, Barefoot Country, Acoustic, Alternative Rock, Beachy, Ocean", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "We are the Wheeland Brothers.

His band in high school, M!ND fURY, wrote and recorded 100 songs, all of them good (lol). Out of high school he formed the band Digma while he also DJd raves around the Midwest. Digma tracked their ep at Smart Studios in Madison, WI. The famed studio Nirvana rehearsed what would become Nevermind, and The Smashing Pumpkins tracked their debut album.\n\n\n\nIn 2002 Voidova moved north to Minneapolis and formed Xerus. Over the next 6 years Xerus would tour the nation, have songs on college radio coast to coast, play SXSW and release two e.p.'s on their label, SkinCell Record Group.\n\n\n\nWith Xerus taking a break 2008, Voidova set his sights on a city where music business is actually a thing that is happening. In 2009 he moved to Los Angeles and joined an arena rock band called Machine Empire. Taking on the roll of only singing for the first time, Voidova made his mark on the soon to be extinct Sunset Strip Metal scene. Machine Empire's fan base began to grow, and a documentary film was being shot of the band, to be shopped to major networks. Alas, the band imploded and the footage never saw the light of day, except for one trailer. Opening for LA Guns at the now closed Knitting Factory was one of many highlights of the early days of Machine Empire.\n\n\nOver the next few years, Voidova bounced from project to project. Wrapped up in work, life, and love, putting together another band wasn't a priority. Now living in Santa Monica with his beautiful lady, he settled in and began writing what would become his next incarnation, Salt Altar. \"each/other\" was released on Bandcamp in 2014. A music video for his take on Madonna's \"Open Your Heart,\" from the viewpoint of a male stalker was released to promote the album.\n\n\nIn 2015 Voidova moved to San Francisco for work. He wrote and recorded what would become the Park Regent e.p. After having friends listen to it, the urge to release it and get it out to the masses struck. He moved back to Santa Monica, and through a friend he found HRDRV, the indie label he is now signed to. The rest is history being written right now. New Voidova music is in the works. The first single, \"Desire\" off of the new album, \"Broken Clouds,\" is scheduled to be released 5/1/20 on all major streaming platforms. \"Broken Clouds\" will be released shortly after, in late May/early June.

Leaving the past where it belongs, accepting there\u2019s no way to know what\u2019s ahead, and challenging himself to be present in both love and life. It\u2019s heady stuff. It also rocks.\n\nWith a career full of critical acclaim and popular success, Carll could\u2019ve played it safe on this, his sixth record, but he didn\u2019t. The result is a musically ambitious and lyrically deep statement of an artist in his creative prime.\n\nHayes Carll\u2019s list of accomplishments is long. His third album, 2008\u2019s Trouble In Mind, earned him an Americana Music Association Award for Song of the Year (for \u201cShe Left Me for Jesus\u201d). The follow-up, KMAG YOYO was the most played album on the Americana Chart in 2011 and spawned covers by artists as varied as Hard Working Americans and Lee Ann Womack, whose version of \u201cChances Are\u201d garnered Carll a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers swept the Austin Music Awards, and was his fourth record in a row to reach #1 on the Americana Airplay chart. Kelly Willis and Kenny Chesney have chosen to record his songs and his television appearances include The Tonight Show, Austin City Limits, and Later w/Jools Holland. Carll is the rare artist who can rock a packed dancehall one night and hold a listening room at rapt attention the next.\n\n\u201cRepeating myself creatively would ultimately leave me empty. Covering new ground, exploring, and taking chances gives me juice and keeps me interested.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wanted to find the next level. On What It Is, he clearly has.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessarily easy to get there. Carll\u2019s last release, 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers was an artistic and commercial risk \u2014 a bold move which eschewed the tempo and humor of much of his previous work. The record revealed a more serious singer-songwriter dealing with more serious subjects \u2014 divorce, new love in the middle of life, parenting, the worth of work. What It Is finds him now on the other side, revived and happy, but resolute \u2014 no longer under the impression that any of it comes for free.\n\n\u201cI want to dig in so this life doesn\u2019t just pass me by. The more engaged I am the more meaning it all has. I want that to be reflected in the work.\u201d\n\nAnd meaning there is. Carll sings \u201cbut I try because I want to,\u201d on the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cNone\u2019Ya.\u201d He\u2019s not looking back lamenting love lost, rather, finding joy and purpose in the one he\u2019s got and hanging on to the woman who sometimes leaves him delightedly scratching his head. \u201cIf I May Be So Bold,\u201d finds him standing on similar ground \u2014 lyrically taking on the challenge of participating fully in life rather than discontentedly letting life happen.\n\nBold enough to not surrender bold enough to give a damn\n\nBold enough to keep on going or to stay right where I am\n\nThere\u2019s a whole world out there waiting full of stories to be told\n\nI\u2019ll heed the call and tell\u2019em all if I may be so bold\n\nThere\u2019s no wishy washy here and he\u2019s not on the sidelines. In fact, he\u2019s neck-deep in life. On the rambunctious, fiddle-punctuated, \u201cTimes Like These,\u201d he laments political division in America while delivering a rapid-fire plea to \u201cdo my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor, while keeping all my joie de vivre.\u201d Carll\u2019s signature cleverness and aptitude for so-personal-you-might-miss-it political commentary is as strong as ever. The stark, \u201cFragile Men,\u201d co-written with singer-songwriter Lolo, uses humor and dripping sarcasm to examine his gender\u2019s resistance to change in less than three minutes of string-laden, almost Jacques Brel invoking drama. It\u2019s new musical territory for Carll, and the result is powerful. His voice is strong and resonant on these songs, and it\u2019s thrilling to hear him use it with a new authority. He is alternately commanding and tender, yet always soulful.\n\nCarll returned to trusted producer Brad Jones (producer of 2008\u2019s Trouble in Mind and 2011\u2019s KMAG YOYO) and Alex the Great Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to record What It Is, and recruited singer-songwriter, author, and fiancee Allison Moorer as co-producer. The production is adventurous while keeping the focus on the singer and his songs and providing a path for him to go where he wants to go. Where that is, is forward.\n\nThat\u2019s evident in the songwriting. Carll continues to hone his singular voice, but is also a flexible co-writer. Matraca Berg, Charlie Mars, Adam Landry, and Moorer have co-writing credits here, but it was Moorer\u2019s inspiration that provided the largest impact.\n\n\u201cOn the songwriting front she\u2019s just a pro. She helps me cut through the noise and she does it with wit and style.\u201d\n\nCarll\u2019s own wit and style has never been more evident. Whether it\u2019s with the put-you-in-picture detail of, \u201cBeautiful Thing,\u201d the not quite sheepish enough, dude-esque defense of dishonesty in, \u201cThings You Don\u2019t Wanna Know,\u201d or the strong as a tree trunk declaration of love on, \u201cI Will Stay,\u201d he displays an increasing command of his poetic lexicon.\n\nWriters most often wrestle with experience and expectations, either romanticizing the past or telling us how good it\u2019s going to be when they get where they\u2019re going. What It Is is a record that is rooted solidly in the present, revealing an artist in the emotional and intellectual here and now.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Devin Dawson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7772871.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Americana, Soul, R&b, Folk, Country, Rock, R&b/soul, Rnb-soul", "Time": "10:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Warner Music Nashville / Atlantic Records artist Devin Dawson is not your typical country artist.

Getting creative and inspiring groups. Making murals with students, teaching fiddle tunes and leading stringbands. Setting up Art shows. Film screenings and community conversations. Working with school groups. Deepening the interaction and community involvement. For select dates he is available for songwriting workshops in conjunction with a public concert. He is an experienced facilitator, and has been invited to teach at many retreats including SummerSongs, The Swannanoa Gathering in North Carolina, at the Goderich Celtic College in Goderich Ontario, the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest in London Ontario and the Yearly Quaker Gathering in Rhode Island.\n\n\u201cJoe has that rare, genuine ability to communicate with, instruct, and entertain all ages. From toddlers to octogenarians, he turned on and tuned in everyone he came in contact with! The feedback during his three days here at the Fayetteville Public Library was overwhelmingly positive.

Three years ago, the Chicago-based trio parted ways with their indie rock roots to record their own take on the hip hop classic \u201cSummertime.\u201d With a smooth bed of 808s and hand claps, the song made the rounds on lists of must-download summer songs and landed the band on Comedy Central\u2019s Tosh.0. But the American reception to the song paled in comparison to an unlikely spot on the map: Lithuania. While the band continued to wage the American DIY-band battle for attention at small club shows around the US, the situation was much different in the former member of the USSR. The band had become a household name, and the song\u2019s accompanying video had racked up more than one million views. \u201cWe started to get all these messages from fans in Eastern Europe about how much they loved the song,\u201d lead singer David McMillin says. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t think that we were catching on somewhere halfway around the world.\u201d Fast forward to 2015, and there was a big reason to start to believe their own hype: the US Embassy in Lithuania offered to bring Fort Frances to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, to headline one of the city\u2019s biggest summer festivals, Loftas Fest. The lineup included Mercury Prize-winning Young Fathers and XL/Terrible Records rapper Le1f. \u201cHere we are, this unknown band with our name alongside some of these huge artists from around the world,\u201d bassist Jeff Piper says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even believe we were going until we were on the plane.\u201d When the band touched down, they stepped into a scene reminiscent of Rodriguez discovering his fans in \u201cSearching for Sugar Man.\u201d The band\u2019s name was plastered on billboards and street signs. They appeared on \u201cGood Morning, Lithuania.\u201d They headlined the sold-out opening night of the festival. It was clear the band had found a second home. \u201cOur week in Lithuania was one of the most rewarding times of my life,\u201d McMillin says. \u201cYou start playing music in a garage without a clue of where it can take you. I never would have expected the road could lead us to a stage in the former Eastern Bloc.\u201d That same road brought them back home to put the finishing touches on a new full-length album with Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter, Lake Street Dive) in a studio tucked away in the woods of Parsonsfield, Maine with a refreshed outlook on creative exploration. The New England retreat gave the band an opportunity to cross into unfamiliar sonic territory. \u201cThere are moments on this record I never would have imagined we would have been able to make a few years ago,\u201d drummer Aaron Kiser says.

Inspired by the dramatic landscape and vast seasonal changes that range as much in temperature as they do in color, she reaches for the earth itself in its various forms to give her a sense of belonging. As the daughter of musicians and missionaries, this brought her to experience pivotal years of her childhood in Central America. Naturally, music became a tool through which she could make sense of the world and put down roots, despite a lingering feeling of displacement.\nAs evidenced in her songs, there is a lustrous display of tension and relief; a relationship between vulnerability and strength, death and rebirth, pain and love. Existing in performance as much as in song, this ongoing conflict allows audiences to gain a glimpse of Sabella\u2019s true persona; she may break your heart, but shortly thereafter will invite you in for a cup of tea, enjoyed most with whiskey.\nAfter experimenting with fresh palets and uncharted terrain, Sabella has established a sound she\u2019s been ever yearning for with Forgive the Birds, the second full-length studio album, to be released this April. Forgive the Birds is both earthbound and ethereal, revealing gripping melodies and intimate lyrics with an unabashedly earnest delivery. Her voice, described as \u201choneyed, but with a mild rasp\u201d by Redline Roots, dances over a finger-picked 1965 hollow-body Gibson; a signature sound of the record and a staple in performance, they make for a pair that seems to know one another, trusted companions both in writing and in travel.\nWorking with Daniel Radin of The Novel Ideas to produce Forgive the Birds, and enlisting the engineering talents of Harris Paseltiner, of Boston-based band Darlingside, this is, without a doubt, a homegrown record.

In '87 Jask began djing at the age of 13. Influences consisted of soul, jazz, funk, r&b, hip hop, rock, new wave, disco, early electro & freestyle. A year later he would soon discover and quickly embrace a passion for the music that was coming out of Chicago & New York, known as the underground house sound. Jask was one of the major players to introduce the acid jazz sound to Tampa & most of central Florida in the early 90's. He held Tampa's longest running eclectic loungin' night called, \"Martini Jazz\". It took place every Thursday night at a club called the Castle which ran from '94 to '96. The \"Martini Jazz\" night brought some notoriety to Jask, which eventually led him to assist in the promotions of \"Groove Collective's (NYC) first ever performance in the Tampa area. In December of 1995, Jask started Tampa's first weekly soulful underground house night called, \"Jacks House\". During its successful over a decade ongoing run, Jask has played alongside various talented djs such as: Mark Farina, Dj Disciple, Benji Candelario, Marques Wyatt, Doug Smith, Brian Tappert , Miguel Migs, King Britt, Tedd Patterson, Tommy Musto, Kaskade, Pete Moss, David Harness, Rasoul, Julius Papp, Matthias Heibronn, Jay-J, Little Louie Vega, Frankie Feliciano, Karizma, Mark Grant, Johnny Fiasco, Diz, Collete, Heather, Tortured Soul, Cevin Fisher, Harry Choo Choo Romero, Cajmere, Lisa Shaw, JJK and many other luminaries in the dance music industry...As of Today, Jask still holds down Jack's House(Tuesdays) and a new night called, \"Paradise\" which has become the new Underground house night in the Tampa area and features guest djs from all around the globe. On the production and remix side of the musical pendulum, Jask has appeared on such notable labels as: Vega, King Street/NiteGrooves, I!Records, Swanky, Metaphor, K2/Vinylicious, Step Ahead, Erotic City, DeepTouch, Harlequin, SoulGroove, Soulfuric Deep, Soulfuric, Soufuric Trax, Catch 22, Deeplay, Solu, Om, Vino, Defected, Undo, Large Music, Salted, Sole Channel, Ultra, Rhythm & Culture, Transport & NeoDisco. His most successful project to date is his release on Soulfuric Deep called Jask featuring Jocie \"Beautiful\" it was released at the end of 2001. This was Jask's first original vocal track in which he wrote everything from the music to the lyrics with haunting lush deep vocals from his friend Jocie. It is a special release in which Jask has dedicated it to his late mother who passed away July 31, 2001. Due to the successful Jacks house night in Tampa and his music productions, Jask has had the luxury of performing/djing across the United States and beyond. Such destinations include, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Denver, St. Louis, Atlantic City, Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Washington D.C., Charlotte, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Orlando, Manchester, Boston, Seattle, Chicago, Sante Fe, Albuquerque, Cleveland, San Antonio, Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa, Paris, Lyon, Athens, Laussane, Oslo, London, Santiago, Santo Domingo, San Jose, San Diego, Naples, Dallas, San Antonio, Baltimore, Honolulu, Kauai, Maui and many more.

Recorded at the iconic Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama, Italian Ice finds the Nashville-based artist joined by Spooner Oldham and David Hood (both members of The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, who played on classic records from the likes of Aretha Franklin and Etta James), Binky Griptite of The Dap Kings, Jim Sclavunos and Dave Sherman of The Bad Seeds, and drummer McKenzie Smith (St. Vincent, Midlake). With special guests including Spoon frontman Britt Daniel, Seth Avett of The Avett Brothers, Erin Rae, and John Paul White, the album is a testament to Atkins\u2019s uncommon talent for uniting musicians of radically different sensibilities. As Atkins explains, the abundance of collaborations on Italian Ice partly stems from a freak accident in which she stumbled into a sinkhole in a Knoxville parking lot\u2014an incident that left her with a profound longing to fill her life with the people and experiences that bring her the most joy.\n\nCo-produced by Atkins and Ben Tanner of Alabama Shakes, Italian Ice makes brilliant use of its A-list personnel, unfolding in a kaleidoscopic sound that Atkins likens to \u201can acid trip through my record collection.\u201d At turns as opulent as symphonic pop and gritty as garage punk, the album wanders into shades of psych-rock and honky-tonk and girl-group melodrama, endlessly spotlighting the tightly honed musicianship and unbridled originality at heart of Atkins\u2019s artistry.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Krystofer Maison ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9726188.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "New York, New York", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Krystofer Maison is a New York City-based queer singer-songwriter.

She attended Agnes Scott College with dreams of becoming a doctor, but was offered a record deal with Clive Davis at Arista Records, which looked alot more interesting to her than more school.\n\nWhen it came time to craft her own sound, she took those religious and secular roots, blended in enough folk, blues and rock to satisfy, and came up with a rootsy high-spirited sound that brings acoustic and electric slide and passionate vocals together harkening back to the lost recordings of Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi, and Lucinda Williams.\n\nAfter several major label releases, Malone is now an independent artist with 15 studio records to date and an impressive resume which includes hi profile performances with everyone from Gregg Allman to John Mayer, the Atlanta Symphony to Ellen Degeneres, various awards including best albums, 4x best singer, 3x best acoustic guitarist, and 2 Grammy ballot nominations.

In 2012 she started a college scholarship fund for girls in need. She currently contributes to various women's and children's non-profit organizations, and donates time to local Georgia music organizations and schools.\n\nMalone has performed for TedX Peachtree, sang the National Anthem for The Atlanta Braves and The Houston Comets, been honored with a Signature guitar slide modeled and named after her by Rocky Mountain Slides, was the keynote speaker at a SoCal high school graduation, has been the rhythm guitarist and mandolin player for Kristian Bush (Sugarland), a satellite member of the Indigo Girls, is endorsed by Supro USA Guitars and amps Reunion Blues, and Breedlove guitars and mandolins.

Critics and fans are already responding with praise. The Washington Post called it \"One of the year's best roots-rock releases.\"\n\nLuke is not your typical rock star. Though he appears to have all of the ingredients included in the modern recipe; young, good looking, rebel dress and incredible talent, his music draws from another time - it is reminiscent of artists some decades ago who focused on the timeless art of songwriting.\n\nMarried to his high school sweetheart (a la Bono and fellow Jersey born rocker Jon Bon Jovi), compassion and the challenge of keeping love alive in a modern and dangerous world are recurring themes in Luke's music and his life. They recently took on the added challenge of a foster child born to a drug-addicted mother. His life-long pursuit of music has led him to travels in West Africa, Brazil and Eastern Europe and consistent touring across the country. He studied guitar at Rutgers with Ken Wessel, guitarist with free jazz pioneer Ornette Coleman, and built his main guitar himself. He is also one of the owners of Jammin' Java - a 200 seat music club recently named one of the Top 100 Clubs in the World by Pollstar Magazine.\n\nWhen asked about his influences he names artists from the classic singer/songwriter pantheon such as Dylan, Neil Young and Van Morrison, the straightforward American songwriters like Springsteen, Tom Petty and Paul Westerberg, the elegance of Nick Drake and early Bruce Cockburn, the rawness and simplicity of early American and British punk, the intricate and revolutionary guitar work of D'Gary, Michael Hedges and Ali Farka Toure, modern songwriters like Joe Purdy, Josh Ritter and Patty Griffin and but also authors and poets like Thomas Merton, Rilke, James Wright, and Rumi.\n\nNo - definitely not typical.\n\nInspired by the early Motown recordings and the classic 70's singer/songwriters records, the entire record was recorded live in the studio with minimal overdubs in only three days. Luke entered the studio in Fall 2006 with a collection of new songs and a stellar band of DC-area musicians including a horn section, brother Daniel on keyboards, and brother-in-law Jared Bartlett as producer.

After all, this accomplished and diverse guitarist has explored several styles in his career\u2014hard rock, rock, surf, and prog, to name a few\u2014and he came home to the blues with 2013\u2019s Deja Blues.\n\nNow, Hoey has forged his deep blues and rock roots into a fiery, organic, and thrilling mix that should delight and astound lovers of the guitar and guitar music.\n\n\u201cLooking back from my first album in 1992, it sure seems like I\u2019m musically schizophrenic,\u201d says Hoey. \u201cBut I truly believed in every style I played. I still do. I wanted to master everything\u2014or at least try to\u2014and every lick from every style I\u2019ve absorbed informs everything I do today. And I love that, because all of that diversity helps me come up with riffs, licks, and melodies that are perhaps deeper and more unique than if I had stayed exclusively with one style.\u201d\n\nOne thing that always stays consistent, however, is Hoey\u2019s impassioned command of the guitar. He\u2019s one of those guitarists who can attack his instrument with feral intensity, and then play something very soft and almost achingly beautiful. This ability to devise phrasing, technique, and tone in the service of feeling the music has not gone unnoticed.\n\nIn 1987, the Boston-born guitarist caught the ear of Ozzy Osbourne\u2014no slouch at picking great guitar players\u2014and almost ended up in his band. (The gig ultimately went to Zakk Wylde.) But Ozzy thought enough of Hoey to implore him to move where the action was\u2014Los Angeles. The relocation paid off big time in 1992, when Hoey scored a major-label record deal with Reprise for his band, Heavy Bones. Sadly, the group was dropped in 1993, but Hoey\u2019s determination won the day. He convinced the label to let him record a low-budget instrumental-guitar album, Animal Instinct, and his version of Focus\u2019 \u201cHocus Pocus\u201d brought Hoey chart success and a successful solo career. Since then, the gigs and accolades have never stopped. Here are some highlights\u2026\n\n\u2022 He scored the soundtrack to Endless Summer II (1994).\n\n\u2022 He recorded \u201cMiserlou \u201997\u201d with surf-guitar icon Dick Dale in 1997.\n\n\u2022 He has provided music for several film and television companies, including Walt Disney, New Line Cinema, and ESPN.\n\n\u2022 He scored the music to the awesome roller-coaster ride California Screaming at Disney\u2019s California Adventure.\n\n\u2022 He produced metal legend Lita Ford\u2019s Living Like a Runaway album.\n\n\u2022 He is a frequent coach and musical director at Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Fantasy Camp.\n\n\u2022 In 2015, he celebrated the 20th anniversary of his holiday CDs and tours under the Ho! Ho! Hoey banner. (Hallmark musical greeting cards feature two of his Ho! Ho! Hoey songs.)\n\n\u2022 He recently completed filming an instructional blues-guitar video for TrueFire online guitar lessons.\n\n\u201cI love playing guitar, and, these days, it takes a creative and administrative commitment to keep a career evolving and growing,\u201d says Hoey. \u201cI\u2019ve learned how to make records, how to manage social-networking campaigns, how to put a tour together, how to sell merchandise, and everything about how to survive in the music business as it exists right now. But it\u2019s all worth it when I hang out with the audience at my shows and talk about music. The human interaction is critical, and having that relationship with my fans is what keeps me writing music and practicing like a demon. I never want to let those people down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to hear Gary sing and play the blues with his trademark intensity, feel and authenticity. And the guitar tones! \u201cDust & Bones is a great sounding Blues/Rock album that\u2019s both vintage and modern at the same time.\u201d Joe Satriani\n\n\u201cI had the pleasure of singing a duet with the great Mr Gary Hoey, on the beautiful ballad called \u201cComing Home.\u201d It\u2019s got some awesome guitar playing in it\u201d Lita Ford\n\nGary Hoey\u2019s awesome command of styles, tones, and techniques drives so many different moods on Dust & Bones that you\u2019ll feel as if he transports you across the musical universe and beyond.\nBuckle up!

The four original members, Scott Blasey (vocals, acoustic guitar), Rob James (6 and 12-string electric guitars, vocals), Greg Joseph (bass, vocals) and David Minarik (drums, vocals) are joined by fellow touring mates Gary Jacob, Skip Sanders and Noah Minarik, tossing out some spanking pedal steel, Hammond organ and tasty guitar. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had more fun composing and recording songs,\u201d says bass player Greg Joseph. \u201cWith our storied recording history, it\u2019s really heartening to know that music can still captivate the band as much as it has on this album.\u201d\n\nWith a highlight reel that includes the Late Show with David Letterman, The Simpsons, and others, The Clarks are enjoying their stage time together now more than ever. \u201cIt\u2019s one big extended family,\u201d says guitarist Rob James. \u201cDave\u2019s son Noah plays on this album, and with us live, so saying that isn\u2019t just a metaphor, it\u2019s fact!\u201d Singing and playing the songs of Madly In Love At The End Of The World has rekindled a fire in The Clarks\u2019 sometimes broken, sometimes mended hearts.\n\nThe Clarks are:\nScott Blasey: Lead Vocals, Electric & Acoustic Guitars\nRobert James: Electric & Acoustic Guitars, Vocals\nGreg Joseph: Bass Guitar, Vocals\nDave Minarik: Drums, Vocals", "otherInfo": "Scott hosting his weekly Live from the Blasement Facebook live stream."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Seth James ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7946955.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Rock, Blues", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/BillyBobsTexas"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "8 Ball Aitken ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8734612.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Swamp Blues", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "For more than a decade, multi-awarded global troubadour, 8 Ball Aitken, has flown the Australian flag on the international circuit performing more than two hundred shows a year, and is thrilled to be back in the place where his heart is.\nImpossibly dedicated to his six-string muse and absolutely devoted to his audiences, 8 Ball Aitken\u2019s funky, foot stomping energy and infectious blend of swampy blues-rock, have brought the party vibe to venues, festivals and high profile music events in the USA, France, Japan, Canada and Europe.\nHe has garnered numerous accolades, awards, rave reviews and recognition across genres with the single, (She\u2019s Going To Mexico) I\u2019m Going To Jail, reaching #1 on the Country and #2 on the Blues charts.\nThe international patron for the Airlie Beach Festival of Music is a prolific singer/songwriter and ace multi-instrumentalist, and brings his 9th self-titled album on the road for the Blazing Blues Summer Tour.\nAll video clips including his USA release, Sleepy, the achingly beautiful Girl In A Million, Seven Bucks An Hour in A Chicken Suit, Yellow Moon and Shut The Front Door may be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/user/8ballaitken.\n\n\u201cOutstanding.

That's what beats at the heart of the South Austin Moonlighters and has since their very first gig. \u201cThe first time we performed an original composition, the instruments and voices fell right into place immediately,\u201d bassist/vocalist Lonnie Trevino says. \u201cIt was obvious that something special was happening. We felt like kids again.\u201d And so it was that Trevino joined forces with guitarists/vocalists Chris Beall and Phil Hurley, and drummer/vocalist Daniel James.\n\nFlash forward about five years to find the Moonlighters solidifying their vision and their voice on their new release, Travel Light. Pulling from all possible corners of roots music \u2014 Americana, folk, country, blues, Southern soul, and rock & roll \u2014 the band's sound coalesces around stellar playing and soaring harmonies, all contributed in a thoroughly egalitarian fashion. \u201cAny one of us could be the 'frontman,'\u201d Beall explains of their four-strong stance. \u201cI think what makes it unique for me is that we are all as supportive of each other as we are for ourselves. That\u2019s a big deal \u2014 it says something about the foundation of the band and why we do what we do to begin with.\u201d\n\nBy sharing songwriting and singing duties, Beall, Hurley, and Trevino each get to have their voices heard which is a rare commodity in band-land. Hurley echoes the uniqueness of that point, \u201cWe\u2019ve all acquired a large tool box of skills through years of musical endeavors. This group allowed us to use them all over the course of one night. Each guy can step up and command your attention, but we are all equally good at listening and supporting. It\u2019s rare to find musicians who are that well-rounded, yet grounded, as well. Egos don\u2019t really have to get in the way because we can all see that success for the group is success for each of us.\u201d\n\nProduced by Anders Osborne, Travel Light aims to achieve that success for the Moonlighters with a big-tent sound. The set opens with \u201cFeels Like Home,\u201d its rough-and-tumble groove cloaking its visceral vulnerability. Though Hurley says that he's never been afraid of hiding his own emotions, the bold rawness of the song's music and meaning might help some to de-couple the cultural connection between vulnerability and weakness in order to find their own inner strength. \u201cThat song came out of the ashes of my life getting really burned to the ground,\u201d the songwriter says. \u201cFor me, that is a song of hope. I wasn\u2019t completely healed, but I was starting to feel that I was getting my legs back under me.\u201d\n\nThe mood shifts for the title track, while not entirely abandoning the grit and gravitas of its predecessor. A Beall contribution,\n\u201cTravel Light\u201d allows that it's easy enough to know what we should do to lighten our loads, and another thing altogether to actually do those things. As he concedes, \u201cSometimes I write about the way I wish things were in hopes that I would make it that way.\u201d Beall's own journey toward traveling light comes in baby steps. \u201cIt begins in small ways \u2014 maybe five-minute increments \u2014 where I let go of something, like working at night, to spend time with my son in his playroom instead. Or maybe it\u2019s a change in the way you think about things. There are internal 'realities' that we hold on to and carry with us throughout life that affect every interaction we have. We cope with disappointments, heartbreak, loss... maybe we should let go of a few of those, too.\u201d\n\nBeing a band from Texas, there are a handful of recurring themes on this album. Topics like small towns, lost women, and blazing guns abound. From the urgent chug of \u201cNowhere Left to Run\u201d to the conscious reflection of \u201cCartersville Rain\u201d to the laid-back shuffle of \u201cBorn Lucky,\u201d the Moonlighters leave no touchstone unturned. But, depending on which band member you ask, that lyrical cohesiveness was either accidental, intentional, or both. \u201cWe all can all relate to these themes,\u201d Trevino offers, \u201cand we believe that, if you are truthful in your art, more people will relate to it. Touching people with our music is a true gift.\u201d\n\nAdds Beall, \u201cWe write what we know, so the the small town theme behind 'Carry Me On' or 'Born Lucky' shines through because of that. 'Girl from Texas' speaks straight from Phil\u2019s experience \u2014 I don\u2019t think there could be a band that didn\u2019t write a song about a woman! The guns part... well, let\u2019s just say that a song gets real serious when people start dyin'.\u201d That being said, Hurley is quick to point out that \u201call of the graves and guns in 'Nowhere Left to Run' are completely fictitious.\u201d\n\nThough superlative writers in their own right, the South Austin Moonlighters drop a couple of cover songs into the mix, as well, including the album's closer, which finds the guys shooting the moon with a Crosby, Stills, and Nash mash-up that combines \u201cDaylight Again\u201d and \u201cFind the Cost of Freedom,\u201d which was suggested by their label. Their rich, honey-like harmonies lift every song they touch, even the iconic ones.\n\n\u201c'Find the Cost of Freedom' is just a chorus, so it seemed ridiculous to do that,\u201d Trevino explains of the initial idea. After a little research, though, he found a video of Stephen Stills playing a solo version of \u201cDaylight Again,\u201d then one of him doing it with Graham Nash. \u201cI said, 'We need to do the harmonies like this!'\u201d Trevino threw together an arrangement while Osborne focused on the message. But the song really came together when Beall and Hurley tuned their acoustic guitars down to A432 instead of the standard A440.\n\n\n\u201cThe whole process of recording that song was really unlike any other recording experience I\u2019ve ever had, and I\u2019ve had many,\u201d Beall says. \u201cI still remember, vividly, us standing in a circle around one microphone and marching \u2014 the words 'all the brave soldiers' not only in our ears, but in our hearts, as well. There was a whole lot more going on for that one that I can\u2019t really explain.\u201d\n\nIn that moment, as in all the others on Travel Light, the South Austin Moonlighters connected to and through the joy of music. And that's a gift they not only give themselves, but also anyone who hears them.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/BillyBobsTexas"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Disco Biscuits ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8206122.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Jamband, Electronica, Electronic", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Comprised of Jon Gutwillig (vocals/guitar), Marc Brownstein (vocals/bass), Aron Magner (keyboard/vocals), and Allen Aucoin (drums), the quartet continues to bridge the gap between the jamband and electronica/dance worlds by drawing on elements from seemingly disparate genres. This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B.

Longtime friend Mike Bishop Smith (drums) completes the trio.On February 14, 2019, The Powell Brothers released their first full length album entitled \u201cLeave On The Light.\u201d Recorded in Nashville at Ravens Landing studio, \u201cLeave On The Light\u201d was produced by Scott Quintana and engineered and mixed by Gena Johnson (\u201cA Star Is Born\u201d soundtrack, Zac Brown Band, Brandi Carlile) and features ten tracks written by Taylor and Blake Powell. The album combines elements of folk-rock, rootsy soul and country, and features a bevy of notable Nashville players including legendary pedal steel guitarist Paul Franklin; Josh Matheny on dobro/lapsteel; Kyle Ryan on banjo; Matt Utterback on bass; Adam Keafer on bass; Will Cafaro on bass and Scott Quintana on drums and percussion.\n\nThe brothers recorded this album during the aftermath and devastation of Hurricane Harvey. Perseverance, resilience and life on the road provide the backdrop for this new collection of songs that staggers artfully between timeless arrangements and sharp songcraft showcasing a defiant, evolving band on the rise. Taylor Powell had this to say about the new record:\n\n\u201cHurricane Harvey definitely changed a lot of things for us,\u201d explains Taylor Powell. \u201cThe plans we had been making for the previous few months were completely wiped out. As we were tearing down our childhood home, there were definitely many moments of despair. But as they say, when you are going through hell, keep on going. Looking back, it actually wiped the slate clean, and gave us an opportunity to do something much greater than we had planned before. We decided to use this as a sign that it was time to make the record we had always wanted to make.\u201d\n\nThe first radio single off the new album was \u201cComing Home,\u201d a love letter to Taylor and Blake Powell\u2019s hometown of Houston, Texas. The single enjoyed seven weeks in the Top 20 on both the TRRR and CDX Traction Texas radio charts. The brothers followed up \u201cComing Home\u201d with the releases of \u201cSomewhere Down The Road,\u201d \u201cThe Way You Are\u201d and the current radio single \u201cWhatever Is Left\u201dreleased to radio on September 6, 2019.\nThe group tours nationally, performing an average of 160 tour dates across 22 states every year.\n\nThe brothers have been featured at major festivals and events like the Oregon Jamboree (Sweet Home, Oregon), Sweet Pea Festival (Bozeman, MT), Oyster Ridge Music Festival (Kemmerer, WY), Memorial Day Music Festival (Dallas, TX), Ziegenbock Music Festival (Corpus Christi, TX) and Merchants & Music Festival (Fort Thomas, KY) to name a few.\n\nThe Powell Brothers\u2019 music really comes to life in their high energy live show. The excellent musicianship and high energy stage show has led to opportunities for the power trio to share the stage with Jon Pardi, Lee Brice, Billy Currington, Josh Turner, Big & Rich, Gary Allan, Montgomery Gentry, Granger Smith, Cody Johnson, Mark Chesnutt, Suzy Bogguss, The Bellamy Brothers, Pat Green, Randy Rogers Band, Jack Ingram and many more.\n\nTaylor Powell and Blake Powell have many interests outside of music, including sports.

The band got things up and running pretty quickly as they played a handful of shows by the early part of 2013. Unfortunately, things were put on hold as fast as they started because the lead singer/lead guitar player decided to take a break from music to start a family. The remaining two members decided to keep the vision of Grunge DNA alive and found some quick luck as the band discovered two new members in very short order to join the band and to fill the void. Grunge DNA officially became a four piece band moving forward. Kevin Harper joined the band as the lead singer and Josh Nichols joined the band as the lead guitarist in May of 2013 making the band complete once again and better than ever. Grunge DNA had really found something going forward and the music really began to take off as these four members performed together at well over 200 shows from 2013 to 2018. In the latter months of 2018, another line up change took place as Kevin Harper and Brian Cahill left the band in November to pursue other musical ventures. David and Josh quickly put their thinking caps on and recruited Patrick Ziemak to take over on lead vocals and Jim Black to take over on bass guitar. The two newest, full-time members were easy selections as they had already been associate members of the band and friends of David and Josh for quite some time with a history of playing the same brand of music.

Two Super-Bowl appearances, Pollstar Box Office chart-topping tours with Def Leppard, Journey, Boston, REO Speedwagon, Bad Company (to name only a few), two more studio albums and no end in sight, STYX continues to conquer the planet, one venue at a time.\n\nSpawned from a suburban Chicago basement in the early \u201870s, Styx would eventually transform into the virtual arena rock prototype by the late '70s and early '80s, due to a fondness for big rockers and soaring power ballads.\n\nEarly on, Styx's music reflected such then-current prog rockers as Emerson, Lake & Palmer and the Moody Blues, as evidenced by such releases as 1972's self-titled debut, 1973's Styx II, 1974's The Serpent Is Rising, and 1975's Man of Miracles. While the albums (as well as non-stop touring) helped the group build a substantial following locally, Styx failed to break through to the mainstream, until a track originally from their second album, \"Lady\" started to get substantial airplay in late '74 on the Chicago radio station WLS-FM. The song was soon issued as a single nationwide, and quickly shot to number six on the singles chart, as Styx II was certified gold. By this time, however, the group had grown disenchanted with their record label, and opted to sign on with A&M for their fifth release overall, 1975's Equinox (their former label would issue countless compilations over the years, culled from tracks off their early releases). On the eve of the tour in support of the album, original guitarist John Curulewski abruptly left the band, and was replaced by Tommy Shaw. Shaw proved to be the missing piece of the puzzle for Styx, as most of their subsequent releases throughout the late '70s earned at least platinum certification (1976's Crystal Ball, 1977's The Grand Illusion, 1978's Pieces of Eight, and 1979's Cornerstone), and spawned such hit singles and classic rock radio standards as \"Come Sail Away,\" \"Renegade,\" \"Blue Collar Man\" and \"Fooling Yourself.\u201d\n\nThe band decided that their first release of the '80s would be a concept album, 1981's Paradise Theater, which was loosely based on the rise and fall of a once-beautiful theater (which was supposedly used as a metaphor for the state of the U.S. at the time -- the Iranian hostage situation, the Cold War, Reagan, etc.). Paradise Theater became Styx's biggest hit of their career (selling over three million copies in a three-year period), as they became one of the U.S. top rock acts due to such big hit singles as \"Too Much Time on My Hands\". It also marked the first time in history that a band released four consecutive triple-platinum albums.\n\nA career-encompassing live album, Caught in the Act, was issued in 1984, before Styx went on hiatus, and the majority of its members pursued solo projects throughout the remainder of the decade. A re-recording of their early hit, \"Lady\" (titled \"Lady\" '95\"), for a Greatest Hits compilation, finally united Shaw with his former Styx bandmates, which led to a full-on reunion tour in 1996. But drummer John Panozzo fell seriously ill at the time (due to a long struggle with alcoholism), which prevented him from joining the proceedings -- as he passed away in July of the same year. Although grief-stricken, Styx persevered with new drummer Todd Sucherman taking the place of Panozzo, as the Styx reunion tour became a surprise sold-out success, resulting in the release of a live album/video, 1997's \"Return to Paradise,\" while a whole new generation of rock fans were introduced to the grandiose sounds of Styx via a humorous car ad which used the track \"Mr. Roboto,\" as well as songs used in such TV shows as South Park and Freaks & Geeks.", "otherInfo": "Join us Saturday night at 8pm EST/5pm PST for STYX FIX LIVE SATURDAY on our official Youtube."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Michael Lee ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8252867.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Progressive Pop Rock, Soul, Pop Rock, Progressive Alternative", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Michael Lee is a prolific songwriter from Bucks, described as having a unique style somewhere between progressive rock and pop.\n\nMichael\u2019s previous releases include his 2009 debut album \u2018Face Forward and his 2014 EP \u2018Blown Away\u2019.\n\nSince the release of the EP, Michael has completed a new album, which explores more of his soulful pop side.

Ball, the 2018 Texas State Musician Of The Year, has won worldwide fame and countless fans for her ability to ignite a full-scale roadhouse rhythm and blues party every time she takes the stage. Her rollicking Texas boogies, swampy New Orleans ballads and groove-laden Gulf Coast blues have made her a one-of-a-kind favorite with music lovers all over the world. With each new release, her reputation as a profoundly soulful singer, a boundlessly talented pianist and a courageous, inventive songwriter continues to grow. Her love of the road has led to years of soul-satisfying performances at festivals, concert halls and clubs. The New York Times says, \"Marcia Ball plays two-fisted New Orleans barrelhouse piano and sings in a husky, knowing voice about all the trouble men and women can get into on the way to a good time.\" The Houston Chronicle says simply, \"She's as perfect as an artist can be.\"\n\nWith her new album, Shine Bright, Ball set out to, in her words, \"Make the best Marcia Ball record I could make.\" In doing so, she has put together the most musically substantial, hopeful and uplifting set of songs of her five-decade career. Produced by Steve Berlin (Los Lobos) and recorded in Texas and Louisiana, Shine Bright contains twelve songs (including nine originals), ranging from the title track's rousing appeal for public and private acts of courage to the upbeat call to action of \"Pots And Pans,\" a song inspired by renowned Texas political writer and humorist Molly Ivins. From the humorous advice of \"Life Of The Party\" to the poignantly optimistic \"World Full Of Love,\" the intensity of Ball's conviction never wavers while, simultaneously, the fun never stops. Shine Bright is exactly the album Ball set out to make. \"It is a ridiculously hopeful, cheerful record,\" she says, in light of some of the album's more serious subject matter. The secret, according to Ball \"is to set the political songs to a good dance beat.\"\n\nBorn in Orange, Texas in 1949 to a family whose female members all played piano, Ball grew up in the small town of Vinton, Louisiana, right across the border from Texas. She began taking piano lessons at age five, playing old Tin Pan Alley and popular music tunes from her grandmother's collection. But it wasn't until she was 13 that Marcia discovered the power of soul music. One day in New Orleans in 1962, she sat amazed as Irma Thomas delivered the most spirited and moving performance the young teenager had ever seen. A few years later she attended Louisiana State University, where she played some of her very first gigs with a blues-based rock band called Gum.\n\nIn 1970, Ball set out for San Francisco. Her car broke down in Austin, and while waiting for repairs she fell in love with the city and decided to stay. It wasn't long before she was performing in local clubs with a progressive country band called Freda And The Firedogs, while beginning to sharpen her songwriting skills. It was around this time that she delved deeply into the music of the great New Orleans piano players, especially Professor Longhair. \"Once I found out about Professor Longhair,\" recalls Ball, \"I knew I had found my direction.\"\n\nWhen Freda And The Firedogs broke up in 1974, Ball launched her solo career, playing clubs around Austin, Houston and Louisiana. She signed with Capitol Records in 1978, debuting with the country-rock album Circuit Queen. Creating and honing her own sound, she released six critically acclaimed titles on the Rounder label during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1990, Ball\u2014collaborating with Angela Strehli and Lou Ann Barton\u2014recorded the hugely successful Dreams Come True on the Antone's label. At the end of 1997, Marcia finished work on a similar \"three divas of the blues\" project for Rounder, this time in the distinguished company of Tracy Nelson and her longtime inspiration, Irma Thomas. The CD, Sing It!, was released in 1998 and was nominated for a Grammy Award.\n\nMarcia Ball has appeared many times on national television over the years, including the PBS special In Performance At The White House along with B.B. King and Della Reese, Austin City Limits and HBO's Treme. She performed in Piano Blues, the film directed by Clint Eastwood included in Martin Scorsese's The Blues series which aired on PBS television nationwide in 2003. Marcia also appeared on The Late Show With David Letterman with The New Orleans Social Club, where she not only reached millions of people, but also helped to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina. In 2012, she had a role in the independent film Angels Sing starring Harry Connick, Jr., Lyle Lovett and Willie Nelson. In 2017 she performed on NPR's A Jazz Piano Christmas, live from The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nBall joined Alligator in 2001 with the release of the critically acclaimed Presumed Innocent. The CD won the 2002 Blues Music Award for Blues Album Of The Year. Her follow-up, So Many Rivers, was nominated for a Grammy Award, and won the 2004 Blues Music Award for Contemporary Blues Album Of The Year as well as the coveted Contemporary Blues Female Artist Of The Year award. Her next release, Live! Down The Road, released in 2005, also garnered a Grammy nomination, as did 2008's Peace, Love & BBQ (the album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Blues Chart). 2010's Grammy-nominated Roadside Attractions and 2014's The Tattooed Lady And The Alligator Man successfully grew her fan base even further. Altogether she holds ten Blues Music Awards, ten Living Blues Awards, and five Grammy Award nominations. She has been inducted into both the Gulf Coast Music Hall Of Fame and the Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame. The Texas State legislature named her the official 2018 Texas State Musician. As her hometown Austin Chronicle says, \"What's not to like about Marcia Ball?\"\n\nSince joining Alligator, Ball has blossomed as a songwriter. Each album has been filled with fresh, original songs, never more so than on Shine Bright. Ball easily draws her listeners deep into her music with instantly memorable melodies and imaginative imagery. Her songs paint vibrant musical pictures richly detailed with recognizable characters, regional flavors, universal themes and colorful scenes, both real and imagined. Living Blues declares, \"Her originals sound like timeless classics and southern soul masterpieces that no one else can imitate.\"\n\nNow, with Shine Bright, Ball's new, aggressively hopeful songs are energized by Steve Berlin's inventive and exciting production, creating electrifying music that is daring, inspired, poignant and timely. The Boston Globe calls Ball \"a compelling storyteller\" who plays \"an irresistible, celebratory blend of rollicking, two-fisted New Orleans piano, Louisiana swamp rock and smoldering Texas blues.\"\n\nOf course, Ball will bring the party on the road, playing her new songs and old favorites for fans around the globe. \"I still love the feel of the wheels rolling,\" she says, \"and the energy in a room full of people ready to go wherever it is we take them.\" With both her new album and her legendary live performances, Marcia Ball will shine a light into the darkness, making the world a brighter place one song at a time.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/BillyBobsTexas"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jeff Tritt ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9761729.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Hip Hop, House, Dance-pop, Rock, Trap", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jeff has become the top DJ in Kent packing dancefloors with his eclectic style of genre jumping mixing.

It's the same kind of self-assurance the soft-spoken Rodgers displays on his second independently released EP, available January 19th. Produced by Mickey Jack Cones (Dustin Lynch, Joe Nichols) and Chris Farren, the five-song collection showcases him as both a talented writer and interpreter, merging the electrified rock he heard on the baseball diamond with the thoughtful lyricism of country. Well before he was singing for his supper, the Batesville, Mississippi native was an accomplished baseball player who was a scholarship athlete at Northwest Mississippi Community College. Raised in the midst of country's '90s commercial heyday \u2013 his first concert was Garth Brooks at the Pyramid in Memphis \u2013 Rodgers always had an inkling that he might end up living in Music City, he just didn't know how or when. \"I can remember in high school I would tell people \u2013 this was before I played guitar or anything \u2013 I would just be like, 'Yeah, I'm gonna move to Nashville one day,'\" he recalls. And so he did, departing Mississippi with one of his college buddies to see if he could make it in Music City. Through the countless open mic nights and lean years that inevitably followed, Rodgers was able to develop the songwriting voice that would eventually earn his first publishing deal with Combustion Music. \"I went into songwriting boot camp,\" he says. \"That's all I did. I hardly played any shows or anything. I just focused on writing.\" In the meantime, Rodgers scored his first cut on Florida Georgia Line's Dig Your Roots, with \"Wish You Were on It.\" He also released his self-titled EP, featuring the streaming hit \"Midnight Daydream.\" All that intense focus shows on his second self titled EP. Opening track \"Ain't Really Over\" depicts a man in the hangover stage of a rough breakup and trying to move on. Framed by surging, distorted electric guitars and Rodgers' bluesy howl, it sets the tone for his melody-rich, introspective style of songwriting. On \"Cold Case,\" Rodgers draws a line between himself and country's long tradition of clever wordplay. Bouncing off the title's suggestion of criminal investigations, he's popping tops and pining over a woman who's up and vanished from his life. His solution? Downing as many beers as he can handle. \"'Cold Case' was just one of those things \u2013 somebody started playing a guitar and one of us just spit it out,\" says Rodgers. \"It kind of fell out of thin air.\" Rodgers' clear sense of his artistic identity also shines through on the outside songs \"Like You've Been There Before\" and \"Some Girls.\" It's easy to envision Rodgers singing about a younger version of himself in \"Like You've Been There Before,\" a rebellious kid getting some sage advice from his father to play it cool whether he's knocking a fastball over the fences or cautiously taking his first trip around the bases with a young woman. He sings it with the easy confidence of a seasoned vet, or as he says in the chorus, \"like it ain't no thing.\" \"Some Girls,\" on the other hand, calls back to \"Ain't Really Over\" except this time he's ended things and she's not handling it well \u2013 talking behind his back and playing childish games on social media. \"Some girls make it easy on you,\" he sighs, \"and some girls never do.\" The female woes reach their apex in the Rodgers co-write \"Missing One,\" which flips the title phrase on its head. Initially it's a missing copy of the Eagles' Desperado that she took when she left, then a single smoke from a pack of cigarettes that she forced him to give up. But it turns out he's actually missing something else most of all. Rodgers wrote the tune with pals Smith Ahnquist and Hunter Phelps, taking months to get it right. \"We started it in January and we didn't finish it until May,\" he says. \"We knew it was gonna be a clever idea, but we had to get it right. It was a hard one, but a fun one.\" That dedication, coupled with Rodgers' finely-tuned ear for songs, makes him perfectly suited to lean forward into Nashville's ever-shifting winds while honoring his roots. \"I want to be known as the dude with good songs,\" he says. \"If a song gives you chill bumps or if it makes you cry or if it makes you happy, it's done its job.\" That may sound like a relatively humble mission for a performer with such promise, but hey, sometimes you just know.", "otherInfo": "Saturday Nights Live"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Blake Shelton ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8161559.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Blake\u2019s brand new album Texoma Shore is available now!\nDownload it here: http://wmna.sh/bstexomashore", "otherInfo": "Opry Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Barelyon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7813011.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Detroit Rock, Pop Rock, Rock, Folk, Garage Soul, Pop, Soul", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Barelyon is what happens when the Big Apple meets the Motor City.

An acoustic re-imagining of the songs from the rock record, the tracks are presented in stark, stripped-down contrast to its predecessors.\n\n\u201cOnce Upon a Hell of a Time... is a Saturday night record,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThis version is for the hangover on Sunday.\u201d\n\nRe-contextualizing the songs offers a new window into the lyrics. What he once described as a \u201cparty-rock record for the brokenhearted\u201d transforms into a reflective and beautiful dive into false escapism, grief, love, and loss. \"The stripped-down record lends clarity and depth to his already nuanced lyrics, revealing a deep thinker who seeks honesty in his craft, and in life.\" - Beatroute\n\nThe recording came amidst a particularly busy time for Matt Mays. During a period when he headlined his first Massey Hall concert and supported sold out shows with The Gaslight Anthem all over North America, Matt teamed up with co-producer Eric Ratz to record at studios around Toronto between touring commitments.\n\nTwice Upon a Hell of a Time\u2026 was originally conceived as a straight-up solo interpretation, similar to the iTunes Session recorded with Ratz in 2011. As the songs took shape, however, Matt decided to incorporate extra vocals and instrumentation. Tapping musicians Aaron Goldstein (Daniel Romano, Lee Harvey Osmond) on pedal steel, Anthony Carone (Arkells) on piano, and guest singers Andrew Rodriguez, Kate Dyke, and Melissa Payne, the album\u2019s arrangements are lush and large without straying from the \u2018unplugged\u2019 vibe he sought from the outset.\n\nLead track \u201cOla Volo\u201d is inspired by a Vancouver-based mural artist of the same name who also created the original album art for both records. \u201cHer paintings and drawings all have a theme that I picked up on,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nature. To me, it\u2019s from another dimension, a very curious dimension that draws me in. Her pieces are very edgy and real-life at the same time. I had this feeling that I\u2019d like to be in one of her paintings, to live in that world that she\u2019s created.\u201d\n\nAfter departing seminal alt-country collective The Guthries back in 2002, Matt Mays alternated between solo projects (his self-titled debut, the unfinished film soundtrack \u2026When the Angels Make Contact) and band projects (the eponymous Matt Mays & El Torpedo record and 2008\u2019s Terminal Romance). Following the dissolution of Matt Mays & El Torpedo in 2009, Matt released Coyote in 2012 to much acclaim, including a JUNO Award win for Rock Album of the Year.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Irrashional ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9082021.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Classic Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Irrashional is a Charlotte, NC band of exceptional teen musicians with a passion for Classic Rock and entertaining.

As politicians use bigoted rhetoric to gain power at home and abroad, and fringe groups creep from the shadows, it's tempting to succumb to despair and defeatism. But Rise Against is challenging fans to create a bold new identity together: one that is stronger than these setbacks, and bigger than any election. WOLVES, their 8th studio release, is about recognizing the power within all of us; it's a primal call for the prey to become the hunters.\n\n\"If you are in the wilderness and you hear wolves howling, what you're hearing might be an animal lost or mourning,\" says Rise Against's Tim McIlrath. \"But it doesn't make you any less afraid. You know they're there. And you know what this powerful pack of animals is capable of.\"\n\nFor 18 years, Rise Against has kept its moral compass steady, using their international punk platform to speak out for social justice.\nThe band cut its teeth during the George W. Bush administration and has released records across three presidencies, but today's political climate forced the band to step back and rethink how they define themselves.\n\nThe record was originally titled \"Mourning in America,\" but after the U.S. presidential election that rang hollow. It felt somber and hopeless. Members of the band felt those emotions, too, but decided they needed to create an album that focused more on our potential than our failings. They knew it needed teeth and claws. The result is WOLVES, a soundtrack for the hunt.\n\n\"In many ways, a Rise Against show is a safe space for our fans,\" McIlrath says. \"But I realized that I don't only want to create safe spaces, I want to create dangerous spaces where misogyny can't exist, where xenophobia can't exist. I want to create spaces where those sentiments don't have any air, and they suffocate: where those ideas die. WOLVES isn't about creating a safe space, it's about creating a space that's dangerous for injustice.\"\n\nThe influence of the U.S. presidential election can clearly be heard in songs like \"Walls\" (\"the monsters lost in history are now making their return\") and \"Welcome to the Breakdown\" (\"ignoring the facts, intoxicated by the throne\"). WOLVES is of course shaped by the new presidency, but it's not limited to it. There is a spirt of resistance and optimism here that transcends our current crisis, and will outlast any politician.\n\nLike all Rise Against records, the band tackles political struggles alongside personal ones, creating songs as complex as their fans. On tracks like \"House on Fire\" and \"Politics of Love,\" one can hear echoes of the iconic punk/folk songwriter Billy Bragg in McIlrath's words; the personal is political, the political is personal, and it's all rooted in a revolutionary, uncompromising love.\n\nThis evolution in Rise Against's identity came against the backdrop of other changes for the band. For 11 years, they had worked closely with producer Bill Stevenson, of the Descendents and Black Flag fame. With Descendents on tour and Stevenson tied up, Rise Against stepped out of their comfort zone and began working with Nick Raskulinecz, the Grammy-winning producer who has partnered with Foo Fighters, Alice in Chains, and Deftones.\n\nRecording with Raskulinecz meant moving to Nashville, Tennessee\u2014far from the band's familiar worlds of Chicago and Los Angeles, and a firmly red state where Rise Against has rarely played. Political yard signs and conversations around town were constant reminders to the band that they were in new territory. And even though Nashville is a music town, it's country\u2014not punk or hardcore. During the band's five months in the area, these outsider feelings shaped the identity of WOLVES.\n\nLiving in the South transformed the record in some unexpected ways. \"As people on the news are arguing about immigration and class warfare, we are driving down the highway and seeing Civil War battlefields and monuments,\" McIlrath says. \"When you tour these battlefields, you hear about what kind of muskets they used. But shouldn't we be talking about what got us to that point as a country?\"\n\nAs further evidence of the geographic influence on the record, it's comprised not just of anthems of resistance, but also reconciliation. Living in Nashville drove home that we can't just focus on our differences, McIlrath says. If we can stop and talk to each other, face to face, we might realize our common ground. We are all wolves in the same pack, circling at the gates.\n\n\"They say we're divided, we are conquered,\" McIlrath sings. \"But our enemies have never been each other.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jim Suhler ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/BillyBobsTexas"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "David Jacobs-Strain ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9933085.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Americana, Blues, Folk", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "David Jacobs-Strain is a fierce slide guitar player, and a song poet from Oregon.

But before moving to the DC area, Jorma and family lived in the Philippines and other locales as he followed his father's career from assignment to assignment before returning to the place of his birth. As a teenager in Washington he and future Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady (who at the time played six-string guitar) formed a band named The Triumphs. Kaukonen departed Washington for studies at Antioch College where friend Ian Buchanan taught him fingerstyle guitar playing. Buchanan also introduced Kaukonen to the music of Reverend Gary Davis, whose songs have remained important parts of Kaukonen's repertoire throughout his career.\n\nIn 1962 Kaukonen moved to the San Francisco bay area and enrolled in Santa Clara University. During this time he taught guitar lessons in a small music store in San Jose. As a self-described blues purist, Kaukonen never had any ambition to play in a rock band. He played as a solo act in coffee houses and can be heard accompanying a young Janis Joplin on acoustic guitar on an historic 1964 recording (known as \"The Typewriter Tapes\" because of the obtrusive sound of Kaukonen's first wife Margareta typing in the background). Invited to attend a Jefferson Airplane rehearsal by founding member Paul Kantner, Kaukonen found his imagination excited by the arsenal of effects available to electric guitar and later said, \"I was sucked in by technology.\"\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nKaukonen's electric guitar work was distinctive and widely emulated by other Bay Area guitarists. Notable work with Jefferson Airplane includes \"Greasy Heart\", \"If You Feel\", \"Hey Frederick\" (which culminates in an extended lead guitar duet with himself), \"Wooden Ships\" and his original composition, \"Feel So Good\". Rolling Stone named Kaukonen the 54th greatest rock guitarist of all time and 16th greatest acoustic guitarist.\n\nThough never a prolific singer and songwriter during his Airplane tenure, Kaukonen contributed some distinctive material. \"Embryonic Journey\" showcased his fingerstyle acoustic guitar virtuosity. On the next Jefferson Airplane album, After Bathing at Baxter's, his playing developed a harder-edged sound inspired by Mike Bloomfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Cream and other groups that visited San Francisco. These stylistic changes are prominent in the acid rocker \"The Last Wall of the Castle\", as well as the instrumental \"Spare Chaynge\", co-written with bassist Jack Casady and drummer Spencer Dryden. Clocking in at 9:12 minutes, this improvisational style was further explored on the free-form extended jams \"Thing\" and \"Bear Melt\", both live instrumentals recorded in 1968. Kaukonen insists, however, on the liner notes of the Live at the Fillmore East album that these jams were not chaotic \"free for alls\" but in fact \"complex rehearsed arrangements.\" Two notable songs that were later to become Hot Tuna signature tunes were also recorded during the 1968-1969 period. These were the traditionals \"Rock Me Baby \" and the gospel ballad \"Good Shepherd.\" Other original compositions with the Airplane appeared on the 1971 album \"Bark\", the instrumental \"Wild Turkey\" and \"Feel So good\", as well as the acoustic autobiographical \"Third Week in the Chelsea\" detailing his feelings about the disintegration of the band.\n\nHot Tuna and solo career\n\nIn 1969-70, Kaukonen and Jack Casady formed Hot Tuna, a spin-off group that allowed them to play as long as they liked. An early incarnation of Hot Tuna included Airplane vocalist Marty Balin and featured Joey Covington on drums and vocals. This grouping came to an end after an unsuccessful recording jaunt to Jamaica, the sessions of which have never been released. Pared down to Kaukonen and Casady, Hot Tuna lived on as a vehicle for Kaukonen to show off his Piedmont style acoustic blues fingerpicking skills. The self-titled first album was all acoustic and recorded live. With the dissolution of Jefferson Airplane in 1972, Hot Tuna went electric, with Airplane fiddler Papa John Creach joining for the next two albums. Hot Tuna scored an FM hit with \"Ja Da (Keep On Truckin')\" from their third (and first studio) album, Burgers. At this time, Kaukonen's song-writing began to dominate, as further evidenced by the next album, The Phosphorescent Rat, which only featured one cover song. Beginning with their fifth album, America's Choice (1974), the addition of drummer Bob Steeler encouraged a rise in volume and a change of band personality -- a rampaging, Cream-like rock with often quasi-mystical lyrics courtesy of Kaukonen. During this period, the power trio was known for its very long live sets and instrumental jamming.\n\nIn 1974, Kaukonen recorded the first and most successful of several solo albums, Quah, together with Tom Hobson. Produced by Jack Casady, and featuring (somewhat surprisingly) string overdubs on some tracks, this album contained some of Kaukonen's most deft fingerpicking work, especially on \"Hamar Promenade\", \"Blue Prelude\", \"Genesis\" and \" Flying Clouds\". The curious picture that adorns Quah's cover is today on display at Donkey Coffe and Espresso, a coffee shop in Athens, Ohio.\n\nKaukonen toured vigorously throughout the 1970s in both the United States and Europe, but with Hot Tuna's break up in 1978, the first phase of the band's career ended. Casady left to form the new wave band \"SVT\", while Kaukonen released his second solo album, Jorma, a mix of electric guitar and acoustic fingerstyle in 1979. Meanwhile, he had formed the band \"Vital Parts\".\n\nVital Parts featured bassist Denny DeGorio, who had played in a San Francisco band called the \"Offs\" with ex-Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler. Kaukonen, experimenting with a new image, not only cut his hair but dyed it purple then bright orange, and had extensive tattoos adorn his body, back and arms. The album Barbeque King was released in 1980. Kaukonen's traditional fan base did not warm to this new, perceived to be \"punk\" image, and sales of the album were so disappointing that Jorma was soon dropped from RCA records.\n\nHe continued playing as a solo artist throughout the 1980s at such venues as The Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia, The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey and in Port Chester, New York. As in his Hot Tuna days, he played very long sets, usually beginning with an hour-long acoustic set followed by a long intermission and then a two hour electric set, sometimes accompanied by bass and drums. Hot Tuna themselves reformed in the late 1980s. At a 1987 Hot Tuna performance, Kaukonen surprised fellow Airplane alumnus Paul Kantner, who was sitting in, with a surprise appearance by his estranged lover Grace Slick; the success of this performance helped to pave the way for a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and record in 1989.\n\nIn 1980, Kaukonen appeared on Robert Hunter's Amagamalin Street. This was the third album released by Relix Records, a label, founded by Les Kippel, that specialized in bands from the San Francisco Bay Area. Relix also released Splashdown, featuring a rare performance by Hot Tuna on WQIV, a defunct radio station in New York. Kippel was instrumental in reuniting Kaukonen and Casady in 1985 for a Hot Tuna theater tour. Relix Records was Hot Tuna's record company until 2000, and also released Classic Hot Tuna Acoustic, Classic Hot Tuna Electric, Live at Sweetwater, and Live at Sweetwater 2.\n\nTwo notable outside projects Kaukonen played on were the David Crosby album \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\" (1971) and Warren Zevon's \"Transverse City\" (1989). In 1993, he collaborated with ex-Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten in recording numerous arrangements of \"Embryonic Journey\". The resulting tracks were released as an album 1994 on the Relix label. In 1999, he played several gigs with Phil Lesh and Friends. In 2000, he appeared with jam band Widespread Panic during their summer tour.\n\nWith his wife Vanessa, Kaukonen currently owns and operates the Fur Peace Ranch, a 119 acre music and guitar camp in the hills of southeast Ohio, north of Pomeroy; complete with a 32 track studio. He is currently under contract as a solo artist to Red House Records and still records and tours with Jack Casady and other friends such as Barry Mitterhof as Hot Tuna. His 2002 album Blue Country Heart was widely acclaimed by critics as one of the definitive examples of American \"Depression Era \" music and features Kaukonen backed by an all-star Nashville bluegrass band. The album was nominated for a Grammy. His latest album, Stars In My Crown, was released in March 2007.", "otherInfo": "Quarantine Concert #6 Livestream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bok1vPD9y5w"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sarah Potenza ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9428504.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "I write roots rock n roll music with my husband Ian, I was a contestant on season 8 of The Voice, and I'm relentless badass fatass who will never give up!", "otherInfo": "hey babes,\nJoin me as I rock the Jams of Janis Joplin!

Not Shelley King. She sweeps in, carrying herself with the strength and assurance of a woman who knows how to step up and get it done, whether \u201cit\u201d is leading her band, running her own record label or co-producing her new album, Building A Fire. If there\u2019s a little swagger to her strut, she\u2019s earned it. Since quitting a sales job to pursue music full time in 1998, the singer-songwriter has served as the first female Texas state musician, performed with Levon Helm, toured the United States, Europe and Japan and cut two albums with members of the Subdudes \u2014 including this one, her seventh. She\u2019s also the author of a song recorded by Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra; they duetted on \u201cTexas Blue Moon\u201d after Hazlewood heard King\u2019s version on the radio while driving through the state. That might chalk up as a lucky break, but it\u2019s King\u2019s talent and tenacity that make such breaks happen. We\u2019re talking, after all, about a woman who loves the Subdudes\u2019 music so much, she started pursuing opening slots on their tours so she could catch their shows. It makes perfect sense that King would be attracted to that New Orleans-born band; her own soul-filled, earthy Americana sound is rooted in southern gospel and blues, dampened by the Gulf-borne humidity of Louisiana, nourished by the river loam of Muscle Shoals, then cleansed by the hot springs of her native Arkansas, with a little Texas country bubbling underneath. \u201cI opened for them all over the country. It seemed like a coincidence to them,\u201d she says with a hearty laugh. The friendship was forged when they sat in with her at a festival after-party, and when King had a radio appearance lined up in Fort Collins, Colo., where several of the band members live, she got in touch. John Magnie met her at the station, accordion in hand, then gave her a tour of his home studio. Months later, she asked if she could record some demos there. Those supposed demos turned out so well, they became her lauded 2009 album Welcome Home, which also led to a shared tour they actually planned. King, Magnie and fellow co-producer Steve Amedee also made actual plans for recording Building A Fire, though the emphasis was still on having fun, not watching the clock. \u201cI\u2019ve got tons and tons of songs. I\u2019d just go in and start playing songs for them until they went, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s a cool one,\u2019\u201d King says. \u201cI could play 10 songs and they\u2019d find one that was super groovy and we\u2019d work on that one.\u201d The first one they recorded happens to be one of two she didn\u2019t write \u2014 the traditional, \u201cI Know I\u2019ve Been Changed.\u201d King first heard it via a YouTube video her mother sent, then turned up other versions, including several by Southern preachers who roused their congregations with it. \u201cIt got stuck in my head so bad, it was playing nonstop,\u201d she says with a mock-groan. \u201cGrocery store, driving a car, everything. So I walk into this studio and they ask, \u2018What to you want to record?\u2019\u201d The first thing out of her mouth was that lyric, intoned in full preacher mode. \u201cI recorded it just to get us warmed up and because it wouldn\u2019t leave me alone,\u201d she says. Her version drips with sinewy soul, evoking futilely swishing funeral-home fans and handkerchiefs dabbing at perspiring brows. But you\u2019d swear the heat source is the devil himself, hovering behind every note in hopes of snatching wayward sinners from the brink of salvation. In fact, the tension between spirituality and sexuality, gospel influences and rootsier renderings, is almost a theme permeating the album. \u201cI have a lot of lyrics in my songs that border on innuendo,\u201d King notes. \u201cBut I do have a spirituality that gets in, too.\u201d Laughing, she calls the title tune \u201ca juxtaposition, if you will.\u201d She also notes that both are major aspects of the human condition, while remaining mysterious \u2014even taboo. The stage for that duality was set early; born in Arkansas, King began singing as a toddler. Her parents split, her mom remarried and King moved to Houston, then Amarillo, where she landed front and center in the children\u2019s choir at her grandmother\u2019s church. After another stint in Houston, her mother divorced again, and King wound up with her other grandmother in Arkansas. She found salvation \u2014 literally \u2014 in a one-room country church, where she built a social life, gained solace from familial turmoil and soloed weekly. Sometimes her uncles accompanied her on guitar. That\u2019s when she also started writing songs, inspired by her beloved Caddo River and a teenager\u2019s hopes and dreams. King returned to Texas for college, which she financed by running her first business. Her plans included law school. But after working for a lawyer and starting her own band, she realized law was not her passion. Music was. After gigging around Houston for a couple of years, she moved to Austin in 1992. By day, she worked as a sales rep; the rest of the time, she lived and breathed music. One day she realized she didn\u2019t care about sales and would forever regret it if she didn\u2019t at least try to follow her heart. \u201cI went in and quit my job and all the way home, I\u2019m like, \u2018Ohmygod, I must be crazy.\u2019 But I got on the phone and called everybody I knew and told them what I had done, and I booked 11 gigs that day,\u201d King recalls proudly. She also formed her own label, Lemonade Records. \u201cI always liked that saying, \u2018If life hands you lemons, make lemonade,\u2019\u201d King says. \u201cAnd I felt like my corporate gig was a lemon and I split and I made lemonade.\u201d She certainly has. King\u2019s first full-length album, Call of My Heart, contained two songs subsequently covered by Austin songstress Toni Price. Her version of the title tune won Song of the Year at the 2002 Austin Music Awards. A few years later, King and her band were named Band of the Year for roots rock. She\u2019s since racked up more accolades, including that Official Texas State Musician title (she was No. 6, preceding even Willie Nelson) and an appearance with Carolyn Wonderland in an episode of the world-renowned \u201cAustin City Limits\u201d TV show. \u201cTexas Blue Moon\u201d also earned her a chance to meet Hazlewood in 2004, as a surprise guest at a party in his honor. \u201cThat experience was worth more than you could put any kind of a pricetag on,\u201d King says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to quantify the opportunity to sit on the floor between Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra while Lee tells her stories about her dad.\u201d That song is one of many luna-inspired tunes King\u2019s written. The final track on Building A Fire, in fact, is titled \u201cMoonlight.\u201d King calls the mid-tempo melody, dressed with harmonies, accordion and gently chiming percussion, \u201cjust a sweet little love song.\u201d \u201cIt's about longing to be with someone who is far away and you're both looking at the moon at the same time from different places,\u201d she explains. One night, while staring at a fat Austin moon, she picked up her phone to text her sister about it. But her sister had just sent virtually the same message. Now and then, we all have moments that somehow feel cosmically connected; King admits she\u2019s experienced several in Woodstock, where she recently recorded backing vocals on a Marcia Ball song with soul sisters Carolyn Wonderland and Amy Helm, Levon\u2019s daughter. King actually was heading to Woodstock for one of Levon\u2019s famed midnight rambles when she learned of his passing. When she arrived, she sat on the tin-roofed porch of a B&B and taught herself a song she loved that he had done during one of her previous visits: the spiritual, \u201cWhen I Go Away,\u201d written by Helm\u2019s band director, Larry Campbell. As she played, a heavy rain began falling. Listening to its watery rhythms, she realized it was ramble time and wondered if she was hearing Levon trying out his new drumkit. \u201cThat song has meant a lot to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI started doing it then and haven\u2019t stopped.\u201d It gets an almost jubilant treatment on Building A Fire. Another track, \u201cThings You Do,\u201d was co-written years ago with Floramay Holliday. The fan favorite appears on in her live Rockin\u2019 the Dancehall album, but had never been recorded in a studio. In addition to Fort Collins, parts of Building A Fire were tracked in Austin and Muscle Shoals. It features King on vocals and guitar; Amedee on drums, percussion, mandolin and support vocals; Magnie on vocals, accordion and keyboards; Marvin Dykhuis on vocals, guitars, dobro and mandolin; and Sarah Brown on bass. Guests include Wonderland on electric guitar, Cindy Cashdollar on lap steel, Warren Hood on fiddle and Tim Cook on vocals. \u201cThey\u2019re just unique talents, and very expressive,\u201d King says of her musical friends. Her co-producers, of course, offer special inspiration. \u201cThey really care about doing what\u2019s right for the song,\u201d she says. \u201cI like that. When I work with them, when we\u2019re done, I feel like I really found myself.\u201d She\u2019s also found out how build quite a fire \u2014 one so strong, it\u2019s gonna burn for a long, long time. ### 2008 Official State Musician of Texas!", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/BillyBobsTexas"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ EU ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10365339.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "House, Latin, Hip Hop, Baile Funk, Electro, Rock, Electro House", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "DJ EU Bio\n\nAtlanta-based DJ EU has become one of Atlanta's most in demand DJ talents.

Those are the qualities that have steered Zito\u2019s career since the beginning and continue to define every effort he\u2019s offered since.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have nothing to hide; it seems my honesty is what people relate to most,\u201d he once told Vintage Guitar magazine. \u201cAnders (Osborne) told me early on, \u2018If you don\u2019t believe what you\u2019re singing, you\u2019ll never be a good singer.\u2019 I try not to write fluff; I try to make every word count.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat point became convincingly clear with his last record 2018\u2019s First Class Life, a collection of songs that detailed his journey from addiction to sobriety and the subsequent success he achieved through his award-winning body of work. A multiple award winner and nominee, Zito has built his career on an ability to tap into tradition while maintaining contemporary credence all at the same time.\n\n\n\nZito\u2019s upcoming album -- his 16th -- due this November on Ruf Records and descriptively titled Rock N Roll: A Tribute to Chuck Berry, finds him broadening his boundaries still further even as it marks a return to his roots. The album consists of 20 Chuck Berry classics performed by Zito and an impressive array of 21 guest guitarists, among them Joe Bonamassa, Walter Trout, Eric Gales, Robben Ford, Sonny Landreth, Luther Dickinson, Albert Castiglia, Anders Osborne and, significantly, Chuck\u2019s grandson, Charles Berry III.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis was a very special project for me,\u201d Zito says. \u201cI lived in Chuck\u2019s hometown of St. Louis for 32 years, and I worked at a small musical instrument store where his drummer also happened to be employed. Chuck\u2019s son would drop by on occasion as well. He was an icon, and rightfully so. I\u2019ve been playing his songs since I was a kid. Needless to say, he was a tremendous influence on my career, and, of course, on many other musicians\u2019 as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nProduced by Zito himself, the album was recorded at his own Marz Studios and mixed and mastered by David Farrell. \u201cWe recorded the basic tracks and then sent them to each guest musician,\u201d Zito recalls. \u201cThey added their contributions and then sent the files back to us. The process took a year to complete.\u201d\n\n\n\nNaturally, patience and perseverance have been Zito\u2019s stock and trade since the beginning. He began playing guitar at the age of five, and by the time he reached his late teens, he was already a fixture on the local St. Louis music scene. He initially released his music independently and then signed with Eclecto Groove Records in 2008. \"Pearl River,\" the title track of his 2009 album for the label, won Song of the Year at the Blues Music Awards and marked his first collaboration with Cyril Nevill, with whom he\u2019d later work in the Royal Southern Brotherhood. A steady succession of critically acclaimed albums followed, culminating in 2011\u2019s Greyhound, which was nominated for Best Rock Blues Album at that year\u2019s Blue Music Awards ceremony in Memphis. Two years later, he signed with Ruf Records and released Gone to Texas, the story of how he gained his sobriety, offered an emotional homage to the state that left an indelible imprint on his entire life. It also marked the debut of his band, the Wheel.\n\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Zito also played an integral role in the super group of sorts, Royal Southern Brotherhood. The group released two albums and a DVD, Songs from the Road - Live in Germany, winner of the year\u2019s Blues Music Award for Best DVD. He also made his mark behind the boards by producing albums for Samantha Fish, Albert Castiglia, Ally Venable, Jeremiah Johnson, Jimmy Carpenter, and many others.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the accolades keep coming. His album Make Blues Not War debuted on the Billboard Blues Album Chart at number one and garnered him recognition as the 2018 Rock Blues Artist of the Year at the Blues Music Awards. Last year\u2019s First Class Life followed suit, also entering the charts at number one. Alternate Root magazine insisted that \u201cThe First Class Life that Mike Zito titles his upcoming album can be heard in the sweet sound of Blue Soul rising like heat waves from his guitar and his vocal.\u201d American Blues Scene said \u201cMike Zito\u2019s return to the blues is, in a word, triumphant!\u201d No Depression declared, \u201cOnce again, Zito has delivered the goods, a first class package with no postage due.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, with Rock N Roll: A Tribute to Chuck Berry, Mike Zito again does what he does best, making an album that\u2019s humble, heartfelt, skilled and sublime....and, to paraphrase Chuck himself, letting it rock all at the same time.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/BillyBobsTexas"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Big Head Todd and The Monsters ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8268907.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Big Head Todd & the Monsters is a rock band formed in 1986 in Colorado.

The former gravedigger and hotel doorman made his major label debut in 2001 with the Universal release of the stunning Salesmen and Racists. He has recently completed his seventh studio recording, Born On Fire, and his live performances both as a solo performer and as the leader of the ferocious Ike Reilly Assassination have garnered him a cult following and high praise from critics. David Carr of the New York Times said, \u201cIke Reilly is a kind of natural resource, mined from the bedrock of music. All the values that make rock important to people\u2014storytelling, melody, rage, laughter\u2014are part and parcel of every Ike Reilly show I have ever seen. One of the best touring acts in the country, Reilly's band takes it as a personal challenge to upend and amaze every room they play in.\u201d\n\nReilly\u2019s new album, Born On Fire (Rock Ridge Music/ Firebrand Records) captures a songwriter at his best, and a band nimble enough to serve a diverse group of songs that required both recklessness and finesse. The songs on Born On Fire traverse R&B, punk, blues, folk, and rock & roll but are wholly original. Reilly uses humor to combat despair as his songs tell tales of love, lust, struggle, drugs, drinking and the underdog. Born On Fire was mostly recorded at IV Lab in Chicago, IL. Reilly\u2019s longtime friend and Assassination guitar player Phil Karnats (Secret Machines, Polyphonic Spree) worked with Reilly and the band on production and the result is a group of rock & roll songs that would be hard to put in a specific era. Reilly said his hope for the record was that it sound like it could have been made \u201csomewhere between the mid \u201960s and the early 2050\u2019s.\u201d\n\nTom Morello founder of Firebrand Records said, \u201cThere's something in the water in my hometown of Libertyville. Marlon Brando, Adam Jones of Tool, my humble self, and now Ike Reilly. Ike is not just a great, authentic songwriter of the highest caliber but he's always ready to throw down at a union rally... or a bar fight. Ike's songs are a poetic cracked window into the lives of the heartland heroes trying to get by, find and keep love, and carve a place for themselves with humor and dignity. But we love him most because at the drop of a hat he'll travel 1,000 miles to play one song for a dying anti-war veteran.

As a young boy John\u2019s mother knew he would be a singer, \u201che came out singing\u201d she would say. John first appeared on stage at the local Baptist church, in his hometown of Camden Mississippi. John was raised with blues records being played by his grandmother. He dreamed of one day playing his guitar on stage with his idol Muddy Water's.\nAt the age of eighteen John followed the path of his mentors and migrated to Chicago in the fall of 1963. Once in Chicago, John quickly found the blues musicians and formed a band. After the success of his first band The Maintainers, in 1974 John replaced John Watkins in the house band at the world famous Theresa\u2019s Lounge on the South Side of Chicago. Over the course of the next 7 years, John would play with such originators as Sammy Lawhorn, Junior Wells, James Cotton, Buddy Guy, and Lonnie Brooks, all innovators sculpting the sound of Chicago Blues.\nThen in 1979, master songwriter and bassist Willie Dixon invited him to join his band The Chicago All Stars. Traveling through the US, Mexico and Europe, John developed his skills as a rhythm guitarist, a lead-guitar, slide player, and a powerful singer. Another blues master who believed in John Primer was none other than the \u201cHoochie Coochie Man\u201d himself, Muddy Waters. Muddy recruited John not only as a guitarist, but also as an opening act and bandleader. John stayed loyal to Muddy until his untimely death in 1983.\nFresh off the heels of his success with the Muddy Waters Band, John signed on with the legendary Magic Slim. For the next 14 years, he toured with Magic Slim & The Teardrops, bringing tight, house rocking sounds to every corner of the planet. While John was the bandleader of Magic Slim & The Teardrops, they were voted the best blues band in the world year after year and are still today thought of as the inventors of \u201cthe lump\u201d, a style of playing backup rhythm.\nIn 1995 the veteran blues man released his major label debut \u201cThe Real Deal\u201d, on Atlantic Records. Deciding to make it out on his own, he began touring extensively in support of his fourteen solo albums to date, including two CD\u2019s on Blues House Productions, John\u2019s independent record label. John has recorded on several other record labels including: Wolf, Earwig, Telarc, Atlantic, Delta Groove and Raisin Music. He is a songwriter, producer and has taught many other blues musicians.\nJohn Primer has been awarded many awards. He was given 2 Lifetime Achievement Awards in 2013 for Keeping the Blues Alive from the Pennsylvania Blues Society as well as from the Mississippi Valley Blues Society, he has been nominated for a Grammy Award by the Recording Academy in 2010 for Best Traditional Blues Album of the Year, and has been given many nominations year after year by the National Blues Foundation\u2019s Blues Music Awards for the Best Traditional Blues of the Year as well as Best Traditional Blues Musician of the Year.

Seamlessly blending folk, rock, and blues, the 19-year-old songstress draws listeners in with a charismatic yet vulnerable stage presence - not to mention an undeniable energy! Born and raised in small town Fergus, Ontario, she infuses her music with rustic, earthy tones, reaching back to pay homage to the genre\u2019s greats while crafting a sound and identity all of her own. Imagine Janis Joplin jamming with Neil Young while Joni Mitchell looks on proudly!\n\nMadison began pursuing her passion for music from a young age. Growing up in rural Ontario, she discovered a love of nature, community, and roots music, which continues to inspire her art today. At age 6, she began classical piano training, eventually advancing through conservatory programs and voraciously delving into the world of music theory and appreciation. However, it wasn\u2019t until she picked up a guitar at age 12 that she discovered her true calling and began pouring out original songs. Drawing inspiration from her upbringing, current issues, and environmental concerns, she started to shape her signature sound and identity as an artist.\n\nSince, Madison has released a 5-song EP entitled \"Who Knows Where\" and has built a reputation as a road warrior, touring relentlessly as a solo performer, duo, or with her band, The Mud Guppies. She has played hundreds of shows, including notable performances at the Mariposa Folk Festival, Riverfest Elora, Toronto Redpath Waterfront Festival, and Ottawa\u2019s Bluesfest while opening for renowned artists such as 54-40, Ron Hawkins (Lowest of the Low), The Sadies, and Alysha Brilla, making a name for herself as a must-see act!.

I don\u2019t grab on to any style because everyone else is doing it.\u201d\n\nRecently described by the DC Examiner as \u201csuper hip\u201d, he pulls in the a vast cross-section of music enthusiasts and party-goers with his appetizing and amalgamated anthology of Downtempo styles, ranging from Nu Jazz and Neo-Soul to Brazilian to, Dub Reggae \u2013 fresh underground, non-commercial hip-hop rhythms filled with the pulsing sounds of life found in the urban wastes of Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cIt is said that life is all about the journey. Well let\u2019s get to journeying then\u2026\u201d\n\nStylo has been repeatedly hired to showcase his unique blend of sounds at a variety of events, not only to include local clubs and lounges, but even unique art gallery shows and exotic, even erotic, events, and as his style and name have become known in the mid-Atlantic, it has translated into invitations to spin at private parties from Miami to NYC.\n\n\u201cI like to see something marinate like it\u2019s for a fine BBQ, then break it on ya and let the beats and melody take you as if you are basking in sunshine\u2026\u201d\n\nIn collaborating with others or working solo, Stylo has also been busy with producing and remix projects, ever searching for the right blend, the right mix of notes and rhythm. Notable remixes include Michael Jackson\u2019s Wanna Be Starting Something, called Start Something (2009); collaborations with duo Lazerbitch on their hit, Coquette (Stylo\u2019s Don\u2019t Look Remix)(2010); re-edits from Damien Marley, called All Night House; re-edits that feature Hip-Hop legends Black Sheep in This N That (2011); re-edits born from Boney M\u2019s Daddy Cool, called Cool Daddy (2011); and forthcoming originals that are already underground hits, Same Same and Friday\u2019s Alone, that features some of Stylo\u2019s original prose.\n\nStylo releases music on mGrooves Music (www.mgrooves.com) and performs regularly with Lust4Life (www.lust4life.net) and ScandalDC (www.scandaldc.com)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Steel Woods ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9542171.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Southern Rock, Country Blues, Southern Music, Bluegrass, Rock, Country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Steel Woods \u2013 Old News\n\n\u201cWell, I ain\u2019t afraid of dying \u2018cause I know where I\u2019ll go/There I\u2019ll live forever on the streets made of gold\u201d \u201cRock That Says My Name\u201d\n\nThe Steel Woods\u2019 sophomore Thirty Tigers album, Old News, represents a creative leap for the southern roots rock songwriting team of Alabama native Wes Bayliss and his North Carolina partner Jason \u201cRowdy\u201d Cope, who completed their first recordings barely months after they first met.\n\nRecorded in Asheville, NC at Echo Mountain Studios, the site of an old church during a six-day break in a hectic touring schedule, the new double-vinyl disc (the follow-up to 2017\u2019s critically acclaimed Straw in the Wind) features more original songs and, for the first time, the whole band participated \u2013 including the rhythm section of bassist Johnny Stanton and drummer Jay Tooke \u2013 playing in a single room, cutting the tracks virtually live.\n\n\u201cWe really hone in on what we do, our strengths as a band, establishing a musical identity,\u201d explains Wes about their latest effort. \u201cThe first album, we were still figuring out our sound, so what came out, came out. This time, we had a premeditated blueprint, a real plan.\u201d\n\nThe songwriting partnership between Bayliss and Cope continues to grow, mature and blossom. \u201cOver time, you find out a person\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, and it just happened to turn out his strengths are my weaknesses, and vice versa.\u201d\n\nPart Lynyrd Skynyrd, Allman Brothers, dual-guitar southern blues-rock with elements of R&B, country, bluegrass, gospel, blues, folk and metal, the descriptively named, Nashville-based band deepens its resolve on a theme-driven album that joins the mystery train of the past with the full-speed loco-motion of the present, seeking to bring people together with the universality of music.\n\nConceptually and musically, Old News delivers a set of songs at once eternal with lyrics wrenched from today\u2019s headlines, featuring mythic reverberations and social critiques to boot. The album mourns an idealized past but isn\u2019t afraid to point the way to a better future that enlists the best of both worlds.\n\nLike The Steel Woods\u2019 previous release, death and mortality make their chilling presence felt, whether it\u2019s in the collection\u2019s cemetery-placed set piece, \u201cRock That Says My Name,\u201d whose theme is classic Shelley \u2013 \u201cOzymandias, look upon ye works and despair\u201d \u2013 or the vintage bluegrass country of \u201cAnna Lee,\u201d the culmination of a murder trilogy begun with \u201cDella Jane\u2019s Heart\u201d on the last album and ending with the Neil Young/Crazy Horse-ish instrumental, \u201cRed River (The Fall of Jimmy Sutherland).\u201d That preoccupation spills over into an idiosyncratic cover of Townes Van Zandt\u2019s \u201cThe Catfish Song,\u201d and a special four-song epilogue that includes faithful tributes to artists who have passed away - Tom Petty (\u201cSouthern Accent\u201d), Merle Haggard (the prescient \u201cAre The Good Times Really Over\u201d), Gregg Allman (\u201cWhipping Post\u201d as funeral dirge) and Alabama singer/songwriter Wayne Mills (the meditation on mortality, \u201cOne of These Days\u201d). Just as on Straw in the Wind, there\u2019s a Black Sabbath cover, this time a take on \u201cChanges\u201d that transforms the song into a smooth Memphis-style Al Green soul croon, a nod to the cover by the late Charles Bradley.\n\n\u201cDeath is a part of life that gets looked over,\u201d says Wes. \u201cIt can be a positive or a negative, consequence or reward\u2026 It just finds its way into a lot of our writing.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s title track \u2013 which inspired the mock old-fashioned newspaper album cover representing each of the songs with a tintype illustration \u2013 is an example of the timeliness and timelessness of Old News, a song of hope that focuses on what connects us. \u201cAnd pray for Miss Liberty,\u201d sings Wes. \u201cAnd the crack in Her bell/There\u2019s a tear in Her eye/But Her arm hasn\u2019t fell.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to write a song of hope,\u201d says Bayliss, who notes his wife gave him a hard time about the grammatically incorrect use of \u201cfell.\u201d \u201cForget about those small things which divide us. This is about the things we all have in common. We\u2019re all here living and working, trying to get by, raising families. We all just want to live and die free.\u201d\n\nIn a world torn apart by differences, Old News invites us to partake of music as a common language, reinvigorating classic tropes with up-do-date relevance. The rowdy guitar blues of \u201cBlind Lover\u201d envisions a world where we trust our hearts without judgement, while \u201cCompared to a Soul\u201d offers another of The Steel Woods\u2019 penchant for moral fables, this one a pair of Faustian bargains with the devil, one a man who shoots a friend for cheating at cards, the other a Jezebel stepping out on her Marine lover.\n\nThe opener, \u201cAll of These Years,\u201d offers a ZZ Top-like guitar riff from an unrecorded song, \u201cShooting Scar,\u201d while \u201cWithout You\u201d offers tough love to a friend \u201cin a bad place,\u201d but in a last-minute narrative twist, turns out to be confronting his own reflection in a shattered mirror.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t an easy record to make,\u201d acknowledges Bayliss about the blood on some of these Old News tracks.\n\n\u201cRock That Says My Name\u201d is arguably the album\u2019s raison d\u2019etre, a sprawling multi-part epic that recalls such forebears as Buffalo Springfield\u2019s Jack Nitzsche-produced \u201cExpecting to Fly,\u201d confronting our own lives in the rear-view mirror. The song ends with Wes\u2019 grandfather solemnly intoning the words of Matthew 6:19-21 from the King James Bible, a benediction that leads into the four-song \u201cObituaries\u201d tribute that ends the album. The song was inspired by Wes reading an article about someone purchasing a tombstone in advance.\n\u201cWhat better way to drive yourself to live well than looking at your legacy, what you leave behind when you\u2019re gone,\u201d says Wes. \u201cJust a rock with your name, when you were born and the day you died.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to tour this record and do everything in our power to do it justice and get it out to our fans,\u201d says Bayliss. With Old News, The Steel Woods continue to build on the independent-minded approach to recording, touring and connecting to fans which has defined their career from the start.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://livesessions.npr.org/live/the-steel-woods"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ k\u00e4rl k-otik ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8612373.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Trance, Techno, Progressive Trance", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "chaotic (k\u0101 \u00e4t\u2032ik):\nadjective\n1. in a state of chaos; in a completely confused or disordered condition\n2. of or having to do with the theories, dynamics, etc. of mathematical chaos\n3. dj k\u00e4rl k-otik, aka Carl M.

There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers.

Pursuing every avenue she came across from the glam rock of Bowie and T Rex, the showmanship of Elvis, the soul music of Aretha to the singer-songwriters of Joni Mitchell et al. Tina honed her skills, writing songs and playing every bar, club and festival that would have her.\n\nEndless touring helped her cultivate not only a dedicated following but a distinctive, blues driven and raspingly passionate vocal style reminiscent of Janis Joplin. She released several albums on her own label Movement Records with the B-Sides and soon signed a major record deal with Sire Records in 1996.\n\nThe band released two CD\u2019s for Sire, \u201cSalvation\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s All Just The Same\u201d, with their songs featured in commercials and major movie soundtracks such as \u2018The Traveller\u2019, \u2018Very Bad Things\u2019, and \u2018A Simple Plan\u2019. Tina and band shared stages with Lenny Kravitz, The Wallflowers, Indigo Girls and Etta James as well as collaborating with artists like Stewart Copeland and Me\u2019Shell Ndegeocello. During that time, Tina was even asked to play the role of Janis Joplin in Paramount\u2019s \u201cPiece of My Heart\u201d a film about the late singer\u2019s life.\n\nIn 1999, and after heavy touring and sale of Sire to Elektra, the band decided to go on hiatus indefinitely. To commemorate their 10 plus years of hard work, they played 2 sold out nights at the legendary First Ave and released a double live CD of the event, \u201cThe Last Polka\u201d which was the last release for the B-Sides.\n\nSchlieske moved permanently to California to bring up her family while continuing to travel the country doing solo acoustic shows.\n\nShe formed and played with several other bands, Lola and the Red Hots (now Lola and the Red Family Band), Tina\u2019s Elvis and most recently California-based, Tina Schlieske and the Graceland Exiles.\n\nAlso during that time Double Trouble (Stevie Ray Vaughn\u2019s band) asked her to tour singing lead and playing rhythm guitar in support of their 2001 album \u201cBeen A Long Time\u201d. She garnered rave reviews as the bands front woman touring that summer in the States and Canada with popular blues artist Kenny Wayne Sheppard.\n\nIn 2005 Tina released her first solo album produced by Sheldon Gomberg, \u201cSlow Burn\u201d which features such renowned musicians as Don Heffington (Dylan, Emmy Lou Harris), Benmont Tench (Tom Petty), Marc Ford (The Black Crows) and Rami Jaffe (The Wallflowers). To her enduring thrill, she even had Elvis Presley\u2019s guitarist James Burton play on two of the tracks.\n\nIn 2008 Schlieske released \u2018Evil Gal Blues\u2019, (also produced by Gomberg) an homage to her favorite female blues singers. Covering songs by artists like Big Momma Thornton, Memphis Minnie, Jessie Mae Hemphill, Etta James and Aretha Franklin.\n\nIn 2009 Tina did a reunion show with the B-Sides at the Minnesota Zoo Amphitheater and released \u201cA-Sides: The Best Of TBS\u201d on her own label Movement Records to great acclaim.\n\nBesides releasing solo albums and playing in her various bands, Tina has kept busy with helping to run a program called \u201cSing It Out!\u201d for a non-profit organization called AHA! It\u2019s an out reach after school program for at-risk teens in the community, teaching self esteem and expression through music. Schlieske acts as musical director for the teens as well as a mentor. She has also donated her time teaching songwriting in her son\u2019s elementary school in which they wrote songs about all the subjects they were learning. They even got to go into a studio to record their songs and release it on a CD.\n\nMusic is Tina\u2019s lifeblood and she still goes back and forth playing in her different bands in Minnesota as well as in California, with friends, musicians and colleagues \u201cI just love music and need to play it whenever, where ever and with who ever I can!\u201d\n\nNext up for Tina is the release of \u201cPinned Up\u201d, an EP of cover songs by various Minneapolis artists from her band One Of The Boys as well as the release of \u2018Sweet Relief III\u2019 on Vanguard Records on July 9th.

The album comes after extensive touring of over 20 countries in Europe and North & Central America since their last album, and heavy rotation on alternative dancefloors with their most recent release \"On Blackened Wings\" hitting #1 in the DAC (German Alternative Charts) in 2015.\n\nAt the core of SHIV-R are Pete Crane (vocals & music) and Ben Bulig (music), driven by the need for self-expression and pushing for musical evolution. The music hits PRODIGY-style depth charges and EBM club elements on its way to IAMX-style expressiveness and vocal hooks that wouldn't sound out of place if sung by MARILYN MANSON. Presented with a provocatively dark, lace-filtered visual style, the group is altogether monstrously seductive.\n\nThe 12 songs on \"Requiem for the Hyperreal\" weave a dark, dynamic tapestry that varies from the industrial drive of \"Malediction\" to the musicbox slither of \"Milk and Honey\", with Pete Crane's lyrics describing a personification of fear over swampy textures in the song \"Here in the Dark\" and carving out a manifesto for self-creation over the heavy, broken beats of \"Something to Say\".\n\n\"Cheshire Grin\" will be the first single from the album dropping on August 25.

His subjects fall somewhere in between old cult movies from the turn of the century to vintage Americana \u2014 between John Wayne and Ed Wood. These subjects in any other writer\u2019s care may not coalesce as seamlessly as they do in the hands of Pickard, who ties them together with wit, passion and heart, most recently on display in the Thunderbird Winos\u2019 third record, Heavy on the Heart.\n\nThe album's cover consists of Lichtenstein-inspired art with a mustard bottle labeled with a heart squirting mustard onto a floating hot dog on the backdrop of outer space. The mustard and the hot dog are imbued with a sense of abject silliness but also sustain a deeper meaning.\n\n\u201cWell, when we named the record Heavy on the Heart, I meant it in the same way you would describe to a hot dog vendor that you wanted him to go heavy on the mustard \u2026 and the mustard\u2019s gotta go on something, I guess,\u201d Pickard explains. \u201cI guess hot dogs are pretty heavy on your heart, too,\u201d he adds, \u201cand I figured a hamburger floating in space would just be too normal.\u201d\n\nThe hot dog-mustard motif shows the dichotomy of Pickard, and this album in particular. It embraces both the ridiculous and the serious earnestly and in equal measure.\n\nPickard has been playing in the Dallas music community since the days when live music abounded on Lower Greenville, when people could flock to outdoor graffiti galleries such as the trestle bridge by Flagpole Hill or the Good-Latimer tunnel in Deep Ellum. (Look it up, it was magnificent!) In a way, you could say that Pickard grew with the city, or grew as the city changed. In one of the album's slower tracks, \"Light Rail,\" he laments over soaring pedal steel guitar the city's drive toward the future and its proclivity to occasionally barrel through its past, and past art, in the process: \u201cThe map\u2019s always changing / The roads aren\u2019t the same / tunnels full of dirt / buried in the name of a light rail train.\u201d\n\nWith Pickard, such sentimentality is not in combat but balanced with such off-the-wall tracks as the opener to the album, \u201cUFB,\u201d which \u2014 of course \u2014 stands for \u201cUnidentified Flying Banana.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had seen this documentary about UFOs years ago where a guy was talking about seeing one and saying that it looked 'just like a big ol\u2019 banana\u2019 and then when I was driving back to town from Louisiana one day the song sort of wrote itself.\u201d\n\nThe subject matter alone makes this song easily one of the oddest to come out of Dallas in recent memory. This is reinforced by the music, which recalls the pulp of a detective novel with a hint of old Reverend Horton Heat.\n\n\u201cI feel like with my first record it was a lot of polish and less substance and the second was almost the opposite. This one\u2019s in the middle and a lot of that is because I have my band together now; it\u2019s road-tested,\u201d Pickard says.\n\nThe mixture of polish and substance is maybe most apparent on the title track \u201cHeavy on the Heart,\u201d which falls as the album\u2019s only solo acoustic performance. A sparse chorus reminiscent of Tom Petty reflects the resignation one feels when considering the ills of this world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heavy on the heart\u2026\u201d Pickard writes as the music fades to silence. \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\nThe track's sparse acoustic feel is almost by necessity and not by design.\n\n\u201cThat song was actually written after we finished tracking this record as sort of an afterthought,\" Pickard says. \"I\u2019ve noticed that whenever I record an album, I\u2019ll write a perfect song right after, just too late to put it on, but this time we were able to get it on there.\u201d\n\nLike many albums, Heavy on the Heart could be said to be a culmination of its influences. As with the Petty-inspired title track, there's the Dwight Yoakam-inspired song \u201cMississippi Girl\u201d (which could have easily been the record\u2019s first radio single if not for its profanity-laden splendor \u2014 if only Pickard could go back to the studio, re-record and \u201cafford to take out the \u2018fucks\u2019\u201d) and the Bob Wills-inspired Texas swing song \u201cTexas Heaven.\u201d\n\nThe way Pickard lauds his predecessors is most perfectly represented in the culminatory \u201cChicken and Jesus,\u201d where he ties all of these forefathers together with a series of this-or-thats. Pickard either needs \u201cJesus or Otis [Redding],\u201d \u201cVision or Jim [Morrison],\u201d \u201cBreakfast or Elvis.\u201d\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure. After this record, the world and, more importantly, Dallas, needs more of Justin Pickard and the Thunderbird Winos.\n\n-Jamie Vahala / Dallas Observer / March 19, 2020", "otherInfo": "9pm central on Justin Pickard and the Thunderbird Winos Facebook page"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rhiannon Roze ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8824364.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Vancouver,Canada", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Formerly, DJ Rhiannon, Rhiannon Roze is a 100% independent Artist, DJ, Producer, Writer, and Vocalist who is known for rocking crowds with her explosive sets and magnetic stage presence.

As the music project of Taelor Deitcher, the Vancouver-based and JUNO-nominated \u201cProducer of the Year\u201d is perched on the intersection of indie and electronica, distilling the emotional details that contemporary producers often overlook. Though endorsed by Billboard as one of \"13 Dance Artists Who Dominated 2017\u201d, it\u2019s Cartal\u2019s history of dabbling in DIY punk bands that capitalizes on his talent as a lyricist, and elevates his production into the pop realm. Em- bracing the unapologetic vulnerability of songwriting, Cartal forges personal narratives and cinematic soundscapes from a genre that shies away from the heartfelt.\nAlthough Cartal has no interest in being a vocalist, his ability to manipulate unlikely phrases into potent hooks leaves him oscillating between the dual role of writing lyrics for his songs while also producing their soundscapes. Cartal began weaving words in basement bands during his childhood, where he spent afternoons writing songs with friends. Stumbling upon Radiohead\u2019s KID A signaled validation for the producer to fuse his singer-songwriter roots with an electronic palette, and matured into a novel approach to electronic dance produc- tion. These experiences paved the foundation for a producer who can not only cull an an- them from the quirky play on words that underlies a track like \u201cStop Being Yourself\u201d, but also produce a radio hit from the simple idea of \u201cMood\u201d.\nThe release of his third studio album, Next Season, comes as a moment of clarity for the producer. Written over the course of 3 years, the record sees Cartal exercising his uncanny ability to amplify the intimacy of a poignant lyric with accessible melodies. Despite that the record is crafted with an arsenal of hand-selected vocalists\u2014including Daniela Andrade, Coeur De Pirate, and Iselin\u2014it comes together with an agile pop sensibility that\u2019s as nostal- gic as it is invigorating. With \u201cGet What You Give\u201d certified Gold in Canada, it\u2019s clear that Next Season\u2019s unparalleled emotional depth doesn\u2019t abandon the commercial viability that continues to propel Cartal into radio airplay\u2014instead, it embraces the sincerity and opti- mism that underwrites self-reflection, and marks a coming of age for the sonic identity of Felix Cartal.\nIt took a series of immersive studio sessions for Cartal to craft a record that brims with the sort of lush instrumentals that mark a milestone in a producer\u2019s career. Where \u201cSomething to Live For\u201d and \u201cWith You\u201d found the producer feeling detached from his music, Next Sea- son is a technical feat\u2014though mounting success doesn\u2019t harden Cartal\u2019s humble and light- hearted nature. Getting his start on Steve Aoki\u2019s Dim Mak Records, the producer has col- laborated with industry heavyweights like Kaskade and R3hab, and pads his chameleonic discography with official remixes of Zedd, Selena Gomez, Galantis, Dillon Francis and more. With over 160 million streams on Spotify, it\u2019s still a surreal surprise for the Canadian artist to stumble upon his own music on the radio. Citing international performances at festi- vals like Tomorrowland and EDC, Felix Cartal stands as one of Canada\u2019s most dynamic ex- ports, continuously evolving within a space that\u2019s hinged on predictability.", "otherInfo": "performing as Glass Petals...\nmy other project...\nclub music only."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Desperate Electric ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10098346.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Electro, Soul, Alternative", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dubbed \u2018electro soul brilliance\u2019, Desperate Electric has spent the past year honing in on that sound.

Jackson\u2019s lyrics paint tales of lives filled with passion and joy as much as of a life tainted by sorrow and disappointment \u2013 his life. Jackson sings of heaven and hell, beauty and grit \u2013 Jackson sings of real life.\nBorn one of eleven siblings to parents of migrant workers, his life began in Moody, Texas, a small town just north of Austin. It was a nomadic existence stripped of the comforts and security that most take for granted. Jackson\u2019s roots instead became deep seeded in his love for music, a passion passed on to Jackson at an early age by his father who would steal away whenever possible to see and hear country greats like Waylon, Willie, and Billy Joe Shaver perform, often with Jackson in tow.\n\nJackson's adolescence was spent bouncing from one migrant labor town to another, finally settling in a small farming town in Washington State. After graduating high school, he moved back to Texas for a while but soon left to try and make his mark in Nashville. There, Jackson found work as a songwriter, but life for Jackson was still a steep uphill climb, and after a couple of tough and frustrating years, Jackson had to face the hard truth that Nashville was not the \u201chome\u201d for which he had spent his whole life searching.\n\nFrom New York City to Los Angeles, Jackson has finally found his rightful home, ironically right back where his life began -- in Texas.\nCombining his real life experiences with old school country elements, and throwing in the flavors of punk and southern rock to create a style all his own, Jackson Taylor continues to break the rules of traditional country music with his straightforward lyrics, \"take it or leave it\" approach, intense live performances, and the drive and determination of a freight train. The end result can not be pigeon holed into any style and can only be rightfully defined as what it is: \u201cJackson Taylor Music\u201d.\n\nRecently signed to the Smith Entertainment Group (Stoney LaRue and No Justice, catalogue on Cross Canadian Ragweed and Randy Rogers Band, the Live at Billy Bob\u2019s Texas line), Jackson Taylor is ready to take country music by storm with his latest release, aptly entitled Dark Days, which was produced and engineered in the mountains of Washington State at Cascade Studios. The CD (produced by Jackson Taylor and Ronnie Belaire, and engineered by Allen Larsen) contains 12 tracks and features the debut single \u201cLonely,\u201d a tale of emotion that Jackson knows all too well. Other tracks include \u201cOutlaws Ain\u2019t Wanted Here No More,\u201d which is a true account of Jackson's experiences in the country music industry that eventually pushed him to take his own musical path. Also featured on the new album is a cover of the tune \u201cHonky Tonk Heroes,\u201d written by Billy Joe Shaver, one of Jackson\u2019s favorite music outlaws.\n\nBilly Joe Shaver summed up it up best when he said, \u201cJackson\u2019s songs are so real and honest, you know straight off he's been there and done that. He writes and sings like he lives, great songs that I believe will live forever.\"", "otherInfo": "Jackson Taylor Live Stream\nMay 9, 2020 @ 8:00 PM (MST)\nStreaming from Facebook & YouTube.\n\nAsk questions, request songs and have a drink with Jackson.\n\nCome hang out and party with us!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nitti Gritti ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9141600.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Hip Hop, Bass Music, Bass, Trap, Electronic", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "NITTI GRITTI is the name that continues to push the boundaries of electronic music.

Those are the qualities that have steered Zito\u2019s career since the beginning and continue to define every effort he\u2019s offered since.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have nothing to hide; it seems my honesty is what people relate to most,\u201d he once told Vintage Guitar magazine. \u201cAnders (Osborne) told me early on, \u2018If you don\u2019t believe what you\u2019re singing, you\u2019ll never be a good singer.\u2019 I try not to write fluff; I try to make every word count.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat point became convincingly clear with his last record 2018\u2019s First Class Life, a collection of songs that detailed his journey from addiction to sobriety and the subsequent success he achieved through his award-winning body of work. A multiple award winner and nominee, Zito has built his career on an ability to tap into tradition while maintaining contemporary credence all at the same time.\n\n\n\nZito\u2019s upcoming album -- his 16th -- due this November on Ruf Records and descriptively titled Rock N Roll: A Tribute to Chuck Berry, finds him broadening his boundaries still further even as it marks a return to his roots. The album consists of 20 Chuck Berry classics performed by Zito and an impressive array of 21 guest guitarists, among them Joe Bonamassa, Walter Trout, Eric Gales, Robben Ford, Sonny Landreth, Luther Dickinson, Albert Castiglia, Anders Osborne and, significantly, Chuck\u2019s grandson, Charles Berry III.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis was a very special project for me,\u201d Zito says. \u201cI lived in Chuck\u2019s hometown of St. Louis for 32 years, and I worked at a small musical instrument store where his drummer also happened to be employed. Chuck\u2019s son would drop by on occasion as well. He was an icon, and rightfully so. I\u2019ve been playing his songs since I was a kid. Needless to say, he was a tremendous influence on my career, and, of course, on many other musicians\u2019 as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nProduced by Zito himself, the album was recorded at his own Marz Studios and mixed and mastered by David Farrell. \u201cWe recorded the basic tracks and then sent them to each guest musician,\u201d Zito recalls. \u201cThey added their contributions and then sent the files back to us. The process took a year to complete.\u201d\n\n\n\nNaturally, patience and perseverance have been Zito\u2019s stock and trade since the beginning. He began playing guitar at the age of five, and by the time he reached his late teens, he was already a fixture on the local St. Louis music scene. He initially released his music independently and then signed with Eclecto Groove Records in 2008. \"Pearl River,\" the title track of his 2009 album for the label, won Song of the Year at the Blues Music Awards and marked his first collaboration with Cyril Nevill, with whom he\u2019d later work in the Royal Southern Brotherhood. A steady succession of critically acclaimed albums followed, culminating in 2011\u2019s Greyhound, which was nominated for Best Rock Blues Album at that year\u2019s Blue Music Awards ceremony in Memphis. Two years later, he signed with Ruf Records and released Gone to Texas, the story of how he gained his sobriety, offered an emotional homage to the state that left an indelible imprint on his entire life. It also marked the debut of his band, the Wheel.\n\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Zito also played an integral role in the super group of sorts, Royal Southern Brotherhood. The group released two albums and a DVD, Songs from the Road - Live in Germany, winner of the year\u2019s Blues Music Award for Best DVD. He also made his mark behind the boards by producing albums for Samantha Fish, Albert Castiglia, Ally Venable, Jeremiah Johnson, Jimmy Carpenter, and many others.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the accolades keep coming. His album Make Blues Not War debuted on the Billboard Blues Album Chart at number one and garnered him recognition as the 2018 Rock Blues Artist of the Year at the Blues Music Awards. Last year\u2019s First Class Life followed suit, also entering the charts at number one. Alternate Root magazine insisted that \u201cThe First Class Life that Mike Zito titles his upcoming album can be heard in the sweet sound of Blue Soul rising like heat waves from his guitar and his vocal.\u201d American Blues Scene said \u201cMike Zito\u2019s return to the blues is, in a word, triumphant!\u201d No Depression declared, \u201cOnce again, Zito has delivered the goods, a first class package with no postage due.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, with Rock N Roll: A Tribute to Chuck Berry, Mike Zito again does what he does best, making an album that\u2019s humble, heartfelt, skilled and sublime....and, to paraphrase Chuck himself, letting it rock all at the same time.", "otherInfo": "Saturday Night Live in the Studio with Mike Zito!\nLive Stream presented by Mike Zito and the Big Blues Bender!\nSaturday, May 9th @ 9:00 PM Central time on facebook.com/mikezitomusic & facebook.com/bigbluesbender\nMike will take requests.... sing and play guitar LIVE.\nJoin Mike for an interactive and intimate night of music.\n............................\nThis is a free event, tipping would be greatly appreciated."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Avestra ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8675163.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Indie, Electro Pop, Electronic, Easy Listening, Funk, Ambient", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ambient-electronic tunes came of the 2016 creative project of 20 year-old Savannah Johnston.

The Black Moods' three members \u2014 frontman/guitarist Josh Kennedy, drummer Chico Diaz and bassist Jordan Hoffman \u2014 aren't looking to reinvent the wheel. Instead, they're piling into a vehicle that's existed for decades, souping up the engine to suit their contemporary needs, and steering those wheels toward their own rock & roll horizon.\n\nThe band formed in Tempe, Arizona. Inspired by local heroes like the Gin Blossoms and Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers \u2014 both of whom have become champions of the Black Moods, often tapping the group as a high-profile opening act \u2014 The Black Moods began building their audience the old-school way: by hitting the road. They toured heavily, promoting albums like their 2012 self-titled debut and 2016's Medicine with gigs across the country. By the time \"Bella Donna\" hit the radio airwaves during the summer of 2018, The Black Moods' fanbase had grown exponentially. The song became a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, paving the way for the band's biggest shows to date.\n\nModern-day torchbearers of ageless rock & roll, The Black Moods aren't shy about nodding to their influences. \"Bella Donna\" was partially inspired by the Doors' slinky strut, while the climatic chorus of \"Bad News\" points to alt-rock mainstays like the Foo Fighters. With one boot planted in the same ground as their influences and the other pointed toward unexplored territory, The Black Moods blaze their own path while still paying tribute to those who came before them.\n\nBoth \"Bella Donna\" and \"Bad News\" were recorded with Grammy Award-nominated producer Johnny Karkazis, who flew to Phoenix and set up a makeshift studio in the band's own rehearsal space. There, in the same practice facility once shared by hometown heroes like the Refreshments, the band funneled the spirit and swagger of their live show into their most dynamic recordings to date. That live show \u2014 which The Black Moods sharpened with cross-country tours alongside the Doors' Robbie Krieger, Shinedown, Jane's Addiction, Eve 6, Cracker, and numerous other headliners \u2014 has always been one of the band's strongest selling points. Now, thanks to singles like \"Bella Donna\" (which also lends its name to the first wine in The Black Moods' wine series), The Black Moods' fury and fire onstage is matched by their electricity on record.\n\nThe band's name is The Black Moods. And these days, those black moods are looking pretty bright.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brandon Stansell ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9869255.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Contemporary Country, Country, Country Pop", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With Jimmie Allen\u2019s recent #1 song, Kane Brown\u2019s #1 album and recent Grammy wins for artists like Kacey Musgraves and Brandi Carlile, Country music seems to be swinging open its doors to some of the more unlikely of country artists - enter Brandon Stansell.\n\nWhen CMT premiered the video for Brandon\u2019s last single HOMETOWN in November 2018, he instantly became what they called,\u201cliving history.\u201d The premiere of this video, addressing LGBTQ themes, is a first for the home of Country Music videos.\n\nThe video then went on to be named one of Rolling Stone\u2019s Top 10 Country Music Videos of 2018.\u201d\n\n\"Country music may not be known for being inclusive to LGBTQ artists, but rising musician Brandon Stansell is redefining the genre one soulful song at a time, \u201c says Billboard\n\nHis is a bold new voice in the genre, as comfortable making you tap your foot as shed a tear - a singer songwriter with something to say, and a voice to remember.", "otherInfo": "Gotta different kind of show planned for you guys!

His 2017 single \"Fuck It\", a collab with fellow producer Sullivan King, saw #1 on the dubstep charts for 2 consecutive months.

The single has been heavily supported by Excision, Borgore, Flosstradamus, Snails, Kayzo, Ghastly, Kill The Noise, Slander, SKisM, and many more. Following the release of \"Rail Breaker\", Riot Ten dropped his debut EP with DIM MAK called \"Hype Or Die: The Dead\" in February of 2018, which recorded a top 10 debut on the iTunes \"dance album\" charts, a feat that is seldom seen by an artist in the genre.

He works every inch of his generous rhythmic, he deconstructs the sounds, betrays our habits and yet those melodies of his go straight to the point and far beyond our expectations. Creating Hungry Music label alongside with his friends Worakls and Joachim Pastor is a chance for him to let his imagination and musical eclectism flow freely so that he continuously reinvents himself. That\u2019s how appeared his latest project, N\u2019to Perc Live 2015, illustration of this blurring of the borders between electronic and acoustic.

After discovering Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin in her mother\u2019s record collection and falling in love with rock music, she was then taken to a live show of Michelle Shocked. It was there that she decided, \"That's what I want to do when I grow up\". The American folk singer with punk spirit showed her the way. As a teenager, Nad\u00e9ah taught herself to play guitar and write songs in beauty and work off pain. Like Leonard Cohen and Tori Amos \u2013 two great sources of inspiration, the first for his ability to paint pictures with words and the other for exorcising afflictions \u2013 Nad\u00e9ah turns her often adverse past experiences into something beautiful and engaging, songs that transcend difficult events to give solace, create humour and to touch beauty but always with a lyrical twist. Nad\u00e9ah\u2019s songs, though born of true experiences, are steeped in fantastical imagery and tell the stories of the Australian who, born to immigrant parents (her mother is Indian, Portuguese, English and Serbian, her father Italian), was never able to stand still. She set up her first band, the loveGods, in England with a French guitarist whom she met whilst busking in Paris. Spotted by the highly influential station Radio One, this fiercely electric act was booked to open for the likes of Nick Cave and Franz Ferdinand. Thanks to word of mouth, the band garnered a large and faithful following. However, after the release of two records on independent imprints, the adventure came to an abrupt end. This took Nad\u00e9ah back to square one, and she moved to Paris. Needless to say she brought her guitar along. In Paris, fate came knocking at her door again: whilst working at a caf\u00e9 she met classical conductor and composer Nicola Tescari. She also started to write again, putting to paper the emotions triggered by the \u201cCity of Light\u201d and French culture. After a short while, some kind souls told Marc Collin he should go and see her on stage, at the club where she was playing at the time. Won over by her voice and personality, he invited her to collaborate on the Hollywood Mon Amour project, then to join Nouvelle Vague and take part in the French collective\u2019s 3rd album. So Nad\u00e9ah performed in city after city around the world for three years. She had been a rock tigress on stage until then, reminiscent of PJ Harvey and Juliette Lewis, but now realised she could use her charms and was quite at ease singing other people\u2019s songs while portraying a sexy femme fatale. During the Nouvelle Vague tour, she put the finishing touches to songs intended for Venus Gets Even, all of which were born of \u2013 sometimes autobiographical \u2013 true stories: on \u201cPinot Noir & Poetry for Breakfast\u201d \u2013 her very own \u201cFever\u201d, where she manages to conjure up the spirit of Marilyn \u2013 she muses over the three months of her life when, inspired by the Parisian air, she would wake up each morning and grab a glass of Pinot with one hand and a book of poetry with the other ! (She has now rid herself of this bad habit, rest assured). Built like short films or scenes from a play, her songs \u2013 whether intriguing (\u201cI Burned a Cowboy at the Melbourne AirportI\u201d), cheerful or slightly blues-inducing (\u201cAn Asylum on New Year\u2019s Eve\u201d, about a friend who spent 31st December in an asylum) \u2013 are all clad in dazzlingly bright fabrics, lively arrangements and attractive shapes. The rich and sophisticated orchestration, devised by Nicola Tescari and comprising guitars, double bass, piano and brass (Babylon Circus\u2019 very own brass section) sounds as if Tom Waits and his accompanists were launching into an explosive and classy musical. The infectious \u201cWhatever Lovers Say\u201d swings like fifties rock\u2026 a love song that will make you sweat. \u201cScary Carol\u201d (about the Christmas consumerist frenzy) features a chorus bursting with an energy so groovy it feels like you've been hit with an electric current. Written upon her arrival in Paris, \u201cOdile\u201d feeds on rhythm and makes finger-snapping hard to resist. Nad\u00e9ah\u2019s repertoire has evolved since The Lovegods, but she retains the unbridled energy of rock whilst cultivating a sophistication not dissimilar to the likes of Feist or Goldfrapp. She enthrals us on her more personal songs with the warm and velvety tones of her voice. On the tear-jerking \u201cEven Quadriplegics Get the Blues\u201d (about an ex-partner paralysed from the neck down), she opts for sobriety and minimalism. This simple ballad, on which she is accompanied only by a piano, tastes more like a strong pick-me-up than salty tears. \u201cSuddenly Afternoons\u201d is a more sorrowful track, a lovely and ethereal song that sounds like something Rickie Lee Jones could have written. \u201cHurricane Katrina\u201d sums up Nad\u00e9ah\u2019s approach quite well: performed by a different artist, this song (about a relationship so tense it conjures up images of hurricanes) would sink the listener into gloominess. However Nad\u00e9ah addresses the issue with a bang, amidst a clamouring honky-tonk atmosphere. With songs such as \u201cTell Me\u201d, her first album puts her in a class with singers such as Josephine Baker and all the other foreign artists (Feist, etc.) who really \u201cclicked\u201d with Paris and France. Along with her 5-star formation, she is now raring to go and set ablaze every stage she treads, and between two tracks, whether explosive or moving, she\u2019ll reveal her outlook on life and say, with a smile: \u201cWhatever happens, make something good of it\u201d\u2026 www.nadeah.com www.facebook.com/nadeahmusic www.twitter.com/nadeah www.instagram.com/princessnadeah Nouvelle Vague : www.nouvellesvagues.com http://myspace.com/nouvellevague The LoveGods : www.thelovegods.com http://myspace.com/thelovegods Hollywood Mon Amour : www.hollywoodmonamour.com http://myspace.com/hollywoodmonamour B for Bang : www.bforbang.com http://myspace.com/bforbang Who is she?

She managed to record two full-length albums and tour with some of the music world's biggest names even before she hit the age of 20. Her first album drew rave reviews from most critics and put her on the often rocky road toward stardom.\n\nDevon was born in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in the spring of 1982. She grew up in a household filled with music and family and friends. She admits some of her influences include Bikini Kill, Frank Zappa, and even some of the classic rock & roll groups her parents loved, like the Beatles. At a young age, Devon practiced vocal harmony with her father. Later she used his old guitar to strum out her first tentative notes. By the time she was 15, she was putting her musical talents to work, playing in front of local places for change from those who stopped to listen. There was never any other dream in her mind but music, and luckily no one to tell her it was the kind of dream that was out of reach.\n\nWhen Devon was still in her teens, she recorded her debut album, a self-titled offering filled with original songs. That album -- really, her voice on that album -- drew a lot of interest, and in the end landed her a spot touring as a side act with the very popular Dave Matthews Band. One tour turned into two. For 2001, Devon released a second album, LONG SLEEVE STORY, under the Three Word Records label. She had some pretty impressive help on her sophomore release, such as drummer Nate Brown, bassist David Saull, trumpeter John D'earth, and bass player Stefan Lessard, who also served as producer for the album.\n\nDevon's 2003 CD, UPSTATE SONGS, (City Salvage Records) was included in Rolling Stone's \u201cCritics Top Albums of 2003\u201d. Critic Julie Gerstein called the record \u201cperhaps the sweetest and most honest folk-pop album recorded this year,\u201d and added, \u201cSproule's vocal and lyrical beauty is unmatched.\"\n\n2007 brought the release of her 'getting-married' (to songwriter Paul Curreri) CD, KEEP YOUR SILVER SHINED (City Salvage/Waterbug). Produced by Jeff Romano in the heart of Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge mountains, this CD highlights Sproule\u2019s talent for combining Appalachian, folk and jazz influences. From the front porch thump of \"Old Virginia Block\" to the high lonesome traditional \"The Weeping Willow,\u201d featuring fellow Virginia-native Mary Chapin Carpenter, the record finds Sproule making another important contribution to the Great American Songbook. The New Yorker magazine: The nimble singer-guitarist Devon Sproule chronicles her ongoing love affairs with humanity, nature, and the state of Virginia. She performs with a sweet, round diction that shines through even her most ornate imagery and rambunctious melodies.

Charming, delirious, positive, big-beaming-grin-on-your-face bundles of fun.\nFriends since childhood, Sam (Rushton, guitar) and Dan (Fane, bass) met remaining members Will (Lee-Lewis, drums) and Lucy (Evers, vocals) in their first week at university in Brighton \u2013 the start of a friendship which has seen them become increasingly inseparable and has resulted in the tight, family unit they are today.\n\nTo date, they\u2019ve released a steady stream of standout singles including fan favourite \u2018Peggy\u2019, the \u201880s summer pop anthem \u2018Darling\u2019, and their surprisingly meta ode to the worldwide bee colony collapse \u2018Honey\u2019 \u2013 all of which feature on the EP.\n\nThese tracks have seen keen support from local and national radio at BBC Introducing, Juice Radio and BBC Radio 6 Music, backed up by critical praise from press including Noisey, The Line of Best Fit, DIY, CLASH, DORK, Wonderland, Indie Shuffle and a whole host of Hype Machine blogs and influencers.\n\nPreviously described as a \u201cglittery gateway drug\u201d and combining left-field experimentation with startlingly prescient pop sensibilities, Orchards are following in the footsteps of luminaries Everything Everything and Foals, though their personal influences range from the super mainstream pop of Anne Marie and Dua Lipa, through to the danceable indie of Bloc Party and The Wombats, to more progressive, heavier bands like The Mars Volta and The Fall of Troy.\n\nApproaching their new material with a heavy focus on killer melodies, the song writing process was intentionally conscious of that vital room being left for the melody to breathe, whether that meant taming a guitar riff or simplifying a drum beat, it didn\u2019t matter so long as the melody was at the forefront.\n\n\"There's more to Orchards than meets the eye. The band's whip-smart math-pop is all glistening surface and immediate melody, but beneath this chrome-plated chassis lies a complex rhythmic engine.\" - CLASH Magazine\n\n\"'Honey,' by Orchards is a great example of Math Rock mixed with Top 40 pop elements.\" - Indie Shuffle\n\n\"Math-pop brilliance.\" - DORK\n\n\"Atop sharp-edged, angular collisions, Orchards managing to cram approximately 5 killer hooks into the space of a single song\" - DIY\n\n\"The quartet\u2019s delightful dabblings in math-rock and incredible hooks has manifested in an undisputed banger that you\u2019ll have in your head for the rest of the day\" - Wonderland\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Feet ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8465283.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Indie Garage Rock", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Formed on the 30th of January 2016, FEET was really a distraction for its members from their endless bowls of pasta and lonely nights due to their poor game.

There are so many layers to Canadian-Colombian singer Lido Pimienta\u2019s identity that you might get lost in them. But if you did, you\u2019d be missing the point.\n\nHer multi-textural, mind-bending voice and music project what Canada\u2019s The Globe and Mail called her \u201cbold, brash, polarizing\u201d persona, which constantly confronts the powers that be. But it also reveals an embrace of the Afro- and Indigenous traditions that is at once defiant, delicate and sweetly nostalgic.\n\nPimienta\u2019s new album Miss Colombia takes her ecstatic hybridity to a new level, building on the \u201cnu\u201d intersection of electronica and cumbia established by her first two albums, Color, released in 2010, and the 2016 Polaris Prize-winning La Papessa as Canadian album of the year. The latter was the first 100% independently released, non- English or French album to win the $50,000 prize. Produced with Matt Smith, a/k/a Prince Nifty, Miss Colombia overflows with the kind of understated genius that promises yet another breakthrough.\n\nAs a Canadian global-beats trailblazer, Lido has an affinity for acts like A Tribe Called Red and Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq, but her work also resonates with British-Sri Lankan rapper MIA and she draws unabashed inspiration from the New York-bred Dominican-Trinidadian rap queen Cardi B. Miss Colombia has the effect of expanding the narrative about her dual Colombian/Canadian identity to her family\u2019s mixed roots in the Afro-Colombian and Indigenous Wayuu communities, while establishing an ambitious new sonic palette that brings her closer to home.\n\nWho or what exactly is Miss Colombia? Pimienta\u2019s new album\u2019s title was inspired by Miss Universe MC Steve Harvey\u2019s gaffe in 2015 when he mistakenly awarded the crown to Miss Colombia instead of the actual winner, Miss Philippines. The incident not only caused her to reflect on the anti-blackness she experienced as a child growing up in Barranquilla, but the fact that while her sister was groomed to be a beauty queen, she suffered through an awkward adolescence as the \u201cweird artistic tomboy\u201d of the family.\n\n\u201cSo I was like am I still Colombian or should I just keep calm and carry on because I\u2019m Canadian now?\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the premise and genesis of Miss Colombia.\u201d\n\nThe central mood of Miss Colombia coalesces around a series of moving, musical poems embracing how she\u2019s loved and lost. The journey magically documents an introspection tinged with sadness, yet still evoking a kind of optimism about experiencing the emotion in glorious repetition. \u201cTe Quer\u00eda,\u201d (I Wanted You) pulses with a kind of samba-like cumbia, floating in the memory of desire and denial. The narrator\u2019s \u201cwant\u201d is quickly dismissed by quoting 2018\u2019s Latin trap hit \u201cTe Bot\u00e9\u201d (I discarded you).\n\nAs Pimienta more firmly grounded herself in her return to the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where Miss Colombia was recorded \u201clive\u201d in rustic settings, her approach evolved from the opulent electronic crafting of La Papessa to something even more sensual and spiritual. The change in scenery helped her closer to her goal of re-contextualizing her music. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to control electronic music,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWhat\u2019s hard about electronic music is to make it sound emotional, make it sound beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe emblematic track \u201cEso Que Tu Haces,\u201d flows with an ethereal mysticism that fuses Lido\u2019s love for traditional porro and slow-building cumbia. Its unique orchestral swirl of wind instruments and synthetic sounds quickly sets the tone for Miss Colombia. On \u201cNada,\u201d she teams up with Bomba Estereo\u2019s Li Samuet, venturing further with her transcendent soprano, crafted with precision and clarity, and driven by sharp-edged metallic beats.\n\nLido clearly remembers the moment when she began her journey as a transnational, cultural mixing experiment as a singer. The brashly dynamic electro-cumbia diva had gone through several phases, starting in her early teens fronting punk and metal bands, and had become obsessed with trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack and Tricky.\n\n\u201cIt was before I moved to Canada, I was in this dance group called Cumb\u00e9 in Colombia,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy cousin was one of the drummers in the group and he told me, \u2018you know you have a really good voice, why would you waste that voice on this depressing music?\u201d\n\nPimienta\u2019s cousin then introduced her to an Afro-Colombian group called Sexteto Tabala, who she later collaborated with on the song \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves\u201d (I Want You To Save Me). Initially formed in 1996, Sexteto Tabal\u00e1 are the cultural heartbeat of Palenque and guardians of Afro-Latin musical history who can swing like a salsa band, groove like a fuji orchestra and serenade you all at the same time. They are one of the most representative musical expressions of the African communities in Colombia.\n\nPimienta credits her time in Sexteto with the development of her singing and overall aesthetic. \u201cThat\u2019s what shaped me, how I learned to have stage control,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because of some bar in Ontario; it was because I was in front of thousands of people singing Afro-Colombian spiritual music.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the flow of Miss Colombia so riveting and rewarding. Structurally it\u2019s bookended by two versions of \u201cPara Transcribir,\u201d one listed as \u201cSol,\u201d (Sun) and the other \u201cLuna\u201d (Moon), a song that tries to come to grips with Pimienta--who is fully bilingual--as a perpetual translator of cultures. The edgy playfulness of her love songs gives way to tracks like \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves,\u201d \u201cPelo Cucu,\u201d which celebrates the symbolic African texture of her hair, and \u201cResisto y Ya,\u201d which makes pointed reference to recent massive Colombian protests against the current government.\n\nWith the latter track, Lido wants to make it clear that while she shares the popular disdain for a \u201cpolitics of division\u201d that squeezes Colombians, she insists that just by being who she is, an Afro-Indigenous, queer feminist, and Canadian outsider, she has always been engaged in resistance. The setting of the recording with Sexteto Tabala in San Basilio de Palenque, a historic town settled by escaped slaves in the 17th century, allows for an expression of healing through traditional culture. \u201cThe chance has arrived/To fix our past,\u201d she sings hauntingly in the chorus of \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel like Miss Colombia is me really doing it for real,\u201d mused Lido. \u201cLike I feel everything up until this point has been happy accident or a horrible accident. This album has been a beautiful process. It\u2019s a really good representation of where I am now and where I\u2019m ready to go next.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Buzzard Buzzard Buzzard ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9824344.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "PARA FICTION ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8634336.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "JAMBO UNCHAINED X KTC", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "PUNK HIP HOP", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ellis ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8836222.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Future Bass, Electro House, Edm, Future House, Electronic", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hey!

Born and raised in Glossop, Josh (vocals) and Dom (guitar and synths) began playing music together at school. The band started to blossom when they started studying at college together, sneaking into the college studio after hours to record what they had written in English class. Henry (bass and synths) and Joe (drums) later joined the band, bringing variety with their funk and rock influences and Larkins were finally able to create a sound that they had pictured in their heads.\n\nLarkins toured extensively in 2018, including a headline tour to thousands of new fans across the UK and Europe. The band\u2019s rise is evident in their upcoming headline hometown show at Manchester\u2019s Albert Hall in March. Already with support from the likes of BBC Radio 1, Radio X, and Zane Lowe flooding in, it\u2019s clear that Larkins are embracing their status as one of the most exciting and in-demand bands to have emerged from Manchester in recent years.\n\nSince the release of their independent debut EP in 2016, Larkins\u2019 atmospheric and hook-filled brand of indie pop has seen them develop a fervent fan base and move from strength-to-strength, especially within the chaos and theatre of their live shows.

Sinclar started DJing in 1986, when he was just 18 years old, specializing in funk and hip-hop music, with the name Chris The French Kiss. His first club hit was Gym & Tonic, a track produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, featuring vocals illegally taken from a Jane Fonda fitness tape. The Bob Sinclar persona was based on a character from Philippe de Broca's film Le Magnifique.\n\nSinclar is famous for popularizing the \"french touch\" of house music, with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. His track \"Feel for You\", a tribute to french musician Cerrone, from his second album Champs Elys\u00e9es, hit #9 in the UK Top 40. On track \"Darlin'\", he worked with vocalist James \"D-Train\" Williams.\n\nSinclar has also worked under other pseudonyms. Under the aliases The Mighty Bop and Reminiscence Quartet, he has dabbled in hip-hop and acid jazz. He also created the Africanism project, where an ensemble of artists produce house music with a combination of latin, jazz, african and tribal flavors. In 2005 he scored a hit with his single \"Love Generation\", that reached #1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts and the German Media Control Single Charts in 2006. The song was a huge success throughout Europe, also peaking at no. 2 in the Dutch Top 40. The followup hit was \"World, Hold On\", that features Steve Edwards and also managed to chart in the top ten in most of the European countries. \"Rock this Party (Everybody Dance Now)\" followed on August 22, 2006.\n\nThe remix of \"World, Hold on\" by E-Smoove is nominated for a Grammy 2007 in the category \"Remixed Recording\". Also, \"World Hold on\" was chosen by Billboard Magazine as the number one Hot Dance Club Play Single of 2006, beating Madonna and Christina Aguilera.\n\nThe fourth single of the album 'Western Dream' called 'Tennessee' was supposed to be released in April 2007, but has been cancelled due to the rumour of a new album being released.\n\nThis album is Soundz Of Freedom. It came out in France on May 21st. It has not yet come out in the United States.\n\nTaken from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Sinclar)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nina Nesbitt ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8984010.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Pop, Folk", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Nina Nesbitt", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lapsley ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9711761.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Other, Ambient, Electronic", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "http://musiclapsley.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Freya Ridings ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8535172.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Singer Songwriter Alternate Pop", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "23 year-old Londoner Freya Ridings released her singles Blackout and Maps (a breathtaking version of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs original song)in 2017.

As the title suggests, the album was recorded at the studio formerly owned by Johnny Cash and now owned by his son, John Carter Cash. Snider played all the instruments on the record, mostly guitar and harmonica, but he also played banjo on one song and overdubbed mandolin and percussion on some others. The only other people on the album are Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires, who contributed backing vocals to several songs. Among the highlights of the record are a trio of talking blues numbers, which reinforce the fact Snider has come full circle with the album because it was the song \u201cTalking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues\u201d from his 1994 debut, Songs For The Daily Planet, that first launched the native of Portland, Oregon, into the national consciousness.

Tocar\u00eda los teclados en lugar de Andr\u00e9s Calamaro, que se un\u00eda a Los Abuelos de la Nada y participar\u00eda en los discos \"Clics Modernos\" (1983) y \"Piano Bar\" (1984).\n\nTras ese empuj\u00f3n art\u00edstico, prepar\u00f3 su primer disco solista, \"Del '63\" (1984). Lo present\u00f3 primero en Rosario y luego en Buenos Aires, acompa\u00f1ado por Daniel Wirtz en bater\u00eda, Fabi\u00e1n Gallardo en guitarra, teclados y voz, Tweety Gonz\u00e1lez en teclados y Paul Dorge en bajo, m\u00e1s los invitados especiales: Fabi Cantilo, Rub\u00e9n Gold\u00edn y Miguel Zavaleta. Al tiempo, Llonch retornar\u00eda al bajo.\n\nYa por entonces consagrado como uno de los compositores m\u00e1s importantes (Luca Prod\u00e1n lo defini\u00f3 como \"el hijo de Charly Garc\u00eda y Nito Mestre\"), se present\u00f3 junto a Baglietto en Obras, el 7 y 8 de junio de 1985, para presentarse nuevamente ante el p\u00fablico porte\u00f1o con su nuevo disco, \"Giros\".\n\nCon Luis Alberto Spinetta tuvo un encuentro fortuito, similar al que lo uni\u00f3 a Garc\u00eda. \u00abEsta es la mejor m\u00fasica que se est\u00e1 haciendo hoy\u00bb, coment\u00f3 el Flaco tras escuchar un demo de lo que ser\u00eda el segundo \u00e1lbum. Juntos grabaron \"La la la\" (1986) y realizaron una desordenada gira que los llev\u00f3 hasta Santiago de Chile. Ese a\u00f1o particip\u00f3 de los festejos por los Mil D\u00edas en Democracia, organizados por el gobierno de Santa Fe en el Monumento a la Bandera. All\u00ed se present\u00f3 con Spinetta como invitado, en un espect\u00e1culo que tambi\u00e9n reuni\u00f3 a Juan Carlos Baglietto, Silvina Garr\u00e9 y Antonio Tarrag\u00f3 Ros.\n\n\"El peor crimen que puede cometer un intelectual es el enga\u00f1o a trav\u00e9s del cual obtiene dinero\", declar\u00f3 al presentar \"Ciudad de Pobres Corazones\" (1987), compuesto en memoria de su t\u00eda y su abuela, asesinadas en Rosario. Este \u00e1lbum, elegido como el Mejor del A\u00f1o para el Suplemento S\u00ed, marca una clara diferenciaci\u00f3n con el per\u00edodo anterior, m\u00e1s r\u00edtmico. Su escepticismo se plasma en las composiciones dark y en sus declaraciones: \"para quien piensa que la m\u00fasica sirve para algo, la gira de Amnesty es lo mejor que le puede pasar. Yo no creo que el arte sirva para nada\". Si en su primera etapa cantaba \"qui\u00e9n dijo que todo est\u00e1 perdido / yo vengo a ofrecer mi coraz\u00f3n\", ahora sentencia: \"en esta puta ciudad / todo se quema y se va / matan a pobres corazones\".\n\nEn diciembre de 1987 se present\u00f3 como telonero de Sting, en el estadio de River Plate. Todav\u00eda furioso e ireverente, declar\u00f3: \u00ab\u00a1A los 40 a\u00f1os se da cuenta de que est\u00e1n torturando gente en el mundo! \u00bfQui\u00e9n de nosotros puede permitirse esa misma ingenuidad? Lo que es cr\u00edtico es el fen\u00f3meno en los medios: lo muestran a Sting como si fuera el Santo Redentor\u00bb (H.Vargas, p\u00e1g 106).\n\n\"Ey!\" (1988), su siguiente disco, se grab\u00f3 en Nueva York y La Habana, mientras participaba del Festival de Varadero junto a Baglietto. Este es el primer disco producido por el propio Fito y fue registrado con su nueva banda: Guillermo Vadal\u00e1 en bajo, Guillermo Colombres en bater\u00eda, Osvaldo Fattoruso en percusi\u00f3n, trompetistas y saxofonistas del grupo Afrocuba (que por entonces acompa\u00f1aba a Silvio Rodriguez) y una serie de guitarristas invitados: Fabi\u00e1n Gallardo, Ulises Butr\u00f3n, Ricardo Mollo y Gabriel Car\u00e1mbula.\n\n\u00ab\"Ey!\" aparece en un momento de transici\u00f3n. Luego de una temporada en el infierno que lo llev\u00f3 a su expresi\u00f3n musical m\u00e1s salvaje, contrapuesto al sitial de rom\u00e1ntica lucidez en el que muchos pretend\u00edan congelarlo por su producci\u00f3n anterior, P\u00e1ez lanza este trabajo sobre el final de una etapa, antes quecomo testimonio de un nuevo punto de partida (...)\"Ey!\" parece un conglomerado de influencias y estilos que muestran no a uno, sino a varios Fito P\u00e1ez posibles. Una gama de posibilidades en que pueden advertirse, sin dudas, facetas m\u00e1s logradas e interesantes que otras\u00bb (G.Allerand, citado en H.Vargas, p\u00e1g 119).\n\n\"Tercer mundo\" (1990) es una especie de pel\u00edcula sobre el continente americano y sus pa\u00edses. \u00abEl disco refleja lo que v\u00ed en mis viajes por Am\u00e9rica Latina: las fiestas paganas, los curas mezclados con los terroristas, las prostitutas tratando de quitarles el dinero a los norteamericanos. Me dije: aqu\u00ed abajo hay un mundo muy fuerte. Quise reflejar eso\u00bb, explic\u00f3 Fito (H.Vargas, p\u00e1g 131). Los temas m\u00e1s importantes son \"Carabelas nada\", \"Yo te am\u00e9 en Nicaragua\", \"El chico de la tapa\" y \"Tercer Mundo\", definida grandilocuentemente como \u00abel equivalente rockero de \"Cambalache\"\u00bb. Con nueva banda, este trabajo fue presentado en el teatro Gran Rex los d\u00edas 14 y 15 de diciembre. Los m\u00fasicos eran Gallardo en teclados, guitarra y coros, Guillermo Vadal\u00e1 en bajo, Daniel Colombres en bater\u00eda, Ricardo Verdirame en guitarra, Mario Maselli en teclados y Celsa Mel Gowland en coros. Entre los invitados especiales (tanto al disco como a su presentaci\u00f3n) figuran Mercedes Sosa, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Liliana Herrero, Fabiana Cantilo e Illya Kuryaki & The Valderramas.\n\nEl siguiente \u00e1lbum ser\u00eda el que mayor \u00e9xito y dinero le traer\u00eda: \"El amor despu\u00e9s del amor\" (1992). \"Nadie puede y nadie debe vivir sin amor\" es el estribillo que caracteriza a este trabajo, criticado por su superficialidad y \"falto de compromiso\". Sin embargo, el \u00e9xito comercial lo llev\u00f3 a ser el disco m\u00e1s vendido de la historia del rock nacional (600.000 copias) con hits como el tema hom\u00f3nimo, \"La rueda m\u00e1gica\", \"Dos d\u00edas en la vida\" y \"A rodar mi vida\". Fue presentado primero en Rosario, en el estadio cubierto de Newell's Old Boys, luego en once shows en el teatro Gran Rex de la Capital y, finalmente, por todo el pa\u00eds en La Rueda M\u00e1gica Tour '93, que culmin\u00f3 en Velez, los d\u00edas 24 y 25 de abril, ante 40.000 espectadores cada noche. En diciembre de ese a\u00f1o repiti\u00f3 su presentaci\u00f3n en Velez, a beneficio de UNICEF Argentina: don\u00f3 420 mil d\u00f3lares.\n\nP\u00e1ez se qued\u00f3 con todos las encuestas de popularidad: Mejor Solista, Mejor Disco (\"El amor...\"), Mejor Tema y Mejor Video\n\n(\"Tumbas de la gloria\") y perdi\u00f3 solamente en Mejor Show, superado por el retorno de Ser\u00fa Gir\u00e1n en River. Ya para mediados de 1994, \"El amor despu\u00e9s del amor\" hab\u00eda alcanzado las 650.000 copias vendidas.\n\nEl \u00e9xito tambi\u00e9n lo acompa\u00f1\u00f3 en Cuba y fue el primer extranjero en permit\u00edrsele su presentaci\u00f3n en la Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n de La Habana, ante 40.000 espectadores y con transmisi\u00f3n en directo para el resto de la isla. Luego, acompa\u00f1ado por Silvio Rodr\u00edguez, fue a visitar a Fidel a la Residencia. Su presentaci\u00f3n en el Festival de Montreux (Suiza).\n\nCon la presi\u00f3n de igualar el \u00e9xito anterior, Fito volvi\u00f3 al estudio para grabar \"Circo Beat\" (1994), pero las expectativas (art\u00edsticamente hablando) quedaron muy grandes para este trabajo. Sin embargo, un par de temas contaron con amplia difusi\u00f3n en las radios: \"Mariposa Tecknicolor\" y \"Tema de Piluso\", en homenaje al c\u00f3mico rosarino Alberto Olmedo. Tambi\u00e9n edit\u00f3 \"Circo Beat Brasil\", con tres bonus tracks en portugu\u00e9s: \"Mariposa Technicolor\" (a d\u00fao con Caetano Veloso), \"She's mine\" (con Djavan) y \"Nas luzes de Rosario\" (o \"Tema de Piluso\", con Herbert Vianna, de los Paralamas). En total, esta placa vendi\u00f3 350.000 copias, lo que lo convirtieron en el segundo \u00e1lbum m\u00e1s exitoso del '95.\n\nSe present\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n en las Francofolies, el desembarco del \"nuevo rock franc\u00e9s\" en Obras, con Sinclair, FFF y No One is Innocent, m\u00e1s el aporte local de Todos Tus Muertos y Los Fabulosos Cadillacs.\n\nEn 1995 present\u00f3 oficialmente el material en 20 shows en el Teatro Opera y cerr\u00f3 el a\u00f1o en un estadio de River sorprendentemente semivac\u00edo (apenas convoc\u00f3 a 25.000 espectadores). Lo acompa\u00f1aron Pomo (bater\u00eda), Gabriel Car\u00e1mbula (guitarra), Gringui Herrera (guitarra), Guillermo Vadal\u00e1 (bajo), Alina Gandini (teclados), Laura V\u00e1zquez (teclados) y Nicol\u00e1s Cotta (percusi\u00f3n). Tambi\u00e9n participaron Andr\u00e9s Calamaro, Ariel Rot, Liliana Herrero y Fabiana Cantilo como m\u00fasicos invitados. Las presentaciones de \"Circo Beat\" tuvieron su \u00faltima fecha en un show al aire libre y con entrada gratuita, que convoc\u00f3 a cerca de 50.000 personas en los bosques de Palermo.\n\nLa cadena MTV le propuso grabar un \"unplugged\", pero ante el no acuerdo econ\u00f3mico, Fito grab\u00f3 una recopilaci\u00f3n ac\u00fastica en sociedad con Telef\u00e9, bautizada \"Euforia\".\n\nEn 1998 edit\u00f3 \"Enemigos \u00edntimos\", un muy promocionado \u00e1lbum junto al espa\u00f1ol Joaqu\u00edn Sabina, cuyo t\u00edtulo ser\u00eda premonitorio sobre la relaci\u00f3n del d\u00fao: terminaron cancelando una gira con m\u00e1s de 60 fechas por Am\u00e9rica y Espa\u00f1a con una poes\u00eda de despedida firmada por el espa\u00f1ol: \u00abUrge cortar por lo sano, con la gira del verano, y el kilombo del video. El rol del patito feo, no me va te lo aseguro, y menos el de hombre duro, que a t\u00ed te cuesta tan poco\u00bb.\n\nEn el '99 se edita \"Abre\", un material fuerte con temas extensos, producido por Phil Ramone, en el cual el aspecto vocal se impone en primer plano.\n\n\"Rey Sol\" (2000) fue dedicado a su hijo Mart\u00edn. \u00c9ste \u00e1lbum tuvo su cuota pol\u00e9mica con el corte \"El diablo de tu coraz\u00f3n\", cuyo videoclip fue dirigido por Eddie Flehner. Pero pese a eso, no fue demasiado aceptado.\n\nDejando de lado moment\u00e1neamente su faceta de m\u00fasico, P\u00e1ez dirigi\u00f3 durante el 2001 la pel\u00edcula \"Vidas privadas\", protagonizada por su mujer de entonces, Cecilia Roth, junto a Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Lito Cruz y H\u00e9ctor Alterio. El film, con gui\u00f3n del propio P\u00e1ez, fue estrenado el 25 de abril del 2002, y Fito present\u00f3 su trabajo en varios festivales internacionales. La cr\u00edtica no lo acompa\u00f1\u00f3, y el m\u00fasico/cineasta se enoj\u00f3 con los medios especializados.\n\nEl 2003 lo encontr\u00f3 en un aspecto mucho m\u00e1s rockero, como hac\u00eda tiempo no se lo ve\u00eda. \"Naturaleza sangre\" incluy\u00f3 como invitados a Garc\u00eda, Spinetta y Rita Lee, y el material fue editado tambi\u00e9n en formato DVD.\n\n\"Mi vida con ellas 1\" y \"2\" no deja de ser una recopilaci\u00f3n en vivo, pero tiene el m\u00e9rito de no caer necesariamente en los hits m\u00e1s cl\u00e1sicos de su carrera. Fue grabado en diferentes ciudades de Am\u00e9rica.\n\nBajo la direcci\u00f3n de Gerardo Gandini y acompa\u00f1ado por una orquesta de nueve cuerdas, encar\u00f3 otro disco de versiones, \"Moda y pueblo\", con el agregado que tambi\u00e9n incluy\u00f3 composiciones ajenas de por ejemplo, Charly Garc\u00eda y Spinetta.\n\n\"El mundo cabe en una canci\u00f3n\" (2006) fue editado luego de terminar de rodar su segundo film, \"De qui\u00e9n es el portaligas\". Producido por el propio Fito, el disco fue grabado en Circo Beat, junto a Guillermo Vadal\u00e1 (bajo), Gabriel Car\u00e1mbula (guitarras), Coki Debernardi (guitarras), Gonzalo Aloras (guitarras y voz), Pete Thomas (bater\u00eda y percusi\u00f3n) y Vandera (coros).

Si en su primera etapa cantaba \"qui\u00e9n dijo que todo est\u00e1 perdido / yo vengo a ofrecer mi coraz\u00f3n\", ahora sentencia: \"en esta puta ciudad / todo se quema y se va / matan a pobres corazones\".\n\nEn diciembre de 1987 se present\u00f3 como telonero de Sting, en el estadio de River Plate. Todav\u00eda furioso e ireverente, declar\u00f3: \u00ab\u00a1A los 40 a\u00f1os se da cuenta de que est\u00e1n torturando gente en el mundo! \u00bfQui\u00e9n de nosotros puede permitirse esa misma ingenuidad? Lo que es cr\u00edtico es el fen\u00f3meno en los medios: lo muestran a Sting como si fuera el Santo Redentor\u00bb (H.Vargas, p\u00e1g 106).\n\n\"Ey!\" (1988), su siguiente disco, se grab\u00f3 en Nueva York y La Habana, mientras participaba del Festival de Varadero junto a Baglietto. Este es el primer disco producido por el propio Fito y fue registrado con su nueva banda: Guillermo Vadal\u00e1 en bajo, Guillermo Colombres en bater\u00eda, Osvaldo Fattoruso en percusi\u00f3n, trompetistas y saxofonistas del grupo Afrocuba (que por entonces acompa\u00f1aba a Silvio Rodriguez) y una serie de guitarristas invitados: Fabi\u00e1n Gallardo, Ulises Butr\u00f3n, Ricardo Mollo y Gabriel Car\u00e1mbula.\n\n\u00ab\"Ey!\" aparece en un momento de transici\u00f3n. Luego de una temporada en el infierno que lo llev\u00f3 a su expresi\u00f3n musical m\u00e1s salvaje, contrapuesto al sitial de rom\u00e1ntica lucidez en el que muchos pretend\u00edan congelarlo por su producci\u00f3n anterior, P\u00e1ez lanza este trabajo sobre el final de una etapa, antes quecomo testimonio de un nuevo punto de partida (...)\"Ey!\" parece un conglomerado de influencias y estilos que muestran no a uno, sino a varios Fito P\u00e1ez posibles. Una gama de posibilidades en que pueden advertirse, sin dudas, facetas m\u00e1s logradas e interesantes que otras\u00bb (G.Allerand, citado en H.Vargas, p\u00e1g 119).\n\n\"Tercer mundo\" (1990) es una especie de pel\u00edcula sobre el continente americano y sus pa\u00edses. \u00abEl disco refleja lo que v\u00ed en mis viajes por Am\u00e9rica Latina: las fiestas paganas, los curas mezclados con los terroristas, las prostitutas tratando de quitarles el dinero a los norteamericanos. Me dije: aqu\u00ed abajo hay un mundo muy fuerte. Quise reflejar eso\u00bb, explic\u00f3 Fito (H.Vargas, p\u00e1g 131). Los temas m\u00e1s importantes son \"Carabelas nada\", \"Yo te am\u00e9 en Nicaragua\", \"El chico de la tapa\" y \"Tercer Mundo\", definida grandilocuentemente como \u00abel equivalente rockero de \"Cambalache\"\u00bb. Con nueva banda, este trabajo fue presentado en el teatro Gran Rex los d\u00edas 14 y 15 de diciembre. Los m\u00fasicos eran Gallardo en teclados, guitarra y coros, Guillermo Vadal\u00e1 en bajo, Daniel Colombres en bater\u00eda, Ricardo Verdirame en guitarra, Mario Maselli en teclados y Celsa Mel Gowland en coros. Entre los invitados especiales (tanto al disco como a su presentaci\u00f3n) figuran Mercedes Sosa, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Liliana Herrero, Fabiana Cantilo e Illya Kuryaki & The Valderramas.\n\nEl siguiente \u00e1lbum ser\u00eda el que mayor \u00e9xito y dinero le traer\u00eda: \"El amor despu\u00e9s del amor\" (1992). \"Nadie puede y nadie debe vivir sin amor\" es el estribillo que caracteriza a este trabajo, criticado por su superficialidad y \"falto de compromiso\". Sin embargo, el \u00e9xito comercial lo llev\u00f3 a ser el disco m\u00e1s vendido de la historia del rock nacional (600.000 copias) con hits como el tema hom\u00f3nimo, \"La rueda m\u00e1gica\", \"Dos d\u00edas en la vida\" y \"A rodar mi vida\". Fue presentado primero en Rosario, en el estadio cubierto de Newell's Old Boys, luego en once shows en el teatro Gran Rex de la Capital y, finalmente, por todo el pa\u00eds en La Rueda M\u00e1gica Tour '93, que culmin\u00f3 en Velez, los d\u00edas 24 y 25 de abril, ante 40.000 espectadores cada noche. En diciembre de ese a\u00f1o repiti\u00f3 su presentaci\u00f3n en Velez, a beneficio de UNICEF Argentina: don\u00f3 420 mil d\u00f3lares.\n\nP\u00e1ez se qued\u00f3 con todos las encuestas de popularidad: Mejor Solista, Mejor Disco (\"El amor...\"), Mejor Tema y Mejor Video\n\n(\"Tumbas de la gloria\") y perdi\u00f3 solamente en Mejor Show, superado por el retorno de Ser\u00fa Gir\u00e1n en River. Ya para mediados de 1994, \"El amor despu\u00e9s del amor\" hab\u00eda alcanzado las 650.000 copias vendidas.\n\nEl \u00e9xito tambi\u00e9n lo acompa\u00f1\u00f3 en Cuba y fue el primer extranjero en permit\u00edrsele su presentaci\u00f3n en la Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n de La Habana, ante 40.000 espectadores y con transmisi\u00f3n en directo para el resto de la isla. Luego, acompa\u00f1ado por Silvio Rodr\u00edguez, fue a visitar a Fidel a la Residencia. Su presentaci\u00f3n en el Festival de Montreux (Suiza).\n\nCon la presi\u00f3n de igualar el \u00e9xito anterior, Fito volvi\u00f3 al estudio para grabar \"Circo Beat\" (1994), pero las expectativas (art\u00edsticamente hablando) quedaron muy grandes para este trabajo. Sin embargo, un par de temas contaron con amplia difusi\u00f3n en las radios: \"Mariposa Tecknicolor\" y \"Tema de Piluso\", en homenaje al c\u00f3mico rosarino Alberto Olmedo. Tambi\u00e9n edit\u00f3 \"Circo Beat Brasil\", con tres bonus tracks en portugu\u00e9s: \"Mariposa Technicolor\" (a d\u00fao con Caetano Veloso), \"She's mine\" (con Djavan) y \"Nas luzes de Rosario\" (o \"Tema de Piluso\", con Herbert Vianna, de los Paralamas). En total, esta placa vendi\u00f3 350.000 copias, lo que lo convirtieron en el segundo \u00e1lbum m\u00e1s exitoso del '95.\n\nSe present\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n en las Francofolies, el desembarco del \"nuevo rock franc\u00e9s\" en Obras, con Sinclair, FFF y No One is Innocent, m\u00e1s el aporte local de Todos Tus Muertos y Los Fabulosos Cadillacs.\n\nEn 1995 present\u00f3 oficialmente el material en 20 shows en el Teatro Opera y cerr\u00f3 el a\u00f1o en un estadio de River sorprendentemente semivac\u00edo (apenas convoc\u00f3 a 25.000 espectadores). Lo acompa\u00f1aron Pomo (bater\u00eda), Gabriel Car\u00e1mbula (guitarra), Gringui Herrera (guitarra), Guillermo Vadal\u00e1 (bajo), Alina Gandini (teclados), Laura V\u00e1zquez (teclados) y Nicol\u00e1s Cotta (percusi\u00f3n). Tambi\u00e9n participaron Andr\u00e9s Calamaro, Ariel Rot, Liliana Herrero y Fabiana Cantilo como m\u00fasicos invitados. Las presentaciones de \"Circo Beat\" tuvieron su \u00faltima fecha en un show al aire libre y con entrada gratuita, que convoc\u00f3 a cerca de 50.000 personas en los bosques de Palermo.\n\nLa cadena MTV le propuso grabar un \"unplugged\", pero ante el no acuerdo econ\u00f3mico, Fito grab\u00f3 una recopilaci\u00f3n ac\u00fastica en sociedad con Telef\u00e9, bautizada \"Euforia\".\n\nEn 1998 edit\u00f3 \"Enemigos \u00edntimos\", un muy promocionado \u00e1lbum junto al espa\u00f1ol Joaqu\u00edn Sabina, cuyo t\u00edtulo ser\u00eda premonitorio sobre la relaci\u00f3n del d\u00fao: terminaron cancelando una gira con m\u00e1s de 60 fechas por Am\u00e9rica y Espa\u00f1a con una poes\u00eda de despedida firmada por el espa\u00f1ol: \u00abUrge cortar por lo sano, con la gira del verano, y el kilombo del video. El rol del patito feo, no me va te lo aseguro, y menos el de hombre duro, que a t\u00ed te cuesta tan poco\u00bb.\n\nEn el '99 se edita \"Abre\", un material fuerte con temas extensos, producido por Phil Ramone, en el cual el aspecto vocal se impone en primer plano.\n\n\"Rey Sol\" (2000) fue dedicado a su hijo Mart\u00edn. \u00c9ste \u00e1lbum tuvo su cuota pol\u00e9mica con el corte \"El diablo de tu coraz\u00f3n\", cuyo videoclip fue dirigido por Eddie Flehner. Pero pese a eso, no fue demasiado aceptado.\n\nDejando de lado moment\u00e1neamente su faceta de m\u00fasico, P\u00e1ez dirigi\u00f3 durante el 2001 la pel\u00edcula \"Vidas privadas\", protagonizada por su mujer de entonces, Cecilia Roth, junto a Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Lito Cruz y H\u00e9ctor Alterio. El film, con gui\u00f3n del propio P\u00e1ez, fue estrenado el 25 de abril del 2002, y Fito present\u00f3 su trabajo en varios festivales internacionales. La cr\u00edtica no lo acompa\u00f1\u00f3, y el m\u00fasico/cineasta se enoj\u00f3 con los medios especializados.\n\nEl 2003 lo encontr\u00f3 en un aspecto mucho m\u00e1s rockero, como hac\u00eda tiempo no se lo ve\u00eda. \"Naturaleza sangre\" incluy\u00f3 como invitados a Garc\u00eda, Spinetta y Rita Lee, y el material fue editado tambi\u00e9n en formato DVD.\n\n\"Mi vida con ellas 1\" y \"2\" no deja de ser una recopilaci\u00f3n en vivo, pero tiene el m\u00e9rito de no caer necesariamente en los hits m\u00e1s cl\u00e1sicos de su carrera. Fue grabado en diferentes ciudades de Am\u00e9rica.\n\nBajo la direcci\u00f3n de Gerardo Gandini y acompa\u00f1ado por una orquesta de nueve cuerdas, encar\u00f3 otro disco de versiones, \"Moda y pueblo\", con el agregado que tambi\u00e9n incluy\u00f3 composiciones ajenas de por ejemplo, Charly Garc\u00eda y Spinetta.\n\n\"El mundo cabe en una canci\u00f3n\" (2006) fue editado luego de terminar de rodar su segundo film, \"De qui\u00e9n es el portaligas\". Producido por el propio Fito, el disco fue grabado en Circo Beat, junto a Guillermo Vadal\u00e1 (bajo), Gabriel Car\u00e1mbula (guitarras), Coki Debernardi (guitarras), Gonzalo Aloras (guitarras y voz), Pete Thomas (bater\u00eda y percusi\u00f3n) y Vandera (coros).

This is the thought that crosses Debi Nova\u2019s mind every time she sits down at the piano to write a song. An artist with extraordinary musical talent, an exquisite personality and a captivating smile, Nova soars with the music she creates.\n\nBorn in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica, she first learned piano at the age of four and was fronting a locally popular band within a matter of several years. She\u2019s been a songwriter and multi-instrumentalist since the age of 14, and was on the road to achieving her dreams by 17, when she signed her first record deal. Since then, she has been involved in 6 Grammy nominated projects, and a path in the music world that includes collaborations with artists like the Black Eyed Peas, Sean Paul, Mark Ronson, Boney James, Vybz Kartel and Ce'Cile.\n\nWhile studying Ethnomusicology and Jazz at UCLA, Debi was invited by the legendary Brazilian artist Sergio Mendes to be the featured vocalist on his critically acclaimed album Timeless, and to accompany him on his tour through the U.S. and Japan. It wasn\u2019t until the fall of 2004 that she released her first single, the vibrant \u201cOne Rhythm,\u201d which was remixed by Ralphi Rosario and went to the top of the Billboard Dance Music/Club Play chart.\n\nShe then joined Ricky Martin on his 2004-2005 Life Tour in support of his album \u201cLife\u201d on which Debi was featured on 3 tracks; Drop It On Me (featuring Daddy Yankee as well), I Am and Qu\u00e9 M\u00e1s Da. All this activity fostered her growth not only as a performer but as a songwriter comfortable writing in both Spanish and English (sometimes within the same song).\n\nNova released her first album, \u201cLuna Nueva\u201d, produced by Gustavo Santaolalla and Marius Devries, in 2010. The album showcases Debi's eclectic talents -she plays piano, guitar, and bass, among other instruments- and captures her authentic Latin roots. Through an electrifying combination of Latin beats with forceful pop rhythms, Debi's album speaks vibrantly of the universal language and power of Music. Her first single from \u201cLuna Nueva\u201d, \u201cDrummer Boy\u201d, reached #5 on the Billboard dance charts. That same year, she participated in two of the most watched TV shows in North America, \u201cDancing With The Stars\u201d and \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance\u201d.\n\nDuring 2011-2012, Debi was on tour in Latin America and the United States opening for the popular Mexican group Camila, and was invited by Venezuelan singer Franco De Vita to participate in the recording of the song \u201cSi Quieres Decir Adi\u00f3s\u201d, which was included in Franco De Vita\u2019s album \u201cEn Primera Fila\u201d. She went on to accompany De Vita on his tour throughout Latin America, performing live over 60 times with the singer.\n\nAlso in 2011, MTV Latin America awarded her the prize MTV Chiuku: Agent of Change, for her work in the United Nations\u2019 campaign \u201cUNITE to end violence against women\u201d, and in April 2012, she was named ambassador of YUNGA (Youth and United Nations Global Alliance).\n\nRecently, Nova was the official voice of the Central American Olympics San Jos\u00e9 2013, with the song \u201cArriba Arriba\u201d and was also invited to participate in the conference TEDx Joven Pura Vida, sharing her story and her music to encourage young people to follow their dreams.\n\nDebi Nova\u2019s goal is to captivate the world with her new creations on and further consolidate herself as a Latin/crossover artist. Her second album, \u201cSOY\u201d, is entirely in Spanish and showcases 11 songs which demonstrate Nova\u2019s growth as an artist, pianist, and composer. Songs which transmit warm, positive and contagious emotions, and unleash with great enthusiasm the singularity of a captivating spirit. The album was recorded in Mondomix Studios in Argentina, and produced by Cachorro L\u00f3pez.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.desdecasaconmusica.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Raj Smoove ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7278751.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Hip Hop, R&b, Trap", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Raj Smoove, \u201cThe Greatest DJ in the World\u201d as claimed by Lil\u2019 Wayne, is the premier DJ in the New Orleans Metropolitan area.

The family moved back to Venezuela when De Vita was 13, and he later studied piano at the university level.\n\nIn 1982, De Vita formed the group Icaro, which released one self-titled album in his homeland. Two years later, he released his first disc as a solo artist, simply titled Franco De Vita. The album spun off three Spanish-language hits: \u201cSomos Tres,\u201d \u201cNo Hay Cielo\u201d and \u201cUn Buen Perdedor.\u201d His 1986 album Fantas\u00eda produced several more hits, including the title song and \u201cAqu\u00ed Est\u00e1s Otra Vez.\u201d \u201cS\u00f3lo Importas T\u00fa,\u201d taken from the album, was used as the theme song to the Spanish-language soap opera La Dama De Rosa. He appeared in the end credits of every episode, performing the song at the piano.\n\nSeeking wider international exposure, De Vita moved to the Sony label for the 1988 album Al Norte Del Sur. A critical and commercial smash, the album cemented his reputation as a purveyor of socially-conscious, adult-oriented pop, particularly through the tunes \u201cTe Amo\u201d and \u201cLouis.\u201d The latter song, about a daydreaming cabbie who idolizes The Beatles, was promoted with a music video considered quite advanced for its time. De Vita\u2019s 1990 album Extranjero featured the song \u201cNo Basta,\u201d which spent four weeks at No. 1 on the U.S. Latin charts and won an MTV Video Music Award.\n\nSubsequent albums have included the live release En Vivo Marzo 16 (1992); Voces A Mi Alrededor in 1993; the acoustic-flavored Fuera De Este Mundo (1996); and 1999\u2019s world-beat inspired Nada Es Igual. He left Sony for the 2002 album Segundas Partes Tambi\u00e9n Son Buenas, but returned to the label the following year.\n\nDe Vita has continued to enjoy success as one of Latin music\u2019s most consistently popular singer-songwriters, with a style often compared to Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel. His 2004 album Stop reached the Top 10 throughout Latin America and on the U.S. Latin charts, spurred by the hits \u201cT\u00fa De Qu\u00e9 Vas\u201d and \u201cSi La Ves,\u201d the latter a collaboration with pop group Sin Bandera. That same year, he toured arenas in the United States on a co-headlining tour with Ricardo Montaner, a fellow Venezuelan songwriter. De Vita is reportedly one of the largest selling musical artists ever to emerge from Venezuela. He also has recorded in Italian and Portuguese, albeit to less success. As a songwriter, he has written hits for Ricky Martin and Chayanne. In 2005, an expanded edition of Stop was released, titled Stop + Algo M\u00e1s, that included remixes and live recordings, as well as No S\u00e9 Lo Que Me Das, De Vita's first recording in English.

However, it was a fruitful move to Switzerland in 2010 that started a love affair with electronic music and DJing that would last a lifetime. Ilona had always been tinkering with music production; in fact before she picked up a set of headphones in Switzerland she had dipped her toes in to that realm.\n\nWith several appearances at the widely celebrated Zurich Street Parade Festival, her Dj career began to take off but Ilona, not wanting to stay too long in any one place and the need to be constantly challenged, decided to make the move back to Dubai in 2012 to make her way in the now flourishing dance music scene. It didn\u2019t take her long to find her mark and by 2015 Ilona started releasing on Dubai based and Sony endorsed label Bootleg Social Records and racked up a serious amount of guest slots and residencies in the city of sand. None higher profile than her residency at Caf\u00e9 Del Mar Dubai and well-received residency at hit techno night \u2013 Back2Basics.\n\nHer production abilities were by then beginning to become more widespread to the point that German mega imprint Get Physical Music signed her to their esteemed imprint with her track \u2018Existe\u2019. The track was such a success that numerous people in the industry began to take notice of Ilona, to the point that she was included in DJ Mag\u2019s \u2018Top 6 Artists to Watch Out For\u2019.\n\nWith releases following on Selador, Emotive Sounds, Dear Deer Records, Filth On Acid, and Natura Viva, Ilona\u2019s production skills are now highly sought out and in demand, and they have regularly received great support by many influential artists such as Pete Tong, Andhim, Betoko, James Zabiela, Paco Osuna, Nicole Moudaber, M.A.N.D.Y., Tiefschwarz, Noir, DJ T and many many more.\n\nNow after moving back to Zurich this year, she has played for the likes of Ministry Of Sound, Relevance Festival Copenhagen, Backyard Sessions Festival Malmo, Up2Us Ibiza, Abflug Berlin, Tabula Records Show in ADE 2017 and her deep melodic techno sets are reaching more and more new audiences, with spectacular effect.\n\nManagement & Booking inquiries: jbw@consultant.com (Cedric H)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Leslie Grace ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Latin", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.desdecasaconmusica.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DINO D'SANTIAGO ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.desdecasaconmusica.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Felix Jaehn ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9149522.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Melodic House", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u2192 Instagram: instagram.com/felixjaehn\n\u2192 Facebook: facebook.com/FelixJaehnMusic\n\u2192 Twitter: twitter.com/felixjaehn\n\u2192 Spotify Playlist: open.spotify.com/user/felixjaehn\n\u2192 Artist website: http://felix-jaehn.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gente de Zona ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8160612.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Urban, Latin, Reggaeton, Reggae, Hip Hop, Hip-hop", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "GENTE DE ZONA, Convertidos en los primeros artistas cubanos en llegar al tope del Billboard's \"Hot Latin Songs\", ellos son los l\u00edderes de una revoluci\u00f3n musical.

Ya en 1977 tocaba en El Banquete, junto a Rub\u00e9n Gold\u00edn y Jorge Llonch. A partir del a\u00f1o siguiente se present\u00f3 como solista en varios pubs locales. Cuando Juan Carlos Baglietto form\u00f3 su banda, lo incluy\u00f3 como tecladista y como arreglador, junto a Gold\u00edn, quien tambi\u00e9n tocaba la guitarra. En esa banda militaban Silvina Garr\u00e9 y Sergio S\u00e1enz. Para fines de 1983 ya cantaba \"Del '63\" solo con su piano, en medio del show de Baglietto.\n\nDurante una presentaci\u00f3n con Baglietto en el teatro Coliseo (4/12/82), Charly Garc\u00eda fue hasta el camar\u00edn para saludarlo. El apenas ten\u00eda 19 a\u00f1os y la plata que sacaba le daba para pagar algunas deudas. Al poco tiempo, Daniel Grinbank, por aqu\u00e9l entonces m\u00e1nager de Garc\u00eda, lo llam\u00f3 a su oficina: comenzar\u00eda a ensayar para la gira nacional de \"Clics Modernos\", junto a GIT y Fabiana Cantilo. Tocar\u00eda los teclados en lugar de Andr\u00e9s Calamaro, que se un\u00eda a Los Abuelos de la Nada y participar\u00eda en los discos \"Clics Modernos\" (1983) y \"Piano Bar\" (1984).\n\nTras ese empuj\u00f3n art\u00edstico, prepar\u00f3 su primer disco solista, \"Del '63\" (1984). Lo present\u00f3 primero en Rosario y luego en Buenos Aires, acompa\u00f1ado por Daniel Wirtz en bater\u00eda, Fabi\u00e1n Gallardo en guitarra, teclados y voz, Tweety Gonz\u00e1lez en teclados y Paul Dorge en bajo, m\u00e1s los invitados especiales: Fabi Cantilo, Rub\u00e9n Gold\u00edn y Miguel Zavaleta. Al tiempo, Llonch retornar\u00eda al bajo.\n\nYa por entonces consagrado como uno de los compositores m\u00e1s importantes (Luca Prod\u00e1n lo defini\u00f3 como \"el hijo de Charly Garc\u00eda y Nito Mestre\"), se present\u00f3 junto a Baglietto en Obras, el 7 y 8 de junio de 1985, para presentarse nuevamente ante el p\u00fablico porte\u00f1o con su nuevo disco, \"Giros\".\n\nCon Luis Alberto Spinetta tuvo un encuentro fortuito, similar al que lo uni\u00f3 a Garc\u00eda. \u00abEsta es la mejor m\u00fasica que se est\u00e1 haciendo hoy\u00bb, coment\u00f3 el Flaco tras escuchar un demo de lo que ser\u00eda el segundo \u00e1lbum. Juntos grabaron \"La la la\" (1986) y realizaron una desordenada gira que los llev\u00f3 hasta Santiago de Chile. Ese a\u00f1o particip\u00f3 de los festejos por los Mil D\u00edas en Democracia, organizados por el gobierno de Santa Fe en el Monumento a la Bandera. All\u00ed se present\u00f3 con Spinetta como invitado, en un espect\u00e1culo que tambi\u00e9n reuni\u00f3 a Juan Carlos Baglietto, Silvina Garr\u00e9 y Antonio Tarrag\u00f3 Ros.\n\n\"El peor crimen que puede cometer un intelectual es el enga\u00f1o a trav\u00e9s del cual obtiene dinero\", declar\u00f3 al presentar \"Ciudad de Pobres Corazones\" (1987), compuesto en memoria de su t\u00eda y su abuela, asesinadas en Rosario. Este \u00e1lbum, elegido como el Mejor del A\u00f1o para el Suplemento S\u00ed, marca una clara diferenciaci\u00f3n con el per\u00edodo anterior, m\u00e1s r\u00edtmico. Su escepticismo se plasma en las composiciones dark y en sus declaraciones: \"para quien piensa que la m\u00fasica sirve para algo, la gira de Amnesty es lo mejor que le puede pasar. Yo no creo que el arte sirva para nada\". Si en su primera etapa cantaba \"qui\u00e9n dijo que todo est\u00e1 perdido / yo vengo a ofrecer mi coraz\u00f3n\", ahora sentencia: \"en esta puta ciudad / todo se quema y se va / matan a pobres corazones\".\n\nEn diciembre de 1987 se present\u00f3 como telonero de Sting, en el estadio de River Plate. Todav\u00eda furioso e ireverente, declar\u00f3: \u00ab\u00a1A los 40 a\u00f1os se da cuenta de que est\u00e1n torturando gente en el mundo! \u00bfQui\u00e9n de nosotros puede permitirse esa misma ingenuidad? Lo que es cr\u00edtico es el fen\u00f3meno en los medios: lo muestran a Sting como si fuera el Santo Redentor\u00bb (H.Vargas, p\u00e1g 106).\n\n\"Ey!\" (1988), su siguiente disco, se grab\u00f3 en Nueva York y La Habana, mientras participaba del Festival de Varadero junto a Baglietto. Este es el primer disco producido por el propio Fito y fue registrado con su nueva banda: Guillermo Vadal\u00e1 en bajo, Guillermo Colombres en bater\u00eda, Osvaldo Fattoruso en percusi\u00f3n, trompetistas y saxofonistas del grupo Afrocuba (que por entonces acompa\u00f1aba a Silvio Rodriguez) y una serie de guitarristas invitados: Fabi\u00e1n Gallardo, Ulises Butr\u00f3n, Ricardo Mollo y Gabriel Car\u00e1mbula.\n\n\u00ab\"Ey!\" aparece en un momento de transici\u00f3n. Luego de una temporada en el infierno que lo llev\u00f3 a su expresi\u00f3n musical m\u00e1s salvaje, contrapuesto al sitial de rom\u00e1ntica lucidez en el que muchos pretend\u00edan congelarlo por su producci\u00f3n anterior, P\u00e1ez lanza este trabajo sobre el final de una etapa, antes quecomo testimonio de un nuevo punto de partida (...)\"Ey!\" parece un conglomerado de influencias y estilos que muestran no a uno, sino a varios Fito P\u00e1ez posibles. Una gama de posibilidades en que pueden advertirse, sin dudas, facetas m\u00e1s logradas e interesantes que otras\u00bb (G.Allerand, citado en H.Vargas, p\u00e1g 119).\n\n\"Tercer mundo\" (1990) es una especie de pel\u00edcula sobre el continente americano y sus pa\u00edses. \u00abEl disco refleja lo que v\u00ed en mis viajes por Am\u00e9rica Latina: las fiestas paganas, los curas mezclados con los terroristas, las prostitutas tratando de quitarles el dinero a los norteamericanos. Me dije: aqu\u00ed abajo hay un mundo muy fuerte. Quise reflejar eso\u00bb, explic\u00f3 Fito (H.Vargas, p\u00e1g 131). Los temas m\u00e1s importantes son \"Carabelas nada\", \"Yo te am\u00e9 en Nicaragua\", \"El chico de la tapa\" y \"Tercer Mundo\", definida grandilocuentemente como \u00abel equivalente rockero de \"Cambalache\"\u00bb. Con nueva banda, este trabajo fue presentado en el teatro Gran Rex los d\u00edas 14 y 15 de diciembre. Los m\u00fasicos eran Gallardo en teclados, guitarra y coros, Guillermo Vadal\u00e1 en bajo, Daniel Colombres en bater\u00eda, Ricardo Verdirame en guitarra, Mario Maselli en teclados y Celsa Mel Gowland en coros. Entre los invitados especiales (tanto al disco como a su presentaci\u00f3n) figuran Mercedes Sosa, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Liliana Herrero, Fabiana Cantilo e Illya Kuryaki & The Valderramas.\n\nEl siguiente \u00e1lbum ser\u00eda el que mayor \u00e9xito y dinero le traer\u00eda: \"El amor despu\u00e9s del amor\" (1992). \"Nadie puede y nadie debe vivir sin amor\" es el estribillo que caracteriza a este trabajo, criticado por su superficialidad y \"falto de compromiso\".

Lo acompa\u00f1aron Pomo (bater\u00eda), Gabriel Car\u00e1mbula (guitarra), Gringui Herrera (guitarra), Guillermo Vadal\u00e1 (bajo), Alina Gandini (teclados), Laura V\u00e1zquez (teclados) y Nicol\u00e1s Cotta (percusi\u00f3n).

Las presentaciones de \"Circo Beat\" tuvieron su \u00faltima fecha en un show al aire libre y con entrada gratuita, que convoc\u00f3 a cerca de 50.000 personas en los bosques de Palermo.\n\nLa cadena MTV le propuso grabar un \"unplugged\", pero ante el no acuerdo econ\u00f3mico, Fito grab\u00f3 una recopilaci\u00f3n ac\u00fastica en sociedad con Telef\u00e9, bautizada \"Euforia\".\n\nEn 1998 edit\u00f3 \"Enemigos \u00edntimos\", un muy promocionado \u00e1lbum junto al espa\u00f1ol Joaqu\u00edn Sabina, cuyo t\u00edtulo ser\u00eda premonitorio sobre la relaci\u00f3n del d\u00fao: terminaron cancelando una gira con m\u00e1s de 60 fechas por Am\u00e9rica y Espa\u00f1a con una poes\u00eda de despedida firmada por el espa\u00f1ol: \u00abUrge cortar por lo sano, con la gira del verano, y el kilombo del video.

Pero pese a eso, no fue demasiado aceptado.\n\nDejando de lado moment\u00e1neamente su faceta de m\u00fasico, P\u00e1ez dirigi\u00f3 durante el 2001 la pel\u00edcula \"Vidas privadas\", protagonizada por su mujer de entonces, Cecilia Roth, junto a Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Lito Cruz y H\u00e9ctor Alterio. El film, con gui\u00f3n del propio P\u00e1ez, fue estrenado el 25 de abril del 2002, y Fito present\u00f3 su trabajo en varios festivales internacionales. La cr\u00edtica no lo acompa\u00f1\u00f3, y el m\u00fasico/cineasta se enoj\u00f3 con los medios especializados.\n\nEl 2003 lo encontr\u00f3 en un aspecto mucho m\u00e1s rockero, como hac\u00eda tiempo no se lo ve\u00eda. \"Naturaleza sangre\" incluy\u00f3 como invitados a Garc\u00eda, Spinetta y Rita Lee, y el material fue editado tambi\u00e9n en formato DVD.\n\n\"Mi vida con ellas 1\" y \"2\" no deja de ser una recopilaci\u00f3n en vivo, pero tiene el m\u00e9rito de no caer necesariamente en los hits m\u00e1s cl\u00e1sicos de su carrera. Fue grabado en diferentes ciudades de Am\u00e9rica.\n\nBajo la direcci\u00f3n de Gerardo Gandini y acompa\u00f1ado por una orquesta de nueve cuerdas, encar\u00f3 otro disco de versiones, \"Moda y pueblo\", con el agregado que tambi\u00e9n incluy\u00f3 composiciones ajenas de por ejemplo, Charly Garc\u00eda y Spinetta.\n\n\"El mundo cabe en una canci\u00f3n\" (2006) fue editado luego de terminar de rodar su segundo film, \"De qui\u00e9n es el portaligas\".

As the title suggests, the album was recorded at the studio formerly owned by Johnny Cash and now owned by his son, John Carter Cash. Snider played all the instruments on the record, mostly guitar and harmonica, but he also played banjo on one song and overdubbed mandolin and percussion on some others. The only other people on the album are Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires, who contributed backing vocals to several songs. Among the highlights of the record are a trio of talking blues numbers, which reinforce the fact Snider has come full circle with the album because it was the song \u201cTalking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues\u201d from his 1994 debut, Songs For The Daily Planet, that first launched the native of Portland, Oregon, into the national consciousness.

This is the thought that crosses Debi Nova\u2019s mind every time she sits down at the piano to write a song. An artist with extraordinary musical talent, an exquisite personality and a captivating smile, Nova soars with the music she creates.\n\nBorn in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica, she first learned piano at the age of four and was fronting a locally popular band within a matter of several years. She\u2019s been a songwriter and multi-instrumentalist since the age of 14, and was on the road to achieving her dreams by 17, when she signed her first record deal. Since then, she has been involved in 6 Grammy nominated projects, and a path in the music world that includes collaborations with artists like the Black Eyed Peas, Sean Paul, Mark Ronson, Boney James, Vybz Kartel and Ce'Cile.\n\nWhile studying Ethnomusicology and Jazz at UCLA, Debi was invited by the legendary Brazilian artist Sergio Mendes to be the featured vocalist on his critically acclaimed album Timeless, and to accompany him on his tour through the U.S. and Japan. It wasn\u2019t until the fall of 2004 that she released her first single, the vibrant \u201cOne Rhythm,\u201d which was remixed by Ralphi Rosario and went to the top of the Billboard Dance Music/Club Play chart.\n\nShe then joined Ricky Martin on his 2004-2005 Life Tour in support of his album \u201cLife\u201d on which Debi was featured on 3 tracks; Drop It On Me (featuring Daddy Yankee as well), I Am and Qu\u00e9 M\u00e1s Da. All this activity fostered her growth not only as a performer but as a songwriter comfortable writing in both Spanish and English (sometimes within the same song).\n\nNova released her first album, \u201cLuna Nueva\u201d, produced by Gustavo Santaolalla and Marius Devries, in 2010. The album showcases Debi's eclectic talents -she plays piano, guitar, and bass, among other instruments- and captures her authentic Latin roots. Through an electrifying combination of Latin beats with forceful pop rhythms, Debi's album speaks vibrantly of the universal language and power of Music. Her first single from \u201cLuna Nueva\u201d, \u201cDrummer Boy\u201d, reached #5 on the Billboard dance charts. That same year, she participated in two of the most watched TV shows in North America, \u201cDancing With The Stars\u201d and \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance\u201d.\n\nDuring 2011-2012, Debi was on tour in Latin America and the United States opening for the popular Mexican group Camila, and was invited by Venezuelan singer Franco De Vita to participate in the recording of the song \u201cSi Quieres Decir Adi\u00f3s\u201d, which was included in Franco De Vita\u2019s album \u201cEn Primera Fila\u201d. She went on to accompany De Vita on his tour throughout Latin America, performing live over 60 times with the singer.\n\nAlso in 2011, MTV Latin America awarded her the prize MTV Chiuku: Agent of Change, for her work in the United Nations\u2019 campaign \u201cUNITE to end violence against women\u201d, and in April 2012, she was named ambassador of YUNGA (Youth and United Nations Global Alliance).\n\nRecently, Nova was the official voice of the Central American Olympics San Jos\u00e9 2013, with the song \u201cArriba Arriba\u201d and was also invited to participate in the conference TEDx Joven Pura Vida, sharing her story and her music to encourage young people to follow their dreams.\n\nDebi Nova\u2019s goal is to captivate the world with her new creations on and further consolidate herself as a Latin/crossover artist. Her second album, \u201cSOY\u201d, is entirely in Spanish and showcases 11 songs which demonstrate Nova\u2019s growth as an artist, pianist, and composer. Songs which transmit warm, positive and contagious emotions, and unleash with great enthusiasm the singularity of a captivating spirit.

Her emotionally disarming performances deceive in their simplicity, often times consisting of nothing more than her voice and a guitar, occasionally accompanied by violinist. Yet, they nevertheless arrest audiences through their quiet, brooding intensity, holding a vulnerability that\u2019s offset by a wintry, gallic allure..\n\nOn any given weekday, you can hear her voice echoing over the Hudson and East rivers. Equipped with only an acoustic guitar, a microphone and a tiny mixer, the French songstress delivers hushed and intimate performances for passengers aboard Spirit Cruises, set against the backdrop of an idyllic Manhattan skyline. Doucet\u2019s set list meanders seamlessly between Top 40 staples like Cindy Lauper and The Week'nd, while discreetly inserting the odd Gallic classic and, of course, a few numbers from her own blooming repertoire. Oddly enough, this sort of eclecticism works, as Doucet\u2019s own style has been informed by her superior command of the pop form.\n\n\nTiphanie Doucet got her start early on in the music and entertainment world. Harp and Ballet were part of her two passions since a very early age, and lead to a professional Dancing and Acting career. A starring role in the film Le b\u00e9b\u00e9 d\u2019Elsa, and later in the Glee-like TV series \"Chante\", gave her popularity in her native France, and the unlikely foundations for what would be a very eclectic musical trajectory. After leaving France, Doucet decided to gamble it all and start fresh in America. The 180 degree turn that her life took left her old life in shambles, bringing her plenty of heartbreak and homesickness that would prove to be a wellspring of musical inspiration. This moment of transition afforded Doucet plenty of material to write her own songs, which she began testing out on street corners, cruises and caf\u00e9s throughout New York and her newly adopted home in Jersey City, New Jersey. The overwhelmingly positive reception was such that she decided to release her own work. She released her first single \"Lucky guy\" with Grammy-nominated producer Jason Agel, whose work can be heard in productions by everyone from Kanye West to Bj\u00f6rk to Beyonce.\n\n\nA year later, she released her debut album \u201cUnder My Sun\u201d, a collection of rustic, yet polished folk numbers produced by David Baron and Simone Felice, who have worked with the likes of Lumineers and Jade Bird. Though Doucet\u2019s influences are prevalent throughout the album, nodding to the likes of Norah Jones, Ingrid Michaelson and Feist, the work is without a doubt a testament to the uniqueness and originality of her voice. The sound is amplified by Felice and Baron's production, which never feels intrusive, but serves as the perfect complement to the singer\u2019s overpowering voice, interjecting only at key moments of emotional revelation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiphanie n'est surement pas inconnue de vous. Elle a commence a 15 ans a la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, quand elle interpr\u00e9tait la fille de Corinne Touzet, dans un premier r\u00f4le plut\u00f4t salu\u00e9 par la critique. A l\u2019\u00e9poque elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 8 ans de conservatoire en musique et danse et continua jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ses 18 ans. A 20 ans elle d\u00e9bute une carri\u00e8re de danseuse professionnelle gr\u00e2ce a Redha qui l'engage comme apprenti sur Romeo et Juliette, apr\u00e8s elle enchaine les shows, plateaux t\u00e9l\u00e9s, tourn\u00e9es. Parmi ses meilleurs exp\u00e9riences, on a pu la voir sur les plateaux de la Star Academy, la tourn\u00e9e de Jenifer ou derri\u00e8re David Guetta, Jonnhy Halliday et m\u00eame Prince, travaillant avec tous les chor\u00e9graphes du moment comme Kamel Ouali, Redha, Mya Frye, Stephane Jarny ou Hakim Ghorab. Comme chanteuse on a pu la voir interpr\u00e9ter \u201cJeanie \u201c dans Hair et bien sur a la TV, meilleure amie de Priscilla dans la s\u00e9rie Chante. A l \u00e9poque elle commence a prendre la musique plus au s\u00e9rieux, rencontre Geoffrey, guitariste, avec qui elle commence a composer et voyager aux Etats Unis : Los Angeles, Nashville, New York. Lors d'un programme court au Musician Institute de Los Angeles, elle s'inscrit a une audition pour l\u2019\u00e9cole AMDA. De retour en France, on lui apprend qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'une bourse de talent ! La voila partie aux Etats Unis, et elle ne reviendra plus. Son dipl\u00f4me en poche elle entame les auditions et commence a travailler. Une com\u00e9die musicale, et m\u00eame un premier r\u00f4le dans une pi\u00e8ce de theatre Off Broadway. Mais la musique est toujours pr\u00e9sente. Elle commence a gratter la guitare, et compose seule son premier EP \u201cBetween us\u201d qu'elle revient enregistrer a Paris. Depuis, elle se consacre a sa musique, elle joue m\u00eame dans la rue, le m\u00e9tro, et a fait plus de 50 concerts a NY, dont la premi\u00e8re partie de Anna Nalick a Brooklyn, une auteur compositeur tr\u00e8s populaire aux Etats Unis, et a Paris aussi ou elle a eu la chance de faire la premi\u00e8re partie d'Arnaud Ducret au casino de Paris au Printemps 2016.\nEn 2017, elle rencontre et enregistre avec le producteur / r\u00e9alisateur Jason Agel, nomin\u00e9 notamment au Grammy Awards pour son enregistrement de la chanson \"All of Me\" par John Legend. Le single \"Lucky guy\" surprend par les m\u00e9lodies m\u00e9lancoliques et relaxantes de Tiphanie, les voix douces et ang\u00e9liques, et les arrangements explosifs de Jason Agel. Apres avoir envoye une demo de chanson en francais, elle attire ensuite l'attention du realisateur Simone Felice ( les Lumineers, Jade Bird... ) Elle debarque a Woodstock et s'enferme avec lui et David Baron dans leur studio au milieu des montagnes de Catskills, le coup de foudre artistique est immediat. L'album est sorti le 10 Aout, comprenant des chansons en Anglais et en Francais.\n\nIl attire la Presse Americaine qui la compare a Norah Jones. En novembre dernier Tiphanie s'est produit au Sunset Jazz Club. Un EP de reprises est prevu pour Mars 2019 avec aussi des versions en Francais des chansons de l'album.\n\n\n\n\nLa p\u00e9pite du jour c\u2019est Tiphanie Doucet et Under My Sun\nPar Charles Chinasky\n\nTiphanie Doucet a une histoire qui ferait un film. Jeune actrice avec Corinne Touzet (oui quand m\u00eame), bourse US, Danse sur le grand journal, com\u00e9die musicale pour finir par se faire rep\u00e9rer dans le m\u00e9tro de New York. Sa vie ressemble \u00e0 un condens\u00e9 de la s\u00e9rie Un, Dos, tr\u00e8s sauf qu\u2019il est par contre fort probable que vous vous souveniez d\u2019elle dans 10 ans. Car Tiphanie a une voix enchanteresse. Elle m\u00e9lange une guitare s\u00e8che folk avec un petit cot\u00e9 soul. C\u2019est une musique \u00e0 faire tomber les \u00e9toiles, en sirotant un petit whisky et en pensant \u00e0 la vie.T\n\n\nPRESS\n\nShaped by her experiences in France, Los Angeles, New York, and her recently adopted New Jersey home alike, Doucet\u2019s new work embraces a folksier, jazz-tinged gentleness. Its subtle warmth instantly feels like home, pervading the senses in a way not dissimilar to Norah Jones or Lucy Rose. Yet, in spite of any similarities you may draw between her and other great songwriters, Doucet\u2019s dreamy vocal quality is markedly distinct, especially in how she tenderly incorporates it into her music to tell stories unique to her own outlook and experiences.\n\nJonathan Frahm \u2022 10 July 2018- For Folk Sake\n\n\"Her vocal performance is compelling in its attention to detail\u2013the ends of lines and the wordless sighs that close the song contain a lot of emotion without going for the big move. If you\u2019re looking for a relaxing summer tune, this is what you\u2019re looking for. Highly recommended.\"\n\nStephen Carradini, for Independant Clauses\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d gotten to know Tiphanie and her sincerity to her work, is obvious to witness. Her dedication to her craft is unconditional. She\u2019s humble, energetic, honest, and she wants to share her music to greater and greater audiences. And in her humble way, she still is seeking Of herself, and About herself \u2013 and we think that contributes profoundly to music making. She wants to be \u2018happy\u2019. Happy with her work, happy with her songs making people happy, and happy with making music an even larger part of her life from a career point of view. She\u2019s come a long way. But she\u2019s a tough gal \u2013 resilient and proud of her accomplishment and the way she\u2019s come through the personal pains in her past. Her heart pushes her to do so. And in our eyes, that passion is something that we can\u2019t help but DIG about her. Kudos, Tiphanie. Kudos.\u201d\n\nJason Kim, Come here Floyd (Jun 29, 2018)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Andr\u00e9s Cepeda ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8847539.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Pop Latino", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Andr\u00e9s Cepeda es uno de los artistas colombianos m\u00e1s reconocidos de la escena musical latinoamericana.

The family moved back to Venezuela when De Vita was 13, and he later studied piano at the university level.\n\nIn 1982, De Vita formed the group Icaro, which released one self-titled album in his homeland. Two years later, he released his first disc as a solo artist, simply titled Franco De Vita. The album spun off three Spanish-language hits: \u201cSomos Tres,\u201d \u201cNo Hay Cielo\u201d and \u201cUn Buen Perdedor.\u201d His 1986 album Fantas\u00eda produced several more hits, including the title song and \u201cAqu\u00ed Est\u00e1s Otra Vez.\u201d \u201cS\u00f3lo Importas T\u00fa,\u201d taken from the album, was used as the theme song to the Spanish-language soap opera La Dama De Rosa. He appeared in the end credits of every episode, performing the song at the piano.\n\nSeeking wider international exposure, De Vita moved to the Sony label for the 1988 album Al Norte Del Sur. A critical and commercial smash, the album cemented his reputation as a purveyor of socially-conscious, adult-oriented pop, particularly through the tunes \u201cTe Amo\u201d and \u201cLouis.\u201d The latter song, about a daydreaming cabbie who idolizes The Beatles, was promoted with a music video considered quite advanced for its time. De Vita\u2019s 1990 album Extranjero featured the song \u201cNo Basta,\u201d which spent four weeks at No. 1 on the U.S. Latin charts and won an MTV Video Music Award.\n\nSubsequent albums have included the live release En Vivo Marzo 16 (1992); Voces A Mi Alrededor in 1993; the acoustic-flavored Fuera De Este Mundo (1996); and 1999\u2019s world-beat inspired Nada Es Igual. He left Sony for the 2002 album Segundas Partes Tambi\u00e9n Son Buenas, but returned to the label the following year.\n\nDe Vita has continued to enjoy success as one of Latin music\u2019s most consistently popular singer-songwriters, with a style often compared to Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel. His 2004 album Stop reached the Top 10 throughout Latin America and on the U.S. Latin charts, spurred by the hits \u201cT\u00fa De Qu\u00e9 Vas\u201d and \u201cSi La Ves,\u201d the latter a collaboration with pop group Sin Bandera. That same year, he toured arenas in the United States on a co-headlining tour with Ricardo Montaner, a fellow Venezuelan songwriter. De Vita is reportedly one of the largest selling musical artists ever to emerge from Venezuela. He also has recorded in Italian and Portuguese, albeit to less success. As a songwriter, he has written hits for Ricky Martin and Chayanne. In 2005, an expanded edition of Stop was released, titled Stop + Algo M\u00e1s, that included remixes and live recordings, as well as No S\u00e9 Lo Que Me Das, De Vita's first recording in English. The following year saw the release of Mil y Una Historias En Vivo, a two-disc live album that also featured four studio tracks, including collaborations with Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez and Diego El Cigala.

California native KP (formerly Kirsten Proffit) launched her solo career with 2006's Lucky Girl, a singer/songwriter record whose tracks found their way onto TV shows like Friday Night Lights and Dawson's Creek. By 2012, she was also touring the country with Jaime Wyatt and Manda Mosher as a member of CALICO, a trio of songwriters whose warm, nostalgic sound nodded to Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, and other icons of California's country-rock golden days. The group hit the ground running, playing 200 shows during their first year together. CALICO was a true collaboration, too \u2014 a group whose members shared songwriting and singing duties \u2014 but after two albums together (both of which were co-produced by Kirsten), the band called it quits. Life and the grind of the road had taken its toll. Besides, KP had become excited about collaborating with another musician: guitar slinger Johnny Hawthorn.\n\nAs a songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, lead guitarist, and record producer, Johnny had already performed with bands like Toad the Wet Sprocket and Everclear by the time he crossed paths with KP at the Cinema Bar in Culver City, CA. He'd also released three albums as a solo artist, with Guitar Player Magazine likening his phrasing to Jimi Hendrix and his vocal melodies to the Eagles. The connection between KP and Johnny was immediate, and the two spent their first date playing songs together. Before long, they were writing songs of their own \u2014 melodic music that made room for KP's voice, Johnny's guitar, and plenty of collaboratively-written hooks. The two became newlyweds, too, their sound mirroring the mutual respect and reverence found in their marriage.\n\n2019's Morning Sun is the HawtThorns' official debut, a collection of warm, West Coast-influenced songs that balance the most engaging parts of the bandmates' different backgrounds. It's an amped-up Americana album for guitar enthusiasts and singer/songwriter fans alike. Laced with touches of lap steel guitar, strings, organ, and thickly-stacked coed harmonies, Morning Sun also introduces the HawtThorns' full lineup \u2014 a roster that includes drummer Matt Lucich and bassist Eliot Lorango \u2014 while making room for additional contributions from Sasha Smith, Kaitlin Wolfberg, and Arthur Barrow. From the heartland rock & roll of \"All I Know\" to the soulful empowerment anthem \"Rebel Road\" to the lushly-harmonized highway ballad \"The 405,\" Morning Sun shows the full range of the HawtThorns' interests and abilities, with production from Eric Corne (founder of the band's label, Forty Below Records), Steve Berns, and KP Hawthorn. The album also includes a John Moreland cover, a revamped version of Johnny Hawthorn's \"Give Me a Sign,\" four songs co-written with Berns, and the chiming, high-spirited lead single \"Shaking.\"\n\nIn a genre that often trends toward moody sounds, Morning Sun is every bit as bright as its name indicates \u2014 an Americana album inspired by the sun-streaked California landscape in which it was written and recorded. It's a record about intersecting lives and finding that balance, with songs that rely equally on Johnny's guitar lines (which he approaches with the nuance of a songwriter) and KP's melodic sensibilities. KP and Johnny aren't newcomers \u2014 they've both weathered the ups and downs of the music industry for years, struggling to overcome musical (and personal) breakups along the way \u2014 but they've tapped into a new beginning with Morning Sun.

Songwriters Sima Cunnningham and Macie Stewart formed their unbreakable bond performing throughout the fringes of Chicago's many interlocking communities, collaborating with titans from the city's indie rock, hip-hop, and improvised worlds. But together, along with drummer Matt Carroll, they've stretched the boundaries of what guitar music can do starting with the band's experimental 2016 self-titled EP and their adventurous debut 2018 LP Parts. Now their longstanding partnership culminates with the stunning and muscular follow-up Fantasize Your Ghost.\n\nOhmme formed in 2014 as an outlet for Cunningham and Stewart to explore an unconventional approach to their instruments. \"That's the whole genesis of the band: us walking up to our guitars and saying, 'how can we make this noisemaker do something different?'\" says Cunningham. But as their musical collaboration strengthened, bringing Parts and intensive tours with acts like Wilco, Iron & Wine, Twin Peaks, and more, the band's scope and focus has also broadened. Fantasize Your Ghost is the direct result of the band spending more time on the road than in Chicago, a record deeply concerned with questions of the self, the future, and what home means when you're travelling all the time.\n\n\"Grinding on tour last year for so long, it can alter your mental state where you have to think about your life in a different way than you would if you're home. A lot of the songs stemmed from just thinking about all of the possibilities that life could be and could take,\" says Stewart. On the commanding single \"3 2 4 3,\" which tackles the terrifying realization of needing to make a change. The song opens with the two singing in transfixing harmony, \"Looked in the mirror the other day / Caught my reflection / My mouth had moved a different way / The muscles were straining.\" Their deft scene-setting and the way their disparate voices blend together heightens the song's inherent anxiety. Later, they sing, \"Filling the holes to make amends / Tearing them up to start again.\" These moments of emotional clarity fill Fantasize Your Ghost.\n\nWritten across 2019, early sketches of the album's tracklist were demoed at Sam Evian's Flying Cloud Studios in upstate New York. \"That's where we really started to see the record come together,\" says Cunningham. The sessions were intensely collaborative and open: the product of long, existential conversations between Stewart and Cunningham in the van about their lives and how to channel the anger they were feeling about the state of the world. Tracks like the driving opener \"Flood Your Gut\" underwent several revisions with Ohmme uncovering several new directions the song could go before finishing it. The refrain \"your whole vision's not enough\" is a call to action, says Cunningham. \"Do you want to be someone who can disconnect or someone who is hyper-engaged and present?\"\n\nFantasize Your Ghost was recorded over a six day session in August 2019 when the band decamped to the Post Farm in southern Wisconsin, where Cunningham runs a yearly DIY music festival. With indie rock journeyman producer Chris Cohen and the idyllic setting just outside Chicago, the songs came to vibrant life. Though Parts showcased their wildly burgeoning influences and talents, Fantasize Your Ghost captures the astounding magnetism and ferocity of their live show. \"Selling Candy\" is the perfect example. It's a small snapshot of childhood complete with nostalgic references to summertime hot dogs and wandering the city but set to an explosive, stadium-ready fuzzed-out arrangement. Elsewhere, songs like the dystopian dance rocker \"The Limit\" further stretch their already dynamic palette.\n\nFantasize Your Ghost encapsulates the thrilling and sometimes terrifying joy of moving forward even if you don't know where you're going. It's an album that asks necessary questions: When life demands a crossroads, what version of yourself are you going to pursue? What part of yourself will you feed and let flourish and what do you have to let go of? When they sing, \"Just walk out the door and / Don\u2019t tell them goodbye\" it's drastic but also exhilaratingly hopeful. This is a record of strength, of best friends believing in each other. Unapologetic and brave, Ohmme are ready to figure it all out together.", "otherInfo": "We are excited to support #ArtsForIllinois and the Arts for Illinois Relief Fund alongside Mayor Lightfoot, Governor Pritzker and First Ladies MK Pritzker and Amy Eshleman \u2013 providing financial assistance to artists, artisans and cultural organizations impacted by #COVID19.

After making her Grand Ole Opry debut at the age of 10, the Tennessee-bred virtuoso mandolinist played Carnegie Hall at age 12, then landed a deal with Rounder Records just a year later. Now 28-years-old, Hull is set to deliver her fourth full-length for Rounder: an elegantly inventive and endlessly captivating album called 25 Trips.\n\nRevealing her profound warmth as a storyteller, 25 Trips finds Hull shedding light on the beauty and chaos and sometimes sorrow of growing up and getting older. To that end, the album\u2019s title nods to a particularly momentous year of her life, including her marriage to fellow bluegrass musician Justin Moses and the release of her widely acclaimed album Weighted Mind\u2014a B\u00e9la Fleck-produced effort nominated for Best Folk Album at the 2017 Grammy Awards.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of push-and-pull on this record, where in some moments I feel like everything\u2019s happening so fast and I wish I could slow it all down so I can really enjoy it,\u201d Hull points out. \u201cBut then there are also times where I\u2019m looking forward to the day when the craziness has died down a bit, and life\u2019s a little calmer.\u201d\n\nMade with producer/engineer Shani Gandhi (Kelsea Ballerini, Dierks Bentley, Sarah Jarosz, Alison Krauss), 25 Trips continues the musical journey begun on Weighted Mind, a body of work that built off Hull\u2019s bluegrass roots and ventured into entirely new terrain. But while its predecessor assumed a sparse and stripped-back palette, 25 Trips embodies a far more intricately arranged sound\u2014an effect achieved with the help of peers like guitarist Mike Seal, bassist Ethan Jodziewicz, violinist Alex Hargreaves, and fiddler Christian Sedelmyer, as well as several musicians that Hull has long admired (including bassist Viktor Krauss, guitarist Bryan Sutton, and multi-instrumentalist Stuart Duncan). Along with integrating electric instrumentation and percussion into her material for the first time, Hull dreamed up the album\u2019s eclectic textures by embracing a free-flowing process that often gave way to lightning-in-a-bottle improvisation.\n\n\u201cThere were some songs that we created from the ground up, where I\u2019d go in and play by myself, and from there we\u2019d bring in other musicians to add more and more layers,\u201d Hull says. \u201cIt was really wonderful to work that way, where we started from a place of mystery and then just let the song show us what it wanted or needed to become.\u201d\n\nImmediately proving the power of that approach, 25 Trips lures the listener into its unpredictable sonic world on the beguiling opening track \u201cBeautifully Out of Place.\u201d With its shifting tempos and gently tempestuous mood, the song was sparked from words of encouragement spoken by Hull\u2019s husband at a time of self-doubt and confusion. \u201cI remember Justin saying to me, \u2018I believe in you, so you\u2019re just going to have to learn to believe in yourself,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThat inspired the first line for me, and the song just wrote itself from there.\u201d\n\nAlthough much of the album bears a rich complexity, 25 Trips also includes moments of stark simplicity that perfectly showcase Hull\u2019s stunning vocal range. On \u201cEverybody\u2019s Talking,\u201d for instance, her luminous vocals quietly capture the frustration of finding clarity in the midst of constant chatter from the outside world. And on \u201cCeiling to the Floor\u201d\u2014co-written with Kai Welch, a songwriter/musician known for his work with Glen Campbell and Abigail Washburn\u2014Hull spins a tender metaphor from her longtime fear of heights. \u201cI was telling Kai about how when I was little my dad used to try to get me over that fear by holding me up to the ceiling and saying, \u2018Just touch it\u2014I\u2019m not gonna let you fall,\u2019\u201d she explains. Featuring a performance from legendary steel-guitar player Paul Franklin, \u201cCeiling to the Floor\u201d drifts from memory to real-time reflection, slowly unfolding as a nuanced meditation on courage and love.\n\nOne of the most unexpected turns on 25 Trips, \u201cEscape\u201d emerges as a delicate collage of hypnotic percussion, otherworldly electric-mandolin tones, and poetic yet plainspoken lyrics (e.g., \u201cI want to escape to a world that\u2019s not closing in\u201d). \u201cI didn\u2019t even have that song on my list for the album, but I played Shani a voice memo and right away she said, \u2018I wanna record that,\u2019\u201d remembers Hull, who penned \u201cEscape\u201d with singer/songwriter Angel Snow. \u201cI was a little hesitant since it\u2019s so unlike anything else I\u2019ve done, but in the end it was really exciting to play electric and come up with something in a completely different vein.\u201d\n\nIn closing out 25 Trips, Hull shares an especially poignant track titled \u201cFather Time.\u201d \u201cI wrote that song with Mindy Smith after spending a week with my husband and his grandma, after his grandpa had a stroke on Christmas morning,\u201d she says. \u201cHis grandma had suffered with Alzheimer\u2019s for years and couldn\u2019t really stay by herself, and through that experience I decided to write about watching my husband take such good care of her, and how that made me love him even more.\u201d With its heavy-hearted melody and choir-like harmonies, \u201cFather Time\u201d shows Hull\u2019s effortless finesse in embedding her music with so many subtle details (including an instrumental reference to \u201cJingle Bells\u201d tucked into the second verse). \u201cWe had our instruments with us at Christmas, so at some point we played \u2018Jingle Bells\u2019 for my husband\u2019s grandma,\u201d says Hull. \u201cShe can\u2019t remember my name or Justin\u2019s name now, but for some reason \u2018Jingle Bells\u2019 stuck, and she still asks for it year-round\u2014it\u2019s the most amazing thing.\u201d\n\nEven as its songs continually shift in genre, encompassing everything from bluegrass to folk-pop to ethereal alt-rock, 25 Trips remains rooted in the sophisticated musicianship that Hull has cultivated almost her entire life. Hailing from the tiny Tennessee hamlet of Byrdstown, she learned to sing from her mother as toddler, took up mandolin just a few years later, and began joining in local bluegrass jams by the young age of eight. With her childhood triumphs including joining her hero and mentor Alison Krauss onstage at the Grand Ole Opry at age 11, she made her Rounder debut with the 2008 album Secrets and promptly garnered the first of many nominations for Mandolin Player of the Year at the International Bluegrass Music Association Awards. In 2016, after a near-decade of consecutive nominations, Hull became the first-ever woman to win the award\u2014then claimed that prize again at the 2017 and 2018 IBMAs. Over the years, Hull has also maintained a rigorous touring schedule, and has made occasional guest appearances with such icons as the Indigo Girls, Garth Brooks, and Gillian Welch.\n\nMarking a bold new era in Hull\u2019s artistic evolution, 25 Trips wholly channels the pure and palpable joy she discovered in the album\u2019s creation\u2014and ultimately illuminates certain truths about the indelible connection between risk-taking and reward. \u201cOne of the things I most enjoyed about making this record was getting to show the wide variety of music I love,\u201d says Hull. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what category the album falls in, but I also think that matters less and less. What really matters to me is trusting myself to be who I am, and just putting my voice and my heart out there in the most sincere way that I possibly can.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kris Orlowski ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9215469.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie, Folk, Folk-pop, Rock", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Seattle-based singer/songwriter Kris Orlowski, continues to explore the themes of authenticity, loss, and a search for connection that has always been central to his songwriting.

Reaching success in a period coinciding with the youth movement started by the Beatles that was taking over the world, Carlos was the leader of Jovem Guarda. He led the TV show that became a generic denomination of a musical style and what was a definitive change of face to the Brazilian phonographic market and of the very art of marketing itself (with the advent of an aggressive merchandising of the JG's top figures, including films, clothes, etc.), encompassing deep behavioral/gestual/language influences widespread through his entire generation. His light music, derived from British pop, and his (and his partner's Erasmo Carlos') lyrics (happy, humorous, and full of fashionable youth slang and na\u00efve though unexpectedly sexual) were deeply contrasting to the serious mpb, with its somber images and protest songs. After all, Brazil was living in a dark period of the military dictatorship, or the \"years of lead\" as they became known.\n\nA few years later, in the late '60s, Carlos (counseled by his advisers) changed his style to become the most successful romantic artist in Brazil. Having written (always with Erasmo Carlos) some of the most beautiful songs in this style (such as \"Detalhes,\" \"Sua Estupidez,\" \"Jesus Cristo,\" \"Debaixo dos Carac\u00f3is dos Seus Cabelos,\" etc.), Carlos accumulated virtually all possible accomplishments as a highly successful artist, including a solid international career with awards like the Grammy and top positions on Billboard's Latin charts. Though the adherence to a worn-out sentimental formula proved to be affective in commercial terms (more than 70 million albums sold in his career), it ultimately led him to be known, in the '80s and '90s, as a cheesy artist by youngsters and part of the adult listeners. Nevertheless, the mid-'90s witnessed a resurgence of Jovem Guarda talents through tributes of new rockers and Carlos reached the 21st century uncontestedly enjoying his absolute title: the King.\n\nRoberto Carlos was from a lower-middle-class family. At six, he lost one of his legs and began using a prosthesis. At nine, he debuted on his home city's local radio. In 1955, he moved to Niter\u00f3i (Rio de Janeiro) and then to Lins de Vasconcelos (a suburb of Rio de Janeiro), where he started to get into rock through Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard, at the same time he met Carlos Imperial, also from his hometown, who, as a TV and radio producer, would be of considerable importance to Carlos's early professional years. Two years later, Carlos performed at TV Tupi, singing \"Tutti Frutti\" (R. Penniman/J. Lubin/D. La Bostrie). In that period, he was scheduled to open a Bill Haley show at the Maracanazinho (Rio), when he became acquainted with Erasmo Carlos (then Erasmo Esteves). In 1958, Carlos met the \"Matoso gang,\" as were known the future artists Tim Maia, Jorge Ben, and the same Erasmo Esteves, among others, who would meet at Matoso Street at Tijuca (a neighborhood of Rio). Carlos, Erasmo, and Tim Maia (together with Edson Trindade, Arl\u00eanio L\u00edvio, and Jos\u00e9 Roberto \"China\") formed the group the Snacks (later the Sputniks), playing balls and performing on TV (including at Carlos Imperial's Clube do Rock on TV Continental, where Carlos was already a regular). The group was soon dissolved due to the incompatibility between Carlos and Maia.\n\nAfter working as an extra in several films such as Ag\u00fcenta o Roj\u00e3o and Minha Sogra \u00e9 da Pol\u00edcia (in which they backed up Cauby Peixoto on one song), Carlos and Erasmo played together in Erasmo's quartet the Snakes until Carlos was called by Imperial to take Carlos Lyra's place in the Os Terr\u00edveis band that played Elvis Presley covers on TV shows and live performances contracted by Imperial.\n\nSoon, Carlos left the band to try to become a bossa nova artist. Strongly influenced by Jo\u00e3o Gilberto in that period, Carlos often tried to \"sit-in\" at the famous temples Plaza nightclub and the clubs of the Beco das Garrafas, but to no avail. A testimony of his ephemeral and unaccomplished bossa nova phase is Carlos' first album, with \"Jo\u00e3o e Maria\" and \"Fora do Tom\" (both by Imperial). In August 1960, a new release was launched, again in the bossa vein, \"Brotinho Sem Ju\u00edzo\" and \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o do Amor Nenhum\" (again, both by Imperial). At the same time, Carlos would participate regularly in shows presented by Imperial, Os Brotos Comandam (TV Continental and R\u00e1dio Guanabara) and Festa de Brotos (TV Tupi). In 1961, in the same year in which Carlos recorded his first LP (a derivation toward boleros and ballads, Louco por Voc\u00ea) that earned some acceptance at the time (3,500 copies sold in one year), he accepted the suggestion of the record company CBS and changed his style to youth music, starting to write songs with the composer/lyricist who would become his most important collaborator: Erasmo Carlos. The duo's first hit was Carlos' rendition for an Erasmo version of \"Splish Splash\" (Bobby Darin), having as the B-side another classic written by them, \"Parei na Contram\u00e3o.\" The album was recorded and launched in 1963 as Carlos' fifth 78 rpm, accompanied by Renato e seus Blue Caps. It sold 7,500 copies, a modest amount today, but it represented a considerable selling then and the milestone of a new time.\n\nIn 1964, the LP \u00c9 Proibido Fumar (backed by the Youngsters) had hits with the title track (by Carlos/Erasmo) and with Erasmo's version of \"Road Hog\" (Gwen/John D. Loudermilk), \"O Calhambeque.\" It sold almost 12,000 copies in 18 months and was considered high-selling then, but still behind the leader Carlos Alberto (a bolero singer), who was selling more than twice as much. Nevertheless, Carlos' nationwide success was ascending, with more and more invitations for TV and radio shows and CBS wanting to take him to Argentina. That year, Carlos recorded the same repertory in Spanish, also backed by the Youngsters, and the album Es Prohibido Fumar was released by the end of 1964 in Argentina. It was planned to also be distributed in Brazil, but as the military government considered anything in Spanish (the language of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara) dangerous to the country, the album was simply taken out of the catalog by the recording company.\n\nIn 1965, Carlos was elected the King for the first time by direct vote of the audience in a contest promoted by Ant\u00f4nio Aguillar on his Reino da Juventude show. Later, the title would be confirmed at the highly popular Chacrinha show and it would be his for life.\n\nIn the same year, Roberto Carlos Canta Para a Juventude broke all records established by the singer until then, by far surpassing Carlos Alberto and his Amor Perdido. Carlos' album reached fifth place according to IBOPE (a most-accredited public opinion research institute), however, it quickly fell several positions. In fact, he would only have an album at number one of the top parade by the end of the year, with his next LP. Until then, his rising success would sell over 20,000 copies of the double single with \"Hist\u00f3ria de um Homem Mau\" (reaching fourth place on the charts) and 50,000 copies of his single \"N\u00e3o Quero Ver Voc\u00ea Triste.\"\n\nOn September 5, Roberto Carlos opened the legendary show Jovem Guarda as the main host and also featuring Vanderl\u00e9a and Erasmo Carlos by his side. The show gave the name and directives to the first musical scene produced especially for Brazilian youth, representing a major cultural/behavioral/commercial breakthrough. After the show debut, Carlos' popularity reached levels unimagined until then. Scoring hits in Argentina and Brazil, Carlos became the best-seller for CBS. A double single with \"A Garota do Baile,\" Carlos reached number two in November, behind the Beatles' \"Help!\" But his album Jovem Guarda, also launched in November, took only one week to push \"Help!\" out of number one on the Brazilian charts, selling almost 200,000 copies in one year. \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo Pro Inferno\" became a nationwide hit and with the exception of brief periods of time, it reigned absolute at number one on the top parade during the entire first semester of 1966. After performing in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay \u2014 countries in which the Spanish version of \"O Calhambeque\" continued to have success \u2014 Carlos went to Europe in April 1966, singing in Portugal (where \"Calhambeque\" and \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo Pro Inferno\" were in first place on Lisbon charts). Returning to Brazil, he soon departed for a tour that started in South America, then Central and North America, where he sang in Los Angeles, Miami, and New York, then Europe (London, Paris, Berlin, and Lisbon). Roberto Carlos, released in December 1966 and went right to number one in the second week (remaining there until April 1967), sold 300,000 copies in less than a year. Also in 1967, Carlos starred the feature film Roberto Carlos em Ritmo de Aventura (whose soundtrack sold 300,000 copies, staying at number one from December 17 until June 1968; the film also broke all box-office records until then); won fifth place at the III FMPB (Festival of Brazilian Popular Music of the TV Record, S\u00e3o Paulo) with \"Maria, Carnaval e Cinzas,\" by Lu\u00eds Carlos Paran\u00e1 (reaching number one as a single in November); participated in the MIDEM Festival in Cannes, France; and won the Chico Viola trophy for the songs \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo pro Inferno\" and \"Esque\u00e7a\" and for the LP Jovem Guarda. In June of the same year, Carlos departed for a series of shows in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the U.S. In Italy, he participated in the Venice Song Festival.\n\nIn 1968, Carlos left Jovem Guarda, which due to his absence would soon cease to exist. His departure was a result of a mature decision to migrate from a youth idol profile to that of a romantic singer. In the same year, Carlos won the San Remo Festival (XVIII Festival della Canzone Italiana) with \"Canzone Per Te\" (Sergio Endrigo) and starred the film O Diamante Cor-de-Rosa (also a box office success), opening his own show Roberto Carlos \u00e0 Noite (TV Record) on March 15. As a romantic singer, Carlos had several hits in the 1970s that still had his creative impetus, such as \"Sua Estupidez,\" \"As Flores do Jardim de Nossa Casa,\" \"Jesus Cristo,\" \"Amada Amante,\" \"Detalhes,\" \"Debaixo dos Carac\u00f3is dos Seus Cabelos,\" \"A Montanha,\" \"A Proposta,\" \"Al\u00e9m do Horizonte,\" \"Olha,\" \"Amante \u00e0 Moda Antiga,\" and \"A Ilha\" (all with Erasmo), along with \"Como Vai Voc\u00ea?\" (Ant\u00f4nio Marcos/M\u00e1rio Marcos), and two songs written by Caetano Veloso especially for him, \"Como Dois e Dois\" and \"Muito Rom\u00e2ntico.\" In that decade, Carlos also consolidated his international career doing regular shows in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America. In the year of 1970, he did his first show at the prestigious Canec\u00e3o, which would be the first of his highly successful annual seasons at the most important Carioca hall in terms of media resonance. In the early '70s, Carlos became the top record-selling Brazilian artist, a position he would keep for many consecutive years. After 1976, his albums were selling over 1,000,000 copies. His 1977 album Roberto Carlos, with \"Falando S\u00e9rio,\" sold 2.2 million copies. His 1978 show also beat all records, with 250,000 spectators in six months throughout Brazil, while the album with \"Caf\u00e9 da Manh\u00e3,\" \"For\u00e7a Estranha,\" and \"Lady Laura\" sold 1.5 million copies.\n\nIn the '80s, Carlos also started to record in English and French (he had already recorded albums in Spanish, Italian, and, naturally, Portuguese), having won the Globo de Cristal trophy, awarded by CBS to Brazilian artists who sell more than five million copies outside Brazil. At the same time, his albums continued to break records in his country. \"Caminhoneiro\" (1984) was aired 3,000 times in a single day, another record soon beaten by his own \"Verde e Amarelo\" (1985), with 3,500 spins. In 1986, he had success at Radio City Music Hall (New York, NY) and, two years later, won the Grammy as the Best Latin American Pop singer. In 1989, his Sonrie reached first place on Billboard's Latin chart.\n\nIn the 1990s, Roberto Carlos became the first Latin American artist to sell more albums than the Beatles (in 1994, having by then sold over 70 million copies of his albums). In the mid-'90s, with the retro Jovem Guarda wave, Carlos, who was worn out among the younger generations who had only known his romantic and sentimental hits directed at a middle-aged audience, had his importance recuperated by young rockers such as C\u00e1ssia Eller, Chico Science & Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi, Bar\u00e3o Vermelho, and Skank, who recorded Rei, a tribute to him with his old Jovem Guarda hits.\n\nIn 1998, his second wife Maria Rita discovered she had cancer (she would die in 1999), which shattered his peace of mind. Trying to keep on with his career, Carlos continued to record and perform after one year of reclusion. In 2001, he broke his contract with Sony (ex-CBS), the recording company through which he had released a vast majority of his albums, due to commercial reasons related to his wife's demise.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "George Gadd ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ben Wylen ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10355324.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Pop, Alternative", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ben Wylen's debut solo album \u2018People Say\u2019 is a gorgeous, confessional 12-track record defiant in the face of what the whispers say, and rules others think people have to live by.

Inspired by such visceral singers as Janis Joplin and Tina Turner, she left school at sixteen to follow her own dreams. Dilana soon found herself with a promising music career in Holland, becoming one of the country's most coveted live acts. Recording and releasing the album Wonderfool in 2000 yielded five singles, four videos and a string of touring and festival gigs throughout the region, celebrating her natural talents as a songwriter and performer.\n\nBy way of Houston, Dilana arrived in L.A. and auditioned to compete on TV's \"Rock Star Supernova.\" Quoted in the Hollywood Press, \"The moment she stepped on the Mayan Theatre stage for Episode 1 and performed 'Lithium,' Dilana instantly became the show's frontrunner.\" Her powerful vocals and commanding stage presence amassed legions of new fans from around the world. That acclaim inspired Dilana to further pursue her musical passions with characteristic tenacity.\n\nDilana has performed with rock's biggest legends including Tommy Lee and Mick Mars (M\u00f6tley Crue), Dave Navarro (Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). In 2007, she won over the masses with opening slot performances for Aerosmith and Beth Hart. She launched two solo tours spanning North America and Western Europe that both consistently sold out and earned stellar reviews in the press and in 2009, Dilana ended a third successful year performing by touring her native South Africa.\n\n\nFollowing the release of seven singles, Dilana spent much of 2008 in the studio. In November 2009, she unleashed the album Inside Out, featuring 12 original tracks and her first full-length album in nine years. As new opportunities presented themselves, Dilana jumped at the chance to venture into film acting. The singer/songwriter won the BEST ACTRESS award at the Action On Film International Film Festival as well as winning both the BEST ACTRESS award and the BEST MUSIC award at the American International Film Festival for the 9 songs she wrote and performed in the rock drama: Angel Camouflaged.\n\nDuring her extensive world touring, Dilana performed in Afghanistan for the troops in 2009 and 2010. She was a part of the Go Army Concert Series tour in August 2011, sharing the stage with Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Doobie Brothers as well as touring Holland, South Africa, and across the USA.\n\n2012/2013 brought fans news that Dilana would be welcoming two new creations to the world. One, the studio release of her studio album titled Beautiful Monster, in which she went on tour where she opened for Puddle of Mudd and also for Saliva, and the other, Dilana's best creation EVER - a beautiful daughter named River. Both officially released in 2013.\n\nIn 2016 her fifth album was released, called Dilana / Angel Camouflaged, the soundtrack of the movie with the same name.\nIn the same year her first live (acoustic) DVD was also released.\nIn 2016 Dilana was invited to be part of The Voice of Holland...", "otherInfo": "Round 8 of the Live Streaming Is Here!

Taking her cue from divas of the past and present such as Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Donna Summer, Diana Ross and Sarah Vaughn, this Brooklyn, New York based singer/songwriter and pianist is destined for greatness.\n\nAlison Crockett decided early on, that a career in music was to be the path she would travel. Piano was her first love. \"It just called to me. I still feel like a pianist who sings.\" However after winning several local vocal talent showcases during her high school years, it became quickly apparent that her voice was a rare gift. Alison honed her vocal skills at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA and then a masters degree at the prestigious Manhattan School of Music. As she says, \"I set out to be a craftsman; someone who could mold and shape music like a sculpture.\" Throughout her school years, Alison continued to build her reputation and gain a loyal following by performing regularly with notable local and national artists in and around her Washington, DC home as well as in Philadelphia and New York.\n\nWhile living and performing in Philly, she met up with dj/producer King Britt (formerly of Digable Planets) and recorded the now classic, Season's Change for the groundbreaking Sylk 130 recording, When the Funk Hits the Fan (Ovum/Sony Music). She was also featured on four other genre bending tracks on the album including the first single, Gettin' Into It. Billboard loved her \"throaty, diva-styled vocals.\"\n\nAfter touring with Sylk 130, Alison relocated to Brooklyn, NY, where she currently resides. Almost immediately upon her arrival she began working with hip hop/jazz pioneer Greg Osby at the Knitting Factory for the 1996 What Is Jazz Festival, and at the Clef Club for 1997's Mellon Jazz Festival. In 1998, she was invited to participate in the prestigious Thelonius Monk Institute Jazz Colony in Aspen, CO, where she appeared on the same stage with jazz luminaries Nnenna Freelon and Herbie Hancock.\n\nAfter hearing her work, Geoff Wilkenson , co-founder of the UK based acid jazz outfit Us3 (noted for their 1994 world-wide smash \"Flip Fantasia (Biddy Biddy Bop)\" ) became convinced he was hearing a young legend on the order of his heroes Shirley Bassey, Dianna Washington or Dianne Reeves. He embarked upon a feverish search to track her down and request that Alison became Us3's first lead singer. Upon her acceptance, Alison traveled to London to write and sing on the album An Ordinary Day in an Unusual Place. \"I learned a lot about writing on that record,\" she says. \" Geoff had ideas for songs that required me to come from certain thematic places that were not as natural for me. I really enjoyed the challenge and I'm proud of what I did.\" The first single, Get Out, immediately shot to the top 10 within a few weeks of its release in Japan. In support of the single and the album, Alison toured extensively in Japan and Europe with the group.\n\nThroughout her time on the road with Us3, and back in New York, Alison continued to write, perform and work on a number of interesting musical projects -- always trying to grow, while bringing her unique sound and soulfulness to each new musical venture; often under the pseudonym Diva Blue. Almost overwhelmed with creative energy and song ideas, Alison could hardly wait to begin working on a project that would showcase the new music she was writing.\n\nNow it's time for the world to experience Alison's singular vision as a solo soul artist. She's currently putting the final touches on her first solo recording, On Becoming a Woman. She describes the songs as a cross between Jill Scott, Meshell N'degeocello and UK broken beat visionaries 4-Hero, but make no mistake, it's pure Alison Crockett!. Alison solely composed all of the music and lyrics on the album. Her brother and business partner, multi-instrumentalist teddycrockett, handled production. She is also collaborating with dj/producer Landslide (hospital records UK) and with the up and coming Brooklyn based drum'n bass producers, Mathmatics adding soul to the UK breakbeat and drum'n bass scenes.

The album, Miranda\u2019s fourth full-length solo release, is more than just an artistic step forward, it\u2019s a whole new way for her to make music. \u201cThis really is the most collaborative record I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s first time I\u2019ve shared so much of the writing and the production, the meat and bones of making an album.\u201d\n\nWith support from a stellar circle of players \u2013 including My Brightest Diamond\u2019s Shara Nova, TV On The Radio\u2019s Kyp Malone, Grandaddy/Modest Mouse\u2019s Jim Fairchild and Built To Spill\u2019s Matthew Morgan amongst others \u2013 it\u2019s Miranda\u2019s astonishing singing vocal that is set free, elevating this collection of songs as no one else could. An instrument which can shift from a barely-there whisper to a soaring wail that cracks open the sky, Holly\u2019s voice is startling from the moment it emerges on Mutual Horse.\n\nThis record finds Holly bridging the gap between 2010\u2019s experimental synth laden release The Magician\u2019s Private Library and 2015\u2019s stripped-back, soulful self-titled record. Miranda takes an honest and intimate approach, while maintaining her sense of humor amidst sonic explorations. The tracks run the gamut from the sultry, driving \u201cOn the Radio,\u201d to a cover of Crazy Horse\u2019s \u201cWhen Your Lonely Heart Breaks,\u201d and the delicate \u201cSing Like,\u201d inspired by Miranda\u2019s mother; an intimate clip of her singing while pregnant with Holly follows the song.\n\nThe album was recorded in Los Angeles, where Miranda laid down the beginnings of 23 songs before returning to her home base of New York City to finish the songs that would end up on the album. The Dangerbird studio also inspired the album\u2019s title. \u201cMutual Horse comes from this image we hung in the studio. It was a photo of the singer-songwriter Cris Williamson\u2014we did a cover of her song \u2018Midnight Oil\u2019\u2014and I had become a big fan,\u201d Miranda explains. \u201cWe printed out photos of her from the 1970s and taped them up around the studio; that was our vibe.\u201d One of those photos was of Williamson and another woman holding the reins of a horse; the two women are staring at each other, but the horse is staring at the camera. That picture was on the wall of Miranda\u2019s studio, and eventually someone scrawled the phrase \u201cMutual Horse\u201d beneath it.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like just mine,\u201d Miranda says of the album, which took its name from the graffiti. \u201cIt feels like it belongs to everybody who worked on it. I opened myself to collaborating this time around, which made me really vulnerable.\u201d Her collaborators on Mutual Horse include Shara Nova (My Brightest Diamond), Josh Werner (Dr. John, Lee Scratch Perry), Jared Samuel (Yoko Ono), Jim Kirby Fairchild (Grandaddy, Modest Mouse), Kyp Malone (TV On the Radio), Maria Eisen (Underground System), and Matthew Morgan (Built to Spill, Modest Mouse) among others.\n\nMiranda grew up between Detroit and Nashville, two music towns that would influence her own journey in a very profound way. She began playing piano at the age of six, taught her self-guitar at 14 and moved to New York at 16 to start her professional career. For nearly 20 years, she\u2019s been performing, writing and producing with some of the best talent in the business. She has performed with the likes of Karen O, Lou Reed, The XX, and Lesley Gore.

In May 2000 she returned to Austin to explore performing and song writing. Following her role as supporting vocalist and dancer for the Austin high-energy rock band Young Heart Attack in 2001, Martin launched her solo career in 2002 with an opening slot for Wilco and her debut album Pretty Things. Shortly after the album\u2019s release, she moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia and had her first commercial success when two of her songs were placed in the award-winning British-Canadian two-part drama Sex Traffic (2004) and in the TV drama series Snakes and Ladders (2004).\n\nWith her second album, Two Hearts (2008), Martin gained considerable attention as a hot up-and-coming artist with several East Coast Music Awards and Nominations. Her Two Hearts music video rose to #5 on the Much More Music Countdown, leading to tours across Canada, the US and Ireland. She performed high-profile shows with Canadian rock icon Matt Mays and sang on Parliament Hill in Ottawa for The Queen of England. You Come Home was placed in the internationally distributed teen drama series The Best Years (2010).

She worked with PledgeMusic.com to release A House Concert (2011) containing fourteen live acoustic versions of songs from her first three studio albums. Martin was nominated at the 2011 Music Nova Scotia Awards for Digital Artist of the Year and A House Concert was nominated at the 2012 East Coast Music Awards for Folk Recording of the Year.

Like a good book that\u2019s hard to put down, Sleeping With A Stranger tickles the ears and within three bars you\u2019re completely hooked.\u201d (Americana UK, October 2012). The album won her the 2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Recording of the Year Award. It was nominated for three East Coast Music Awards Come Undone Records was nominated for Music Nova Scotia Company of the Year. What I Always Knew was placed in the CBC television drama Heartland and her single Falling For You remained on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 countdown for five months.\n\nMartin returned home from Europe in the spring of 2014, following eighty concert dates which included a performance at Rolling Stone Weekender Festival, a publicity partnership with PopUp Records in Hamburg, and an endorsement from the esteemed Duesenberg Custom Guitar Shop in Hannover, Germany. She secured relationships for her future from her home base as Artist in Residence in the city of Dachau, Germany.\n\nIt\u2019ll Be Alright (2015) found Christina attaining what her music has always suggested, a place where the ghosts of her musical heroes freely mingle with the architecture of modern music. Working closely with her long-time producer and guitarist Dale Murray, drummer Brian Murray and bassist Jason Vautour, Martin made a conscious effort to confound the expectations of those who have categorized her in the past. This record utilizes far more sonic textures, allowing Martin to explore the many sides of her musical personality. The album won a 2016 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year and her It\u2019ll Be Alright single rose to #6 on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 chart. You Ran From Me was voted the #14 most played Canadian song on Sonica for 2015, and Somewhere With You was placed in the CBC Television show Heartland.\n\nFollowing two years of touring across Germany, Poland, The Netherlands, The UK, Switzerland, Austria, France and Canada, Martin returned home briefly in 2016 to write her newest album. A fervent anthem for those who are lost and longing, Lungs Are Burning was the first single from her album Impossible To Hold (Released March 23, 2018). The first single was triggered by the rising Fentanyl drug crisis killing thousands of Canadians, with Christina\u2019s lyrics set to music by her and Dale Murray. With lyrics like \u201cwhile I\u2019m watching the babies\u201d and \u201cgot to go out and get some, baby\u201d, Martin captures the desperation of \u201cchasing the dream\u201d and the horror of living it. Murray\u2019s stately production brings that stark reality home with a bite. Martin: \u201cThe song is an modest attempt to bring light to the heavy topic of addiction, and reflects my own personal sense of loss, longing and a deep void, and the ache I feel from losing my brother and friends to addiction and mental illness.\u201d For her Canadian tour dates, Christina has partnered with Center for Addiction and Mental Health to increase engagement and awareness.\n\n\u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is Martin\u2019s sixth and strongest studio album, achieving a perfect balance between organic ambience and impeccable production. \u201cI\u2019m writing about faith and love more than ever with songs like \u2018Keep Me Calm\u2019 and \u2018Always Reminding\u2019, but I haven\u2019t shaken the need to write about the darker things that are part of our human journey\u201d. Combining good taste, passionate singing and thoughtful lyrics, \u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is where music and poetry meet. The album won the 2018 Music Nova Scotia Award for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\n\nAWARDS\n\n2018 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Impossible To Hold)\n2016 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (It\u2019ll Be Alright)\n2014 Music Nova Scotia Inspirational Recording of the Year (Remember Me \u2013 EP)\n2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Sleeping With A Stranger)\n2009 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n\nARTIST IN RESIDENCIES COMPLETED\n\n2013-2015 Dachau, Germany\n\n2010-2011 Halifax NS, Canada \u2013 Dalhousie Geriatric Medical Research & Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN)\n\nFESTIVALS/CONFERENCES\n\n2019 Ottawa Blues Fest - Ottawa ON, Canada\n2019 Area506 - Saint John NB, Canada\n2018 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto, Canada\n2017 Sonder Fest \u2013 Manchester, United Kingdom\n2016 Reeperbahn Festival \u2013 Hamburg, Germany\n2016 Rising Tide Festival @ Fundy National Park- Alma NB, Canada\n2016 Harmony Bazaar Festival \u2013 Lockeport NS, Canada\n2016 Maverick Festival \u2013 Suffolk, United Kingdom\n2013 Rolling Stone Weekender Festival \u2013 Weissenh\u00e4user Strand, Germany\n2011 Winter Olympics @ Atlantic Canada House \u2013 Vancouver BC, Canada\n2011 Canada Games \u2013 Halifax NS, Canada\n2011 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2010 Belfast Nashville Songwriters Festival \u2013 Belfast, Ireland\n2009 Folk Alliance \u2013 Memphis TN, USA\n2009 North By North East \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2009 Stan Rogers Festival \u2013 Canso NS, Canada\n2002 SXSW - Austin TX, USA", "otherInfo": "It's Mother's Day!

But before moving to the DC area, Jorma and family lived in the Philippines and other locales as he followed his father's career from assignment to assignment before returning to the place of his birth. As a teenager in Washington he and future Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady (who at the time played six-string guitar) formed a band named The Triumphs. Kaukonen departed Washington for studies at Antioch College where friend Ian Buchanan taught him fingerstyle guitar playing. Buchanan also introduced Kaukonen to the music of Reverend Gary Davis, whose songs have remained important parts of Kaukonen's repertoire throughout his career.\n\nIn 1962 Kaukonen moved to the San Francisco bay area and enrolled in Santa Clara University. During this time he taught guitar lessons in a small music store in San Jose. As a self-described blues purist, Kaukonen never had any ambition to play in a rock band. He played as a solo act in coffee houses and can be heard accompanying a young Janis Joplin on acoustic guitar on an historic 1964 recording (known as \"The Typewriter Tapes\" because of the obtrusive sound of Kaukonen's first wife Margareta typing in the background). Invited to attend a Jefferson Airplane rehearsal by founding member Paul Kantner, Kaukonen found his imagination excited by the arsenal of effects available to electric guitar and later said, \"I was sucked in by technology.\"\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nKaukonen's electric guitar work was distinctive and widely emulated by other Bay Area guitarists. Notable work with Jefferson Airplane includes \"Greasy Heart\", \"If You Feel\", \"Hey Frederick\" (which culminates in an extended lead guitar duet with himself), \"Wooden Ships\" and his original composition, \"Feel So Good\". Rolling Stone named Kaukonen the 54th greatest rock guitarist of all time and 16th greatest acoustic guitarist.\n\nThough never a prolific singer and songwriter during his Airplane tenure, Kaukonen contributed some distinctive material. \"Embryonic Journey\" showcased his fingerstyle acoustic guitar virtuosity. On the next Jefferson Airplane album, After Bathing at Baxter's, his playing developed a harder-edged sound inspired by Mike Bloomfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Cream and other groups that visited San Francisco. These stylistic changes are prominent in the acid rocker \"The Last Wall of the Castle\", as well as the instrumental \"Spare Chaynge\", co-written with bassist Jack Casady and drummer Spencer Dryden. Clocking in at 9:12 minutes, this improvisational style was further explored on the free-form extended jams \"Thing\" and \"Bear Melt\", both live instrumentals recorded in 1968. Kaukonen insists, however, on the liner notes of the Live at the Fillmore East album that these jams were not chaotic \"free for alls\" but in fact \"complex rehearsed arrangements.\" Two notable songs that were later to become Hot Tuna signature tunes were also recorded during the 1968-1969 period. These were the traditionals \"Rock Me Baby \" and the gospel ballad \"Good Shepherd.\" Other original compositions with the Airplane appeared on the 1971 album \"Bark\", the instrumental \"Wild Turkey\" and \"Feel So good\", as well as the acoustic autobiographical \"Third Week in the Chelsea\" detailing his feelings about the disintegration of the band.\n\nHot Tuna and solo career\n\nIn 1969-70, Kaukonen and Jack Casady formed Hot Tuna, a spin-off group that allowed them to play as long as they liked. An early incarnation of Hot Tuna included Airplane vocalist Marty Balin and featured Joey Covington on drums and vocals. This grouping came to an end after an unsuccessful recording jaunt to Jamaica, the sessions of which have never been released. Pared down to Kaukonen and Casady, Hot Tuna lived on as a vehicle for Kaukonen to show off his Piedmont style acoustic blues fingerpicking skills. The self-titled first album was all acoustic and recorded live. With the dissolution of Jefferson Airplane in 1972, Hot Tuna went electric, with Airplane fiddler Papa John Creach joining for the next two albums. Hot Tuna scored an FM hit with \"Ja Da (Keep On Truckin')\" from their third (and first studio) album, Burgers. At this time, Kaukonen's song-writing began to dominate, as further evidenced by the next album, The Phosphorescent Rat, which only featured one cover song. Beginning with their fifth album, America's Choice (1974), the addition of drummer Bob Steeler encouraged a rise in volume and a change of band personality -- a rampaging, Cream-like rock with often quasi-mystical lyrics courtesy of Kaukonen. During this period, the power trio was known for its very long live sets and instrumental jamming.\n\nIn 1974, Kaukonen recorded the first and most successful of several solo albums, Quah, together with Tom Hobson. Produced by Jack Casady, and featuring (somewhat surprisingly) string overdubs on some tracks, this album contained some of Kaukonen's most deft fingerpicking work, especially on \"Hamar Promenade\", \"Blue Prelude\", \"Genesis\" and \" Flying Clouds\". The curious picture that adorns Quah's cover is today on display at Donkey Coffe and Espresso, a coffee shop in Athens, Ohio.\n\nKaukonen toured vigorously throughout the 1970s in both the United States and Europe, but with Hot Tuna's break up in 1978, the first phase of the band's career ended. Casady left to form the new wave band \"SVT\", while Kaukonen released his second solo album, Jorma, a mix of electric guitar and acoustic fingerstyle in 1979. Meanwhile, he had formed the band \"Vital Parts\".\n\nVital Parts featured bassist Denny DeGorio, who had played in a San Francisco band called the \"Offs\" with ex-Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler. Kaukonen, experimenting with a new image, not only cut his hair but dyed it purple then bright orange, and had extensive tattoos adorn his body, back and arms. The album Barbeque King was released in 1980. Kaukonen's traditional fan base did not warm to this new, perceived to be \"punk\" image, and sales of the album were so disappointing that Jorma was soon dropped from RCA records.\n\nHe continued playing as a solo artist throughout the 1980s at such venues as The Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia, The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey and in Port Chester, New York. As in his Hot Tuna days, he played very long sets, usually beginning with an hour-long acoustic set followed by a long intermission and then a two hour electric set, sometimes accompanied by bass and drums. Hot Tuna themselves reformed in the late 1980s. At a 1987 Hot Tuna performance, Kaukonen surprised fellow Airplane alumnus Paul Kantner, who was sitting in, with a surprise appearance by his estranged lover Grace Slick; the success of this performance helped to pave the way for a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and record in 1989.\n\nIn 1980, Kaukonen appeared on Robert Hunter's Amagamalin Street. This was the third album released by Relix Records, a label, founded by Les Kippel, that specialized in bands from the San Francisco Bay Area.

In '87 Jask began djing at the age of 13. Influences consisted of soul, jazz, funk, r&b, hip hop, rock, new wave, disco, early electro & freestyle. A year later he would soon discover and quickly embrace a passion for the music that was coming out of Chicago & New York, known as the underground house sound. Jask was one of the major players to introduce the acid jazz sound to Tampa & most of central Florida in the early 90's. He held Tampa's longest running eclectic loungin' night called, \"Martini Jazz\". It took place every Thursday night at a club called the Castle which ran from '94 to '96. The \"Martini Jazz\" night brought some notoriety to Jask, which eventually led him to assist in the promotions of \"Groove Collective's (NYC) first ever performance in the Tampa area. In December of 1995, Jask started Tampa's first weekly soulful underground house night called, \"Jacks House\". During its successful over a decade ongoing run, Jask has played alongside various talented djs such as: Mark Farina, Dj Disciple, Benji Candelario, Marques Wyatt, Doug Smith, Brian Tappert , Miguel Migs, King Britt, Tedd Patterson, Tommy Musto, Kaskade, Pete Moss, David Harness, Rasoul, Julius Papp, Matthias Heibronn, Jay-J, Little Louie Vega, Frankie Feliciano, Karizma, Mark Grant, Johnny Fiasco, Diz, Collete, Heather, Tortured Soul, Cevin Fisher, Harry Choo Choo Romero, Cajmere, Lisa Shaw, JJK and many other luminaries in the dance music industry...As of Today, Jask still holds down Jack's House(Tuesdays) and a new night called, \"Paradise\" which has become the new Underground house night in the Tampa area and features guest djs from all around the globe. On the production and remix side of the musical pendulum, Jask has appeared on such notable labels as: Vega, King Street/NiteGrooves, I!Records, Swanky, Metaphor, K2/Vinylicious, Step Ahead, Erotic City, DeepTouch, Harlequin, SoulGroove, Soulfuric Deep, Soulfuric, Soufuric Trax, Catch 22, Deeplay, Solu, Om, Vino, Defected, Undo, Large Music, Salted, Sole Channel, Ultra, Rhythm & Culture, Transport & NeoDisco.

This was Jask's first original vocal track in which he wrote everything from the music to the lyrics with haunting lush deep vocals from his friend Jocie. It is a special release in which Jask has dedicated it to his late mother who passed away July 31, 2001. Due to the successful Jacks house night in Tampa and his music productions, Jask has had the luxury of performing/djing across the United States and beyond.

She started to sing in church, directed choirs by the age of 10 and received voice lessons in high school. As she was raised in the Bay Area in the 60s she was influenced by all the styles of music going on and places like The Fillmore were second home to her - even Bill Graham watched out for her. Patti jammed with hundreds of musicians during that time and learned how to improvise in any style. Some might remember that Patti was one of the founding members of Kingfish - featuring Bobby Weir, Matthew Kelly, Dave Torbert, Barry Flast among others.\n\nTuck was influenced by swing and classical music from an early age but it wasn't until the Beatles and Rolling Stones came out that he knew he had to play rock and roll. Because Tuck's sister had taught him how to play the piano he started with that instrument but soon decided that the guitar would be a better choice. Although Tuck was influenced by rock music he started to learn complex jazz chords instead, simply because he had the Mel Chord Book, with 400 Orchestral Chords in the appendix, at hand. When he heard Jimi Hendrix for the first time he was not only blown away, he considered it impossible for him to come up with such a sound himself and he dived even deeper into jazz.\n\nIn 1970 Tuck enrolled in Stanford where he would later major in music and played in several rock and jazz bands at the same time. He even went to Los Angeles to play in bands and took the guitar position for the Sonny and Cher TV show for some time - but decided to leave the L.A. scene before it could swallow him. Instead he headed to the Bay Area where he would play in top 40, soul and rock bands or practice and listen to music 8 to sometimes 14 hours a day.\n\nIn 1978 Tuck was playing in a band Patti came to audition for. Once they met they immediately knew they had found their musical soul mate (and partner in life). Since the band didn't happen Tuck and Patti decided to work as a duo and their instant success in the Bay Area proved that their formula that every song had to speak and be played from their hearts worked. Ten years later they would release their first CD Tears of Joy and the rest is history as they say. Tuck & Patti have become a well known act worldwide - especially in Europe and Japan.\n\nThat's also the reason why their CD A Gift of Love got released. They actually produced this album for their fans in Japan who wanted to hear Tuck & Patti's interpretations of classical love songs. The album turned out to be yet another success, once it was released in Japan it had to be released in Europe as well. Last but not least, 33rd Street Records released the album in July 2004 for the American market. What does this tell us?

But before moving to the DC area, Jorma and family lived in the Philippines and other locales as he followed his father's career from assignment to assignment before returning to the place of his birth. As a teenager in Washington he and future Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady (who at the time played six-string guitar) formed a band named The Triumphs. Kaukonen departed Washington for studies at Antioch College where friend Ian Buchanan taught him fingerstyle guitar playing. Buchanan also introduced Kaukonen to the music of Reverend Gary Davis, whose songs have remained important parts of Kaukonen's repertoire throughout his career.\n\nIn 1962 Kaukonen moved to the San Francisco bay area and enrolled in Santa Clara University. During this time he taught guitar lessons in a small music store in San Jose. As a self-described blues purist, Kaukonen never had any ambition to play in a rock band. He played as a solo act in coffee houses and can be heard accompanying a young Janis Joplin on acoustic guitar on an historic 1964 recording (known as \"The Typewriter Tapes\" because of the obtrusive sound of Kaukonen's first wife Margareta typing in the background). Invited to attend a Jefferson Airplane rehearsal by founding member Paul Kantner, Kaukonen found his imagination excited by the arsenal of effects available to electric guitar and later said, \"I was sucked in by technology.\"\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nKaukonen's electric guitar work was distinctive and widely emulated by other Bay Area guitarists. Notable work with Jefferson Airplane includes \"Greasy Heart\", \"If You Feel\", \"Hey Frederick\" (which culminates in an extended lead guitar duet with himself), \"Wooden Ships\" and his original composition, \"Feel So Good\". Rolling Stone named Kaukonen the 54th greatest rock guitarist of all time and 16th greatest acoustic guitarist.\n\nThough never a prolific singer and songwriter during his Airplane tenure, Kaukonen contributed some distinctive material. \"Embryonic Journey\" showcased his fingerstyle acoustic guitar virtuosity. On the next Jefferson Airplane album, After Bathing at Baxter's, his playing developed a harder-edged sound inspired by Mike Bloomfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Cream and other groups that visited San Francisco. These stylistic changes are prominent in the acid rocker \"The Last Wall of the Castle\", as well as the instrumental \"Spare Chaynge\", co-written with bassist Jack Casady and drummer Spencer Dryden. Clocking in at 9:12 minutes, this improvisational style was further explored on the free-form extended jams \"Thing\" and \"Bear Melt\", both live instrumentals recorded in 1968. Kaukonen insists, however, on the liner notes of the Live at the Fillmore East album that these jams were not chaotic \"free for alls\" but in fact \"complex rehearsed arrangements.\" Two notable songs that were later to become Hot Tuna signature tunes were also recorded during the 1968-1969 period. These were the traditionals \"Rock Me Baby \" and the gospel ballad \"Good Shepherd.\" Other original compositions with the Airplane appeared on the 1971 album \"Bark\", the instrumental \"Wild Turkey\" and \"Feel So good\", as well as the acoustic autobiographical \"Third Week in the Chelsea\" detailing his feelings about the disintegration of the band.\n\nHot Tuna and solo career\n\nIn 1969-70, Kaukonen and Jack Casady formed Hot Tuna, a spin-off group that allowed them to play as long as they liked. An early incarnation of Hot Tuna included Airplane vocalist Marty Balin and featured Joey Covington on drums and vocals. This grouping came to an end after an unsuccessful recording jaunt to Jamaica, the sessions of which have never been released. Pared down to Kaukonen and Casady, Hot Tuna lived on as a vehicle for Kaukonen to show off his Piedmont style acoustic blues fingerpicking skills. The self-titled first album was all acoustic and recorded live. With the dissolution of Jefferson Airplane in 1972, Hot Tuna went electric, with Airplane fiddler Papa John Creach joining for the next two albums. Hot Tuna scored an FM hit with \"Ja Da (Keep On Truckin')\" from their third (and first studio) album, Burgers. At this time, Kaukonen's song-writing began to dominate, as further evidenced by the next album, The Phosphorescent Rat, which only featured one cover song. Beginning with their fifth album, America's Choice (1974), the addition of drummer Bob Steeler encouraged a rise in volume and a change of band personality -- a rampaging, Cream-like rock with often quasi-mystical lyrics courtesy of Kaukonen. During this period, the power trio was known for its very long live sets and instrumental jamming.\n\nIn 1974, Kaukonen recorded the first and most successful of several solo albums, Quah, together with Tom Hobson. Produced by Jack Casady, and featuring (somewhat surprisingly) string overdubs on some tracks, this album contained some of Kaukonen's most deft fingerpicking work, especially on \"Hamar Promenade\", \"Blue Prelude\", \"Genesis\" and \" Flying Clouds\". The curious picture that adorns Quah's cover is today on display at Donkey Coffe and Espresso, a coffee shop in Athens, Ohio.\n\nKaukonen toured vigorously throughout the 1970s in both the United States and Europe, but with Hot Tuna's break up in 1978, the first phase of the band's career ended. Casady left to form the new wave band \"SVT\", while Kaukonen released his second solo album, Jorma, a mix of electric guitar and acoustic fingerstyle in 1979. Meanwhile, he had formed the band \"Vital Parts\".\n\nVital Parts featured bassist Denny DeGorio, who had played in a San Francisco band called the \"Offs\" with ex-Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler. Kaukonen, experimenting with a new image, not only cut his hair but dyed it purple then bright orange, and had extensive tattoos adorn his body, back and arms. The album Barbeque King was released in 1980. Kaukonen's traditional fan base did not warm to this new, perceived to be \"punk\" image, and sales of the album were so disappointing that Jorma was soon dropped from RCA records.\n\nHe continued playing as a solo artist throughout the 1980s at such venues as The Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia, The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey and in Port Chester, New York. As in his Hot Tuna days, he played very long sets, usually beginning with an hour-long acoustic set followed by a long intermission and then a two hour electric set, sometimes accompanied by bass and drums. Hot Tuna themselves reformed in the late 1980s. At a 1987 Hot Tuna performance, Kaukonen surprised fellow Airplane alumnus Paul Kantner, who was sitting in, with a surprise appearance by his estranged lover Grace Slick; the success of this performance helped to pave the way for a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and record in 1989.\n\nIn 1980, Kaukonen appeared on Robert Hunter's Amagamalin Street. This was the third album released by Relix Records, a label, founded by Les Kippel, that specialized in bands from the San Francisco Bay Area. Relix also released Splashdown, featuring a rare performance by Hot Tuna on WQIV, a defunct radio station in New York. Kippel was instrumental in reuniting Kaukonen and Casady in 1985 for a Hot Tuna theater tour. Relix Records was Hot Tuna's record company until 2000, and also released Classic Hot Tuna Acoustic, Classic Hot Tuna Electric, Live at Sweetwater, and Live at Sweetwater 2.\n\nTwo notable outside projects Kaukonen played on were the David Crosby album \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\" (1971) and Warren Zevon's \"Transverse City\" (1989). In 1993, he collaborated with ex-Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten in recording numerous arrangements of \"Embryonic Journey\". The resulting tracks were released as an album 1994 on the Relix label. In 1999, he played several gigs with Phil Lesh and Friends. In 2000, he appeared with jam band Widespread Panic during their summer tour.\n\nWith his wife Vanessa, Kaukonen currently owns and operates the Fur Peace Ranch, a 119 acre music and guitar camp in the hills of southeast Ohio, north of Pomeroy; complete with a 32 track studio. He is currently under contract as a solo artist to Red House Records and still records and tours with Jack Casady and other friends such as Barry Mitterhof as Hot Tuna. His 2002 album Blue Country Heart was widely acclaimed by critics as one of the definitive examples of American \"Depression Era \" music and features Kaukonen backed by an all-star Nashville bluegrass band. The album was nominated for a Grammy. His latest album, Stars In My Crown, was released in March 2007.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.youtube.com/user/guitarfestival"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pr\u00f3xima Parada ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8979159.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Joshua Collins- guitar, Aaron Kroeger - percussion, Kevin Middlekauff- bass, Nick Larson- vocals, keys", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Pr\u00f3xima Parada blends soulful melody and hard-hitting rhythm into a sound distinctly their own, groovy and uplifting.

Pr\u00f3xima Parada is releasing new music and will embark on their first U.S. tour this year.\n\nTheir last single, Time In A Circle, currently has over 1,500,000 plays on Spotify alone.\n\nStarting in 2012 as a group of college friends wanting to extend their dynamic to their community in San Luis Obispo, CA, they never dreamed that their passion would reach a global audience, that they'd perform at beautiful historic venues and music festivals, that their songs would earn awards, that their music would soothe and uplift people around the world.\n\n\nThe starting lineup for Pr\u00f3xima Parada:\nNick Larson (vocals, keys, guitar), Kevin Middlekauff (bass), Josh Collins (guitar), and Aaron Kroeger (drums).\n\nA BETTER BIO:\n\nThe following recount of the epic of Pr\u00f3xima Parada was translated from ancient Greek dactylic hexameter and is traditionally attributed to Sophocles (although recent investigations by way of modern advancements hypothesize the text as a discarded fragment of Homer's Iliad):\n\nIt all emerged from the discovery of freedom way back when. Pr\u00f3xima Parada, protector of goslings, formed as a result of a murmur, a moo moo, the recitation of a Nordic dirge, and a desperate whimper; sounds heard all the way down to the Mississippi Delta, which had long been shining like a National guitar. Though the individuals of Pr\u00f3xima Parada were all ephemeral in flesh, their collective offering of goodwill in the aural realm became immortal by wish of the gods.\n\nOn Olympus resounded a long, deep breath of agreeable relief, as the gods delivered their most interesting gift for Earth, Kevin Middlekauff, enchanter of the four stringed bass lyre, son of Leto of the Lovely Locks, to whom they gave the patience of the Bald Eagle along with his fierce talons, which made plucking strings a markedly difficult task. With him came a fleet of Achaean spearwomen. Enrapt in observing a quarrel between armies of men, the gods let fall a quiver of divine arrows, and the jumble that fused upon an unforgiving collision of earth and oxen created many a Nicholas Larson, bleak souls with shrill voices. One Nicholas was given the great fortune of finding Kevin, who guided him through wind and sea away from a shameful life as a lotus eater and taught him the Seikilos epitaph (\"While you live, shine / have no grief at all / life exists only for a short while / and time demands an end\").\n\nJoshua Collins\u2019 lineage cannot be enumerated with exactitude, although Agamemnon, supreme commander of the Achaean armies, was informed by an oracle that Joshua was the end result of an abandoned beard. How he and his young fur joined Pr\u00f3xima Parada is even less understood.\n\nFollowing a fortnight of arrows raining from both armies, Apollo ceased his observations of Troy to ponder a creation forming in the northern reaches from the percussion of glaciers striking Galdh\u00f8piggen, Scandinavia\u2019s boldest mountain. Savage ice and rock had been warring for ages. Apollo, to establish consonance in that great region, sent Aaron Kr\u00f6ger, king of Mycenae in the Peloponnese, hiker of short pants. Aaron percussed the earth with his dual gold-bestudded sceptres to instruct the sun of the tempo of the day and the moon of the night\u2019s gloom. Satisfied in frigid Norden, he prepared himself to settle in asceticism for the rest of his days.\n\nNot before long, under the tutelage of Olympus, the three boys became something akin to men and the silence turned to harmony, harmony that spread through the yellow hair of Aaron Kr\u00f6ger, into his ears, and reverberated in his heart. Having never been moved so by man, he vowed to percuss alongside the sounds of the three. Pr\u00f3xima Parada, the amalgamation of the four regions of Nether, was erected in January of 2012 of the Gregorian Calendar, although The China National Petroleum Corporation would soon change their fiscal calendar to mark Pr\u00f3xima\u2019s birth as year 0.", "otherInfo": "We'll be doing a Mother's Day Virtual concert 5/10 at 1pm PST.\n\nTune in on Facebook or YouTube!

They started by recovering some traditional music from Algarve and Alentejo (South of Portugal), always adding their original touch. Their repertoire integrates, mostly, popular traditional songs of these regions, fertile on love stories or even on social critics.\n\nTheir songs reveal all the glory and splendour from the Portuguese traditions with an utterly simplicity.\n\nMocoilas have performed all over Portugal, Brazil and Germany.\n\nTheir repertoire began with the material that they \"stole\" from the ancient; they adopted and reinterpreted all the traditional culture and blended it with some tones from today and, very soon, they realized that they had everything to do their music: they had the will, the smells, the tastes, the colours, the sounds and the inspiration of the mountain to create their own compositions. The result?.... A huge success.MO\u00c7OILAS \" Cantigas da Serra do Caldeir\u00e3o .....\"\n\nSurgiram em 1994, especificamente para uma apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o da Serra do Caldeir\u00e3o, nas suas express\u00f5es Algarvias e Alentejanas, na Festa do Desenvolvimento Local \u2013 Manifesta 94.

Nascem, assim, naturalmente de uma grande vontade de cantar e de partilhar esse gosto umas com as outras. Depois de alguns ser\u00f5es e de outras festas e eventos, aperceberam-se de que havia um lugar vago e com urg\u00eancia de ser preenchido na m\u00fasica popular portuguesa: a m\u00fasica da Serra Algarvia.

As on their covers-heavy first album, Three Chords and a Cloud of Dust, the new No Good Deed Goes Unpunished finds Snit Fitzpatrick and his like-minded mates sifting '80s vinyl and the rocking B-sides of their childhood.

Studio album No.6 - \u2018WAX\u2019 - the 2nd in a trilogy, out now.\n\nSince scoring a worldwide smash with her debut album \u2018Eye To The Telescope\u2019 in 2004, which went on to sell over 5 million copies, KT Tunstall has remained at the forefront of UK singer- songwriter talent. Over the next decade, three further critically acclaimed albums followed; \u2018Drastic Fantastic\u2019, \u2018Tiger Suit\u2019 and \u2018Invisible Empire//Crescent Moon\u2019 in 2007, 2010 and 2013 respectively, keeping the platinum sales rolling and cementing the Scottish singer-songwriter\u2019s reputation as a major recording talent, as well as a mesmerising live artist.\n\nTunstall has toured the world many times over. She outsold every other female artist in the UK in 2005, won the 2006 Brit Award for Best British Female Solo Artist, won the Ivor Novello Best Song award for her huge, self-penned hit 'Suddenly I See\u2019, and a Q award for Track of the Year. She also landed a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and lent her tunes to a host of movies and TV shows ('Suddenly I See', used in the iconic opening scene of Meryl Streep flick 'The Devil Wears Prada').\n\n2012 and the years that followed saw a seismic shift in outlook - the loss of her father, a divorce, and a relocation to Venice Beach, California.\n\nAfter a period of healing, soul-searching, and a change of scenery, 2016 hailed the arrival of the first of a trilogy of albums, the critically acclaimed UK top 10 album - 'KIN'. The trilogy evokes, separately and in sequence, spirit, body and mind. With 'KIN' being her phoenix- from-the-ashes 'spirit' album, 2018 marked the second offering of that trilogy, the \u2018body\u2019 album \u2018WAX\u2019 - released October 5th.\n\nSpeaking about her 6th studio album, Tunstall says of \u2018WAX\u2019 \u201cI knew before I started writing that I wanted it to be an electric guitar record. It had to be visceral, about the physical, and the weight of that, and the obstacles of that. It\u2019s a record about human-ness, which we so often just write off as \u2018flaws\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe title a nod to the viscous pungency of one of the body\u2019s natural substances. \u201cWax evokes colonies of bees, candlelight, the material that the first long-playing records were made of\u201d, she explains, \u201cbut more than that, wax is produced inside your own head. You unconsciously create it, and then weirdly that same basic substance has been used for centuries to make the most lifelike replicas of human beings. It has a life glow to it. It sticks to you. We have these strange, ancient connections and relationships with wax. How odd is it that the body produces all these substances from all these holes!\u201d laughs this stoutly down-to-earth singer, songwriter and guitarist.\n\nLead single \u201cThe River\u201d, which was released August 23rd, opens with an arresting synth hook, before Tunstall\u2019s powerful voice enters, emotionally taking centre stage. The track builds with strong rhythmic guitar textures, exploding into an anthemic chorus. Heavy guitar riffs are central to this track capturing the dirt, grit and physicality of the album. Tunstall explains, \u201cit\u2019s about wanting to escape the madness in the world, escaping bad relationships, and wanting to be washed clean - emancipation through nature\u201d. The single was named one of Rolling Stone's \u2018Songs You Need To Know\u2019. The music video, directed by Alexo Wandael, premiered on Clash Magazine and features KT performing a sensual routine with dancer Alex Thomas.\n\nKT released \u2018WAX\u2019 in October 2018 via Virgin Records (UK) / Rostrum Records/ InGrooves (US / RoW). \u201cWAX\u201d entered the UK album chart at number 15 (Tunstall\u2019s 6th Top 20 album in the UK), was featured on Spotify\u2019s \u2018New Music Friday\u2019 playlist in a dozen countries worldwide and received critical acclaim from both national publications and specialist music outlets in both the UK and USA.\n\nThe Sunday Times - \u201cKiller folk-rock melodies and chord progressions; lyrics rich with emotional intelligence, candour, self-awareness and bite and vocals of immediacy\u201d\n\nThe I \u2013 \u201cFrom the moment she strikes the first meaty chord of her new album, KT sounds visceral capturing the grit of her live shows\u201d\n\nThe Sun 4* \u2013 \u201cWAX provides a gritty collection of classic rock-pop\u201d\n\nSecond single, \u2018Human Being\u2019, was released in December 2018, accompanied by a self- directed video by Tunstall which was premiered on NYLON and features an 8-year-old black belt nunchuck talent Eccaia Sampson. KT says of the video: \u201cMy vision for the video was to create a mirror between a young, crazy- talented, bold little girl, and link that burgeoning energy to a band of warrioress women\u201d. The track was playlisted by BBC Radio 2.\n\nThe last few years have seen something of a creative rebirth for Tunstall. Upon relocating to the west coast of the USA, she was accepted as one of six annual fellows for the Sundance Film Institute\u2019s Composers Lab (hosted by George Lucas\u2019s Skywalker Ranch in Northern California) and has since scored music for short and feature films.\nShe has also been awarded the Inspirational Artist gong at the Women In Music Awards and was chosen as the first ever female Grand Marshal (following the likes of Sir Sean Connery) to lead April 2018\u2019s annual New York Tartan Week parade. In May 2018 she and Mike McCready, of legendary multi-million selling Pearl Jam, released a cover of Tom Petty\u2019s huge hit single \u2018I Won\u2019t Back Down\u2019 with proceeds going to Pearl Jam\u2019s Vitalogy Foundation.\n\nIn 2018, KT performed sold-out intimate headline shows across the UK and US and toured worldwide supporting acclaimed artists including Simple Minds, The Pretenders, Barenaked Ladies and Gary Barlow.\n\nSo far in 2019, KT has been on a headline tour across the UK and Europe with her all-female band, played at festivals all over the UK (including a headline set at Glastonbury and sets at Isle of Wight, HebCelt, Larmer Tree and Car Fest), toured across the US & Canada, supported Hall & Oates on their UK arena tour and played shows in Japan and China.\n\nBy the end of 2019, KT will have also played live dates in the Netherlands, Mexico and Brazil.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://citywinery.com/newyork/can-t-be-there-today-billy-bragg-and-the-city-winery-all-stars-presents-a-mother-s-day-special.html"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Todd Snider ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10097093.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Americana, Folk", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "In many ways, acclaimed singer-songwriter Todd Snider has made a career out of turning left, when everyone else expected him to turn right.

As the title suggests, the album was recorded at the studio formerly owned by Johnny Cash and now owned by his son, John Carter Cash. Snider played all the instruments on the record, mostly guitar and harmonica, but he also played banjo on one song and overdubbed mandolin and percussion on some others. The only other people on the album are Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires, who contributed backing vocals to several songs. Among the highlights of the record are a trio of talking blues numbers, which reinforce the fact Snider has come full circle with the album because it was the song \u201cTalking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues\u201d from his 1994 debut, Songs For The Daily Planet, that first launched the native of Portland, Oregon, into the national consciousness.

She is oldest daughter of Johnny Cash and his first wife, Vivian Liberto, born shortly before the release of her father's first single. She is also the stepdaughter of June Carter Cash and the stepsister of country singer Carlene Carter.\n\nCash released her first single in 1979, a duet with Bobby Bare called \"We Don't Need No Memories Hangin' 'Round\". Two years later, she had her first country No. 1 (and the biggest commercial hit of her career), \"Seven Year Ache\". Although Cash was a prominent country star throughout the '80s, alongside fellow decade-defining artists Emmylou Harris, Juice Newton, and Dolly Parton, her music was anything but traditional: She topped the charts with songs written not only by herself, but by her father (\"Tennessee Flat Top Box\"), John Hiatt (\"The Way We Make a Broken Heart\"), Tom Petty (\"Never Be You\") and The Beatles (\"I Don't Want To Spoil The Party\"), \"I Don't Know Why You Don't Want Me\", which won her a Grammy in 1985, and \"It's Such A Small World\", a 1987 duet with Rodney Crowell on his album Diamonds & Dirt, provided further hits. A sampling of these songs and more are included on the compilation Hits 1979-1989. In 1979, she married Rodney Crowell, who was to produce most of her hit records. Their stormy marriage lasted until 1992; its break-up is chronicled in Cash's Interiors and in Crowell's album Life Is Messy. Cash later married John Leventhal, who produced her albums The Wheel, 10 Song Demo, Rules of Travel, and Black Cadillac.\n\nTo date, Cash has had more than twenty top 40 country singles, including eleven chart-toppers, but none since 1990, and she has left Nashville in both spirit and body to pursue her artistic vision. Although she had recorded all of her hits for Columbia Records' Nashville division, she released 10 Song Demo for the pop division of Capitol. Cash resurfaced in 2003 with Rules of Travel. The album features guest appearances by Sheryl Crow and Steve Earle, as well as a tune penned by Joe Henry and The Wallflowers' Jakob Dylan. Cash's latest album, entitled Black Cadillac, was released by Capitol Records in January 2006 to critical acclaim. Many of the songs were written by Cash and address the losses (within a 24-month span) of her step-mother, her father, her step-sister (Rosey Nix Adams) and then finally her mother on Cash's fiftieth birthday.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://citywinery.com/newyork/can-t-be-there-today-billy-bragg-and-the-city-winery-all-stars-presents-a-mother-s-day-special.html"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Joan Osborne ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9031241.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Rock, Soul, Blues, Pop", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Official page of Joan Osborne.

But before moving to the DC area, Jorma and family lived in the Philippines and other locales as he followed his father's career from assignment to assignment before returning to the place of his birth. As a teenager in Washington he and future Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady (who at the time played six-string guitar) formed a band named The Triumphs. Kaukonen departed Washington for studies at Antioch College where friend Ian Buchanan taught him fingerstyle guitar playing. Buchanan also introduced Kaukonen to the music of Reverend Gary Davis, whose songs have remained important parts of Kaukonen's repertoire throughout his career.\n\nIn 1962 Kaukonen moved to the San Francisco bay area and enrolled in Santa Clara University. During this time he taught guitar lessons in a small music store in San Jose. As a self-described blues purist, Kaukonen never had any ambition to play in a rock band. He played as a solo act in coffee houses and can be heard accompanying a young Janis Joplin on acoustic guitar on an historic 1964 recording (known as \"The Typewriter Tapes\" because of the obtrusive sound of Kaukonen's first wife Margareta typing in the background). Invited to attend a Jefferson Airplane rehearsal by founding member Paul Kantner, Kaukonen found his imagination excited by the arsenal of effects available to electric guitar and later said, \"I was sucked in by technology.\"\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nKaukonen's electric guitar work was distinctive and widely emulated by other Bay Area guitarists. Notable work with Jefferson Airplane includes \"Greasy Heart\", \"If You Feel\", \"Hey Frederick\" (which culminates in an extended lead guitar duet with himself), \"Wooden Ships\" and his original composition, \"Feel So Good\". Rolling Stone named Kaukonen the 54th greatest rock guitarist of all time and 16th greatest acoustic guitarist.\n\nThough never a prolific singer and songwriter during his Airplane tenure, Kaukonen contributed some distinctive material. \"Embryonic Journey\" showcased his fingerstyle acoustic guitar virtuosity. On the next Jefferson Airplane album, After Bathing at Baxter's, his playing developed a harder-edged sound inspired by Mike Bloomfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Cream and other groups that visited San Francisco. These stylistic changes are prominent in the acid rocker \"The Last Wall of the Castle\", as well as the instrumental \"Spare Chaynge\", co-written with bassist Jack Casady and drummer Spencer Dryden. Clocking in at 9:12 minutes, this improvisational style was further explored on the free-form extended jams \"Thing\" and \"Bear Melt\", both live instrumentals recorded in 1968. Kaukonen insists, however, on the liner notes of the Live at the Fillmore East album that these jams were not chaotic \"free for alls\" but in fact \"complex rehearsed arrangements.\" Two notable songs that were later to become Hot Tuna signature tunes were also recorded during the 1968-1969 period. These were the traditionals \"Rock Me Baby \" and the gospel ballad \"Good Shepherd.\" Other original compositions with the Airplane appeared on the 1971 album \"Bark\", the instrumental \"Wild Turkey\" and \"Feel So good\", as well as the acoustic autobiographical \"Third Week in the Chelsea\" detailing his feelings about the disintegration of the band.\n\nHot Tuna and solo career\n\nIn 1969-70, Kaukonen and Jack Casady formed Hot Tuna, a spin-off group that allowed them to play as long as they liked. An early incarnation of Hot Tuna included Airplane vocalist Marty Balin and featured Joey Covington on drums and vocals. This grouping came to an end after an unsuccessful recording jaunt to Jamaica, the sessions of which have never been released. Pared down to Kaukonen and Casady, Hot Tuna lived on as a vehicle for Kaukonen to show off his Piedmont style acoustic blues fingerpicking skills. The self-titled first album was all acoustic and recorded live. With the dissolution of Jefferson Airplane in 1972, Hot Tuna went electric, with Airplane fiddler Papa John Creach joining for the next two albums. Hot Tuna scored an FM hit with \"Ja Da (Keep On Truckin')\" from their third (and first studio) album, Burgers. At this time, Kaukonen's song-writing began to dominate, as further evidenced by the next album, The Phosphorescent Rat, which only featured one cover song. Beginning with their fifth album, America's Choice (1974), the addition of drummer Bob Steeler encouraged a rise in volume and a change of band personality -- a rampaging, Cream-like rock with often quasi-mystical lyrics courtesy of Kaukonen. During this period, the power trio was known for its very long live sets and instrumental jamming.\n\nIn 1974, Kaukonen recorded the first and most successful of several solo albums, Quah, together with Tom Hobson. Produced by Jack Casady, and featuring (somewhat surprisingly) string overdubs on some tracks, this album contained some of Kaukonen's most deft fingerpicking work, especially on \"Hamar Promenade\", \"Blue Prelude\", \"Genesis\" and \" Flying Clouds\". The curious picture that adorns Quah's cover is today on display at Donkey Coffe and Espresso, a coffee shop in Athens, Ohio.\n\nKaukonen toured vigorously throughout the 1970s in both the United States and Europe, but with Hot Tuna's break up in 1978, the first phase of the band's career ended. Casady left to form the new wave band \"SVT\", while Kaukonen released his second solo album, Jorma, a mix of electric guitar and acoustic fingerstyle in 1979. Meanwhile, he had formed the band \"Vital Parts\".\n\nVital Parts featured bassist Denny DeGorio, who had played in a San Francisco band called the \"Offs\" with ex-Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler. Kaukonen, experimenting with a new image, not only cut his hair but dyed it purple then bright orange, and had extensive tattoos adorn his body, back and arms. The album Barbeque King was released in 1980. Kaukonen's traditional fan base did not warm to this new, perceived to be \"punk\" image, and sales of the album were so disappointing that Jorma was soon dropped from RCA records.\n\nHe continued playing as a solo artist throughout the 1980s at such venues as The Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia, The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey and in Port Chester, New York. As in his Hot Tuna days, he played very long sets, usually beginning with an hour-long acoustic set followed by a long intermission and then a two hour electric set, sometimes accompanied by bass and drums. Hot Tuna themselves reformed in the late 1980s. At a 1987 Hot Tuna performance, Kaukonen surprised fellow Airplane alumnus Paul Kantner, who was sitting in, with a surprise appearance by his estranged lover Grace Slick; the success of this performance helped to pave the way for a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and record in 1989.\n\nIn 1980, Kaukonen appeared on Robert Hunter's Amagamalin Street. This was the third album released by Relix Records, a label, founded by Les Kippel, that specialized in bands from the San Francisco Bay Area. Relix also released Splashdown, featuring a rare performance by Hot Tuna on WQIV, a defunct radio station in New York. Kippel was instrumental in reuniting Kaukonen and Casady in 1985 for a Hot Tuna theater tour. Relix Records was Hot Tuna's record company until 2000, and also released Classic Hot Tuna Acoustic, Classic Hot Tuna Electric, Live at Sweetwater, and Live at Sweetwater 2.\n\nTwo notable outside projects Kaukonen played on were the David Crosby album \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\" (1971) and Warren Zevon's \"Transverse City\" (1989). In 1993, he collaborated with ex-Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten in recording numerous arrangements of \"Embryonic Journey\". The resulting tracks were released as an album 1994 on the Relix label. In 1999, he played several gigs with Phil Lesh and Friends. In 2000, he appeared with jam band Widespread Panic during their summer tour.\n\nWith his wife Vanessa, Kaukonen currently owns and operates the Fur Peace Ranch, a 119 acre music and guitar camp in the hills of southeast Ohio, north of Pomeroy; complete with a 32 track studio. He is currently under contract as a solo artist to Red House Records and still records and tours with Jack Casady and other friends such as Barry Mitterhof as Hot Tuna. His 2002 album Blue Country Heart was widely acclaimed by critics as one of the definitive examples of American \"Depression Era \" music and features Kaukonen backed by an all-star Nashville bluegrass band. The album was nominated for a Grammy. His latest album, Stars In My Crown, was released in March 2007.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://citywinery.com/newyork/can-t-be-there-today-billy-bragg-and-the-city-winery-all-stars-presents-a-mother-s-day-special.html"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Loudon Wainwright III ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6287804.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Folk, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Loudon Wainwright III (born September 5, 1946 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina) is an American songwriter, folk singer, humorist, and actor.
