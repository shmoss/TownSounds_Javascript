For the past decade that Lopez has been actively crafting music, multimedia art, and poetry, she has always seen her creative output as a necessary therapy. \u201cFor a long time I didn\u2019t go to therapy, and I used music as a release.\u201d explains Lopez. \u201cI\u2019m able to convey on stage what I can\u2019t off stage, and these songs that we\u2019ve written and performed\u2014I\u2019ve clung to them as a means of survival almost.\u201d What began as a notebook of poems Lopez kept during her youth in South Sacramento, has evolved into a lush and genre-defying body of work.\n\nAfter two close deaths and a period of reflection in 2016, Lopez felt she needed to reassess her life and her musical project, Sister Crayon. The project was reinvented through Rituals of Mine, and with the new moniker Lopez began writing the most honest and personal songs she had ever written. After years of obscuring her story and emotions through metaphorical lyrics, Lopez felt a sudden confidence to write more directly about her experiences as a queer woman of color. Lopez began fleshing out the songs with her long time collaborator and producer Wes Jones, who helped turn Lopez\u2019s heartfelt writing about trauma and personal growth into urgent and powerful electronic tracks. Lopez then enlisted Adam Pierce to play drums, knowing that their background in metal percussion would provide an intensity that could match her own.\n\nSince releasing their debut, Devoted, in 2016, Rituals of Mine has been praised within the indie music community, and Lopez\u2019s interactive art exhibit that simulates female-identifying people's experiences with street harassment, THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, has reached over 200,000 participants. Rituals of Mine has shared its music and message around the world, touring with acts like Garbage, Tricky, Built to Spill, DEFTONES, and Le Butcherettes. The band is excited to release their new EP, SLEEPER HOLD, this fall through Carpark Records. With these new songs and their upcoming live shows, Lopez hopes to continue to inspire audiences in her local community and around the country to overcome their own struggles and indulge their cathartic outpour.", "otherInfo": "No Place Like Home: a livestream benefit series for the Bay Area Music Community!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "From Indian Lakes LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9189892.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Dream Pop, Indie Alt Rock", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "From Indian Lakes is the project of California-based singer/songwriter Joey Vannucchi.

Consisting of guitarist and vocalist Todd Tate alongside drummer Daniel Guaqueta, Sayla Dobro was brewed up in the Bay Area, between Marin and San Francisco. Originally created as a stage name for Tate\u2019s persona in a now defunct Marin bar-hopping band, \"The Deep Sounds of Bobby Peru\", Sayla Dobro has since evolved into a much more complex and mature getup.\n\nThe band really kicked off after Tate saw dobro guitar virtuoso Jerry Douglas play live - he instantly went out and bought a dobro guitar and starting writing and recording immediately. Now part of his namesake, Sayla Dobro is characterized by Tate\u2019s customized Regal RD-35 square neck dobro. Enter Colombian-raised, Mississippi-born multi-instrumentalist Daniel Guaqueta. The drummer and Tate came together through mutual friend Michael Starita, President of the San Francisco area Grammy chapter. Starita mixed the first two Sayla Dobro singles, \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d and \u201cJ-Train\u201d. During this time, he introduced Guaqueta and Tate and the rest was history.\n\nSayla Dobro\u2019s songs hearken seasoned folk-rockers like Beck and Calexico, thoughtfully self-produced and rough around the edges. It\u2019s no surprise that Sayla Dobro has been able to capture such a potent essence - the band\u2019s frontman and lead songwriter Todd Tate\u2019s industry experience runs deep. In the mid-nineties Tate\u2019s main focus was audio engineering at The Blue Room Studios, working on Grammy nominated Latin jazz with Carlos \u201cPatato\u201d Sanchez, and with popular rock artists like Train. On the brink of the millennium, Tate ditched full-time engineering and went to the other side of the glass to focus on making his own music. He made a rock record with a new group Life Love Misery (members of The Starship and Cacophony).\n\nMeanwhile, Guaqueta has a rich musical background of his own. He\u2019s written and released music with artists including Questions in Dialect, Buddy & The Squids, Mainframe Theory, and Storage 24. He\u2019s collaborated directly with Roy Mitchell-Cardenas (of Mutemath) and Mississippi rapper Kamikaze. His diverse background runs further; Guaqueta\u2019s visual artwork has earned honors for his music videos, including the Telly Award, the Addy Award, and the Ruma Award at Crossroads Film Festival.\n\nWith plans to release singles and videos \"very often\" in the upcoming months of 2016, Sayla Dobro is ready to hit the ground running. Supporters of the band\u2019s efforts to release a new single every month can download the band\u2019s single's as they are released in any format now at sayladobro.com/music or any online digital music service. In the upcoming months, fans also have the opportunity to pledge support on Patreon or Bandcamp and receive access to the private Sayla Dobro social feed, an array of special \"awards\", and even a live performance at their own home or business.", "otherInfo": "Live Dobro, electric and acoustic guitar, singing to tracks.

A collection of 5 childhood friends who met up in college, Jared & The Mill has spent the past few years touring extensively through the dive bars, venues, theaters, music festivals, and even arenas of the U.S. and Canada, playing alongside burgeoning bands and established acts, and developing a strong and rooted fan base along the way.

It got to the point that if they were listening to something else, all I had to do was get in the car and they'd automatically flip over to country.\"\n\nComing from a family with deep musical roots, the Stoney Creek Records\u2019 artist started playing piano and guitar at a very early age. \"I learned how to play guitar traveling to country-bluegrass camps with my dad, and knew right from the beginning of my strong passion for country music.\"\n\nThe Calgary native was discovered at 13 by BTO and The Guess Who's Randy Bachman (\"American Woman,\" \"Takin' Care Of Business\"). \"Randy learned guitar from master jazz guitarist Lenny Breau, so I dove head-first into this world of blues, jazz and rock guitar \u2013 learning all these different solos, switching radio stations and trying to get an idea of where all those techniques come from. I was listening to Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Clapton, Derek Trucks and all those incredible guitar players.\u201d\n\nLindsay\u2019s passion and study has served her well, leading to several unique opportunities, including an opening slot with blues icon Buddy Guy; however, her first songwriting trip to Nashville was the catalyst that brought her early affinity for country full-circle. \"When I got here, it was like I was home,\" she says. \"I didn't need to put on a facade of who I was or wasn't. And I finally fell back into my roots. Coming to Nashville brought me to who I am and who I'm meant to be.\"\n\nBecause it is rare, she knows her six-string prowess is not the only focal point, but an accent to her vision as an artist. \"There aren't a lot of girls who play electric lead guitar, and it can be a defining thing,\" she says. First and foremost, I want people to hear me and understand my voice as a country music recording artist. When they come see me, I'd love it if they were impressed at my guitar and piano playing. But by that point, hopefully they understand the artist behind it all has a lot of different sides to her music.\"\n\nTo get to that point, she knows radio and fans will be key \u2013 and she can't wait. \u201cHaving the chance to share my music and show people how ready I am continues to be one of the most exciting steps I've made yet.\"\n\nHaving spent a decade learning about the music industry from the front of a stage, Lindsay Ell is more than ready for that step \u2013 however big or small. \"Playing live, honing my craft and developing as performer before taking my first serious try at being a recording artist and getting radio airplay gives me a foundation a lot of artists just don't get. I've had the cords fail, the monitors shut down and mics die. I've seen all kinds of crowds ... and no crowd at all. I feel ready as a singer and a musician. I have confidence as a performer. I've been writing for years and, since moving to Nashville, have found how best to communicate who I am. I'm comfortable in a conference room with six people or onstage opening for Keith Urban in front of thousands. It's really not that different. Both are exciting and a little humbling.

The project was reinvented through Rituals of Mine, and with the new moniker Lopez began writing the most honest and personal songs she had ever written. After years of obscuring her story and emotions through metaphorical lyrics, Lopez felt a sudden confidence to write more directly about her experiences as a queer woman of color. Lopez began fleshing out the songs with her long time collaborator and producer Wes Jones, who helped turn Lopez\u2019s heartfelt writing about trauma and personal growth into urgent and powerful electronic tracks. Lopez then enlisted Adam Pierce to play drums, knowing that their background in metal percussion would provide an intensity that could match her own.\n\nSince releasing their debut, Devoted, in 2016, Rituals of Mine has been praised within the indie music community, and Lopez\u2019s interactive art exhibit that simulates female-identifying people's experiences with street harassment, THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, has reached over 200,000 participants.

Consisting of guitarist and vocalist Todd Tate alongside drummer Daniel Guaqueta, Sayla Dobro was brewed up in the Bay Area, between Marin and San Francisco. Originally created as a stage name for Tate\u2019s persona in a now defunct Marin bar-hopping band, \"The Deep Sounds of Bobby Peru\", Sayla Dobro has since evolved into a much more complex and mature getup.\n\nThe band really kicked off after Tate saw dobro guitar virtuoso Jerry Douglas play live - he instantly went out and bought a dobro guitar and starting writing and recording immediately. Now part of his namesake, Sayla Dobro is characterized by Tate\u2019s customized Regal RD-35 square neck dobro. Enter Colombian-raised, Mississippi-born multi-instrumentalist Daniel Guaqueta. The drummer and Tate came together through mutual friend Michael Starita, President of the San Francisco area Grammy chapter. Starita mixed the first two Sayla Dobro singles, \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d and \u201cJ-Train\u201d. During this time, he introduced Guaqueta and Tate and the rest was history.\n\nSayla Dobro\u2019s songs hearken seasoned folk-rockers like Beck and Calexico, thoughtfully self-produced and rough around the edges. It\u2019s no surprise that Sayla Dobro has been able to capture such a potent essence - the band\u2019s frontman and lead songwriter Todd Tate\u2019s industry experience runs deep. In the mid-nineties Tate\u2019s main focus was audio engineering at The Blue Room Studios, working on Grammy nominated Latin jazz with Carlos \u201cPatato\u201d Sanchez, and with popular rock artists like Train. On the brink of the millennium, Tate ditched full-time engineering and went to the other side of the glass to focus on making his own music. He made a rock record with a new group Life Love Misery (members of The Starship and Cacophony).\n\nMeanwhile, Guaqueta has a rich musical background of his own. He\u2019s written and released music with artists including Questions in Dialect, Buddy & The Squids, Mainframe Theory, and Storage 24. He\u2019s collaborated directly with Roy Mitchell-Cardenas (of Mutemath) and Mississippi rapper Kamikaze. His diverse background runs further; Guaqueta\u2019s visual artwork has earned honors for his music videos, including the Telly Award, the Addy Award, and the Ruma Award at Crossroads Film Festival.\n\nWith plans to release singles and videos \"very often\" in the upcoming months of 2016, Sayla Dobro is ready to hit the ground running. Supporters of the band\u2019s efforts to release a new single every month can download the band\u2019s single's as they are released in any format now at sayladobro.com/music or any online digital music service. In the upcoming months, fans also have the opportunity to pledge support on Patreon or Bandcamp and receive access to the private Sayla Dobro social feed, an array of special \"awards\", and even a live performance at their own home or business.", "otherInfo": "Live Dobro, electric and acoustic guitar, singing to tracks.

Her style fuses influences from the Isle of Skye and Cape Breton Island with Americana grooves and musical innovations, creating a cutting-edge acoustic sound that retains the integrity and spirit of the Scottish tradition. Hanneke\u2019s music is a blend of the contemporary and traditional, described by the Boston Globe as \u201cexuberant and rhythmic, somehow wild and innocent, delivered with captivating melodic clarity and an irresistible playfulness.\u201d\n\nA prolific composer, Hanneke writes music from personal experiences of love and loss as well as to commemorate the joys and sorrows in the lives of loved ones. Hanneke\u2019s latest release, Trip to Walden Pond, features traditional Scottish and Cape Breton tunes and seventeen new pieces composed in the Scottish idiom. While her lively style is very much evident, this new album carries a deep, soulful sound with songs of celebration and farewell. Produced by Finnish musician Antti J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 (FRIGG, JPP, Baltic Crossing), the album showcases long-time musical collaborators cellist Mike Block, guitarists Keith Murphy and Christopher Lewis, fiddler/violist Jeremy Kittel, and pianist Dave Wiesler. Antti J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 contributes guitar and piano to a couple of tracks and piper Samppa Saarinen is featured on the uilleann pipes. Trip to Walden Pond, similar to Hanneke\u2019s five previous albums, offers mellifluous arrangements of traditional fiddle music and original tunes that evoke humor and heart. This latest album also includes several compositions penned by Hanneke as commissions to benefit Many Hopes, a children\u2019s education nonprofit based in Kenya that she avidly supports.\n\nA native of Port Orford, Oregon, Hanneke started out as a Texas-style fiddler and went on to win the 1997 U.S. National Scottish Fiddle Championship, which awarded her the opportunity to study with Alasdair Fraser and introduced her to fiddle camps and the folk community -- both of which continue to play an integral role in her life. Hanneke teaches regularly at Fraser\u2019s Valley of the Moon and Sierra Fiddle Camps, the Mike Block String Camp (run by her husband, acclaimed cellist Mike Block), Harald Haugaard\u2019s International Fiddle School, and the Boston Harbor Scottish Fiddle School. She has served as a guest instructor in the American Roots department at Berklee College of Music, where she received her Bachelor\u2019s of Music in Violin Performance.\n\nHanneke is a sought-after performer who has graced stages across North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. She has been featured at Celtic Connections (Glasgow, Scotland), KVMR Celtic Fest (Grass Valley, USA), Milwaukee Irish Fest (Milwaukee, USA), Celtic Colours (Cape Breton, Canada), WGBH Christmas Celtic Sojourn (Boston, USA) and the National Celtic Festival (Port Arlington, Australia). The Hanneke Cassel Band features Mike Block on cello and alternating guitarists Keith Murphy and Christopher Lewis.\n\nIn addition to performing with her own band, Hanneke has been featured on PBS with Boston-based fiddle band Childsplay and has performed with Baroque/Celtic group Ensemble Galilei at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (with former NPR \u2018Talk of the Nation\u2019 host Neal Conan) and the National Geographic in Washington, D.C.

Today FSQ members Chuck Da Fonk and Chas Bronz carry the DJ torch for Sa\u2019d Ali, who began in his career 1977 as a disco soul DJ.\n\nFSQ also performs their productions live with their rhythm section - The Supreme Qualities - aka The SQ's.", "otherInfo": "Hosted by Chuck Fishman (aka Chuck Da Fonk), Chuck draws upon his intimate knowledge of soul, funk, disco and house to present a diversity of styles and a quality DJ set of music every Wednesday from 12-2PM NYC time on The Face Radio.

Unter anderem wie Robert Carl Blank es alleine nur mit seiner Gitarre und Stimme schafft, eine Masse von mehr als 1000 Menschen so zu verzaubern, als w\u00fcrde er f\u00fcr jeden einzelnen singen. Der Konzertbesucher vergisst einen Abend mit dem sympathischen Fallschirmspringer aus Hamburg nur schwer, nachdem seine Songs einmal den Weg in den Geh\u00f6rgang gefunden haben. Robert ist einziges lebendes Roadmovie, der in seinen Liedern seine Erfahrung wiedergibt und das Freiheitsgef\u00fchl mit jeder Pore ausstrahlt. Mr. Blank ist der Prototyp der neuen Generation von Songwritern, die ein aufregendes, spannendes und freies Leben f\u00fchren und ihre Erfahrungen teilen wollen.\n\n\u201eWelcome all you volunteers, jokers, clowns and puppeteers\u201c hei\u00dft es gleich in der ersten Zeile seines neuen Albums \u201eFairground Distractions\u201c, das im Herbst 2016 auf den Markt kam. Robert macht hier ein gro\u00dfes emotionales Fass auf: Ein Album \u00fcber die Liebe zum Leben in seiner ganzen Unvorhersehbarkeit - die gro\u00dfe Freiheit gepaart mit bitter-s\u00fc\u00dfen R\u00fcckblicken. Es ist aber auch ein Album \u00fcber Entscheidungen im Leben geworden. Das Album zeigt wieder einmal, wie gro\u00df das Talent dieses Mannes ist, einfach gute Songs zu schreiben und zu interpretieren. Im Gegensatz zum letzten Album ist der Sound hier 60er Jahre Pop mit vielen Anleihen bei den Gro\u00dfen der Zeit. Den Hamburger mit den tschechischen Wurzeln interessieren keine Schubladen, da ihm das Leben in seiner ganzen Vielfalt daf\u00fcr viel zu schade w\u00e4re. Der inzwischen schon inflation\u00e4r gehandelte Titel des \u201eSinger/Songwriters\u201c ist bei Robert daher auch nur reine Nomenklatur, denn der Pops\u00e4nger und Songschmied ist viel mehr als das. Er ist ein rastloser und leidenschaftlicher Idealist, der sich f\u00fcr ein kompromissloses Musikerleben entschieden hat.\n\nUnber\u00fchrt von den Bequemlichkeiten des b\u00fcrgerlichen Lebens reist er bepackt mit einer Batterie von akustischen Gitarren, einem Fallschirm und einer dicken Portion Soul das ganze Jahr \u00fcber durch die Welt, sammelt Material, beobachtet und schreibt seine Eindr\u00fccke und Erfahrungen als kodierte Reiseberichte nieder. Kaum hat er ein neues Album fertig aufgenommen, gibt es schon Material f\u00fcr das n\u00e4chste. Und dabei sind seine Songs nie am Rei\u00dfbrett entstandene L\u00fcckenf\u00fcller, sondern Reisetageb\u00fccher, inspiriert von intensiven Erfahrungen auf einer selbstgebuchten Welttournee.\n\nSein erster musikalischer Reisebericht nach 10 Jahren Worldwide Travelling - das Deb\u00fctalbum \u201eSoul Circus\u201c 2008 - wurde von der Presse mit Lobeshymnen \u00fcberh\u00e4uft. Das INTRO Magazin lobte beispielsweise das liebevoll aufgenommene Album f\u00fcr seine \u201eRadiotauglichkeit\u201c und ordnete ihn als \u201eHoffnung zwischen Jack Johnson und American Idol\u201c ein. Mit seinem zweiten Album \u201eLast Time I Saw Dave\u201c (2010) konnte er sich nicht nur musikalisch weiterentwickeln, sondern auch sein Deb\u00fctalbum noch toppen. Robert Carl Blank gelang es zweifelsohne zu zeigen, dass er keine Eintagsfliege ist, und g\u00e4be es einen Soundtrack zum Leben, dann h\u00e4tte Robert ihn geschrieben \u2013 eine Wahrheit in und zwischen jedem Song, Ehrlichkeit und k\u00fcnstlerische Tiefe. Arne Schumacher (Radio Bremen) z\u00e4hlt ihn \u201eohne Zweifel zu den talentiertesten englisch textenden Singer/Songwritern in Deutschland\u201c und Heinz Rebellius (u.a.

Very early she experienced the \u201cSodade\u201d feeling of missing someone with the long absence of her father due to his work at sea. She grew up in a mixed language environment of Creole, the Cape Verde dialect her parents spoke at home, and Portuguese, always surrounded by the Cape Verdean way of life.\n\nTheo Pas'cal, her producer and mentor and one of the best bass players in Portugal, discovered her talent and introduced Carmen to Jazz and other contemporary sounds that markedly influenced her musical development.\nMusicians like Theo Pascal, Horace Silver, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Joe Zawinul, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarret, Bill Evans, Miles Davis, etc, truly inspire her evolution and search for a unique personal style.\n\nIn 2003, Carmen began working with Theo on the compositions that would be included on her d\u00e9but album Ess \u00ea nha Cabo Verde. Carmen wanted to create a new sound, in her ancestor\u2019s dialect Creole, that would mix traditional African and Cape Verde rhythms like Batuke, Morna, Cola djon, and others, with her jazz contemporary influences, in a totally intimate and acoustic vibe, different from the traditional festive environment of Cape Verdean sounds.\n\nEss \u00ea nha Cabo Verde, was released two years later in 2005 to critical acclaim and led to her international breakthrough performance at the WOMAD at Reading Festival of the same year.\n\nIn \u201cVerdade\u201d her second album, which She co-produces and features on Wurlitzer and guitar, released in 2008, Carmen Souza signs an exciting and melodically vibrant repertoire in Creole that once again received amazing reviews from the International Press worldwide.\n\nAfter 2 critically acclaimed albums, Carmen Souza returns in 2010 with the impressive \"Protegid\" (Protected) that blends perfectly with elegance and sophistication the African and Cape Verdean traditional rhythms with Contemporary Jazz and Afro-Latin. Once again the two composers, Carmen Souza and Theo Pas\u2019cal, present an album that pushes even more the limits of what constitutes the Cape Verdean music, World Music and Jazz. Carmen co-produces, plays guitar, Rhodes and signs 11 out of the 12 lyrics of the album.\n\nIn Protegid, Carmen Souza singular vocal approach and courageous musical chooses earned her pairing with singers like Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Cleo Laine, Eartha Kitt or Marie Daulne. Her Unique talent as a singer, composer and musician sets her apart from the female crowded Cape Verdean scene and progressively she is consolidating her own space in the World Music/Jazz music.\n\nThis new album received outstanding reviews from all over the World and the Press recognizes that something new is being developed in her music. World Music Central considers the album: \u201ca landmark that will prompt you to embrace and at the same time rethink everything you know and love about the sounds of Cape Verde\u201d, NPR says: \u201copens a window to another world entirely\u201d and The Independent declares: \u201cthe poetic voice is as original as the musical one\u201d.\n\nProtegid received a nomination for the German Record Critic\u2019s Award, enters the World Music Charts Europe in April and was included in the list of pre-nominated albums for the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music album . A new edition of Verdade, her second album re-issued in 2010 by Galileo, also enters the WMCE in August and by the end of the year Protegid was included in several lists of \u201cBest World Music Album 2010\u201d.\n\nCarmen Souza have been touring extensively around the World since 2005 and in 2010 she plays big stages like The North Sea Jazz Festival(NL), London African Music Festival(UK) or the Leverkusener Jazztage Festival(DE).\nIn Leverkusener, Carmen Souza, headlines a double bill with Mariza with an\namazing performance later broadcasted by WDR/3SAT German TV.\n\nOther concerts were also broadcasted around the world by major TV/Radio Channels like CBC(CA), RDP/RTP(PT), RADIO6(NL), etc, and her uniqueness is recognized by Ethnomusicologists Gerhard Kubik and Fernando Arenas. A closer look into Carmen Souza groundbreaking work was published in a new book called \u201cBeyond Independence: Globalization, Postcolonialism, and the Cultures of Lusophone Africa\u201d by Fernando Arenas released by the University of Minnesota (USA).\n\nCarmen Souza starts 2011 with a special performance on Italian national television RAI UNO, Concerto Dell Epifania, broadcasted to millions in Italy on the Jan 6, a religious holiday and went on a long tour to sold out big venues and Festivals and mesmerize audiences and Press in Uk, Brazil, Turkey, Netherlands, Germany, Cape Verde, Latvia, Ireland, Portugal, Finland, Italy, USA, Canada...\n\nSpecial mention to her first Official North American Tour with 14 dates in several states receiving opening honours at San Francisco Jazz Festival, Monterey Jazz Festival and also performing at Montreal Jazz Festival.\nCarmen\u00b4s Monterey Jazz Festival concert was web broadcasted live, by the first time in the Festival history and transmitted direct by NPR.\n\nAnother year highlight was Carmen Souza first concerts in Cape Verde with full coverage in all national press. The concerts receive great reviews from Press and Audience and all recognized her special and unique place in the Cape Verdean music culture.\n\n\"In a single song, she delves into the warm and melodic registers of the great jazz divas, only to flee into more contemporary terrain immediately thereafter...the singer cloaks Cape Verdean music in new garb, this distancing herself from what is currently being done by other female Cape Verdean singers\u2026another path for the evolution and renovation of morna or funan\u00e1, giving them a new breadth and life.\" A Semana-Cape Verde\n\nIn 2012, Carmen Souza and Theo Pascal released a special live Duo performance recorded in London \" LONDON ACOUSTIC SET\".

Her style is just as unique as convincing and her Cape Capeverdean roots as evident as her desire to create a new language under the label of 'World Jazz'.\n\n2017 will mark a return to her creole roots with a new album called CREOLOGY.\n-->\n\u201cCarmen Souza sings in her native creole dialect with an intimacy, sensuality, and vivacity, characterised by a tremendous lightness of touch.

The right vocalist can make you fall in love at first listen, elicit tears, or bring you back to a different era altogether. A microphone and a stage remain the only necessities. That holds true for New York-based singer and songwriter Morgan James. On her full-length debut for Epic Records, Hunter, she casts an unbreakable spell with a powerhouse voice equally inspired by smoky soul, swaggering R&B, theatrical swing, and a virtuosic classical poise.\n\nThe Idaho native discovered her passion for music early on and pursued it\nwholeheartedly at the prestigious Juilliard School. While in the midst of the institution's rigorous academic program, she soon realized that her path would diverge from the classical world. \"I didn't want a career in opera, but Juilliard still shaped me,\" she confesses. \"The traditional training really made me a disciplined singer. I carry that with me to this day.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Morgan spent the next few years facing the proverbial struggles of being a young artist in New York. Low on money, she bounced back and forth between bartending and restaurant gigs while fighting to survive. Immersed in classic sixties and seventies soul records, she concurrently experienced a pivotal revelation. \"Out of that frustration came this other voice,\" she says. \"It was my true voice, and I feel like I discovered it in the middle of so much hardship just trying to be heard. I embraced who I was at that very moment.\"\n\nSoon, she would be heard in a big way. In 2008, Morgan booked her first Broadway show\u2014appearing in The Addams Family alongside Nathan Lane, as well as in prominent and leading roles in Wonderland, Godspell (Turn Back, O Man), and Berry Gordy's Motown The Musical as Teena Marie. The latter set the stage for her to\nproperly launch her solo career. Gordy recognized the vocalist's immense talent, and introduced her to Doug Morris and L.A. Reid, opening the door for a deal with Epic Records in 2012.\n\nAround the same time, Morgan booked a landmark show at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, where she paid tribute to Nina Simone with a set of songs that were closely associated with the legendary artist. The incendiary show was recorded and released as the critically acclaimed Morgan James Live on Epic Records. It also proved to be the perfect segue for her first studio album, released in June of 2014.\n\n\"I always knew to make a neo-soul pop record,\" Morgan says. \"The foundation is all real ingredients, and those roots of soul and R&B are pretty strong. It's the culmination of my musical life up to this point. The painful songs are straight out of a bad relationship with someone from my past. The joyful moments are wonderful memories. It's all coming from me. I've lived every one of these stories, and I love the genres I'm representing. It's one point-of-view\u2014mine.\"\n\nThe title track and album opener \"Hunter\" boasts a seductive hook with cinematic noir flair. Flaunting the singer's immense delivery and dynamic presence, it's an undeniable and classy come-on that proves as animalistic as it does magnetic. \"From a woman's perspective, it's such an empowering and sexy song,\" she smiles. \"It totally makes me feel like a warrior! Music is so sensual and life-affirming. That's what I look for. You don't often see a girl take this position, and that's what I love about it!\"\n\nMorgan assumed co-writing duties on eight of the collection's fourteen tracks and even performed all of her own background vocals and harmonies. From the empowering farewell of \"Fed Up On You\" to the mournful rumination of \"You Never Lied\", she continually bares it all\u2014both emotionally and musically. \"I sing like I'm never going to sing ever again,\" Morgan affirms. \"I wanted to capture that power and passion every time. At some moments, it might sound flawless; at others, it might sound like it's going to break. I'm revealing something about myself with\nevery song. You've got to do that. My favorite artists, whether Joni Mitchell or Michael Jackson, are and were, always honest.\"\n\nThere's a unique structure to the album. The first five songs boast electronic elements, while the last six don't have any. \"There's a gradient of the record that goes down,\" she says. \"By the time you get to the last song, it's just piano and voice. It starts with a song about power and ego, and it ends on one about surrender and selflessness. I have all of that in me. Maybe we all do.\"\n\nUltimately, her honesty permeates everything that Morgan James does, and it's why you'll always remember her voice. \"I want people to walk away from this album feeling fulfilled. That's the way it used to be. Often, I think I'm from another time,\u201d she says, her voice trailing off. \u201cI just want to bring back the power of the singular legacy voice.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "noartist ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dash Berlin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10338208.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Music", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Top 25' Dash Berlin including the new singles 'Home' and 'Love Out Loud'!

Still a teen when breakout single \u2018Sweet About Me\u2019 conquered the globe, the Australian artist was thrust into the glare of the spotlight, enjoying chart success after chart success.\n\nYet the more she travelled, the further away from her roots she became. \u201cIt was a bit of an odd time for me, because it was a big departure from why I got into music in the first place. All of a sudden I\u2019m onstage dancing in a sexy robot costume,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt left me in a place where I felt like I had really lost my way from why I wanted to do this in the first place.\u201d\n\nSo she went back to the source. Living in London for the past decade, her 2013 album \u2018The Sting\u2019 was a \u201cshedding of the skin moment\u201d, with Gabriella grappling with independence for the first time. \u201cIt felt like I didn\u2019t know who I was, so I was figuring that out,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was all about stripping things back and going back to the complete basics of writing a song; to go back to the roots of why I loved music in the first place.\u201d\n\nA pivotal moment was watching The Band\u2019s iconic performance in The Last Waltz. Friends onstage making music together, their fusion of country, soul, blues, and Americana lit up Gabriella\u2019s imagination. Working with her brother Joseph as co-songwriter and Eliot James as producer, the three stripped her music to the core, and her new EP is the bravest, most explicitly honest thing Gabriella Cilmi has ever done.\n\nLead single \u2018Ruins\u2019 is a beautiful piece of gilded country-soul, her husky voice set against that graceful acoustic guitar. If it feels incredibly natural then that\u2019s because it is \u2013 this is her voice, her vision, and her life. \u201cI make it because I love it,\u201d she comments. It\u2019s just something that I think I have to do.\u201d\n\nRecorded in short bursts of creativity, Gabriella wanted to use as much analogue equipment as possible, resulting in an organic, inviting sound. She explains: \u201cIt has to feel loose, and it has to feel as though you\u2019re in the room as much as possible.\u201d\n\n\u2018Forgiveness\u2019 is a meditation on the bond between family, while \u2018Safe From Harm\u2019 - \u201cI\u2019m a sucker for a sad waltz!\u201d - is incredibly personal, dealing with guilt, absolution, and mental health. \u201cI went to a Catholic girl\u2019s school and we always started the day with a hymn,\u201d she recalls. \u201cMy brother always jokes, that I\u2019ve got this massive cross to bear! I\u2019m a really loyal person but I also have this thing where I do have this guilt and that\u2019s what I deal with in my songs, and in my music.\u201d\n\nWorking quickly, Gabriella managed to get her feelings down on tape. Musically, it\u2019s honeyed, Autumnal tones are crisp, refreshing, recalling everyone from greats such as Van Morrison and Janis Joplin through to contemporaries such as The Staves or First Aid Kit. But lyrically the EP is a process of exoneration, of letting go.\n\n\u201cA lot of the time you won\u2019t know what a song means until you write it down,\u201d she says. \u201cThe best things tend to come really quickly. If I spend too much time on something, if it\u2019s too laborious, then it\u2019s normally because it\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\nThe process of making the EP has been both cathartic and transformative, with the scorching autobiography of the songwriting aiding her own life. \u201cI\u2019m one of those people who takes things to heart, and holds on to things. Keeps it in locked inside. But everything about this record \u2013 instead of internalising everything it\u2019s just letting it breathe. It\u2019s all about capturing the moment.\u201d\n\nGabriella Cilmi has found her path, and she intends to see where it leads.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Rock ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8030110.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Blues, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Rock (born Dwayne Johnson on May 2, 1972) is a professional wrestler turned actor.

Songs of love, alchemy and life\u2019s journeys. Beautiful vocals, bittersweet melodies and a cheeky pop edge.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, music is often reduced to background noise and treated like a mass-produced product to be sold, even by those who create it. Few in the business give much thought to artistry or how their music impacts those who listen. UK folk-pop duo Faeland is an emerging act that is fully committed to making music that changes lives for the better and adds something good to human existence. Gentle, intuitive, and mystical, the music on Faeland\u2019s debut album All My Swim blends folk traditions from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Singer-songwriter stylings and a dose of pop bring a captivating sound with instant appeal.\n\nFaeland is the brainchild of singer-songwriters Rebecca Nelson and Jacob Morrison, a project designed to break them both out of their comfort zones and to allow them to do meaningful work, not merely start another band. This lead to All My Swim, a song cycle that deals with the deeper themes of humanity like love, healing, and magic. Nelson and Morrison come from families of artists, creatives and healers and this gives a natural quality to these ideas that would flounder in lesser hands. The sound is acoustic guitars and double bass mixed with drums, harp, santour, and violin. Ethereal, bittersweet vocals float across the mix and complete the picture. Echoes of Joni Mitchell, Fleetwood Mac and Gillian Welch are detectable but the vibe is original and individual.\n\nFaeland\u2019s sound and mission pair up well together and create a beautiful vulnerability that is authentic and true. Songs like \u201cWe\u2019re Just A Love Song\u201d, \u201cAll My Swim\u201d and \u201cThe Wheel\u201d offer listeners a seductive realness that rises above all the pushed product out there and must be heard and experienced to be fully understood.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

During a residency at the prestigious MacDowell Colony, they continued experimenting and making art with the songs they found, discovering the many vibrating worlds within them. The pair\u2019s interest in experimental music and avant-rock is paramount in this new cycle of work. They continue to delve deeper into the works of pioneers such as Meredith Monk, Nick Cave, and Laurie Anderson, as well as drone musicians and avant composers who use field recordings in order to further unpack these old songs.\n\nSince forming six years ago, Anna & Elizabeth have released two acclaimed full-length albums\u2014Sun to Sun (2012) and Anna & Elizabeth (2015). They have performed at hundreds of venues worldwide, including National Sawdust (Brooklyn), Newport Folk Festival, NPR Music\u2019s Tiny Desk Concerts, Cambridge Folk Festival (UK) and Pickathon. On stage they marry the spartan simplicity of two voices in harmony with acoustic instruments, percussion, synth, pump organ, film projections, choreography, and crankies--illustrated, hand-cranked scrolls depicting songs and stories as they are performed.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

Some people don\u2019t take us seriously,\" Anstascia says. \"We\u2019re doing our best to show that our music speaks for itself.\u201d In 2015 they released their album \u2018Welcome to the Present\u2019 on Kompakt Records. The LPs journey of field recordings, traditional instruments and polyglot vocals results in a masterfully crafted, intoxicating soundscape unlike any other debut album out there.

Combining this with an interest in reggae (shown to him at an early age by his Jamaican mother) and rock (via his Irish father), LT\u2019s adventurous love of music and performing onstage grew throughout the years, culminating in the release of his first EP at age 17. He has since grown into a vibrant and compelling talent. LTtheMonk\u2019s 2015 debut album, Monk in London, described his career, relationship with his home city and journey to adulthood. His 2017 release The Dark Side of the Monk was an introspective and wide-ranging session rooted in California production aesthetics and informed by contemporary race politics.\nHaving moved from the UK megacity to Hamilton, Ontario in 2017, listeners might expect LT\u2019s latest outing Kinks, Drinks & Hip-Hop to reflect another leap in personal and artistic evolution. And they would not be disappointed. The album is as questioning as its predecessors, serving up an in-depth exploration of his romantic relationships, place in hip-hop and the music industry, and more discoveries of his persona.

While Ezra has played with an array of musicians over the years, his current line-up featuring Corinna Smith on fiddle, Alex Martin on drums, and Poche Ponce on bass has been creating a new buzz around the country, as evidenced by their mind numbing tour schedule, ballooning tickets sales, and opening features with The Wallflowers, Galactic, John Oates, The Wailers, Southside Johnny, Graham Parker, and America.\n\nNot believing in set lists, every AEG show provides new and unique concert experiences that the band has been recording in real time and sharing with fans on thumbs drives as part of their \"Live Sound Project\" every night. Go to any Adam Ezra show, solo or with the group, and you will not only find fans who have traveled vast distances to be there, but also doubtless a fair number of rabid followers accumulating as many AEG shows as possible throughout the year.\n\nThe fall of 2019 had AEG on more headlining tours supporting their 19th & 20th album releases and the latest in a series of enhanced, remixed, live albums, aptly named \"Better Than Bootleg Vol 3\"(Aug 24, 2019) and \"Better Than Bootleg Vol 4\" (Dec 27, 2019). The musicians who make up Adam Ezra Group are all believers in the power of real-time connection with their audience, explaining their non-stop touring schedule throughout the year.\n\nThe start of 2020 has Adam Ezra out on the road on his annual \"Get Folked Tour.\" This tour has Ezra spending the first two months of the year playing in a different living room every night.

The little kid with the big voice grew up listening to records from Ray Charles, Ronnie Dunn, and, of course, the greatest of them all: Frank Sinatra. His parents bought a guitar and a small sound system for Eldredge when he was a teen, and while he didn\u2019t immediately take to the instrument \u2013 \u201cI never could sit still long enough to learn it,\u201d he admits \u2013 the sound system and its wireless microphone became a cornerstone of his early musical training. By age 15, Eldredge was a performer in demand for local functions. \u201cI really grew to love the feel of the crowd,\u201d he says.\n\nEldredge says there was no question that his passion for performance would carry him to Nashville, but his move to Music City after college made one thing clear: He was going to have to pick up that abandoned guitar. \u201cI saw people on stage playing these songwriter nights, just them and a guitar,\u201d he says. So Eldredge locked himself in a room to practice, and eventually started writing songs of his own. \u201cIt took me a while to finally get a hold of the guitar, but once I did I was hooked,\u201d he says. \u201cI think being a student of singers works to my advantage, because it taught me how to phrase things. I had melodies all over the place in my head.\u201d\n\nHe has since moved on to writing with some of Nashville\u2019s greats, including the legendary \u201cWhispering\u201d Bill Anderson, who taught him that one of the tricks to being a great songwriter is to \u201cjust keep writing,\u201d Eldredge says. Two singles he\u2019s released so far certainly prove his range: His 2010 debut, \u201cRaymond,\u201d was inspired in part by Eldredge\u2019s own grandmother and her struggle with Alzheimer\u2019s. Current single \u201cDon\u2019t Ya\u201d hits the opposite end of the spectrum, an up-tempo flirtation that ponders the mystery of romantic relations, and showcases the sexy baritone in Eldredge\u2019s voice. And during his own high-energy live shows, just like that kid with the wireless mic, Eldredge goes out of his way to connect with every member of the crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s the place I feel more alive than anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything it takes to get to wherever I\u2019m going to play \u2013 every airplane and car I ride in \u2013 is so worth it once I\u2019m able to get up on that stage. I want everybody in the crowd to feel the energy that I\u2019m feeling from them.\u201d\n\nAs he continues to work hard at the craft of songwriting, there\u2019s no question his talent will grow along with his audience. \u201cYou can create something from nothing, and that\u2019s the coolest thing in the world to me,\u201d Eldredge says. \u201cThis new music is me, and it\u2019s taken every song I\u2019ve written up to this point to get to where I am. I feel better about my music now than I ever have felt, and I can\u2019t wait for people to hear it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Saturators ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7998586.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Dance, Electronic", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Saturators are a 2015-borne dance band featuring an eclectic mix of musicians based out of Brooklyn and Harlem.

For both fans and band members alike, an AEG concert is a rally to live life with intensity and soak in the moments we share with one another.\n\nHailing from Boston, AEG\u2019s unconventional approach to the music world has allowed them to surge beyond their beloved hometown and emerge as one of the most uniquely powerful, underground live music experiences in the country. While Ezra has played with an array of musicians over the years, his current line-up featuring Corinna Smith on fiddle, Alex Martin on drums, and Poche Ponce on bass has been creating a new buzz around the country, as evidenced by their mind numbing tour schedule, ballooning tickets sales, and opening features with The Wallflowers, Galactic, John Oates, The Wailers, Southside Johnny, Graham Parker, and America.\n\nNot believing in set lists, every AEG show provides new and unique concert experiences that the band has been recording in real time and sharing with fans on thumbs drives as part of their \"Live Sound Project\" every night. Go to any Adam Ezra show, solo or with the group, and you will not only find fans who have traveled vast distances to be there, but also doubtless a fair number of rabid followers accumulating as many AEG shows as possible throughout the year.\n\nThe fall of 2019 had AEG on more headlining tours supporting their 19th & 20th album releases and the latest in a series of enhanced, remixed, live albums, aptly named \"Better Than Bootleg Vol 3\"(Aug 24, 2019) and \"Better Than Bootleg Vol 4\" (Dec 27, 2019). The musicians who make up Adam Ezra Group are all believers in the power of real-time connection with their audience, explaining their non-stop touring schedule throughout the year.\n\nThe start of 2020 has Adam Ezra out on the road on his annual \"Get Folked Tour.\" This tour has Ezra spending the first two months of the year playing in a different living room every night.

The little kid with the big voice grew up listening to records from Ray Charles, Ronnie Dunn, and, of course, the greatest of them all: Frank Sinatra. His parents bought a guitar and a small sound system for Eldredge when he was a teen, and while he didn\u2019t immediately take to the instrument \u2013 \u201cI never could sit still long enough to learn it,\u201d he admits \u2013 the sound system and its wireless microphone became a cornerstone of his early musical training. By age 15, Eldredge was a performer in demand for local functions. \u201cI really grew to love the feel of the crowd,\u201d he says.\n\nEldredge says there was no question that his passion for performance would carry him to Nashville, but his move to Music City after college made one thing clear: He was going to have to pick up that abandoned guitar. \u201cI saw people on stage playing these songwriter nights, just them and a guitar,\u201d he says. So Eldredge locked himself in a room to practice, and eventually started writing songs of his own. \u201cIt took me a while to finally get a hold of the guitar, but once I did I was hooked,\u201d he says. \u201cI think being a student of singers works to my advantage, because it taught me how to phrase things. I had melodies all over the place in my head.\u201d\n\nHe has since moved on to writing with some of Nashville\u2019s greats, including the legendary \u201cWhispering\u201d Bill Anderson, who taught him that one of the tricks to being a great songwriter is to \u201cjust keep writing,\u201d Eldredge says. Two singles he\u2019s released so far certainly prove his range: His 2010 debut, \u201cRaymond,\u201d was inspired in part by Eldredge\u2019s own grandmother and her struggle with Alzheimer\u2019s. Current single \u201cDon\u2019t Ya\u201d hits the opposite end of the spectrum, an up-tempo flirtation that ponders the mystery of romantic relations, and showcases the sexy baritone in Eldredge\u2019s voice. And during his own high-energy live shows, just like that kid with the wireless mic, Eldredge goes out of his way to connect with every member of the crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s the place I feel more alive than anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything it takes to get to wherever I\u2019m going to play \u2013 every airplane and car I ride in \u2013 is so worth it once I\u2019m able to get up on that stage. I want everybody in the crowd to feel the energy that I\u2019m feeling from them.\u201d\n\nAs he continues to work hard at the craft of songwriting, there\u2019s no question his talent will grow along with his audience. \u201cYou can create something from nothing, and that\u2019s the coolest thing in the world to me,\u201d Eldredge says. \u201cThis new music is me, and it\u2019s taken every song I\u2019ve written up to this point to get to where I am. I feel better about my music now than I ever have felt, and I can\u2019t wait for people to hear it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Templeton Thompson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10375472.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "singer * songwriter * hippie chic cowgirl\n\nYou can find her songs on million-selling CD's from country superstars Reba\nMcEntire, Jo Dee Messina and Little Texas.

When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do. Having already established themselves both as melodic songwriters (2004\u2019s RIAA-Certified Gold record They\u2019re Only Chasing Safety) and as ambitious power merchants (2006\u2019s stentorian, gold-selling Define The Great Line and its majestic follow-up, 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound Of Separation), the evolution detailed on Erase Me finds them using the sonic dialects they\u2019ve crafted to reveal where they are now. Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems. Even with a comeback title seemingly marinating in self-fulfilling prophecy, nobody in their right mind would dare delete Under\u00f8ath\u2019s measurable contribution to the advancement of post-hardcore and heavy rock. The only thing you need to erase is your patience with their pretenders. Accept no substitutes and your culture won\u2019t feel destitute.

Combining Thomas\u2019s arranging ideas and skilled instrumental work with Andrija\u2019s studio full of vintage mics, tube amps, keyboards, and tape machines, the resulting record has a rich, buttery warmth well-suited to Miss Tess's voice and authentic, retro-contemporary songwriting style.\nAfter over a decade on the road, now making her home in Nashville \u2014 by way of Baltimore, Boston, and Brooklyn \u2014 Miss Tess has found a creative community that encourages and embraces wide artistic exploration and expression as much as she does.\n\n\u201cMiss Tess swings and swaggers, rooted in a retro groove that\u2019s equal parts blues, mid-century rock & roll and Booker T-worthy R&B.\u201d \u2013 Rolling Stone\n\n\u201cOld-time warmth, 21st-century sass.

After attending high school in South Texas, Stalling studied at Texas A&M - College Station, where he earned a masters degree in Food Science. He followed the corporate road from there and eventually landed in Dallas working in product development for Frito-Lay.\n\nDuring this time, Stalling discovered the Three Teardrops Tavern and Dallas community radio station KNON. These outlets exposed a musical heritage to which Stalling had been nearly oblivious. Inspired by artists like Townes Van Zandt, Robert Earl Keen, Guy Clark, Lyle Lovett, and Jerry Jeff Walker, Stalling started writing songs, recording albums, and eventually touring with a full band to back him. In June 2008, Stalling joined musical greats Kris Kristofferson, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, Selena, Guy Clark and many others when he received a star on the South Texas Music Walk of Fame in Corpus Christi.\n\nStalling's style is modern with a vintage feel. With Jeff Howe on drums and percussion, Glenn Wallace on nylon-string guitar and electric guitar, Heather Stalling on fiddle and harmony vocals, and Jason Steinsultz swapping between stand-up and electric bass, Stalling creates a dynamic live show that\u2019s smart, charming and as listenable as it is danceable. Stalling and troupe are equally at home on a huge concert stage in front of thousands or playing an acoustic set for a hundred. Attendance numbers at shows have continued to rise. \u201cI chalk it up to the strength of the songs and the strength of my band\u201d, comments Max.\n\nDespite playing the same circuit as many household names in Texas country, grouping Stalling with them would be premature. His unique voice and amusingly clever song lyrics pull him in a different direction - a direction most obviously evident in his newest record Banquet.\n\nStalling has put together an elite team for his newest studio project, Banquet, including recording heavyweight and Grammy winner Lloyd Maines. Maines has been instrumental in developing the sounds of some of the best artists in music and has worked with industry giants including the Dixie Chicks, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Bruce Robison. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the life that this record has,\u201d says Max. \u201cWe poured heart and soul into this project and I think people will be wowed by what this project contains\u201d\n\n\nBanquet was released in 2015. Previous projects include Home to You from 2010, Topaz City in 2007; One of the Ways, 2002; Wide Afternoon, 2000; Comfort In the Curves, 1997; and three live releases (Sell-Out, 2006; Live From The Granada CD/DVD 2009 and Live At The Mucky Duck - Portmanteau, 2019).

The music needed to exist, and it was as much an emotional exercise as a creative one.\n\u201cI think every other record that I've written, I wrote knowing that the songs would have an outlet,\u201d Costa says \u201cAnd for this one, I really didn\u2019t. It was just a process I was going through, clearing myself of these feelings and thoughts.\u201d\nThe songs were like Costa\u2019s letters to himself, with the honesty and intimacy of something that was not meant to be heard. \u201c I feel really close to them for that reason,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of my favorite writing is like that - Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s Dear Theo, or Steinbeck\u2019s A Life in Letters. Those are really revealing, because it\u2019s not intended as part of their body of work. There\u2019s something really special about that. But at the same time, I write songs and perform for a living. So it's hard to think these songs will never see the light of day.\u201d\nAnd now, of course, they have. Yellow Coat is a masterpiece of heartbreak from a preternatural tunesmith, its raw emotion channeled into gently swinging, hooky love songs, most of them awash in strings and mellotron and harmonies and groove. From the insinuating acoustic riffs and lo-fi beats of \u201cAvenal\u201d and the snappy fatalism of \u201cSlow\u201d to the almost church-like fragility of \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d Yellow Coat is equal parts lost \u201860s AM radio hits, folk-pop beauty and dark night of the soul music.\nAt the time that Costa started writing, he had stripped things down not only emotionally, but in terms of his surroundings. He had moved into a Laguna Beach studio - as in the size of his living quarters, not a recording complex - with just the bare minimum of furniture and instruments. Instead of a bedside table, a Wurlitzer Sideman drum machine.\nThe Wurlitzer eventually got used and sampled on \u201cAvenal,\u201d which Costa and his friend Chase Perkowski (Iris and the Shade) wrote on a going-nowhere road trip a few hundred miles northeast of L.A. \u201cI was in a searching headspace,\u201d Costa says. \u201cRunning away from something, trying to find something, trying to find myself. We stopped at a gas station overlooking highway 5. Chase was strumming a few chords as the gas was pumping, and I sat under a tree humming a melody and frantically writing down lyrics. By the time the car was fully fueled I asked him to play back the chords to me as I sang the song.\u201d Back on the road, the next sign said \u201cAVENAL: 2 Miles\u201d and Costa had both his opening track and song title.\nThe 37 year-old Costa has a lot of music and artistic growth under his belt, particularly in the last six years. He was 21 when he made his first EP, having immersed himself in music after a bad skateboard landing sidetracked what might have been a pro career. Coming out of that world, he had a punk side, but also became enamored of Scottish folk, and Brian Jones\u2019 guitar style in the Rolling Stones.\n\u201cOne of my first shows that I played was with a band that was all about things like At The Drive-In,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI went up there with my acoustic guitar and played like a Pixies song, and a Donovan song, and then an original of mine. And I remember thinking, What am I? Do I even belong here?\u201d But at no point did he ever think, \u201cOkay, I'm just going to be a guy with a guitar. I always heard bigger arrangements.\u201d\nHe began his career on Jack Johnson\u2019s Brushfire Records, where both his 2006 debut, Songs We Sing, and 2008\u2019s Unfamiliar Faces were produced by No Doubt\u2019s Tom Dumont. Costa produced 2010\u2019s Mobile Chateau himself, while 2013\u2019s self-titled effort brought him to Scotland, where producer Tony Doogan (Beck, Air) assembled a backing band drawn from the ranks of Belle and Sebastian. In 2013, he began a several year period of restless wandering, working on soundtracks such as the 2017 documentary Orange Sunshine and releasing short EPs experimenting with different aspects of his artistry. Then, in 2018 with Santa Rosa Fangs, he found a new home at Dangerbird. The record, a winding story about a family of characters in Northern California, was a rebirth of sorts and a second act to a long and storied career.\n\u201cI've always had freedom in making my records and songs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with Dangerbird, and the last records, they really trusted me to follow my instincts, which is a pretty special place to be.\u201d\nEven before writing \u201cAvenal,\u201d Costa had done a fair amount of home recording. Once an album seemed to be in the cards, the label suggested he connect with producer Alex Newport (At the Drive-In, Death Cab For Cutie, Bleached), as much because they would get along personally as creatively. They worked on three songs that were in varying states of completion, including \u201cLast Love Song\u201d (a simple home recording), \u201cSlow\u201d (a demo) and \u201cMake That Change\u201d (a bare-bones solo acoustic track that Costa and Newport fleshed out from start to finish). Then they kept on going.\nCosta plays a bit of everything on the record, but he also brought in touring drummer Cory Gash and one-woman string section Alexis Mahler (she plays both violin and cello). Costa and Mahler had previously done a lot of remote recording, but this time she came down to California for a week. \u201cWe worked up a bunch of arrangements together that lifted up a lot of the songs in a nice way,\u201d Costa says. \u201cI wanted to really pull up some of the emotional stuff with string and things\u201d (said \u2018things\u2019 being the mellotron, which can evoke so many different tones, as well as Costa\u2019s layered vocals).\nCosta had been playing \u201cSlow\u201d at solo shows before recording it, but it was first written around a rhythm track. With its snappy bass and doo-wop-inspired backing vocals, it feels like a song that could have been plucked from a Scorsese movie, except made in 2020. The sweeping, soulful \u201cJet Black Lake\u201d is equally cinematic, with Costa pushing his vocal range into falsetto.\nBut it\u2019s \u201cLet Love Heal\u201d and \u201cLast Love Song\u201d that are perhaps the heart of the record, bittersweet evocations of love\u2019s power to both soothe and devastate. When Costa first wrote what became \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d it had a different title, and was meant to be an anniversary gift. Instead, it turned into a break-up song, its sadness as palpable as the sound of Costa\u2019s fingers on guitar strings.\nLife does go on, however: the record ends with the last song Costa wrote for it, \u201cSo I Say Goodbye,\u201d which provides a sense of closure, its piano-driven tunefulness feeling both uplifting and melancholy. And since finishing Yellow Coat, Costa has written and released an even newer piece of music, \u201cHuman Kind of Song,\u201d which he lyrically crowd-sourced with fans on Instagram while sheltering in-place. Like every other songwriter, he doesn\u2019t know when he will next play live in front of people, so the experience provided some community. And while Yellow Coat may have started as an album about heartbreak, its sense of sadness, hope and perseverance also feels completely universal.\n\u201cEveryone's going through personal trials all the time,\u201d says Costa. \u201cAnd it can be isolating. But now everyone's going through something. And as difficult as that is, there's comfort in that too. Because we're all in it together, and we have been the whole time. Except now we can actually feel it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mega Ran ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8796843.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Hip-hop, Soul, Video Music, Chiptunes", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"Random's proven he can excel in storytelling, punchlines, poignancy, freestyling and, well, pretty much any other way you can measure an MC.\" - LA Weekly\n\nMega Ran, aka Raheem Jarbo of Philadelphia is arguably the world's most well known video-game influenced performance artist.

Combine that with Delta blues, compliments of a childhood spent in Cajun country, and you\u2019ve got one badass up-and-comer, with the pure musical talent and vocal chops to back him up. Already turning heads throughout Nashville, Baton Rouge and beyond, having been named one of the \u201cTop New Artists You Need To Know\u201d by Rolling Stone Country, CJ says the driving force behind his current success isn\u2019t fame nor fortune \u2013 it\u2019s just a diehard infatuation with the music he grew up on.\n\n\u201cI just want to write songs that say something that really means something. I want to ride around in a van, tour the country, and play songs with my buds. Everything I do in music, I want to do it for the love of the music and the sake of the song,\u201d he adds.\n\nIt all started back in Baton Rouge where his family\u2019s affinity for music struck a chord. \u201cMy grandparents loved country music. My dad was a big classic rock fan,\u201d he said. \u201cDad kept a guitar in a closet, and I dug it out when I was seven and started making noise of my own with it,\u201d Solar recalls. That so-called \u201cnoise\u201d would sharpen quickly, through lessons at the young age of eight, to enrollment at Nashville\u2019s Belmont University, to cuts on albums by Justin Moore and Jerrod Niemann, and, now, his own critically acclaimed solo EP that\u2019s turning heads, Hard One to Turn Down.\n\nAnd a Hard One To Turn Down, the EP is. Critics at The Daily Country write, \u201cSolar injects a hefty (and welcome) dose of Southern rock into his country, which melds perfectly with his gravelly vocals.\u201d Country Music Rocks was \u201cimmediately captivated by all five songs and hopes that [the EP] obtains the recognition it deserves.\u201d The Rowdy found it \u201cexactly what country fans are looking to savor.\u201d And The Shotgun Seat welcomes Hard One to Turn Down as \u201cthe perfect pairing of country storytelling and rocking rhythms, married by his dynamic vocals.\u201d And that\u2019s only the beginning.\n\nFlashback to Louisiana where CJ put a group together while in elementary school, recruiting his two brothers. They called themselves The Solar Heat, recollected by CJ as \u201cthe cheesiest band name of all time.\u201d But the band built up a solid local fan base, and helped CJ hone his writing and performance skills. However, CJ knew he needed to be in Nashville where he attended Belmont and landed an exclusive publishing agreement before he had even graduated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded some of my best songs in December of my senior year,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started interning at Sea Gayle Music in February, I played these and two other songs I hadn\u2019t recorded for Mike Owens (VP Creative at Sea Gayle). A week later I had a publishing deal. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not the way it happens with most interns. I\u2019m grateful for these opportunities, and I don\u2019t plan on taking them for granted.\u201d\n\nThe ink was still wet on Solar\u2019s degree when artists all over town started putting the new Nashville songwriter\u2019s self-penned songs on hold. \u201cBlue Bandana,\u201d which he\u2019d written in January, was chosen by Jerrod Niemann and released as a single. Then, Solar began writing with Bob DiPiero and other members of Nashville\u2019s songwriting elite.\n\nSolar tracked and produced Hard One To Turn Down, alongside Sea Gayle\u2019s Brent Anderson, (who\u2019s producing and songwriting credits include Chris Janson, Blake Shelton and others), with established country hit-maker Jerrod Niemann joining in on one song as guest vocalist. Its lead single, a paean to the powers of sipping on a \u201cTall Boy,\u201d dropped in mid-March and quickly garnered over 164,000 Spotify spins in its first month of release. The EP followed on April 15, in both digital and physical formats. In May, the music video for \u201cTall Boy,\u201d directed by Marcel Chagnon, premiered on CMT. Tour dates from coast to coast include his own headlining dates and opening slots for The Cadillac Three, Old Dominion, Hank Williams, Jr., and the list goes on.\n\nIf it\u2019s not obvious yet, Solar is on the fast track to success, with a solid team in Nashville to back him up. And he\u2019s not going to leave any stones left unturned. As important as songwriting is and will always be to Solar, he is excited to be stepping into the spotlight as an artist. CJ is a powerful vocalist with his Southern, gravelly edge and he has the guitar chops to match. His live show puts it all together and will knock you off your feet.\n\nYet the pensive, bolero-brimmed, too-wise-for-his-age 23-year-old is riding his momentum thoughtfully, with the long haul in mind. \u201cI\u2019d love to tour the country and have a handful of hit songs,\u201d he muses. \u201cBut I\u2019m totally cool with living pretty normally as long as I need to.

But the South Korea born, New Mexico raised performer hardly realized just how dynamically his skills on the instrument would mesh with his ultimate development as a rocker in the popular regional bands Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and now, his emergence as a powerful and emotional singer/songwriter in his own right. On his debut album These Illusions, Park plays violin and acoustic guitar in addition to reaching out to acoustic rock fans everywhere with his inimitable vocals. Because of the mostly personal nature of the songs, the compelling 11-track collection rolls like a fascinating chronology of the 27-year-old singer\u2019s life, beginning with tunes he wrote when he was an engineering student at New Mexico State in his now adopted hometown of Las Cruces. He was also building his catalog of songs as he played violin and contributed backing vocals for several years in two well known regional bands: the mostly cover band Live Bait and the \u201cscreamo\u201d metalcore/hardcore group Kiss To Betray. Playing in Live Bait, his violin came in very handy for those Dave Matthews songs and it helped him take songs like Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d to a transcendent level. Live Bait won the local college radio station KRUXFEST for \u201cBest New Alternative Band\u201d in 2005 and Kiss To Betray won the Las Cruces 2006 Battle of the Bands and later played at well known venues around the country like Headhunters in Austin, The Viper Room in L.A. and hotspots in Phoenix. As a solo artist, Park has since headlined regularly at local clubs like El Patio Bar and Hurricane Alley, the Albuquerque haunts the Launch Pad and Rally\u2019s Pub on 4th Street, and in Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix and even Colorado Springs. He recently posted two live performance videos on his myspace (myspace.com/danielparkmusic), one of which features his unique looping technique which allows him to play violin and guitar \u201csimultaneously\u201d on the same song. While Park enjoyed his time in Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and the notoriety he received as a featured performer, in some ways he felt he was always gearing up for his eventual breakthrough to the forefront as his own artist. In the months leading up to the breakup of Kiss To Betray, Park gathered his best material, entered what kiddingly refers to as \u201ca local ghetto studio\u201d and started to come to grips with These Illusions. While many of the tracks on the album have their roots in romantic relationships, the hypnotic and percussive, acoustic guitar driven title cut cuts to the core of his desire to find his own creative path in life\u2014even if it means going against the mainstream expectations of our society. Other songs tap slightly into his lifelong search for identity as an Asian born man adopted (along with two of his siblings) by a white American family. Other key tracks on These Illusions include the jangling, high energy \u201cTimes Have Changed,\u201d which laments the shift in life as his significant other chooses to move on. The graceful, easy strumming ballad \u201cWhat We Should Be\u201d is another heartbreaker about learning to accept the changes in a relationship when one person leaves to pursue his or her dreams\u2014while still celebrating the memories. Park spins a different perspective .., going even deeper and more introspective .. in Me,\u201d a song about a man who hits rock bottom and realizes his need to adjust his course. \"Daniel Park has distilled what it is to be a singer songwriter in the late oughts, and in doing this, has created a blueprint that every individual with an acoustic guitar and a microphone should follow for the next decade.\" - James @ NeuFutur.com www.danielparkmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ghastly ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9027199.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Doesnt Matter", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "sup im the ghost kid.", "otherInfo": "Twitch Live"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Crystal City ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9057931.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Sam Drella, Dave Helmer", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Crystal City is fronted by Dave Helmer and Sam Drella.

With his fingerstyle technique, his compositions defy categorization and blend various forms and styles, including folk, rock, jazz, blues, country, world and roots. Incorporating a textured sound all his own and sense of economy in phrasing, Ray is a soulful player who lets his instrument sing, wringing emotion from every note. In the end, it's all about conveying an emotion and taking the listener away.\n\nRay Montford\u2019s new and long-awaited seventh studio album, Share My Sky, is the acclaimed guitarist\u2019s first recording in six years. Exploring the themes of loss, grief, trauma, compassion, forgiveness and love, Montford has expanded his sonic range and compositional depth to offer his most personal and emotional statement to date. Collaborating with singer/songwriter Lynn Moffatt, he co-wrote Deliver Me, a song that embodies the universal feelings of loneliness and belonging, while specifically shining light on the fate of refugees who strive to land in a safe place - a topical theme in these troubled times. The strong presence of singers Sheena Turcotte and Anouk Michelle-Gr\u00e9goire on this recording (a first in Ray\u2019s career) lends tremendous poignancy to songs Alive and Let Your River Flow, while the album\u2019s profoundly reflective title track, composed upon his return from Bali, rates as one of the most evocative melodies the guitarist has ever written.\n\nBorn in Ottawa, Ray began learning by ear and woodshedding with the great rock records of that era. After studying audio engineering, production, and performance in the Music Industry Arts program at Fanshawe College and doing a term in the music program at Humber, he began writing and recording his own music, and by 1995 was dedicating most of his priorities in that discipline. Between 1994-'97, he was the guitar player for the Rankins and from 1997-'99, Mary Jane Lamond. His compositions have been heard on National CBC radio and have been licensed for various television series. For more than 20 years Ray and his rhythm section featuring some of Canada's best players, have played for audiences and loyal fans at music festivals, clubs, theatres, house concerts and private parties. They toured parts of Europe in 2001, shared the stage with the Tony Levin Band (alumnae of Peter Gabriel) in 2003 and sold out the Young Centre for the Performing Arts in Toronto for the release of A Fragile Balance in 2007. Recently, they played the Oakville Centre for the Performing Arts to a sold-out audience, the Oakville Jazz Festival (2010 & 2012), Markham Jazz Festival (2012), and the Canadian Guitar Festival (2009, 2011 & 2014).\n\nRay has gratefully received support from the Ontario Arts Council, Toronto Arts Council, Factor and External Affairs as well as sponsorship from Totem Acoustic and Paradigm for his compostions, recording and performances.

There, she found herself gravitating toward the sounds, stories, and swagger of country music, a genre that had been so prevalent back home. Formed in 2014, Honey County brought all three women together, kicking off a whirlwind career that has since found the group receiving praise from Rolling Stone; playing gigs alongside Lady Antebellum and Old Dominion; enjoying high-profile slots at CMA Fest and Stagecoach Festival; and receiving heavy airplay for independent singles like \"Love Someone\" (one of the most-played songs during the launch of Radio Disney Country),\" \"High on the Radio\", \"Los Angeles\", and \u201cCigarette\u201d.\n\nYou won't find Honey County on any map. Instead, the group takes its name from a fictional place, a move that allows the bandmates to create their own landscape of story-driven country, melodic pop, and punchy, guitar-fueled rock. It's a sound that leans heavily on the powerful blend of three voices, punctuated by songwriting chops that evoke both the sunny beauty of the band's California headquarters as well as the Bible Belt bounce of Nashville. With all three members trading vocal duties and sharing songwriting credits, Honey County sounds as sweet at its name.\n\nThe group has been busy, too. one of the only independent acts to play Stagecoach Festival and CMA Fest in 2017 and again in 2019, Honey County earned a thumbs up from Rolling Stone Country, who praised the band's songwriting and harmony-heavy live show.\n\nGenuine fans of the country music tradition, the members of Honey County have also paid tribute to their influences, creating covers of hit songs like Little Big Town's \"Girl Crush\" (whose video earned more than 129,000 views on YouTube), Garth Brooks' \"People Loving People\" (whose recording notched over half a million spins on Spotify), and Maren Morris' \"I Could Use a Love Song.\" Even so, they've created more of a stir with their own music. Produced by John Spiker and Maks Gabriel, Honey County's first summertime single, \"High On The Radio,\" became one of the first songs to receive airplay on SoCal Country radio station Radio Disney Country in mid-2017. Tapped as a trending music video on CMT.com, the song's accompanying video premiered on E! News, shining a light on three singers who were meant to perform together.\n\nReleased later that summer, \"Love Someone,\" also received heavy airplay on E! News, while also receiving nods from Apple Music's 'Cool Country' Playlist and the iTunes Country Music Hot Tracks. With more than 16,000 monthly listeners on Spotify and a new single \u2014 the dark, Fleetwood Mac-inspired \"Los Angeles\" \u2014 under the band's belt, Honey County carried their momentum into 2018, with more melody-heavy songs and cross-country shows on the horizon.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nina Baumer ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10368288.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Pop, R&b", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Chicago-born and Australian-raised, 22-year-old singer-songwriter Nina Baumer developed her love for music and songwriting from a young age.

But when the sun goes down, he straps on his signature Gretsch 6120, steps up to the mike and is transformed into REVEREND HORTON HEAT, a hellfire-spewing, rock and roll dare-demon.\n\nJim\u2019s tome is iconic: From recording with Lemmy Kilmister, being revered by country music legends like Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins, touring with Soundgarden, ZZ Top, The Cramps, Social Distortion, White Zombie and the Sex Pistols (a young Lydon was connected to Jim\u2019s original 1985 demo), to providing touring opps to upstarts Kyuss, Hank III, Marilyn Manson and countless others across decades on the road.\n\nHeath and longtime confidant and slap-bass general Jimbo Wallace have polished up their 12threlease, Whole New Life, which Heath calls \u201cthe most positive material I have ever written. It focuses heavily on rock and roll but there is a human interest parallel - songs about growing up poor, vices, marriage, having children and walking the rapturous streets of America.\u201d\n\nCall it a new twist on an old sound, Whole New Life was recorded between Fun Guy Studios and Modern Electric in the band\u2019s hometown of Dallas. The eleven track rumination features new sticksman Arjuna \u2018RJ\u2019 Contreras. The Texas based jazz pupil came to the bands attention from a friend\u2019s reference in the summer of 2017, and brought a whole new backbeat to the legendary rockabilly administration. After clicking with Contreras, Heath hired a new pianist in 2018, Matt Jordan, to flesh out the sound with the pomp and power of Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. \u201cI love playing with these guys, it truly is a whole new band, so the title fits perfectly.\u201d\n\nRecording the album, Heath recalled that \u201cBack in the 1950\u2019s, reverb chambers were really hip and I always loved their warmth. I\u2019m all about Sam Phillips and the things he did with tape machines and tape echo. I love that kind of production value, even if it is older than me! It really sent me to this whole other headspace where I worked with a lot of vintage gear on this album - some of which I built myself for a truly unique sound - ribbon, old tube microphones, pre-amps and stuff. Additionally, a year before I started piecing this together I worked especially hard on my singing voice. Whole New Life brought out something in me where I am screaming more and making more throaty sounds. It's got some Louisiana feel to it, a bit of gruff and some Roy Orbison style in it. We tested out new tracks on our most recent tour and they are working better with the audience than any new songs we premiered since the early days of the band.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis tour started around 1986,\u201d Heath chuckles dryly. REVEREND HORTON HEAT still performs nearly 200 shows annually, including their trademark Horton\u2019s Hayride Festival in Southern California, which has expanded to an end-of-the-year jamboree under the name Horton\u2019s Holiday Hayride. The band has also wowed sold-out crowds with their multi-city residencies across America, including performances at Coachella, Reading, Austin City Limits, Riot Fest and countless other festivals. The Texas troubadours also took a unique approach to the term \u2018Special Guests\u2019 on recent tours. Recalling the time the band opened for Jerry Lee Lewis, Heath had a vision, \u201cThe idea of playing in Jerry\u2019s backing band would have been pretty neat. So every once in a while we\u2019ll have a load of fun putting that aspect in our live set. In the middle of our set, we\u2019ll have a special guest come on stage for a mini-set where REVEREND HORTON HEAT is the backing band. The first time we did it was with Lemmy Kilmister. We stopped our set midway, the road crew dragged a Marshall amp on stage, wiped the Rickenbacker clean and out came Lem. He was adamant on playing deep cuts, but I fought tooth and nail with him to do \u2018Ace Of Spades.\u2019 I told him, \u2018Lemmy, we must do this song, we have to give the people want they want.\u2019 He took a drag of his smoke, looked me square in the eye, and said \u2018Never give them what they want, give them what they need!\u2019\u201d\n\nWith over 1 million albums sold and nearly 35 years in the game, Heath and company have been delivering blood-pressure inducing scriptures to millions of fans worldwide. Call it rock and roll, psychobilly or what have you, REVEREND HORTON HEAT is often considered an early architect of the latter genre (at least on this side of the Atlantic) and occupies a peculiar place in American musical terrain.\n\nWhole New Life was delivered November 30, 2018.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tony Lucca ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10131981.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Rock, Singer-songwriter", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tony Lucca is a Nashville-based singer/songwriter whose catalog of music runs the gamut from soul-infused pop to tear-jerker folk balladry.

The multi-million selling country icon is set to embark on a tour commemorating the 30th anniversary of his groundbreaking debut album Killin\u2019 Time, which all but altered the landscape of country music. Three decades later, Clint remains humble as ever about the massive influence he has had on the genre.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really feel like I was leading a change in country music,\u201d Clint remarks. \u201cIt just felt like big success to me. I would hear things like, \u2018So-and-so is going to record, and they\u2019re using their own band because you did.\u2019 Or, \u2018So-and-so wants to write more of their own songs, because you did.\u2019 But I don\u2019t feel like I changed anything, other than contributing my work to the big picture. It\u2019s hard to look at myself and see the impact I\u2019ve had. I do know that my songs have touched a lot of people.\u201d\n\nIf Black won\u2019t say it outright, his staggering career speaks for itself. His is one of the most storied careers in modern music. Black surged to superstardom as part of the fabled Class of '89, reaching #1 with five consecutive singles from his triple-platinum debut, Killin' Time. He followed that with the triple-platinum Put Yourself in My Shoes, and then a string of platinum and gold albums throughout the '90s. Perhaps most impressively, Clint wrote or co-wrote every one of his more than three dozen chart hits, including \"A Better Man,\" \"Where Are You Now,\" \"When My Ship Comes In,\" \"A Good Run of Bad Luck,\" \"Summer's Comin',\" \"Like the Rain\" and \"Nothin' But the Taillights,\" part of a catalog that produced 22 #1 singles and made him one of the most successful singer/songwriters of the modern era. Along the way, he\u2019s earned more than a dozen gold and platinum awards in the U.S. and Canada, landed nearly two dozen major awards and nominations, won a GRAMMY Award, countless Country Music Association, American Music Awards and Academy of Country Music Awards, as well as a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nRaised in the suburbs of Houston, Texas, Clint Black is the youngest of four brothers. He began performing with brother, Kevin at the family\u2019s backyard barbecues. After high school, he spent 10 years on the local nightclub circuit and in 1989, he led a movement of young talent that transformed country music leading into the \u201890s.\n\nIn 2004, he scaled the top of the charts by trading lines with Buffett, Alan Jackson, George Strait, Toby Keith and Kenny Chesney on the Hank Williams classic \u201cHey Good Looking.\u2019\u201d He contributed \u201cThe Great Mississippi Flood\" to the 2005 post-Katrina charity album Hurricane Relief: Come Together Now. He released albums in 2004, 2005 and 2007.\n\nHis interest in releasing new music waned when his record label closed its doors in 2008. He explains, \u201cI had interest from major companies to sign deals, but declined\u201d.\nClint Black has hardly been idle since then. He\u2019s written and produced songs for Hasbro\u2019s children\u2019s shows and in 2010 and 2012 starred in the films Flicka 2 and Flicka: Country Pride, the latter with his wife and daughter.\n\nIn 2013, the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain began marketing an album of Black\u2019s hits, which continues to sell strongly and in early 2015, he collaborated with Joe Nichols on a Superstar Duets NBC-TV special for the Academy of Country Music.\nIn 2015 released On Purpose, his first studio album of new material in nearly a decade. He dedicated the album to his father, who passed away in 2012.\n\n\u201cMy dad was a huge country fan and is the first reason I listen to country music. He is probably the reason I\u2019m a songwriter today. He was my introduction to \"who\u2019s behind the music\". I grew up wanting to be the writer behind the song. That really all started with him.\u201d\n2018 was a particularly busy year for the Class of \u201889 alum. Always finding ways to challenge himself creatively, Clint produced his first ever holiday musical, titled Looking For Christmas, which focuses on family, love, and the magic of Christmas. It\u2019s expected to tour in 2019.\n\n\u201cThis has been in the works for a while now and it was great to see the audience reaction. Working with James Sasser has been both a blessing and a learning experience and I believe that the story is relatable to many Americans, both young and old.\u201d\nNow, with the 30th anniversary of Killin\u2019 Time approaching, Clint has earned the right to sit back, and let his body of work speak for itself.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ryan Townsend Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9735440.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Folk, Rock, Folk Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Mixing folk rock songs with spirited guitars and textures, Ryan Townsend is a singer/songwriter creating unfettered acoustic driven compositions that share an alternative decadence and genuine intimacy.

Johnny started his career in the rough and tumble neighborhood blues joints on Chicago\u2019s West Side with Howlin\u2019 Wolf disciple Tail Dragger, and went on to tour and record with blues legends such as Pinetop Perkins, Sam Lay and Billy Boy Arnold. He\u2019s been praised by the Cascade Blues Association for his \u201cstunning guitar playing\u2013 the pure Chicago styled sound\u201d, and his fans love Johnny\u2019s take on the intense, stripped-down \u201cWest Side sound\u201d of Otis Rush, Magic Sam and Buddy Guy. Johnny is a Delmark and Vizztone recording artist with 9 CDs to his credit. He was nominated for a BMA for Best Traditional Blues CD of 2017 for \u201cHowlin\u2019 at Greaseland\u201d, a Howlin\u2019 Wolf tribute.\n\nJohnny Burgin grew up in Starkville MS and Greenville SC, and while he was still in high school, he got to see many touring blues bands such as Guitar Jr, Gatemouth Brown and Eddie Clearwater. His father was an actor and folk musician and taught him the basics on guitar. He went to University of Chicago with the intention of becoming a writer, but a different path unfolded and he fell headfirst into the Chicago blues scene. Things started happening fast after Johnny (at that time featuring guest vocalist Jimmy Burns) took a Monday night residency at the Smoke Daddy in Chicago\u2019s Wicker Park neighborhood. They soon became a strong draw, and the atmosphere they generated was so electric that Bob Koester of Delmark Records offered them a contract after hearing just one set.\n\nSince those days, Johnny played the Chicago blues festival many times, toured Europe regularly, and has headlined festivals all over the US. Over the years, he has developed from a blues guitar slinger and local blues hero into a fully fledged singer, harmonica player, a dynamic and engaging bandleader, and a mature, seasoned guitarist. One look at Johnny\u2019s tour schedule confirms his status as an in-demand blues performer. He puts on the kind of satisfying and exciting show that only years of touring can develop. Elmore magazine remarked on Johnny\u2019s \u201ccommanding vocals and stinging guitar\u201d, but Elvin Bishop may have said it best: \u201chis guitar style is raw and rude and real\u2014on the vocal side, a nice original style\u2013he\u2019s damn good!\u201d\nFor more info, please see www.johnnyburgin.com.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ T3D MORRI5 ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9923967.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "DJ T3D jumped into the Las Vegas club scene in 2009 after playing in Washington.

The accomplished singer/songwriter/producer/multi-instrumentalist\u2014a true quadruple threat\u2014released her impactful and emotional debut album Symptoms last year, and it's only the beginning of her journey with a new single and more new music on the way.\n\nBorn and raised in Hawaii, the Los Angeles-based Crowe was practically brought into the world with music in her life: she started playing violin at the young age of three years old, and her father was a concert pianist alongside his career as an astronomer. \"My parents were very musical\u2014they met performing theater together,\" she explains. \"Music was a huge part of our family and my upbringing.\"\n\nAfter teaching herself how to sing while listening to Broadway musical recordings, Crowe eventually got accustomed to performing locally and accrued the confidence and motivation to try her hand at songwriting and music production, with formative influences that included Jewel and Alanis Morrissette. \"They had strong, empowering lyrics,\" she states. \"Jewel had this beautiful voice\u2014all she had to do is grab a guitar and tell her stories. That was mesmerizing to me. Alanis was all about raw, unapologetic emotion and power, and her lyrics were very dynamic while still retaining introspection.\"\n\nIn 2018, Crowe won the John Lennon Songwriting Contest for her song \"Breaking Things,\" which was co-written and co-produced with her partner and first songwriting collaborator Josh Anderson; a year later, she released her debut album Symptoms, the result of two and a half years of work with Anderson in Los Angeles on songs she'd originally written in her bedroom. \"It was my first chapter as a writer, producer, and artist,\" she states while discussing the album's origins. \"It was such a journey to have people around me and a team who could help guide me in this city.\"\n\nA deeply felt and expressive pop album, Symptoms was inspired by Lady Gaga's own approach to production and songwriting: \"She's a powerhouse performer. A lot of my production is inspired by her, along with songwriters like Sia and Taylor Swift\u2014strong women that are powerful, dynamic, and cathartic above all else.\"\n\nSymptoms' title track\u2014as well as the album as a whole\u2014draws from an abusive experience that took place before moving to the West Coast. \"After I went through that experience, my body went into shock and I started experiencing panic attacks and anxiety,\" she recalls. \"It was about telling myself that everything was going to be okay\u2014and a musical diary that revealed the ways I was coping with what I'd been through.\"\n\nThe transformative \u201cChess Game,\u201d co-written by Kailey Shaffer, zeroes in on the struggles that young women in the music industry often face, as well as how to transcend and evolve amidst such struggles. As young women in our industry, we felt like we were tired of playing everyone else\u2019s games,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe were inspired to write something uplifting\u2014an infectiously driven and empowering anthem in the face of adversity. The symbolism of the lyrics represents transformation, realizing your inner strength and having the courage to take back and own your true power.\u201d The song was an anthem and debuted in the Billboard Dance Charts.\n\n\"Each song is a different piece of a puzzle\u2014a symptom of who I am,\" Crowe continues. \"I took my traumatic experiences and turned them into these fun pop songs to help me get through what I've experienced.\" The latest single from Symptoms, \"Sky Is Falling,\" is particularly close to Crowe's heart; the epic, wide-open ballad finds her drawing from the pain and perseverance of her father's passing. \"It's my most personal song\u2014it encompasses all the things at the core of what I've gone through,\" she explains. I never had the chance to get any closure with him about what had happened to me, and I never got to say goodbye. All my anxiety turned into depression when he died. Because he studied the stars, the title itself is a double meaning. My world was crashing down around me, but I also wanted to make sure the song was uplifting and hopeful.\"\n\nThe accompanying music video for the single is next up, and in Crowe's words, the space-themed clip focuses on \"Finding a connection with that feeling after you experience loss\u2014with that person who may not even be there in the physical form anymore.\" What's next? More new music, starting with a duet with frequent collaborator Nick Mair, \"Can't Find Love\"\u2014as well as continuing to live through the highs and lows of existing, and helping her listeners do the same. \"A lot of things are hard to talk about that we go through, but we can all laugh and cry about it,\" she states. \"It's about letting yourself feel those emotions and coming out stronger from it\u2014feeling more self-assured about who you are.\"", "otherInfo": "NEW SHOW!\n\nWednesday May 13\n\nWe Found New Music's Livestream Series\n\nTune in at 7 PM @WFNM on Instagram\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/wfnm"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Valley Maker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8797401.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie Folk, Folk, Indie Rock", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "http://store.bricklanerecords.com/products/557119-when-i-was-a-child www.valleymaker.com www.twitter.com/valleymaker www.instagram.com/valleymakermusic", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/audiotree"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jameson Rodgers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9914459.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"You kind of know if it's your song or not, after you write it,\" says singer-songwriter Jameson Rodgers, explaining the strange, mystical process by which new tunes are brought into the world and find their intended performer. It's the same kind of self-assurance the soft-spoken Rodgers displays on his second independently released EP, available January 19th. Produced by Mickey Jack Cones (Dustin Lynch, Joe Nichols) and Chris Farren, the five-song collection showcases him as both a talented writer and interpreter, merging the electrified rock he heard on the baseball diamond with the thoughtful lyricism of country. Well before he was singing for his supper, the Batesville, Mississippi native was an accomplished baseball player who was a scholarship athlete at Northwest Mississippi Community College. Raised in the midst of country's '90s commercial heyday \u2013 his first concert was Garth Brooks at the Pyramid in Memphis \u2013 Rodgers always had an inkling that he might end up living in Music City, he just didn't know how or when. \"I can remember in high school I would tell people \u2013 this was before I played guitar or anything \u2013 I would just be like, 'Yeah, I'm gonna move to Nashville one day,'\" he recalls. And so he did, departing Mississippi with one of his college buddies to see if he could make it in Music City. Through the countless open mic nights and lean years that inevitably followed, Rodgers was able to develop the songwriting voice that would eventually earn his first publishing deal with Combustion Music. \"I went into songwriting boot camp,\" he says. \"That's all I did. I hardly played any shows or anything. I just focused on writing.\" In the meantime, Rodgers scored his first cut on Florida Georgia Line's Dig Your Roots, with \"Wish You Were on It.\" He also released his self-titled EP, featuring the streaming hit \"Midnight Daydream.\" All that intense focus shows on his second self titled EP. Opening track \"Ain't Really Over\" depicts a man in the hangover stage of a rough breakup and trying to move on. Framed by surging, distorted electric guitars and Rodgers' bluesy howl, it sets the tone for his melody-rich, introspective style of songwriting. On \"Cold Case,\" Rodgers draws a line between himself and country's long tradition of clever wordplay. Bouncing off the title's suggestion of criminal investigations, he's popping tops and pining over a woman who's up and vanished from his life. His solution? Downing as many beers as he can handle. \"'Cold Case' was just one of those things \u2013 somebody started playing a guitar and one of us just spit it out,\" says Rodgers. \"It kind of fell out of thin air.\" Rodgers' clear sense of his artistic identity also shines through on the outside songs \"Like You've Been There Before\" and \"Some Girls.\" It's easy to envision Rodgers singing about a younger version of himself in \"Like You've Been There Before,\" a rebellious kid getting some sage advice from his father to play it cool whether he's knocking a fastball over the fences or cautiously taking his first trip around the bases with a young woman. He sings it with the easy confidence of a seasoned vet, or as he says in the chorus, \"like it ain't no thing.\" \"Some Girls,\" on the other hand, calls back to \"Ain't Really Over\" except this time he's ended things and she's not handling it well \u2013 talking behind his back and playing childish games on social media. \"Some girls make it easy on you,\" he sighs, \"and some girls never do.\" The female woes reach their apex in the Rodgers co-write \"Missing One,\" which flips the title phrase on its head. Initially it's a missing copy of the Eagles' Desperado that she took when she left, then a single smoke from a pack of cigarettes that she forced him to give up. But it turns out he's actually missing something else most of all. Rodgers wrote the tune with pals Smith Ahnquist and Hunter Phelps, taking months to get it right. \"We started it in January and we didn't finish it until May,\" he says. \"We knew it was gonna be a clever idea, but we had to get it right. It was a hard one, but a fun one.\" That dedication, coupled with Rodgers' finely-tuned ear for songs, makes him perfectly suited to lean forward into Nashville's ever-shifting winds while honoring his roots. \"I want to be known as the dude with good songs,\" he says. \"If a song gives you chill bumps or if it makes you cry or if it makes you happy, it's done its job.\" That may sound like a relatively humble mission for a performer with such promise, but hey, sometimes you just know.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "AUGUST MANLEY ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10159064.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Groovy Judy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10322404.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Pop, Funk, Rock, R&b/soul, Rnb-soul", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Groovy Judy puts a new face on the late 60\u2019s, early 70\u2019s sound that made the Bay Area what it is.

As the Pacific Northwest\u2019s most renowned musical artist, Tom Grant\u2019s career achievements reflect his unique ability to embrace the full spectrum of contemporary music. Born to show business parents, Tom was at home with many musical instruments, but always returned to the piano. At a tender age, he was taught to play piano and drums by his tap dancer father. Later, he learned about music styles listening to music at his father\u2019s record store in Portland, Oregon. His brother, an avant-garde jazz pianist, introduced him to the many different facets of jazz music.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Oregon and a short stint as a high school teacher, Tom answered his musical calling. Native American saxophonist Jim Pepper took Tom to New York in 1970 to record the chant classic Witchi-tai-to. After that, he toured and recorded with such jazz greats as Woody Shaw, Joe Henderson, Charles Lloyd and Tony Williams. Since 1983, Tom\u2019s records have repeatedly topped the Smooth Jazz charts. Several, including the popular Mango Tango, Night Charade, In My Wildest Dreams, and The View from Here, enjoyed lengthy stays at Number One. Tom\u2019s music has been a staple of terrestrial and internet radio both in the U.S. and around the world. His compositions are also used in TV and Films worldwide.

It only took eight years of waiting for one of the most unique artists to finally deliver a new dose of contemporary electro pyrotechnics and a worthy successor to the smashing Total. During those eight years, SebastiAn successfully completed a 360\u00b0 turn. Plus, it\u2019s been eight years of putting his talent to the good use of others (Frank Ocean, Philippe Katerine, Charlotte Gainsbourg) to help him get to where he wants to be today. From European electro to American R&B via classic pop, Thirst sets ablaze all genres. His taste for explosive mechanisms (like his well-known \u201cturbine\u201d techno sub-genre label-mates at Ed Banger) made Total an elegantly revolutionary debut album that captivatingly took things to the extreme, while being as frightening as a ticking bomb. But now, the wait is over. Thirst bursts forward providing an amazing opening to brand new worlds. This 14-track adventure narrates the journey of how he mastered machines, his own demons and even several time zones.\n\n\u201cThe general approach to this record corresponds to the time when Frank Ocean called me in Paris, telling me I had to be in Los Angeles the next day to work alongside him,\u201d reveals SebastiAn. \u201cAt the same time, I\u2019d met Charlotte Gainsbourg to produce her latest album. So I found myself working with these two opposing personalities: on one side you\u2019ve got Frank Ocean, who\u2019s ultra charismatic and fanciful, while on the other, Charlotte Gainsbourg is both an introvert yet so openly real. When Charlotte moved to New York, Frank landed in London, and so the work process suddenly switched. I found this really interesting. My record came about from all the encounters I made going between these two projects.\u201d The energy from such contrasts brought this project to life, provoking SebastiAn to call upon an impressive list of artists to feature on Thirst (Syd from The Internet, Mayer Hawthorne, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Allan Kingdom, Sevdaliza, Cautious Clay, Sunni Col\u00f2n, Sparks, Gallant and Loota). \u201cFrom Ed Banger to Jean-Louis Costes and Katerine, or Frank Ocean to Charlotte Gainsbourg, my music has always looked to build bridges,\u201d outlines the self-confessed fan of DJ Premier, Giorgio Moroder and Suicide, who\u2019s managed to bring different styles together as one on this record. From this head-on collision between cold European techno and the warm tones of R&B, hip-hop and American gospel comes a series of explosions which progressively topple towards unchartered territories. With a certain Slavic melancholy that\u2019s an homage to his roots, SebastiAn makes the single Beograd evolve from metronomic dirty disco to a melody of cinematographic stature worthy of De Roubaix, entangled in a Chopin-esque lamenting sonata. The art of SebastiAn is certainly the art of suspense. He\u2019s like a tightrope walker, juggling a balancing act from the intimate to the epic (just take Run For Me which is a tour de force), and from minimalism to baroque to create a mystical form of electronic music. Thirst has such a contemporary edge to it, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s not aiming for a total collision between music\u2019s major current trends (electro and R&B), but in fact he\u2019s looking to rearrange the rules, settling alight the history of pop (The Beach Boys-eque Better Now) and rock (Handcuffed To A Parking Meter reaching dizzying heights with his idols Sparks), and a certain classicism in a recurring dialogue between strings, piano and knob-twiddling machines.\n\nIn 2011, for the cover work for Total, Jean-Baptiste Mondino captured SebastiAn as a modern-day Narcissus, photographing the musician kissing his alter ego. Eight years later, the same photographer once again depicts the artist with his double, however this time the love affair has ended and it\u2019s fists up ready for a fight. To sum up this game of metaphors, Thirst is a beefed-up declaration of love - not of SebastiAn to himself, but to the world around him. Thirst leaves you thirsty for more.", "otherInfo": "Meditate with Stuart"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SK Shlomo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10359656.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Electronic, Beatbox", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "After collaborating with Ed Sheeran, Bjork and Damon Albarn, award winning singer-songwriter, beatboxer, producer & live looping technologist SK Shlomo's acclaimed debut solo album 'Surrender' is out now raising #MentalHealthAwareness: http://skshlomo.com/listen", "otherInfo": "This Thursday, and for the next 6 Thursdays at 2pm BST, I'm launching a weekly livestream called Homeskool Beatbox Adventures to help isolated families and raise funds for NHS Charities Together.\n\nWe're partnering with 80 music venues to simulcast the livestream to thousands of homes worldwide, with weekly special guests including Basement Jaxx, Bastille, Bill Bailey, Jason Mraz, KT Tunstall and Radio 1\u2019s Dr Radha helping me to raise a target of \u00a32500 to help frontline staff, patients and families affected by COVID19.\n\nThe show will be livestreamed on our brand new beatboxadventures.com website, on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nAnd you can be part of the show!\n\nEach week I am inviting a virtual studio audience of up to 50 lucky families to join me in our digital theatre - also known as the \u2018Zoom Room\u2019.

It also has the media capitol of the world sitting right there in the middle.

From there, what started as a one off project, blossomed to include some of the most deft players in Southern California. The musicians who added their signature sounds to those initial recordings have since become permanent and integral members of what is now The Alpine Camp.\n\nThe Alpine Camp has spread their mountain tinged roots rock far and wide since 2014. Since then they have performed at Earth Jam, the California Oysterfest, OC Music Fest and shared the stage with Atlas Genius, The Brothers Comatose, Midnight North, The Motet and Ghost Light amongst many others.\n\nThe Alpine Camp seems to think traditional roots instrumentation and exploratory rock can coexist and so do their fans.

They also incorporate symphonic elements into their sound. The past years, their melodies have taken much more melancholic turn and the sound is overall much darker.\n\nBiography\nInsomnium began to take shape during the bleak spring of 1997. In a quiet town of Joensuu, located in the easternmost part of Finland, four young men were forming a fierce metal band. From the beginning it was clear that this band would make music that was brutal and yet melodic, full of contrasts and changing atmospheres. They took what they regarded as the best aspects of their favourite bands and moulded these influences into a new kind of entity. The result was the marriage of melodic Scandinavian death metal and traditional Finnish tunes. Lyrics turned out to be sorrowful, dream-like tales of love and death that usually took place amidst the Finnish nature. Influences were taken from the Finnish folklore as well as the world literature.\n\nAfter two years of intensive training Insomnium made their first demo-cd, which received praises from all over the world. The second demo was made the following year and it gained a lot of attention as well. This time, record companies got interested, too. In the beginning of 2001 founding members, guitarist Ville Friman, drummer Markus Hirvonen and bassist/vocalist Niilo Sev\u00e4nen, attached a new guitarist, Ville V\u00e4nni to the band. Now Insomnium was stronger than ever and ready to rise to the next level. A deal with Candlelight was signed the same spring and recording of the first album began in the summer.\n\n- In the Halls of Awaiting - was released in April 2002 and it introduced a band that had evolved in many ways. The legacy of Scandinavian death metal was still the core of the music but new layers had appeared around it. There were more nuances and depth in the songs, and the music was more versatile and challenging than before. Progressive shades had crept into the songs, and in many ways the band had stepped aside from the mainstream of melodic death metal. Debut album received excellent reviews in many magazines around the globe, especially in Germany, Finland and North America. The recording of the second album began in summer 2003. The process was somewhat painful but finally in December the new album was ready. - Since the Day It All Came Down - continues the development that the first album began. Songs are more versatile and surprising, progressive influences are ever clearer. Some tracks may even be described as experimental. But the straightforward side of the music hasn\u00b4t gone anywhere, since catchy guitar-harmonies, crushing riffs and soothing acoustic interludes are all still there. Melodies are still the most essential element in the music of Insomnium, but this time the tunes are even more melancholic and wistful than on the debut album. This is a sad and dreary album, heavier and gloomier than the first one, and undoubtedly more challenging. So when you take this path, keep in mind that it takes a while before your eyes get used to the dark...\n\n..And darker it got. With their third release, - Above The Weeping World -, the music got more agressive, harder, louder and the progressive elements grew once again. The first European tour is over, and Insomnium is once again a step closer to world domination.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.insomnium.net", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jade Helliwell ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8798778.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Country, Pop", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jade Helliwell is a singer / songwriter from West Yorkshire.

They also incorporate symphonic elements into their sound. The past years, their melodies have taken much more melancholic turn and the sound is overall much darker.\n\nBiography\nInsomnium began to take shape during the bleak spring of 1997. In a quiet town of Joensuu, located in the easternmost part of Finland, four young men were forming a fierce metal band. From the beginning it was clear that this band would make music that was brutal and yet melodic, full of contrasts and changing atmospheres. They took what they regarded as the best aspects of their favourite bands and moulded these influences into a new kind of entity. The result was the marriage of melodic Scandinavian death metal and traditional Finnish tunes. Lyrics turned out to be sorrowful, dream-like tales of love and death that usually took place amidst the Finnish nature. Influences were taken from the Finnish folklore as well as the world literature.\n\nAfter two years of intensive training Insomnium made their first demo-cd, which received praises from all over the world. The second demo was made the following year and it gained a lot of attention as well. This time, record companies got interested, too. In the beginning of 2001 founding members, guitarist Ville Friman, drummer Markus Hirvonen and bassist/vocalist Niilo Sev\u00e4nen, attached a new guitarist, Ville V\u00e4nni to the band. Now Insomnium was stronger than ever and ready to rise to the next level. A deal with Candlelight was signed the same spring and recording of the first album began in the summer.\n\n- In the Halls of Awaiting - was released in April 2002 and it introduced a band that had evolved in many ways. The legacy of Scandinavian death metal was still the core of the music but new layers had appeared around it. There were more nuances and depth in the songs, and the music was more versatile and challenging than before. Progressive shades had crept into the songs, and in many ways the band had stepped aside from the mainstream of melodic death metal. Debut album received excellent reviews in many magazines around the globe, especially in Germany, Finland and North America. The recording of the second album began in summer 2003. The process was somewhat painful but finally in December the new album was ready. - Since the Day It All Came Down - continues the development that the first album began. Songs are more versatile and surprising, progressive influences are ever clearer. Some tracks may even be described as experimental. But the straightforward side of the music hasn\u00b4t gone anywhere, since catchy guitar-harmonies, crushing riffs and soothing acoustic interludes are all still there. Melodies are still the most essential element in the music of Insomnium, but this time the tunes are even more melancholic and wistful than on the debut album. This is a sad and dreary album, heavier and gloomier than the first one, and undoubtedly more challenging. So when you take this path, keep in mind that it takes a while before your eyes get used to the dark...\n\n..And darker it got. With their third release, - Above The Weeping World -, the music got more agressive, harder, louder and the progressive elements grew once again. The first European tour is over, and Insomnium is once again a step closer to world domination.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.insomnium.net", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "9Bach ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10349887.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Folk", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "9Bach Formed in 2005 thanks to a chance meeting between Lisa (also known for her work with Gruff Rhys and Public Service Broadcasting) and Martin (Pusherman)\n\n9Bach made their name by taking traditional Welsh Folk songs and recasting them onto a spectral and haunting sound canvas.

Their live shows showcase the band\u2019s improvisational prowess and run the gambit from ethereal soundscapes to balls to the wall shredding all framed within the context of the great American songbook.\n\nThe band is supporting their latest release Hybrid, a collection of originals along with live performances showcasing the band\u2019s aptitude for improvisation. \u201cWith Hybrid they get the best of both worlds,\u201d said Chris Bell \u201cit\u2019s as close as you can get to our live show.\u201d\n\nThe band started as a way for Bell and songwriting partner Charles Etienne to continue their lifelong musical partnership. Bell had traveled to Nashville and fallen back in love with country, bluegrass and songwriting in general. When that love turned into melodies, Etienne was there to foster those ideas into finished songs. From there, what started as a one off project, blossomed to include some of the most deft players in Southern California. The musicians who added their signature sounds to those initial recordings have since become permanent and integral members of what is now The Alpine Camp.\n\nThe Alpine Camp has spread their mountain tinged roots rock far and wide since 2014. Since then they have performed at Earth Jam, the California Oysterfest, OC Music Fest and shared the stage with Atlas Genius, The Brothers Comatose, Midnight North, The Motet and Ghost Light amongst many others.\n\nThe Alpine Camp seems to think traditional roots instrumentation and exploratory rock can coexist and so do their fans. Since you can ski and go to the beach in the same day in Southern California, maybe they\u2019re right...", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Graham Reynolds ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7505072.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Ambient, Other", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Called \u201cthe quintessential modern composer\u201d by the London Independent, Austin-based composer/bandleader Graham Reynolds creates, performs and records music for film, theater, dance, rock clubs and concert halls with collaborators ranging from Richard Linklater and Jack Black to DJ Spooky and Ballet Austin.

Formed by Denis \"Piggy\" D'Amour, Michel \"Away\" Langevin and Jean-Yves \"Blacky\" Theriault, the fledging group soon found the perfect singer in Denis \"Snake\" Belanger. A blend of thrash with some progressive rock thrown in, and lyrics leaning heavily on sci-fi imagery. One of the first Canadian punk and thrash bands to enjoy success outside of Canada, they released four albums in the mid '80s before being signed to a major label. War And Pain in 1984, Rrroooaaarrr! in 1986, Killing Technology in 1987, and Dimension Hatross in 1988. Their blend of thrash and progressive rock caught the ear of MCA Records, who signed them and released their next album, Nothingface in 1989. The video of their Pink Floyd cover, Astronomy Domine, got tons of MTV airplay. They would headline a club tour with bands like Soundgarden and Faith No More, relative unknowns at the time, opening for them.\n\nThings started slowly sliding downhill for them after, their next album being poorly received, 1991's Angel Rat. 'grunge' was taking hold, with bands such as their former opening act, Soundgarden, enjoying a rise to stardom. Blacky left the band quickly after Angel Rat's release. 1993 saw the release of The Outer Limits album. Following the subsequent tour, Snake quit Voivod. The former Liquid Indian man, Eric \"E-Force\" Forrest replaced Blacky and Snake in one fell swoop on bass and lead vocals, and would stay with the band for two albums, 1995's Negatron and 1997's Phobos. 2000 saw an EP (Kronik) and live album (Lives), and in 2001 a car accident invalidated E-Force with a broken back. The group was put on hiatus, until eventually the decision was made to reform the band with Snake. Voivod fan Jason Newsted, fresh from Metallica, filled the vacant bass slot. This version of the band would go on to release 2003's self-titled album, Voivod.\n\nGuitarist Denis \"Piggy\" D'Amour sadly died on 25th August 2005 from colon cancer aged 45. After his diagnosis he spent the last 2 months of his life recording ideas & guitar parts for several albums worth of new songs. After his death the rest of the band completed work on Voivod's 14th album, Katorz, released in July 2006.\n\nIn addition to Jason Newsted, they had a few other well-known fans, including Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt of Opeth, Nocturno Culto of Darkthrone and Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters fame. Dave Grohl was such a big fan while growing up that he would even invite their singer, Snake, to join him for a track on his Probot side project, on which he worked with several singers from rock/thrash/death metal bands he really enjoyed in his younger days.

A band that truly walks it's own path proudly and shows some new exciting sides on identifiable character. A band of many directions and styles, some of them clearly visible while others were more unseen - namely working and keeping it all together under the moniker of melodic life-and-death metal and bastardizing it with various influences. Adult oriented death metal that it is!\n\n\"THE DEMOS\"\n\nDuring the first spring rays of 1996 a thing called OMNIUM GATHERUM took its first steps and shapes in a gloomy and oily cellar in the south-eastern harbour town of Kotka in Finland. Omnipotent young fellas Markus Vanhala and Olli Lappalainen (who's still a part of the band as an art designer & have made all the OG artworks since the very first demo) were extremely influenced by the rapidly ascending wave of scandinavian melodic death metal and the polar alliance between brutal death metal spiced with the despairing Finnish melancholy. The result of intensive training was seen as a four demos; \"Forbidden Decay\" '97, \"OG-ep\"'98, \"Gardens, Temples...This Hell!\" '99 & \"Wastrel\" '01, that built up a quality cult following in the underground scene and set standards for the up-coming.\n\n\"STEAL THE LIGHT\" 2002\n\nAfter the highly acclaimed \"Wastrel\" demo the band signed a deal with the growing UK metal label Rage Of Achilles and were sent right away to the Sonic Pump studio in Helsinki with Nino Laurenne to re-record their latest demo as debut EP entitled \"Steal The Light\" during the last days of 2001. The debut EP was released after a long, long wait in September 2002 and both the critics and the audience seemed to like the stuff and the metal medias awakened for the new Finns.\n\n\"SPIRITS AND AUGUST LIGHT\" 2003\n\nThe debut full-length album \"Spirits And August Light\" was released in April 2003 via Rage Of Achilles and gave the band some well deserved attention within the underground metal community and the press. The album showed another side to the light: despite the clear and catchy melodies and the stable rhythm all along the way it had a lifelike taste of dirtiness to it, with desperate love and uninvited hate searching for an outlet, like something you didn't want to see happen but it did nonetheless. The reviews were unbelievably great, for example being the only Finnish band then so far with a debut review of 5/5 in Kerrang! and all the major metal magazines followed in the same vein. So far, so good... so what!\n\n\"YEARS IN WASTE\" 2004\n\nNext in line to be was the band signing to a metal giant label\nNuclear Blast in the autumn of 2004 to release the second album \"Years In Waste\", as also re-issues from the \"Steal The Light/Spirits And August Light\" via NB. More technical, more progressive and\nsophisticated, thus naturally more difficult also, while at the same\ntime keeping distance to the listener. The new recipe was completed\nwith themes from the wasted youth and the verses of fall. \"YIW\" showed another way out from the great depression, and OG did the first festival appearances outside Finland. In the spring 2006 an era came to an end. The long-time singer Antti Filppu was replaced by Jukka Pelkonen aka J.\n\n\"STUCK HERE ON SNAKES WAY\" 2007\n\nThe debut album of \"The new OmG\" - featuring J on vocals - was released in April 2007 after a successful UK headlining tour and signing with British Candlelight Records. \"Snakes Way\" is an endless road dealing with the choices in our existence and the temptation within the mind of every soul on this third planet of ours, and unfortunately so many people are stuck. Gladly OG didn't get stuck with the album and the \"Snakes Way\" conducted the band to do tours abroad with Dark Tranquillity, Caliban and Entombed, spiced with a large amount of Finnish headlining gigs and the #31 position in the Finnish national album chart!\n\n\"THE REDSHIFT\" 2008\n\nThe 4th album \"The Redshift\" & year 2008 introduced the camp OG in its very strongest form seen yet. The album were recorded in the spring days of 2008 once again by their court engineer Teemu Aalto and it was mixed/mastered at Unisound Studio in Sweden by the legendary metal-mastermind Dan Swan\u00c3\u00b6 himself, who even commented the album with his nice words: \"You won't find a better album in years!\" The album was full of contrasts; melodic but yet brutal, lots of changing atmospheres, moods from sorrow to joy and from hope to despair, very catchy but still stand outs after lots of listens and the sands of time. The album themes are about that certainty, when you reach a point in your existence that makes you transform into something new and improved, It is about going faster and yet more calmly than ever before, It is a salute to knowing oneself and the space that is around! The redshift riders were sent to playing all over the Europe about 100 shows in support of the album, doing festivals and tours in Europe alongside Nile, Grave, Swallow The Sun, Insomnium & Dark Tranquillity, and even gained a #24 position in the Finnish album chart. Change for the better!\n\n\"NEW WORLD SHADOWS\" 2011\n\nDuring anno 2010 OG signed to Lifeforce Records and started to record their new masterpiece with a fresh and refined sound. After dedicated and time consuming pre-production the \"New World Shadows\" album was an epic and massive attack of ever flowing stream of Finnish melodic death metal! The album was released in February 2011 and peaked on Finnish official album chart on position 5. and reached the position 1.(!) on Finnish Rumba indie shop chart. \"New World Shadows\" were again recorded by Teemu Aalto & mixed by Dan Swan\u00f6, who also provided some amazing clean vocals for the album. Band did two European tours after the release during 2011, first with Rotting Christ and second with Dark Tranquillity, Eluveitie, Mercenary etc. and two extended Finnish tour and big amount of festivals.\n\nThe \"NWS\" album is pure northern death metal without limitations - really melodic and intelligent but still aggressive and heavy as a really heavy thing, aside quoting feels from prog rock to even AOR - this is adult oriented death metal in it's most epic & purest form!\n\nThe next step of OG's saga is coming out early in 2013, so the story continues soooon!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jon Cleary ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10375103.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "New Orleans Piano, Funk, New Orleans Funk And Groove", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jon Cleary\u2019s love and affinity for New Orleans music goes back to the rural British village of Cranbrook, Kent, where he was raised in a musical family. Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anabel Englund ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Electronic, Deep House, Disco, R&b/soul, Rnb-soul, Soul, R&b", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream at https://live.bandsintown.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "ARIELLA ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10367730.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Jazz Fusion, Retro Swing, Blue-eyed Soul, Jazz Adjacent, Ecelectic", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "ARIELLA is a talented duo with a passion for blues, jazz and soul.

Main influences are groups such as Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Blue \u00d6yster Cult, Lucifer\u2019s Friend, Steppenwolf, 70\u2019s Heart and Fleetwood Mac.\nWith over 150 shows under their belt Lucifer has toured the US, Canada, Japan and Europe multiple times and played renowned international festivals like The KISS Kruise, Psycho Las Vegas, Hellfest, MetalDays, Sweden Rock, Desertfest, the long standing German cult TV program Rockapalast twice, to name only but a few.\nFounded in 2014 in Berlin by The Oath front woman Johanna Sadonis, the group first consisted of Cathedral, Angel Witch and Ladytron members.

Ever since leaving wildly successful trip-hop group Sneaker Pimps, Corner\u2019s process of becoming IAMX beginning in 2004 has been theatrical, transcendent, and communal. Androgynous and visceral, IAMX has metamorphosed from small-town blue-collar kid to international pop star in the late 1990\u2019s to creator of raw art that disrupts gender and genre in the 2000\u2019s. Fueling electronic experimentation with punk energy and confessional lyricism, Corner\u2019s dark alternative electronic sound, fashion, performances, videos, and persona are larger than life, iconoclastic, and shockingly intimate.\n\n+++ I Forget That There\u2019s A World Outside +++\nGrowing up as a self-described socially anxious geek, Corner\u2019s interest in music was stoked by a \u201cweird uncle\u201d who would play \u201cstrange music\u201d to him. Interest became obsession, and obsession a means through which Corner explored his growing fascination with technology. The interest lingers to this day, as IAMX not only writes and performs, but also produces his own music. The awkward kid who spent a lot of time in his room became the iconoclastic artist who recently spent weeks in a converted homestead in the Mojave desert staring at mountains, mining the silence around him, fastidiously regenerating the muscle memory in his fingers, and practicing, and honing his new album, Echo Echo.\n\n+++ I've Seen Attention - See Through Me +++\nCorner\u2019s adolescent curiosity moved to a new level in his teens when he connected with his older sister\u2019s boyfriend Liam Howe, who became a friend and collaborator. Their first band F.R.I.S.K. released two bedroom-produced EPs \u2013 Soul of Indiscretion, World as a Cone \u2013 that provided an early sonic template for trip-hop in general. The pair also performed as DJs under the alias Line of Flight. In 1995, Corner and Howe formed Sneaker Pimps in Hartlepool, England with support from Kelli Dayton (vocals), Joe Wilson (bass) and Dave Westlake (drums). The newly formed band took rave culture and the pop charts by storm with their 1996 debut album, Becoming X which featured dance-floor classics \u201c6 Underground\u201d and \u201cSpin Spin Sugar\u201d, sold over a million copies, led to extensive touring, and attracted the attention of Virgin Records who signed them.\n\n+++ There\u2019s Something That\u2019s Stirring Deep In Me +++\nIn 1998 the band\u2019s changing creative direction lead to Corner taking over vocals from Kelli, and Splinter was released on Clean Up records in 1999. Splinter fostered a bourgeoning cult fandom, who continued with Sneaker Pimps through the band\u2019s third album Bloodsport (Tommy Boy) and beyond. Soon, Chris realised the band was no longer the right vehicle for where his music was headed, and from this awareness IAMX was born.\n\n+++ I Know You\u2019re Aching To Be Saved +++\nEven though some of the songs on IAMX\u2019s 2004 debut Kiss + Swallow were originally slated to be on the Sneaker Pimps' fourth album, (and IAMX is itself a reference to Becoming X), shades of Chris\u2019 old life quickly faded as his theatrical and gender-bending alias emerged with full force. From 2004 onward, IAMX maintained a hectic recording and touring schedule, moving to Berlin in 2005 at the peak of its electronic renaissance. IAMX released his sophomore album, The Alternative in 2006, followed in 2008 by Live In Warsaw. Kingdom Of Welcome Addiction and its anagram remix album Dogmatic Infidel Comedown OK followed in 2009 and 2010, chronicling a dark phase in Corner\u2019s life. As dark energy seductively does, it produced compelling work, including 2011\u2019s Volatile Times and 2013\u2019s The Unified Field albums, the latter of which is considered a milestone in IAMX\u2019s creative development as a musician and performer. Eventually, however, dark energy claims its toll.\n\n+++ The World Outside May Still Be Beautiful - But I Love This Cell +++\nFollowing a successful world tour in support of The Unified Field, Corner fell into a depressive and insomniac state. His ordeals \u2013 detailed in his personal blog here \u2013 prompted him to move to Los Angeles in sunny California for a change of scenery. \u201cI stopped listening to music for about a year. I stopped making music and it was almost unbearable to listen to music. For instance, I couldn\u2019t watch TV, I couldn\u2019t even drive as it would invoke these waves of existential panic, depression, and exhaustion. I thought I would never be able to make music again but that my enjoyment of it was over. That was a very scary idea,\u201d he explained.\n\n+++ In The Sunlight And The Dust Of California +++\nThe move was a good decision and yielded one of IAMX\u2019s best albums, Metanoia in 2015 and the mini-album Everything Is Burning (Metanoia Addendum) in 2016. Having poured his heart out lyrically on two successful albums and rigorous world tours, IAMX released Unfall (German for accident), an instrumental album to cleanse his creative palette. In 2017, Corner emerged from his depression into a state of euphoria captured on his album Alive In New Light.\n\n+++ The Boys With Their Toys Are Bringing The Void Our Way +++\nIn addition to his success as a songwriter, producer, and touring artist, IAMX is one of the most licensed musicians on ABC TV\u2019s runaway hit show, How To Get Away With Murder. By the beginning of 2019, IAMX had synced 16 of his songs to its soundtrack, becoming one of the most recognizable composers on television thanks to the show\u2019s creator Pete Nowalk being a super fan of IAMX. Another super fan turned collaborator is postmodern tattoo and makeup powerhouse, kindred spirit Kat Von D, who sang on four songs on Alive In New Light and shares IAMX\u2019s avant-garde fashion and design sense, epic stage theatricality, and gender-bending proclivities. IAMX\u2019s provocative aesthetics are not limited to his music and fashion. As a video artist, he crafts IAMX\u2019s stunning live visuals and most of their music videos, as well as videos for other acts, most notably his close friend Gary Numan.\n\n+++ Echoes From The Past +++\nIn the decompression from the electro-fueled passion that had taken IAMX to 27 countries on the Alive In New Light chapter, an old yearning reawakened. 2019 was to be the year that IAMX returned to the device that had been the initiation of his odyssey as a musician. The acoustic guitar. Eleven acoustic re-imaginings of IAMX\u2019s extensive catalogue, Echo Echo heralds the start of a new yet familiar tangent in the enthralling IAMX journey, one which promises the intimacy of his songwriting laid bare.\n\n+++ The Sky Has Opened Up And Now I\u2019m Overcome +++\nIAMX isn\u2019t clear where this newfound liberation will lead him. Rising from a humble working class background to capitalistic celebrity, then down to the depths of despair and back into a new light, IAMX\u2019s armor is now more permeable and his imagination more stimulated by Los Angeles\u2019 unrelenting optimism. For Chris Corner, turned IAMX, the transformative journey that began in his bedroom as a young kid in the North East of England and found its way into the California desert continues. The I AM in IAMX may imply stasis, a fixed state of being, but the X signifies the variable in mathematics and an unstoppable metamorphosis. IAMX will continue to evolve and is fiercely committed to deliver music that transcends genre, defies the rules of the music industry and cuts straight to the heart.", "otherInfo": "***LAST IAMX LIVE ONLINE SHOW***\nAccess: https://www.crowdcast.io/e/iamxacoustic-05-14\nChris performs IAMX songs live on acoustic guitar, vocal mic and various effect/loop pedals.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

His passionate performances are punctuated by a crisp acoustic guitar and soaring tenor vocals. This is best shown in his 2018 EP \u201cBreathe,\u201d a four song project consisting only of acoustic guitar, bass and vocals. And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.\n\nKyle takes in the world, processes it and turns it into song with his own special touch. He has a unique take on things, a view of the world others may not necessarily notice. He continues to grow as an artist, sharing his story and messages of love and peace.\n\nAbove all, though, it\u2019s still about the music.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lady Sanity ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9056548.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Rap", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Birmingham rapper Lady Sanity fuses the spirit of 90s HipHop, the heart of Jazz & the energy of Trap & Grime. .

He puts everything into every note, every word.'\n\nDavid Ford recorded his debut album 'I Sincerely Apologise For All the Trouble I've Caused' on his own in his cellar flat in Eastbourne during 2005 thinking he was just \"doing a bunch of demos\". However, the strength of these recordings led to magnoliaMAM taking him on for management and shortly thereafter licensing the 'demos' as a finished album to Independiente for the UK and then, in April 2006, to Columbia Records in New York for the USA and the 'rest of the world'.\n\nThe album has now been widely acclaimed and featured in the best of lists for 2006 in the LA Times, The Sunday Times, The New York Post, The Word and The Toronto Star - who said 'you have to go back to Dylan's 'Idiot Wind'/'Blood on the Tracks' to find such an impressively sustained, bile-soaked round of invective'.\n\nHe has toured extensively in the USA, the UK, Canada and Australia during 2006. When performing live David makes use of a 'looping pedal' which allows him to build up layers of vocals, guitars, percussion and keyboards to create extremely powerful and beautiful layers of sound; most notably when playing the song \"State Of The Union\".

But it was in the sweaty climes of the Lock Up Stage at Reading and Leeds 2008 that his solo career really started to take off. Inside the packed out tents, heaving with adoring fans and intrigued passers-by, Frank led the congregation in a mass sing-a-long; a stirring set that not only sparked the interest of the British mainstream but resonated unassumingly across the pond as a wealth of American punk bands watched approvingly from the sidelines.\n\nNo stranger to the festival, Frank had not only played the Lock Up Tent with former hardcore band Million Dead back in 2005 but also as a tentative solo artist in 2007 when debut album \u2018Sleep Is For The Week\u2019 was just an underground success. Within the following year, Frank\u2019s popularity grew with yet more touring and the release of second album 'Love Ire & Song' in March 08. He started to play larger headline shows and develop the live band that he was looking for.\n\nThe profits of all his hard work came together that festival weekend; it kicked started a new wave of interest and thanks to the unwavering support from Radio 1 DJs Mike Davies and Steve Lamacq, the rest of Radio 1 began to follow suit. Soon enough when Frank\u2019s single 'Long Live The Queen' \u2013 taken from \u2018Love Ire & Song' \u2013 was released in October, it made the R1 C-list, was Single Of The Week on Sara Cox\u2019s show and helped sell out Frank\u2019s largest UK headline tour culminating in a bursting-over-capacity-finale at London\u2019s Scala. The following single 'Reasons Not To Be An Idiot' released in January of this year eclipsed those successes by graduating to the R1\u2019s B-list, 6Music\u2019s A-list and XFM\u2019s daytime playlist, prompted a Live Lounge session for Sara Cox, a Hub Session for George Lamb as well as making iTunes Single Of The Week all helping to recruit a new army of Frank followers.\n\nIt was also during this time that sections of the US punk fraternity began to take notice. Having watched the infamous Lock Up Stage set at Reading and Leeds, Vinnie from Less Than Jake got in contact asking to release 'The First Three Years' album (a collection of all early and previously unreleased material, live tracks and b-sides released in the UK in December 08 on his vinyl label Paper and Plastick. Chuck Ragan took him on the Revival Tour with Tim Barry across America, he did a few shows with up and coming stars Fake Problems and New Jersey boys The Gaslight Anthem invited him to support them on their huge UK and European dates in the early part of this year. It was evident that word was spreading throughout the punk scenes both sides of the Atlantic and by the time Frank flew in to Austin, Texas for the annual industry showcase SXSW in March, a whole new chapter in his story was about to begin.\n\nFrank\u2019s brand of folk songwriting, catchy melodies and punk passion had reached the ears of the CEO of US independent label Epitaph Records, Bad Religion\u2019s legendary guitarist: Brett Gurewitz. Excited by what he had heard and seen when Frank headlined LA\u2019s notorious Viper Rooms in March, Gurewitz got in contact and soon enough plans were formulated and a worldwide deal was inked. With loyalty and integrity firmly intact, Frank kept his relationship with his existing label Xtra Mile Recordings for all releases in the UK and Ireland and so the two labels will work closely for what will undoubtedly be an exciting new era in Frank\u2019s ever evolving career.\n\n\u201cFrank Turner\u2019s music is a revelation to me,\u201d says Gurewitz. \u201cI can\u2019t stop listening to it. It\u2019s a real privilege to get out there and help Xtra Mile spread the Frank Turner gospel.\u201d\n\nEpitaph is the perfect home for Frank. With its fiercely independent spirit, rich in punk and hardcore history it is also home to the song-writing talents of Nick Cave and Tom Waits on sister label Anti; mirroring Frank\u2019s cross-over appeal of punk ethics and strong song-writing abilities. Inspired by the likes of Bad Religion as a kid, this really is a dream come true for Frank.\n\nSo with this exciting plot in place the year ahead is looking pretty good. His third studio album, \u2018Poetry Of The Deed\u2019, released worldwide in September, sees Frank venture in a more rock direction recruiting his outstanding band for the recording process. Performing live has always been at the very heart of the Frank Turner experience and whilst he\u2019s still writing all the songs, they will be recorded live to help bring that experience to the album. Grammy nominated producer Alex Newport \u2013 who has previously worked with Death Cab For Cutie, At The Drive-In, Two Gallants \u2013 is on production duties after contacting Frank directly asking if they could work together. Coinciding nicely with the release are tours in America and Europe as well as the massive UK headline tour in October, where having previously supported The Gaslight Anthem at London\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, he will return triumphantly to headline for the last night of the tour.\n\nBefore that though, another summer of further touring and festivals lies ahead. He will jet off to the East Coast of America to support The Offspring for 12 dates of their tour in July, performing solo to potentially 30,000 people. He\u2019ll play at Camp Bestival and Jersey Live fest and return full circle to this year\u2019s Reading and Leeds Festival. This time, however, he will play the larger Radio 1/NME tent midway through the afternoon and judging by what happened last year it\u2019ll be another defining moment in this story of one beardy man and his acoustic guitar.

It was a cozy place, filled with blue-collar workers who made their living on the water. During the weekends, many of those workers would head over to the Osborne household, where a series of loose, all-night jam sessions filled the Maryland air with the sounds of Bob Seger, Hank Williams, Tom Petty and George Jones. The Osborne siblings strummed their first chords during those jam sessions. From the very start, TJ Osborne was the brother with the voice. He sang in a thick, low baritone, crooning like Johnny Cash long before he was even old enough to drive. Older brother John, on the other hand, was the family\u2019s guitar shredder, his fingers capable of down-home bluegrass licks, arena-worthy rock riffs, country twang, and everything in between. Combined, the two Osbornes could play everything from traditional country music to rock & roll, creating a broad, full-bodied sound that would eventually fill the 11 songs on their major-label debut, Pawn Shop. Like its title suggests, Pawn Shop offers a little bit of everything. There\u2019s bluesy slide guitar, country duets, southern rock solos, harmonies, and plenty of groove. The hooks are big, the guitars are loud, and the songs \u2014 every last one of them co-written by the Osbornes, who reached out to award-winning songwriters like Shane McAnally and Ross Copperman for help \u2014 introduce a duo whose music bridges the gap between the mainstream and the alternative world. Some songs were written at home in Nashville, while others came together on the road, where the guys spent several years headlining their own club shows, touring the country with Darius Rucker, and playing some of the biggest arenas in America with fellow rule-breaker Eric Church. \u201cMost duos are built on singing,\u201d says TJ \u201cBut John is an incredible guitar player, and this band is built on me singing and John playing guitar. It gives us two parallels that work nicely together.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like an old-school rock approach,\u201d adds John, who cites classic bands like Aerosmith and the Allman Brothers as influences on the duo\u2019s dynamic. \u201cGroups like that always had the lead singer as well as the sideman guitar player. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going for, too. We\u2019re carving our own path in country music.\u201d That unique path has already led the band toward the upper half of the country charts. \u201cRum\u201d got them there first, mixing the feel-good sunshine of a beach tune with a far more realistic storyline. There\u2019s no actual beach in \u201cRum,\u201d after all. Instead, Brothers Osborne turn the song into a tribute to the simple pleasures that their Maryland hometown offers: friends, good weather, and the occasional drink. They even filmed the song\u2019s music video in Deale, filling the clip with footage of friends, relatives, and locals. \u201cMost people we grew up with don\u2019t go to these beautiful beaches,\u201d says TJ. \u201cThey can\u2019t afford to do it. They don\u2019t have the time for it. What we\u2019re most familiar with is people going to the local bars and hanging out with each other.\u201d John adds, \u201cWe tried to have the biggest time possible with what little we had. \u2018Rum\u2019 explains that.\u201d The brothers agree, \u201cWe had to say it from our own perspective.\u201d A similar theme runs throughout \u201cDirt Rich\u201d and \u201cPawn Shop,\u201d two songs that stress the importance of appreciating what you\u2019ve got. Pawn Shop dishes up plenty of love songs, too, from \u201cLoving Me Back\u201d \u2014 an old-school country duet featuring vocals from Lee Ann Womack \u2014 to \u201cStay a Little Longer,\u201d the band\u2019s biggest hit to date. While a three-minute guitar solo brings \u201cStay a Little Longer\u201d to an epic, anthemic close, Brothers Osborne also devote time to more laid-back songs, from the nostalgic California country of \u201c21 Summer\u201d to the 420-friendly \u201cGreener Pastures.\u201d Brothers Osborne, who co-produced the album with Jay Joyce (the award-winning producer behind Little Big Town\u2019s Painkiller, Eric Church\u2019s The Outsiders, and Carrie Underwood\u2019s Storyteller), recorded most of Pawn Shop during breaks in their busy touring schedule, using members of their own touring band rather than session musicians from the Nashville community. The result is an album that\u2019s stamped with the unmistakable mark of a band. It doesn\u2019t sound like two singers, flanked by anonymous players. Instead, it sounds like a group of road warriors who\u2019ve spent years sharing bus seats and hotel rooms, creating the sort of chemistry that can\u2019t be faked. Pawn Shop is both raw and real, and Brothers Osborne \u2014 who, years after those household jam sessions in Deale, now have a handful of nationwide tours under their belts, songs on the charts, and a career on the rise \u2014 are no longer a family secret.

Throughout his prolific career as part of three of the greatest live groups in rock history \u2013 Allman Brothers Band, Gov\u2019t Mule and the Dead \u2013 his virtuosic artistry has led to thousands of unforgettable performances and millions of album and track sales. Despite all of the ground that Haynes has covered on his musical journey, the impressive thing is that he still has many miles to explore. On his newest solo album Ashes and Dust, he puts forth one of his most gorgeous, musically rich and personal albums to date. It is endlessly exciting to see one of the most brilliant minds in modern music shine an entirely new light on the depths of his creativity.\n\nAshes and Dust, only the third studio album Haynes has ever released under his own name, is a masterful work of art and a particularly important statement for Haynes. The songs are immediately and clearly different from his usual style \u2013 encompassing beautiful acoustic arrangements, a rootsy/Americana soundscape and honeyed vocals that cut straight through to the soul. Although many of these songs are brand new, some of the tunes that make up this album have been dear to Warren for years. In some cases he has been carrying them around for 20 or 30 years, waiting for the right time to record them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing songs all my life from a more folky, singer-songwriter, even Celtic direction,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while, I\u2019ve been compiling songs that didn\u2019t necessarily fit in with Gov\u2019t Mule or the Allman Brothers or even my last solo album. So this record was really a chance to bring a lot of that music to fruition. It\u2019s really given me the opportunity to take a lot of songs I love, that didn\u2019t have a home, and build a home for them.\u201d\n\nGiven his life-long commitment to experimentation and eclecticism, though, it should come as no surprise that the album reveals yet another new side of his musical personality. Knowing that he wanted to pursue a more folk-based approach on this project, he brought in the New Jersey-based Americana band Railroad Earth as collaborators.\n\n\u201cI have a cool chemistry with those guys\u2014they add their own personality to the songs, but they\u2019re really great at interpreting, as well,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other casually for several years, and then at Del-Fest a few years ago, we winged a few songs together and it went really well. A little later, when I was opening the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY, they joined me for part of the set. We did that with a little more rehearsal, more preparation, and it was a great experience. At that point, I started thinking that maybe I should make my next record with these guys.\u201d\n\nEven with a clear sense of his goals for the album, Haynes and Railroad Earth still needed to explore various avenues and possibilities. They recorded more than 30 songs, often trying entirely different arrangements for each take or even recording late at night and not listening to playbacks until they reconvened the next day.\n\nFans of jam-band powerhouse Gov\u2019t Mule or the most recent soul-charged incarnation of the Warren Haynes Band\u2014or listeners who know Haynes through his 25-year affiliation with the Allman Brothers Band or his work with various extensions of the Grateful Dead family\u2014may be surprised to hear him working in a more song-based context. Several of the tracks on Ashes and Dust, like \u201cCompany Man\u201d and \u201cCoal Tattoo,\u201d are links to the folk tradition of narrative writing.\n\n\u201cI love story songs,\u201d Haynes says. \u201cI was very influenced by the whole concept of writing songs that tell a story. When I first got bitten by the singer-songwriter bug, when I was 14, it was due to those people who transported you to another place and another time with their songs\u201d\n\nWhich is not to say that Ashes and Dust leaves his instrumental adventures behind; several songs such as \u201cBlue Maiden\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cStranded in Self-Pity\u201d open out into more extended musical journeys. \u201cIn the studio, you\u2019re always looking for the balance between structure and focus and improvisation, opening up the music to chance\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut too much of either can keep the music from being as rewarding or as effective as it can be. Luckily my audience loves things to be stretched out. They love to hear the performance aspect. It was nice to take a few dirt roads, musically speaking, and go to some places none of us were expecting.\u201d\n\nHaynes shares that this album also brought out some new dimensions for him as a guitarist. \u201cMy playing here is quite different from what I\u2019ve done in recent projects. It\u2019s showcasing a side of my musicality that\u2019s unlike, in some cases, anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says, noting that he played a hollow-body D\u2019Angelico instrument (\u201ckind of a jazz guitar\u201d) for many of the sessions. \u201cI like to adapt to my surroundings\u2014to the music itself and to the musicians, trying to choose a musical voice that fits into the overall picture a certain way. I played a lot more slide guitar than I\u2019ve played in a long time and a lot of acoustic guitar, things that were more directed to weaving themselves into the fabric of this music.\u201d\n\nOne of the songs, \u201cSpots of Time\u201d (the lyrics of which include the phrase that gives the album its title), may be familiar to ardent Haynes-watchers. The song was written by Haynes and Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers have been playing it on stage in recent years. He had hoped that the song would be included if the Allmans made another studio album, but after the legendary band retired in 2014, he decided to record it himself\u2014but not before inviting Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and percussionist Marc Quinones to join him in the studio.\n\nOn \u201cGold Dust Woman,\u201d Grace Potter adds her unique vocal timbre. Sparking a fast friendship and instant chemistry several years ago, Haynes and Potter have performed this song together many times on stage and this endeavor seemed like the perfect opportunity to document it in the studio. That chemistry, along with Railroad Earth\u2019s unique instrumental interpretation, plays out here in fine form on the sole duet on the album.\n\nThe presence of these world-class musicians and artists, along with that of Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin and famed harmonica player Mickey Raphael (who each make an appearance here on \u201cWanderlust\u201d) is yet another reason why Ashes and Dust stands as such a personal, ambitious document of Warren Haynes\u2019 history. With songs that reach back to his initial fascination with music and others that go right up to the present day, it\u2019s a look behind his first-rate playing and into his enduring creative spirit.\n\n\u201cThese songs were each very important to me when they were written, especially since some of them go so far back,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all visual memories and experiences of certain time periods that I tried to capture in song. They really represent a collection of memories in my life.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.youtube.com/user/guitarfestival"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Built to Spill ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371631.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Built to Spill plays the songs of Daniel Johnston out this MAY.

'Deleter' is the new track from Grouplove and it is an emergency opener. It's fueled by pounding keys, squalling guitar lines, and lightning drumming before the voice of Christian Zucconi questions everything around him: faith systems, his sense of belonging, communities, his own psyche. \u201cAll this time I thought you were a leader/It turns out you're only a deleter.\u201dIt could be interpreted as a political statement, but it's also highly personal. \u201cAll this time been burning with a fever / It turns out I've always been my healer,\u201dis also switched in as a rhyming line, and in the end sees Zucconi and his collaborator, wife and frontwoman Hannah Hooper realizing that amid every progression and every regression you always come back to yourself for the answers. They're already within you.\n\nToday in a cafe in their LA neighborhood of Silver Lake,the pair sit down as two people who have experienced and borne witness to a great deal of change, trauma and growth in the past three years. You may associate the band as a beacon for positivity and optimism. They're still a five-piece \u2013albeit with a new drummer in Ben Homola \u2013and at their core, remain a vessel for looking at the glass half full. Hence their opening sentiment: a rallying cry for tearing down false idols and building anew.\n\nAfter the band completed touring their 2016 album Big Mess, it all got tumultuous. Back in LA, Hannah had committed to taking some personal time to pursue an art show of her paintings. Just before theshow and before the band started writing again, they lost a dear friend. As Hannah painted,she felt connected to him, and was consumed by thoughts of death and the afterlife. All the while the left side of her body had started to feel out of her possession. \u201cIt felt like I was having a slow stroke,\u201d she recalls. She got an MRI to be safe. The day she finished painting the show, the results came through. The news was bad \u2013she needed brain surgery. \u201cWhat the fuck?! I just went white.\u201d\n\nWith Hannah's shocking news and the world outside feeling like it was in constant crisis, making music became the greatest remedy for the band and they started to write. They wrote more than they've ever written. Decamping to Northern California they worked in a way they never had before, experiencing a collective catharsis.\n\nThey made very aggressive grunge. \u201cIt felt good to scream,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cWe write music as a way to deal with good times or bad.\u201d The shows, the songsandthe writing took Hannah out of a state of constant freak-out. It didn\u2019t only help heal Hannah, but also helped heal Christian, who wasn't just a Buddha-like figure for Hannah and their young daughter but,was helping keep the band in productive spirits too.\n\nIn October 2018, the band \u2013 including Homola, guitarist Andrew Wessen and bassist Daniel Gleason \u2013 traveled to El Paso, Texas with esteemed producer Dave Sitek [of TV On The Radio] for a month. This was a shift for the band, who had previously worked almost entirely in house with founding member and former drummer/producer Ryan Rabin. Rabin left amicably prior to the band beginning work on this album. Sitek had heard 'Deleter' and loved it but he wanted to work with the band to veer away from their previous grunge-leanings. He wanted to take them outside the box and stretch them beyond what they had ever had to deal with. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cIt's like playing a sport with a new teammate. We just became better.\u201d\n\nWorking in Texas was a headtrip. \u201cWe had never recorded in a place where time did not exist, because it doesn\u2019t exist at Sonic Ranch if you don\u2019t want it to. We watched the sun rise every singleday, I had lost the concept of time,\u201d Andrewadds. Ben felt the same and helped set the scene in Texas: \u201cWe never missed a sunrise, listening back with the studio doors wide open, sitting around a tired fire surrounded by miles and miles of pecan trees. Hannah and I laughed uncontrollably, couldn\u2019t even produce words, couldn\u2019t stop crying -Were we happy or losing our minds? Haha I\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\nNot only did they learn new tricks, but Sitek encouraged them both to simplify their sound and to extend it. The songs they made during this period are so ambitious, that it pushed them to become a seven-piece band ontour. The limitations were gone. They were away from the world, immersed and unplugged in the middle of nowhere. They were also half a mile from the border and during the height of Trump's family separations crisis.\n\nBeing close to that inspired the song 'Promises.' \u201cNothing disappoints me like the news,\u201dsings Christian, taking into consideration his own experience as a father. \u201cYou're just following orders, closing your eyes and telling lies while they're taking our daughters.\u201d The track sounds like a paranoid futuristic Western.\n\n\u2018Youth\u2019 is an anthem reminding people never to forget their inner child. \u201cWhen we finished Youth a group of us drove to El Paso and went grocery shopping, bought fireworks, went to a guitar shop and stopped at a food stand. We had been up for 2 days. We looked insane, we felt insane & and it was insane. But I\u2019ll never forget how the song felt as we sped down the highway, Dave driving 150 mph, all of us just crammed in. I can literally picture it perfectly because I was so fucking proud of the song and couldn\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t exist 1/2 day before,\u201d Andrew recalls.\n\nSongs like \u2018Expectations\u2019 and \u2018Places\u2019speak to the more internal and personal friction many of us feel these days. \u2018Places\u2019line, \u201cthere\u2019s a place we\u2019re all running from, and we don\u2019t know how to get there,\u201d is Christian examining his experience in a constantly evolving world.\n\nWhen the band got back to LA, they got in the studio with a second producer \u2013Malay, famed for working with Frank Ocean and Lorde. They found themselves more prolific than ever, in an easier mode of creativity. Songs like \u2018Inside Out\u2019 were written and recorded in just a couple of days. Hannah remarks that the song reminds us that life is more beautiful the more honestlywe live it.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to collaborate with brilliant musical minds whose only agenda was to make honest and exciting music. It\u2019s what you hope for. Malay is the perfect example of someone who creates from his inner music fan,\u201d Dan recalls.\n\nHannah has always been the visual force for all of Grouplove\u2019s art, and in June 2019, she was given the opportunity to showcase her own paintings at the legendary artist Shepard Fairey\u2019s gallery. Now, post-surgery, she\u2019s still recovering. Butshe sees it as a gift; a way to connect with others.\n\nIt's been almost ten years since Grouplove met on a commune in Greece and brought the idea of themselves being a band back to California. They'd never have anticipated making it this far. Healer represents a re-birth and one that almost comes full circle to their initial idealism. \u201cWhen we all met in Greece, Christian and I were leaving New York at an all-time low. We just wanted to have a fun summer. We wanted to make art. And we're still doing that. We found that feeling again on this album, of hopelessness put into a medium of expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis album is us fighting for that feeling,\u201d says Hannah.\u201cThere's a darkness that's real and everyone deals with it at a certain point in their life. We\u2019re addressing that life is hard.We understand and we are going through it with you.\u201d\n\nGrouplove is: Hannah Hooper, Christian Zucconi, Andrew Wessen, Daniel Gleason, Benjamin Homola", "otherInfo": "Instagram Live & Chat"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Land of Deborah ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8483476.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Singer-songwriter Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "WELCOME TO THE LAND!\n\nThe Land of Deborah is an award-winning singer-songwriter and composer with a unique take on life, love and the pursuit of fair trade chocolate.\n\nBorn and raised in England, Deborah is a trans-national artist who now calls Vancouver, BC home.\n\nShe has been described in the press as \u201c...feel good folk-pop\u201d and as having \u201c...one of the smoothest voices in the city\u201d.\n\nFor video: youtube.com/TheLandofDeborah\nFacebook: facebook.com/TheLandofDeborah\nInstagram: instagram.com/TheLandofDeborah\nFor more info please go to http://thelandofdeborah.com/bio", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Dears ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10278828.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Prog-rock, Alternative, Art Rock, Indie Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Dears, a critically acclaimed \u201corchestral-pop-noir-romantique\u201d rock'n'roll band from Montre?al, is shaped equally by nineties rock and a broad tableau of gospel, soul, and pop music.\n\nThe band formed in 1995 and released their first album, End of a Hollywood Bedtime Story, in 2000.

The title is not arbitrarily applied. His first major musical success was in 2012 with a trapped-out remix of Hardstyle superstar Showtek\u2019s \u201cF.T.S.\u201d This tune, which SAYMYNAME credits as the impetus for the Hardtrap genre, was banged out ad infinitum on every major festival stage in the world multiple times over. LA Weekly has also acknowledged this title. By fusing Hardstyle with Trap, \u201cthe dance music world has been better for it ever since\u201d. But this Humboldt, California native had modest beginnings. SAYMYNAME was raised in a musical family. By the age of 5, his father, a DJ himself, cultivated in Dayve a passion for music. At 12, he picked up DJing as a hobby. His high school years were punctuated by his interest in music, sports, and the arts (Dayvid is an accomplished Graffiti and street artist). He took two years of advanced music theory courses, which set him on the path to professional music production. He first experimented with Apple\u2019s Garage Band but soon graduated to more advanced production tools like Acid, Reason, Sylenth and Abelton. He was accepted to Chapman University in Orange County, California, the prestigious IVY league of the West Coast. While there he kept himself as focused on music as he did on his academics and, in 2013, his diligent work ethic and production prowess combined to win him the coveted Insomniac Discovery Project contest. This win landed him squarely in front of thousands of fans at EDC Las Vegas, and his performance was touted as one of the best of the festival. His future in dance music was becoming a reality, but this dream had yet to pay the bills. After college, Dayve continued to work 35-40 hours a week at Guitar Center, then rushed home to produce in his bedroom at night. It was this job at Guitar Center that got him through those tough early days, and two days before his first Australia tour, he handed in his two weeks. Now, years later, with top headline and mainstage billings across the globe and mega hits like his collaboration with Mercer, \u201cWanted\u201d, and his remixes of Dj Snake\u2019s \u201cPropoganda\u201d and Mercer\u2019s \u201cEncore\u201d, SAYMYNAME finds himself at the center of setlists by Dance music\u2019s elite including Tiesto, Afrojack, David Guetta, Dillon Francis, Madeon, Dimitri Vegas Like Mike, Jauz, W&W, DYRO, Borgeous, Showtek, NGHTMRE, and Diplo. Towering above the decks at 6\u20195, SAYMYNAME is the undisputed champion and originator of Hardtrap.

It is Nitze's journey through our world. And the sound originates from the stillness of our apartments at night. Our home.\nQuestioned about his musical roots and influences, Nitze replies: \"I grew up listening to \"This Mortal Coil\". David Sylvian's songs have always been a part of my life to the present day. Robert Smith was like my \"guitar teacher\". I think \"A Forest\" was the first piece I played on the guitar. For me Ivo Watts Russell is one of the greatest innovators in the music industry. And in my view these archetypal albums were all created under his direction. In other words what we today call 4AD. The Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, Dead can Dance, Clan of Xymox... These are albums that aren't hyped much but everyone knows them. If they hadn't existed, the music world would have been a much poorer place. I'm especially thinking of albums like \"Sleep With The Fishes\". This influenced me a great deal.\nOn \"almost forgotten tales\" Nitze sets three poems by Dylan Thomas to music; he explains why: \"It is the sense of the absurd in his writing. His writing is a true source of inspiration to me. Jon Cale was the one who first introduced me to Thomas. I devoured everything he wrote. \"Being But Men\" is all about how simple it is to feel happiness. Something that we knew all about as children. It's so simple... but we've forgotten how to do it.

And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.\n\nKyle takes in the world, processes it and turns it into song with his own special touch.

It's decided that we should respect each band and we should have separate groups for both bands.\n\n\nPopular French rock group Dolly got together in Nantes, a town in the west of France, in 1991. Their formation came about thanks to drummer Thierry Lacroix and singer Emmanuelle Monet - aka Manu - who shared a mutual passion for English and American music. The Anglophile duo teamed up with two musician friends - bass-player Mick Chamberlin and guitarist Nicolas Bonniere (who was just 15 at the time!) - and went on to make a name for themselves on the local music scene as Dolly and C\u00b0.\n\nDolly and C\u00b0's early influences might have been lifted from the best chapters of an English/American rock compendium - indeed, the group's sound was heavily influenced by the likes of Blondie, Prince, the Pixies and the Smashing Pumpkins. But lead singer Manu's greatest source of inspiration was the work of English indie diva PJ Harvey. The young French singer was fascinated by Harvey's deep, melancholy vocals and, after seeing PJ in concert, Manu decided to accompany her own singing on guitar. Performing extensively on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 soon began to build up an extensive repertoire (most of which was written by Manu). And before long the group attracted a massive following of fans.\n\nEncouraged by this early success on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 went into the studio to begin work on their d\u00e9but album. After producing a mini album (featuring six tracks), Dolly and C\u00b0 went on to produce their first full-length album themselves. (The album, entitled simply \"Dolly and C\u00b0, actually scored a considerable hit on the national music scene, selling over 85,000 copies).\n\nShortly after the release of their d\u00e9but album, the group underwent several major changes in their line-up, re-inventing themselves as Dolly. The new-look Dolly went on to sign a recording deal with the East West label and then returned to the studio to set to work on a new CD album.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nDolly (\u30c9\u30ea\u30a3, \uff24\uff4f\uff4c\uff4c\uff59) is an japanese rock band.\nThey started their activities in 2005.\n\nMember:\nVocals: Mitsu\nGuitar: Masa\nGuitar: Yuina (ex Luecie)\nBass : Hachi\nDrums : Takashi (ex Plastic Tree)\n\nThe release Ussetsu Drop had their first proper PV with more of a budget than the previous.\nNow they have just released the Red and White singles of the tricolore opera trilogy making a total of 3 pvs and 9 songs.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Seu Maxixe Oficial ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10354796.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live do Seu Maxixe"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Soul Filter ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9060638.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Pop Rock, Adult Contemporary, Folk Rock, Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Soul Filter is an emerging 4 piece rock band from Prince Edward Island that blends pop, blues and folk to create a soulful and dreamy alternative contemporary sound. With a 2020 PEI Music nomination for Rock Recording of the Year and 5 single releases from their album A Minor Conspiracy, the band has burst onto the indie music scene with their debut LP. They have been featured on CBC's Mainstreet with Matt Rainnie, Q93, CBC Music Hour with Bill Roach, The East Coast Countdown, Q104 in Halifax, CJIM Montreal's Rock Station New Scotland Radio, CIOE FM's \"Fresh From the East\" & \"East Coast Rising\", and shared the stage with Canadian icons Big Wreck, The Road Hammers, Honeymoon Suite & Haywire during one of PEI\u201ds biggest festivals, Rock The Boat. In 2019 their single Like Water made CBC Searchlight\u2019s Top 100 by fan vote.?\n\nWhen founding members, husband & wife duo Karen & Mike Penton, first met in 2001, she didn't know he was a performing musician and he didn't know she had a secret life long desire to be one. To Karen\u2019s delight, their second date consisted of 2 bottles of wine and an acoustic guitar \u2013 the deal was sealed. After a few years of signing Beatles\u2019 covers (and other classics) together at home, Mike decided it was time to push Karen into the spotlight. With their mutual passion for music and newly formed partnership, the two went on to create several popular cover bands (Junkmale, Pretty Tragic, No Doubt & Alanis Morissette tribute show, Karen & Mike acoustic duo), performing all over PEI and into NB, before forming Soul Filter in 2017.?\n\nThe two had dabbled in songwriting individually since they were teenagers but put it on the back burner while they raised their two girls and performed in cover bands on the weekends. What started out as a fun hobby became a purpose and life force. After years of singing other people's songs, an increasing passion to find and sing her own words, and a gnawing desire to see what kind of magic they would create together helped push Karen & Mike to write and record A Minor Conspiracy.\n\nWith themes of self-discovery, adversity, love and loss, the album infuses pop, blues and folk into Soul Filter's rock roots sound. Acoustic rhythm serves as the backbone to melodically sweet electric guitar riffs and punchy choruses. Baring a reminiscent feel to the 90's alternative contemporary rock era, lead singer/songwriter Karen gets her musical inspiration from artists like The Cranberries, Alanis Morissette, & Sheryl Crow. Dynamically weaving between soft falsetto and soulful, powerful vocals, Karen embraces vulnerability and delivers empowering, self-reflective lyrics through alluringly catchy melodies. To bring the album to life on stage, Karen & Mike brought in longtime friends and former cover band mates Ronnie Arsenault on bass guitar, and Marc Robichaud on drums.\n\nThe band has been busy performing and promoting their album across PEI and looks forward to bringing their live stage performance on road.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Narwhals & Waterfalls ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9394803.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Dallas, Texas", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dallas based Narwhals & Waterfalls is an acoustic Kindie Rock duo with a heart for kids.

With a voice that touches somewhere deep inside, Alyssa\u2019s soulful sound and powerful lyrics will send you jet-setting into a broad range of human emotions. Growing up on the open roads of America, with her RCA country recording artists parents, Baillie & The Boys, made it impossible for Alyssa not to witness the power and magic of music. At just 3 weeks old, her cradle was the gentle rocking of a tour bus. Her play ground encompassed sound checks at fairs and festivals and back stage dressing rooms at a slew of different venues including the Grand Ole Opry and Country Music Award shows, and her \u201cextended family\u201d consisted of managers, promoters, roadies, musicians and other fellow mainstream country artists.\n\nAt the age of 3, Alyssa performed on the Ralph Emory television show, Nashville Now. Where her version of the Leslie Gore classic; It\u2019s My Party brought the house down in front of millions of national viewers. At age 10, one of those major acts, Kenny Rogers, decided Alyssa was the perfect child singer to record a duet with him on his Christmas CD, Christmas From The Heart. By age 13, Alyssa had her first batch of songs written and received an endorsement from Gretsch Guitars. She had figured out her own unique style of guitar playing with open tunings inspired by Joni Mitchell. By age 16 she landed her first 50 date tour opening up for Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives. It soon became obvious that she was the real deal, not only as a musician and singer but as a prolific songwriter as well.\n\nWhile in high-school, Alyssa became a go-to session singer for people like Christian artist Matt Maher, where she created her own layered harmony vocal approach from years of hearing her parents sing together. Her songs started finding their way into television shows, (Switched! on ABC Family, MTV), movies, as well as getting her first cuts on other artists projects.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Alyssa received a full scholarship from Sennheiser to Paul McCartney\u2019s Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts in Liverpool England, where she would spend the next three years earning a degree in Sound Technology while continuing to perform in local venues throughout Europe. While playing at a venue called The Zanzibar in Liverpool, Alyssa was spotted by Liverpool Rock Star Pete Wylie and was asked to join his band playing electric guitar and singing background vocals. Alyssa of course said yes, and experienced what most artists never experience; a private performance requested by the Queen to help support one of Liverpool\u2019s local charities. A performance with Ringo Starr at the 800th Anniversary of Liverpool\u2019s, \u201cCapital Of Culture 2008\u201d event; a performance slot at one of the UK\u2019s largest music festivals; Knowsley Hall on the same bill as The Who, and from there on scored her own slots performing on the Acoustic stage at Glastonbury in 2009, and a UK tour opening for Raul Malo of The Mavericks.\n\nWhile at LIPA, Alyssa was inspired by their music community and the extreme amount of talented people attending the school. She lived in Lennon Studios, an apartment complex that used to be the old maternity ward where John Lennon was born. Her incredibly unique experiences abroad inspired her debut album, The English Diaries, an all acoustic intimate collection of songs she produced and recorded herself in her one bedroom Beatles inspired flat.\n\nAfter graduating LIPA and receiving her diploma from Paul McCartney himself, Alyssa returned to Nashville and signed her first publishing deal with Rondor Music. While signed to Rondor, she produced and released her sophomore album Love Hard which was backed by a 10k dollar Kickstarter Campaign and landed one of the biggest nationwide commercial placements of 2012 with her song, \u201cI Make My Own Sunshine,\u201d inspired by Liverpool\u2019s rainy weather. It was featured in a Lowe\u2019s commercial, earning over 50,000 downloads in its first 3 months and over 1 million plays on Spotify. She had no idea at the time that her song would later be heard by Steven Tyler and recorded on his first ever solo album, We\u2019re All Somebody From Somewhere and that she would be the only solo writer on his debut #1 billboard Country album.\n\nAlyssa\u2019s many other accomplishments in the singer/songwriter community include: Writing with Jeffrey Steele, Michelle Branch, Hunter Hayes, and JD Souther, writing three songs on Jessie James Decker\u2019s top 5 Billboard Country album \u201cComin\u2019 Home\u201d and co-writing top 40 billboard country radio single, \u201cLights Down Low\u201d, winning Canadian songwriter of the year and song of the year for \u201cI Only Smoke When I Drink\u201d by the Small Town Pistols, co-writing Jana Kramer\u2019s latest country radio single \u201cCircles\u201d and a #17 AC Billboard Chart Christmas duet with Matthew & Gunner Nelson called \u201cThis Christmas\u201d which she wrote with the twins and her father, Michael Bonagura. She\u2019s also had three #1 hits in Australia with Morgan Evans and Chelsea Basham and produced music for Jo Dee Messina & Rachel Reinert of Gloriana.\n\nAt 28 years old, Alyssa has become a songwriting seamstress for a number of artists, a producer, and a band member of the west coast folk & classic rock n\u2019 roll sounds of The Sisterhood Band with friend Ruby Stewart, all while simultaneously having a career as a solo artist. She\u2019s created life long friendships with fellow songwriters, artists and musicians, and has been called \u201cA fixture on Nashville\u2019s indie singer-songwriter scene\u201d by Rolling Stone. It\u2019s been over 4 years since she\u2019s released a solo project, but when you hear her newest record Road Less Traveled, you\u2019ll know it was worth the wait.\n\nAfter an entire summer of recording plans with an outside producer had fallen through, Alyssa turned to her boyfriend Graham Whitford for guidance on what was the best way forward for the songs she so much believed in. They decided to call long time friend and engineer Mark Petaccia to see if he was available to help record at his studio Petti Sound in Berry Hill. By a simple twist of fate, he had 7 days free.\n\nHer closest friends and family who are all a part of the Nashville underground music community decided to come together and help her create Road Less Traveled without the help of a label and purely for the love and support of their friend. The entire album was recorded live, produced by Alyssa & Mark Petaccia, Mastered by Richard Dodd and executive produced by Karen Whitford. Alyssa showcases her multi-instrumental talents by playing acoustic guitar in her signature open tunings, Piano, Ukulele, Lap Steel, Electric guitar, Bass, B3 and Harmonica. She\u2019s backed by Graham Whitford, Caleb Crosby, and Noah Denney (3/4ths of Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown), String arrangers and players Eleonore Denig and Molly Cherryholmes (Mountain Heart), Kevin McGowan, Tarka Layman, fellow artist and songwriter Davis Naish, and her father Michael Bonagura on Electric guitar.\n\nRoad Less Traveled showcases Alyssa as a solo artist in her truest form to date and shares the journey of finding her own voice and paving her own path as an independent Country artist. It encompasses elements of early Sheryl Crow mixed with Joni Mitchell like vocals. You'll hear so many iconic female influences on this project. Alyssa blends them all extremely well to come up with a sound that is familiar in its harkening back to the greats from multiple decades, yet completely unique and unlike anything else one would hear today.

Justin Fabus tells a story worthy of this time-honored and timeless tradition. In his music, the singer and songwriter exudes a raw relatability between the resounding twang of acoustic guitar and robust rhythms. Endorsed by everyone from Taste of Country to The Boot and handpicked by Donnie Wahlberg to open New Kids on the Block\u2019s Mixtape Tour in his native Pittsburgh, the troubadour transforms trials and tribulations into country anthems.\n\u201cI\u2019m from a dog-eat-dog place that\u2019s very hard to break out of,\u201d he admits. \u201cHowever, my philosophy is, \u2018If you\u2019re not going to let me through the front door, I\u2019m going to climb through the window\u2019. Pittsburgh\u2019s a blue-collar hardworking town; I write blue-collar songs. That\u2019s country music at its core. That\u2019s who I am.\u201d\nHe also continues to make major strides through simply doing what he does. 2016\u2019s self-titled Justin Fabus soared to the Top 3 of iTunes Top Country Albums chart as he performed with everyone from Garry Allan and Randy Houser to Craig Campbell. In addition to sold out headline gigs, the 2017 CMA Music Festival showcased him as an \u201cEmerging Artist.\u201d However, he reached new heights with Remedy in 2018. Boasting collaborations with Joey Henry [Frank Sinatra, John Denver, Garth Brooks] and The Voice star Tony Lucca, it crashed the Billboard New Country Albums Chart in the Top 50. Not to mention, he landed features from Paste, AXS, All Access, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and many others.\nIn the midst of this rapid rise, Justin faced a turbulent and trying time. His mother passed away after a bout with pancreatic cancer.\n\u201cIt was definitely a rough year,\u201d he sighs. \u201cMy mom was the main reason I got into music. She was always my number one fan. It took a toll on me. I was lost. After a month, I snapped out of it, because music is all I know. I put my best foot forward.\u201d\nIn January 2019, he got a little encouragement from a legend. Tweeting about how \u201cthere needed to be a country version of New Kids on the Block\u2019s \u20182 in the Morning\u2019,\u201d Donnie replied with his blessing. So, Justin recorded his take on the tune from 2008\u2019s chart-topping, The Block. The cover caught fire online and Donnie personally invited Justin to perform it at PPG Paints Arena in front of 20,000 screaming fans when New Kids On The Block\u2019s Mixtape Tour rolled through Pittsburgh in 2019.\nIn the aftermath, Justin launched his biggest solo headline run to date the Back From Hell Tour, crisscrossing the country and packing houses. However, everything set the stage for his next original body of work.\nStripping down the sound to guitar, drums, and bass as the backdrop for the same catchy and confessional storytelling, Justin ultimately adds a new edge to country by preserving its integrity.\n\u201cI want people to listen to it and feel the pain and realness of my songs,\u201d he leaves. \u201cI\u2019m never going to write songs I didn\u2019t live or haven\u2019t gone through. My style keeps progressing and growing. I\u2019m writing about loss, but I\u2019m also writing about falling in love.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

Kenneth\u2019s musical styling and dynamic live performances also attracted the attention of some of his mentors like Lucinda Williams, Billy Gibbons and current bandmate Steve Ferrone of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Since 2013, he spent two years touring with multi-Grammy winner Lucinda Williams, who describes the sound of the live band as \u201csomewhere between Lynyrd Skynyrd and Drive-By Truckers\u201d. He has also opened for ZZ Top, Steve Winwood, and Blackberry Smoke. Whether in intimate Honky Tonks or stately, sold-out theaters, Kenneth and the live band continue to captivate audiences with powerful, resonating guitar tones and a tight rhythm section.\n\nKenneth\u2019s sixth studio album \u2018With Lions,\u2019 released May 19th 2017, includes 11 songs all written by Kenneth and pays tribute to his mentors as well as his musically rich and culturally significant Southern heritage. The single \u201cYou\u2019re Not Mine\u201d is an edgy anthem with heavy-hitting guitar solos and powerful vocals. \u201cBeautiful Storm\u201d is an emotionally evocative track that showcases Kenneth\u2019s spell-binding competency with a slide.\n\nRock \u2018n\u2019 roll royalty Steve Ferrone (Drums, Tambourine, Shakers) and Scott Thurston (Keyboards, Piano) of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers don\u2019t just lend their talents for the album but, Ferrone sits behind the drum kit when he\u2019s not touring with Tom Petty. Kenneth and Steve met a couple of years ago at a gathering thrown by a mutual pal. Not long after, he needed a drummer for a Hollywood gig and Steve sat in with the band. He has worked with Kenneth to hone the sound and helped him the right players. And as they say, the rest is history. Handpicked by Steve, drummer Chris Cano plays with the KBB when Ferrone is on the road with the Heartbreakers. Popular session bass guitarist and Disresputable Few member, Paul Ill, joined the band at Steve\u2019s urging and perfectly rounded out the Kenneth Brian Band sound. \u201cThose two were the perfect combination for what I do,\u201d said Kenneth. \u201cTheir influence has helped elevate my playing and just being around Steve is a master class on how to be a successful artist and a decent human being,\u201d he continued. In true KBB form, the sound of the new album honors a distinctive blend of Southern Rock that is both progressive and rooted in tradition.\n\nWhile Kenneth currently resides in Los Angeles, he originally hails from the South. Born in Virginia, he spent some of his formative years in Alabama before his family settled in the musically rich town of Gainesville, Florida. From a very young age, he realized his passion for creating music and has pursued it with vigor. He penned his first country song on an old guitar at the ripe age of 4 and became serious about the guitar at age 11.\n\nAfter moving to Nashville in 2001, Kenneth hit the road with a new sound steeped in tradition.\n\n\u2018With Lions,\u2019 out May 19, 2017 on Robo Records, was recorded at Dave\u2019s Room Studio in Hollywood, California. David Bianco (Bob Dylan, Lucinda Williams, Tom Petty) produced, mixed and engineered the album.

Also known for their phenomenal live show, the Nashville-based duo are now gearing up to make their Rounder debut with a sophomore album showcasing their boundless energy and tremendous generosity as songwriters and performers.\n\nDespite the deep sense of communion that infuses their music, Michael and Tanya hail from wildly different backgrounds. Originally from just outside Washington, D.C., Tanya discovered her supreme vocal skills at a young age and promptly pursued a career in music and acting. Meanwhile, Michael grew up in Cleveland and D.C., spending part of his childhood in homeless shelters and later enlisting in the U.S. Army.

Soon tasked with writing and performing songs in memoriam to his unit\u2019s fallen soldiers, Michael cultivated a distinct songwriting voice that he further developed upon returning home. After he and Tanya shared the stage at a music festival, the two began creating music together, eventually marrying and forming The War And Treaty. Their EP Down to the River arrived in July 2017, and the duo made their full-length debut with Healing Tide\u2014a widely acclaimed effort. The Associated Press called them, \u201c\u2026a powerhouse R&B duo who sound as though they were born to sing together,\u201d while Billboard went on to claim that, \u201cThe music world\u2026has definitely shown that it\u2019s ready to love The War and Treaty.\u201d\n\nThe War And Treaty have shared two new tracks from their forthcoming album that bring even more depth and dimension to their music.

Over the last month of rehearsals and impromptu live performances in Hamilton Park, near their rehearsal space in Jersey City, the three women quickly nailed the essence of the Red Molly sound, while hinting at inspiring new musical possibilities in the months of touring that lie ahead. \"We are busily reinventing fan favorites from our current recordings, while adding new material and collaborating on songwriting for the first time,\" says Gardner. \"This is an exciting time for the band; we're so thrilled that Molly has joined us,\" adds MacAllister.

Shortly after, Isaiah started learning music under the close introduction of his father Michael Sharkey. He would learn about different musical genres/styles from gospel music,(which came from growing up in the church) to jazz, R&B, blues, rock and funk music. It wasn't long after that Isaiah would become noticed by other musicians in the Chicago area for being a young new talent. Soon after , he started doing concerts in the church as well as sitting in local jazz club jams.\n\nAt the age of 14, Isaiah along with his father and brothers released their first album entitled,\"Skyliner\". This album displayed Isaiah's ability to play covers and some transcriptions from greats like Wes Montgomery and George Benson.\n\nShortly thereafter, Isaiah began his recording career as well as being a sideman for musical artists in the gospel genre such as Smokie Norful, Donald Lawrence, and Vanessa Bell Armstrong and others.\n\nAt the age of 18, he began touring with Ronald Isley as his lead guitarist and shortlythereafter he secured the opportunity to record two incredible albums with him.\n\nIn 2009, Isaiah started working with 4-Time Grammy award winner D'Angelo on his third album (Black Messiah - 2016 Grammy Award Winner for Best R&B Album) which secured Isaiah a 2016 Grammy Award for his work & contribution to the project.\n\nSince then, Isaiah has worked, recorded, and toured with numerous world renown & Grammy Award Winning artists such as, Patti Labelle, Christopher Martin (Coldplay), Paul Simon, Corrine Bailey Rae, Mike Posner, Keith Urban, Brian Mcknight, Boyz Il Men, Lalah Hathaway, Raphael Saadiq, Jennifer Hudson, Regina Bell, Ruben Studdard, Lupe Fiasco, Kelly Price, Faith Evans, Rance Allen, The Winans, The Clarke Sisters, Chris Dave and the DrumHedz, and many others.\n\nCurrently he is touring as a guitarist for John Mayer's2017The Search For Everything World Tour.\n\nNow, Sharkey is poised to finally take center stage as he fuses together his background in gospel, Jazz, R&B, Blues, Rock, and Funk to create an original sound with an unmistakable dose of soul.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jon Batiste ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8451675.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Social Music Jazz, American", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "There\u2019s something utterly awe-inspiring about Jon Batiste\u2019s combination of exuberant charisma, jaw- dropping talent and dapper sense of style.

They were nominated for a Grammy in 2013 for their second album \u2018The Life and Times Of\u2026\u2019. and, with acclaimed releases such as \u2018Vicennial...\u2019, \u2018On The Spot\u2019 and \u201cTake Cover\u201d, continue to exemplify their ability to honour their city\u2019s musical traditions while forging their own powerful legacy. Hot 8\u2019s incredible tale, which comes across in their life-affirming music, has also previously featured in Spike Lee\u2019s two New Orleans documentaries, When The Levees Broke and The Creek Don\u2019t Rise, and David Simon\u2019s HBO series Treme (in which the band played themselves), to add to extensive features across the world\u2019s media.\n\nMixing an old school street brass approach with funkier currents and hip hop vocals, Hot 8\u2019s magnificent originals are juxtaposed with fresh versions of Snoop Dogg, Stevie Wonder, The Specials, Basement Jaxx and of course their anthemic take on Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cSexual Healing\u201d.\nHot 8 Brass Band\u2019s rhythms are loose-limbed and hard-hitting, with most tracks featuring a sousaphone prominently. The legendary group have established themselves as a dominant force on New Orleans streets\u2014the band you want to dance behind during a Sunday second-line parade or witness jazz funeral.\nBrass band-related activities have been a vital part of New Orleans\u2019 African American community life for over a century, serving as an important source of celebration, bonding, strength, pride, and both individual and collective expression. Jazz funerals are among the most curious and well-known New Orleans brass band customs. As an exercise of the belief in \u201crejoicing at death,\u201d the jazz funeral juxtaposes grief and joy. Slow, sad hymns and dirges are played en route to the cemetery, followed by up-tempo songs and joyous second line dancing in a final procession away from the grave.\nThe city\u2019s traditional obsession with music, parades, dancing, and the rise of black benevolent organizations, has helped to maintain and support brass band activities and culture. Dozens of benevolent societies and groups known as \u201csocial aid & pleasure clubs\u201d sponsor weekly Sunday parades. Very different from New Orleans\u2019 better known Eurocentric Mardi Gras parades, the black social club events consist of three main parts: divisions of colorfully dressed social club members, one or more brass bands and the second line\u2014a crowd of up to several thousand people who follow and dance alongside the parade throughout its several-hour duration. The free-form second line dance performed by club members and the crowd, both of whom dance with umbrellas and handkerchiefs, is derived from West African processions. The intensity that builds from the constant creative interaction between hot music and improvised dancing often erupts into a euphoric dimension in which a sense of total freedom, equality, limitless power, and a spiritual redefining of earthly reality seem to overtake all of the participants. Many legendary and influential musicians who would migrate from New Orleans by the 1920s and influence the direction of American music\u2014among them King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, and Sidney Bechet\u2014got some of their early training and experience in street parades and funerals.\nThe story of the Hot 8 Brass Band has been one of tragedy and triumph. Over the years the Hot 8\u2019s ranks have been decimated by the deaths of four original members due to street violence and illness. The devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was a life-altering turning point; during which 80% of New Orleans flooded, untold numbers of inhabitants died, and long-term displacement and misery affected hundreds of thousands\u2014raised real concerns about the survival of the city and its indigenous cultural traditions. After being evacuated, displaced, and scattered across the country, the band regrouped and began touring the United States to encourage and support other displaced Katrina victims and promote New Orleans\u2019 recovery.\nHot 8 Brass Band are signed to Tru Thoughts, based in Brighton, UK.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sarah Siskind ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10357594.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Rock, Americana, Fusion", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Sarah Siskind built her music career in Nashville, TN and now lives in her home-state of North Carolina.

I\u2019ve never had voice lessons, and it wasn\u2019t until after graduating from college that I started teaching myself how to play guitar. So, if you\u2019d told me then that I\u2019d end up making a living as a singer-songwriter, I wouldn't have believed you. Even now, with the release of my fifth studio album, Morning Light, I can barely believe it.\n\nMy performing career began in the smoky corners of Knoxville, TN\u2019s restaurants and bars, singing cover songs for distracted drunks and underage college students. I didn\u2019t seriously consider pursuing a career in music until May 9, 2007, after an unexpected opportunity to open for John Legend at Knoxville\u2019s Tennessee Theatre. The guy that walked on stage that night, wasn\u2019t the same guy that walked off. One set, six songs in just thirty minutes, changed my life forever.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve shared a tour bus with Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Famers, performed in front of crowds of over 20,000 people, and been lucky enough to share the stage with artists like Brandi Carlile, Heart, Gavin DeGraw, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, James Blunt, Edwin McCain, Chris Isaak, and Daughtry, as well as tour Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, performing for our men and women in uniform stationed overseas.\n\nMusic has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It\u2019s taken me to parts of the world I would\u2019ve never seen and connected me with lifelong friends I would\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s given my life purpose. Without music, I may have never met the two greatest loves of my life, my wife, Mandy, and my daughter, Annabelle Rose Baker. However, at the same time, music almost tore my life apart.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2013, I was touring over 200 days a year. By many standards, I was living the dream, but life on the road was taking its toll. While my music career had never been better, my personal life had never been worse. At home, waiting for me, was the life that I\u2019d dreamed of, and I was missing it. First words were being spoken, first steps taken, and it was all passing me by like road signs on the highway. Sadly, the two people I was working hardest to protect, were the ones getting hurt the most.\n\nThen one day I walked into an empty house and found my wife\u2019s wedding ring on the kitchen table along with a note that read, \u201cI will not be sorry for the choice YOU made.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, success as a singer-songwriter didn\u2019t seem nearly as important if it meant failing as a husband and as a father. I was at an intersection in my life and a choice had to be made. I could continue down the road I was on, whatever the cost, or change my direction and come home.\n\nThankfully, I made the choice to refocus on my family, and in January of 2014, I put down my guitar and started picking up the pieces. I stopped recording and touring, and traded the stage lights, for front porch lights, but as it turns out, the day that I decided to stop making music, was the day a new chapter in my music career began.\n\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve learned is that you get what you give in this life. 5 years ago, I GOT a second chance, and everything that\u2019s happened has GIVEN me this moment.\n\nToday, I am a better husband. I\u2019m a better father, and hopefully, I\u2019m a better songwriter. Music may have tried to tear my family apart, but now it\u2019s graciously bringing us back together. So, I see music as a celebration of every wrong turn and right turn that has led me here, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t give thanks for that old wooden box with six strings.\n\nHere\u2019s to the hope that keeps us holding on and to never losing sight of the things that are truly important. Here\u2019s to the promise and possibility of each NEW DAY. Here\u2019s to the beauty of the present moment and to trying our best to make the most of it. The road here has not been easy, but over the last few years, I\u2019ve learned that if you look hard enough, the shadows always show us the light.

It\u2019s a journey that has seen the country-rocker tour with superstars like Taylor Swift and Alan Jackson, play to over 50,000 people in Nashville at the world\u2019s biggest country music festival and build a large, devoted following as he\u2019s played the length and breadth of his native land and across the USA. Morgan has made his mark on the Australian musical landscape with a sound that fused contemporary country with melodic rock, fueled by a unique passion and energy all Morgan\u2019s own. His music is driven by an optimism shaped by life\u2019s bumpy journey, a faith in the power of love and hard work to overcome the obstacles we all face every day. Growing up in the working class beach city of Newcastle in NSW, Morgan turned the blue-collar ethic of his neighborhood into a relentless drive for energy and connection in his live shows. After seeing him whip a festival crowd into a frenzy, Warner Music Australia offered Morgan a recording contract. In 2013, after releasing two hit EPs that yielded three #1 singles, Morgan was named New Oz Artist of the Year at the CMC Music Awards. The fan voted award solidified his status as the hottest young performer in Australian country and was followed by four more trophies over the next two years, including back-to-back Male Oz Artist of the Year awards. Soon Morgan returned to Nashville to record his debut album with an all-star group of A-list musicians and Nashville based Aussie ex-pat producer Jedd Hughes. \u201cTo hear guys who played on the songs that inspired me to become a musician, playing on my songs, blew my mind,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cIt reminded me of why I was doing this in the first place and pushed me to take my vocals and guitar playing on the album to the next level\u201d. The songs that make up Morgan Evans are the result of a relentless songwriting schedule for almost a year that took Morgan to Nashville and back, and saw him tap into the deepest parts of himself. Morgan wrote eleven of the twelve tracks - some by himself, some with local artists and many with A-list Nashville writers. The album, released in March 2014, immediately shot to #1 on the iTunes and ARIA Country Album Charts and debuted at #20 on the ARIA Mainstream Album Chart. The impact of the acclaimed album has been immense \u2013 3 #1 singles (One Eye for an Eye, Best I Never Had and record-equaling Like A Tornado) and his first APRA nominations just for starters. The release also garnered international attention, leading to an invitation to return to Nashville\u2019s massive CMA Music Festival and perform at the legendary Grand Ole Opry, which prompted William Morris Endeavor \u2013 the world\u2019s largest talent agency \u2013 to sign Morgan up for international representation. Morgan\u2019s charisma and talent for engaging audiences led to his signing as the face of Foxtel\u2019s Country Music Channel, which has already seen him nominated for an ASTRA Award and a TV Week Logie Award \u2013 a first for an Australian country music star. He hosts television coverage of the CMC Rocks music festival, artist interviews and the CMC Music Awards. He was joined in 2016 by international co-host Kelsea Ballerini for the live national broadcast. A major career milestone was capped off when Morgan received a message from Grammy-winners Lady Antebellum informing him that he\u2019d been awarded the prestigious 2015 CMA Global Artist Award. The award recognizes outstanding achievement by an international country star in furthering the popularity of country music in their home country. Morgan joins an exceptional list of previous winners including Tommy Emmanuel, Kasey Chambers and Lee Kernaghan. Since then, Morgan has his sights set once again on Nashville, relocating to Music City where he has been writing with the A-list of songwriters for his upcoming US debut release and recently made return performances to CMA Music Fest and the Grand Ole Opry. His growing fanbase in both Australia and the USA is eagerly awaiting new music from Morgan, expected to be released later this year. http://www.morganevansmusic.com \"Kiss Somebody\" Out Now: https://wmna.sh/me_kisssomebod Twitter: @Morgan_Evans Instagram: @morganevansmusic Snapchat: themorganevans", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Clap Your Hands Say Yeah ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8315551.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Indie Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s 2005 self-released debut album set a precedent for how bands might begin to approach making music independently. The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions. We have to build something to last, rather than just build it because it looks good at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Annie Zeleski", "otherInfo": "donate:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/Ounsworth"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Josh Vietti ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10376298.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Hip-hop, Jazz, R&b, Rnb-soul, Christian/gospel, Hip Hop, Classical, Gospel, Pop, R&b/soul, Christian-gospel", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Contact Josh Vietti at bookings@joshvietti.com For more information please visit his website: http://www.joshvietti.com https://youtu.be/DXoj5KIyJSo", "otherInfo": "What\u2019s up everybody!

Shorter has recorded dozens of albums as a leader, and appeared on dozens more with others. Many of his compositions have become standards.\n\nShorter was born in Newark, New Jersey, and attended Newark Arts High School. He was encouraged by his father to take up the saxophone as a teenager (his brother Alan became a trumpeter). After graduating from New York University in 1956 Shorter spent two years in the US Army, during which time he played briefly with Horace Silver, and after his discharge from the army with Maynard Ferguson.\n\nIn 1959 Shorter joined Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers. He stayed with Blakey for five years, and eventually became musical director for the group. In 1964, Miles Davis persuaded Shorter to leave Blakey and join the Miles Davis Quintet alongside Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams. Davis had been searching for a saxophonist to replace John Coltrane for some time, and the new quintet is considered by many to have been Davis's strongest working group. Shorter composed extensively for Davis (\"Prince of Darkness\", \"ESP\", \"Footprints\", \"Sanctuary\", and many others; on some albums he provided half of the compositions).\n\nHerbie Hancock had this to say of Shorter's tenure in the group: \"The master writer to me, in that group, was Wayne Shorter. He still is a master. Wayne was one of the few people who brought music to Miles that didn't get changed.\" Davis said: \"Wayne is a real composer. He writes scores, write the parts for everybody just as he wants them to sound. He also brought in a kind of curiosity about working with musical rules. If they didn't work, then he broke them, but with musical sense; he understood that freedom in music was the ability to know the rules in order to bend them to your own satisfaction and taste.\"\n\nSimultaneously with his time in the Miles Davis quintet, Shorter recorded several albums for Blue Note Records, featuring almost exclusively his own compositions. He also recorded occasionally as a sideman (again, mainly for Blue Note) with Donald Byrd, McCoy Tyner, Grachan Moncur III, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, and band mates Hancock and Williams. Until 1968 he played tenor saxophone exclusively; by the early 1970s, however, he chiefly played soprano saxophone.\n\nShorter remained in Davis's band after the breakup of the quintet in 1968, playing on early jazz fusion recordings including In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew (both 1969). His last live dates and studio recordings with Davis were in 1970.\n\nIn 1970, along with keyboardist Joe Zawinul (also a veteran of the Miles Davis group), Shorter formed Weather Report. Other original members were bassist Miroslav Vitous, percussionist Airto Moreira, and drummer Alphonse Mouzon. Shorter and Zawinul co-led the group until late 1985 with a variety of other musicians, and separately wrote most of Weather Report's material. Shorter also recorded critically acclaimed albums as leader, notably Native Dancer, which featured Brazilian composer and vocalist Milton Nascimento, and Atlantis.\n\nAfter leaving Weather Report, Shorter continued to record and lead groups in jazz fusion styles, and contributed to several albums by Joni Mitchell. He has also maintained an occasional working relationship with Herbie Hancock, including appearances on several of Hancock's albums, the VSOP band (essentially a revival of the 1960s Miles Davis quintet with Freddie Hubbard substituting for Davis), and a tribute album recorded shortly after Davis's death with Hancock, Carter, Williams and Wallace Roney.\n\nShorter formed his current band in 2000, the first permanent acoustic group under his leadership. The quartet is composed of pianist Danilo Perez, bassist John Patitucci, and drummer Brian Blade. Two albums of live recordings featuring this quartet have been released (Footprints Live (2001) and Beyond the Sound Barrier (2005)). The quartet has received great acclaim from fans and critics, and the musicians have come to consider themselves family on and off stage.

It\u2019s the first album Costello has made with The Imposters since the 2008 release of \u2018Momofuku\u2019 and his first new album since the acclaimed 2013 Roots collaboration, \u2018Wise Up Ghost\u2019.\n\nAnyone anywhere in the world who has seen Elvis Costello and The Imposters live can testify to their unmitigated swagger. Costello\u2019s suspicion that it was time to return to the studio was confirmed while on the \u2018Imperial Bedroom & Other Chambers\u2019 tour of the USA, last summer and he realized the power and sheer musicality of The Imposters had never really been fully captured on one record.\n\n\u201cI knew if we could make an album with the scope of \u2018Imperial Bedroom\u2019 and some of the beauty and emotion of \u2018Painted From Memory\u2019, we would really have something\u201d, said Costello.\n\n\u2018Look Now\u2019 is an outstanding 12-strong addition to his song catalogue. Most of the titles were written solely by Elvis Costello although, \u2018Don\u2019t Look Now\u2019 and \u2018Photographs Can Lie\u2019 were co-written with Burt Bacharach, who makes a guest appearance, leading The Imposters from the piano for those two ballads.\n\nAnother song to which Bacharach contributed, \u2018He\u2019s Given Me Things\u2019 features some of the best singing Elvis has ever recorded, while \u2018Burnt Sugar Is So Bitter\u2019 was written with Carole King and closes with a serpentine horn line winding around Steve Nieve\u2019s atmospheric keyboard parts.\n\nThe album was co-produced by Elvis and Sebastian Krys - the Latin Grammy Producer of the Year for 2007 and 2015, whose love and understanding of music spans both hemispheres.\n\nSebastian had worked extensively with Pete and Davey in the Los Angeles studios, so it\u2019s no surprise that this dynamic rhythm section was incredibly well-prepared for the recording sessions. \u201cWhen Pete and Davey are in this kind of rare form, it\u2019s wise to get on the back-beat with your Telecaster and stay out of their way\u201d, said Costello.\n\nSpeaking of his own role as co-producer, Costello said, \u201cI had all of the orchestrations and vocal parts in my head or on the page before we played a note, so it was essential that I worked closely with Steve Nieve to maintain the light and space in the arrangements and allow him to shine.\u201d\n\nCostello completed the picture by adding both guitar and his own vibraphone or celesta parts to his orchestrations but remarked, \u201cSebastian was there to make sure only the essential notes got onto the record, whether it was a fuzz-tone guitar or jazz bassoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the final mixing, Sebastian did a beautiful job of keeping everything present but always lead by emotion or narrative, although when balancing the band, my voice and the quartet of woodwinds and horns that I\u2019d written for \u2018Stripping Paper\u2019, I told him to \u201cJust trust the blur.\u201d\n\nFrom today, fans who pre-order the 12-track standard or the 16-song deluxe album from digital retailers will instantly receive a download of two of the album\u2019s standout tracks \u2018Under Lime\u2019 and \u2018Unwanted Number\u2019.\n\nAsked for a further comment on the \u201cInstant Gratification\u201d phenomenon, Costello said, \u201cThat\u2019s just the latest record business gimmick-speak for something you can get right away.

His mother was the maid Maria do Carmo Nascimento. When he was just a few months old, the boy was adopted by the family for whom his mother had previously worked: the couple Josino Brito Campos (a banker, mathematics teacher and electronic technician) and L\u00edlia Silva Campos (a music teacher). He lived in the boroughs of Laranjeiras and Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro. When he was 18 months old, his biological mother died and he moved with his adoptive parents to the city of Tr\u00eas Pontas, in the State of Minas Gerais.\n\nIn the earlier stages of his career, Nascimento played in two samba groups, Evolussamba and Sambacana. In 1963 he moved to Belo Horizonte, and his friendship with the Borges brothers led to the Clube da Esquina (\"corner club\") movement. Other members included Beto Guedes, Toninho Horta, Wagner Tiso, and Flavio Venturini.\n\nNascimento is famous for his chime-clear falsetto and tonal range, as well for highly acclaimed songs such as \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o da Am\u00e9rica (Song from America)\" and \"Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Estudante (Student's Heart)\". The lyrics of \"Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Estudante\" remembers the funeral of the student Edson Lu\u00eds, killed by police officers in 1968. The song became the hymn for the diretas J\u00e1 campaign in 1984 and it was also played in the funeral of the late president Tancredo Neves the next year, who died before assuming the presidency.\n\nWhile his reputation within Brazil was firmly established with his Clube da Esquina works, Nascimento's international breakthrough came with his appearance on jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter's 1974 album Native Dancer. This led to widespread acclaim, and collaborations with American stars such as Paul Simon, James Taylor, and Pat Metheny.\n\nThrough his friendship with guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, Nascimento came to work with the pop-rock band Duran Duran in 1993. Nascimento co-wrote and performed (in the Portuguese language) the song \"Breath After Breath\", featured on the band's 1993 album Duran Duran. He also performed with the band in concert when they toured in Brazil, in support of that album.\n\nNascimento earned a Grammy award for \"Best World Music Album\" in 1998 for his album Nascimento, and was also nominated in 1991 and 1995.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Nascimento", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pedrito Martinez ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9616665.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Salsa, Latin", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rosie Perez ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://jazzfoundation.org/covid19fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Eve & The Exiles ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8440811.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Rock N Roll, Blues", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Blues grooves, Texas roots and trashy garage", "otherInfo": "Eve Monsees & Mike Buck play every Thursday evening as part of their Live In Exile series!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Blue Water Highway ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10375462.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Alternative, Rock, Indie, Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Listen now: https://Blue-Water-Highway.lnk.to/0KrUBba\n\nBlue Water Highway comes from the working class, coastal town background that has informed the work of so many of rock\u2019s greatest writers and artists.

His musical style ranges from classical to pop.\n\nAfter only one year in the music department at Carnegie Mellon University, his choice school, Groban left when he was offered a recording contract at Warner Bros. Records through David Foster's own 143 Records imprint. With regard to signing Groban, Foster said: \"I love his natural ability in the pop and rock arena, but I love his sense of classics even more. He's a true musical force to be reckoned with\" [5]. Therefore, under Foster's influence, Groban's first album focused more on the classics with songs such as \"Gira Con Me\" and \"Alle Luce Del Sole,\" the first ones decided on by Foster and Groban.\n\nSoon after being picked up by David Foster, Groban went on to perform \"There For Me\" with Sarah Brightman on her 2000-2001 La Luna Tour, featured on her \"La Luna\" Concert DVD, and made his recording debut by singing \"For Always\" with Lara Fabian on the movie soundtrack to A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001). He also became involved in many benefit shows, including the following: \"The Andre Agassi Grand Slam Event For Children\", singing alongside Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Don Henley and Robin Williams; \"Muhammad Ali's Fight Night Foundation\" which honored Michael J. Fox and others; \"The Family Celebration\" (2001) which was co-hosted by President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and David E. Kelley and his wife, Michelle Pfeiffer; and Michael Milken's CapCure event, which raises funds for cancer research.\n\nIn May 2001, Groban played the role of Malcolm Wyatt in the season finale of the television series Ally McBeal, performing \"You're Still You.\" The series creator David E. Kelley was impressed at Groban's performance at The Family Celebration event, and, based on the audience reaction to Groban's singing, Kelley created a character for Josh in this finale. The character of Malcolm Wyatt was so popular, with 8,000 emails from fans, that Groban was asked to come back the next season to reprise his role and perform \"To Where You Are.\"\n\nOn November 20, 2001, Groban's self-titled debut album Josh Groban was released and, over the next year, it went from gold to double-platinum.\n\nOn February 24, 2002, Groban performed \"The Prayer\" with Charlotte Church at the closing ceremonies of the Winter Olympics, and by November, he had his own PBS special Josh Groban In Concert (2002). The following month, he performed \"To Where You Are\" and \"The Prayer\" at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, and joined The Corrs, Ronan Keating, Sting, Lionel Richie and others for a holiday performance at the Vatican in Rome, Italy.\n\nOn November 11, 2003, his second album Closer was released. Josh himself said that he believed that this second album was a better reflection of him and that his audience would be able to get a better idea of him personally from listening to it. \"What most people know about me, they know through my music. This time, I've tried to open that door as wide as possible. These songs are a giant step closer to who I really am and what my music is all about. Hence the title\".\n\nTwo months after Closer was released, it rose on the Billboard charts from number 11 to number one.

But the South Korea born, New Mexico raised performer hardly realized just how dynamically his skills on the instrument would mesh with his ultimate development as a rocker in the popular regional bands Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and now, his emergence as a powerful and emotional singer/songwriter in his own right. On his debut album These Illusions, Park plays violin and acoustic guitar in addition to reaching out to acoustic rock fans everywhere with his inimitable vocals. Because of the mostly personal nature of the songs, the compelling 11-track collection rolls like a fascinating chronology of the 27-year-old singer\u2019s life, beginning with tunes he wrote when he was an engineering student at New Mexico State in his now adopted hometown of Las Cruces. He was also building his catalog of songs as he played violin and contributed backing vocals for several years in two well known regional bands: the mostly cover band Live Bait and the \u201cscreamo\u201d metalcore/hardcore group Kiss To Betray. Playing in Live Bait, his violin came in very handy for those Dave Matthews songs and it helped him take songs like Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d to a transcendent level. Live Bait won the local college radio station KRUXFEST for \u201cBest New Alternative Band\u201d in 2005 and Kiss To Betray won the Las Cruces 2006 Battle of the Bands and later played at well known venues around the country like Headhunters in Austin, The Viper Room in L.A. and hotspots in Phoenix. As a solo artist, Park has since headlined regularly at local clubs like El Patio Bar and Hurricane Alley, the Albuquerque haunts the Launch Pad and Rally\u2019s Pub on 4th Street, and in Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix and even Colorado Springs. He recently posted two live performance videos on his myspace (myspace.com/danielparkmusic), one of which features his unique looping technique which allows him to play violin and guitar \u201csimultaneously\u201d on the same song. While Park enjoyed his time in Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and the notoriety he received as a featured performer, in some ways he felt he was always gearing up for his eventual breakthrough to the forefront as his own artist. In the months leading up to the breakup of Kiss To Betray, Park gathered his best material, entered what kiddingly refers to as \u201ca local ghetto studio\u201d and started to come to grips with These Illusions. While many of the tracks on the album have their roots in romantic relationships, the hypnotic and percussive, acoustic guitar driven title cut cuts to the core of his desire to find his own creative path in life\u2014even if it means going against the mainstream expectations of our society. Other songs tap slightly into his lifelong search for identity as an Asian born man adopted (along with two of his siblings) by a white American family. Other key tracks on These Illusions include the jangling, high energy \u201cTimes Have Changed,\u201d which laments the shift in life as his significant other chooses to move on. The graceful, easy strumming ballad \u201cWhat We Should Be\u201d is another heartbreaker about learning to accept the changes in a relationship when one person leaves to pursue his or her dreams\u2014while still celebrating the memories. Park spins a different perspective .., going even deeper and more introspective .. in Me,\u201d a song about a man who hits rock bottom and realizes his need to adjust his course. \"Daniel Park has distilled what it is to be a singer songwriter in the late oughts, and in doing this, has created a blueprint that every individual with an acoustic guitar and a microphone should follow for the next decade.\" - James @ NeuFutur.com www.danielparkmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Prana Crafter ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8672564.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Prana Crafter session of Kosmic Psych for Hoover Public Library"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bettye LaVette ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8294634.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "R&b", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bettye LaVette is no mere singer.

The band features Avi Salloway (Bombino/Hey Mama/Avi & Celia) joined by an inspired cast of singular artists who have performed across five continents including concerts at the Coachella Music & Arts Festival, Newport Folk Festival, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Montreal Jazz Fest, Carnegie Hall, and Lincoln Center. From 2013-16, Salloway toured the globe with Bombino, the Tuareg guitar hero from Niger, Africa. While on the journey and since returning, Salloway wrote the material on the band\u2019s latest album, Strike the Match (Sand & Gold Records).\n\nSalloway has been bringing these songs to life with the Wylder Family, a group of dear friends and musical kindred spirits. In between shows, the band spent ten days recording at Eyeland Studio in the Columbus Theatre, home of The Low Anthem. The music weaves together American folk and rock with sensibilities from the Sahara Desert: think Andrew Bird meets Ali Farka Toure, Pete Seeger and Talking Heads. Strike the Match expands on American musical traditions, building a bridge to their African roots and coloring the songs with experimental art-rock textures: gilded string lines, synthesizers, and angular guitars. Mother Earth is at its center, surrounded by stories of love, conflict, change and dreams.\n\nSalloway shares, \u201cThis album is a reflection of the world we\u2019ve been born into, one filled with supernatural beauty and incomprehensible struggle. My social and environmental activism work has taken me to territories that have been colonized and occupied in the Middle East, North and West Africa, the South Pacific and Standing Rock, here at home. I have experienced the creative spirit rise up in the face of darkness and adversity and it is the most life-affirming feeling I have witnessed. This record has become the artifact at the intersection of these moving events in my life.\u201d\n\nOn Strike the Match, Billy Wylder grapples with some of the most pressing questions of our time. How can we reorient ourselves to nature as a source of strength for resistance to the forces that seek to destroy and profit from it? How can we use music to move beyond capitalism and nationalism to a global society for the benefit of the earth and all living beings? How can we reconcile our painful history with hope and optimism for the future? The album calls the listener to engage with these questions and illuminates the path towards participating in the creation of a more just and sustainable world.\n\nThe band is named after Salloway\u2019s grandmother, Wilma \u201cBillie\u201d Hotaling.\u201d She was a prolific painter, author, musician, and educator. Billie wrote Count the Stars Through the Cracks, a harrowing historical fiction novel about a young brother and sister\u2019s escape from the Antebellum South along the Underground Railroad. Billie\u2019s writing was raw and fearless and her book delivered a powerful narrative about America\u2019s hard truths and the long journey to freedom. \u201cMy grandma Billie led by example, showing me what creativity looks like and how critical art can be as a form of love and resistance. She is part of me and part of the Wylder family,\u201d Salloway reflects.\n\n\u201cRaised in a progressive home and taught to play by Pete and John Seeger, activism is a constant in Avi Salloway\u2019s life and art.

Timeless and timely, it's a classic sound with every word sang from the heart, driven forward by a mix of southern storytelling, Bible Belt twang, and Owens' big, booming baritone.\n\nFresh out of the studio, Owens has just finished recording his latest album due to release at year\u2019s end. He traveled to Texas for this project to record in The Panhandle House Studio enlisting the talents of JT Corenflos | Electric Guitar ( Alan Jackson, George Jones, Charley Pride, George Strait), Mitchell Smithey | Steele Guitar (Ray Price, Lee Ann Rimes, TG Sheppard, Gary Stuart), Dale Morris Jr. | Fiddle (Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Ray Price, Marty Stuart, Travis Tritt), Kerry Huckaba | Bass Guitar (The Hansons, The White River Band), Jay Brown | Piano (Canyon, Ty Herndon), and Andrew Raley | Drums (Deryl Dodd). Together, they captured a sound filled with fiddle, pedal steel and all the hallmarks of classic country music. Ten of the eleven tracks are penned by veteran writer Galen Griffin (Luke Bryan, Joe Diffie, Craig Morgan, Clay Walker) and magically Engineered and Produced by Nick \u201cAce\u201d Lutz (David Alan Coe, Ty Herndon, Little Texas, Ronnie Milsap, Kellie Pickler). This is an album filled with music intended to take the listener back to an earlier era in Country Music reminiscent of a simpler time. Owens shines brightly delivering each song with the same supersized voice that once shook the pews of his hometown church as the musicians expertly lay the sounds of Dance Halls long gone.\n\nLong before he hand-built his career in the honky-tonks and country clubs of the southeast, Owens grew up in rural Alabama. In many ways, it was a classic American upbringing, filled with family, faith, and music. Owens shines a light on those old-school values with his debut album Where I\u2019m Coming From and his newest release It\u2019s A Southern Thing, working closely with a roster of country music's top songwriters \u2014 including Bob Diperio, Greg Barnhill, Tony Stampley, Wynn Varble, Brian Callihan and Trent Willmon \u2014 for his most upbeat collection of songs to date.\n\n\"Like a lot of my favorite country singers, I grew up singing Gospel music,\" says Owens, who grew up listening to artists like Randy Travis and Keith Whitley. \"I grew up the same way, and I've stayed true to my Traditional Country roots. I'm still singing about going to church, eating fried chicken, and keeping it country. Why wouldn't I? Once you start trying to be something you're not, that's when you lose track of where you're headed.\"\n\nLongtime country music journalist Robert K. Oermann agrees, pointing to Owens' traditional approach as his strongest weapon. \"I like to think that there are cycles in [country] music,\" Oermann explains. \"Usually, the pendulum swings out and the Pop-Country people bring in a whole lot of new listeners, and then the new listeners discover real Country music. Then there's usually a swing back to more traditional styles. I hope we're on the cusp of that\u2026 and if we are, Shane is perfectly positioned.\"\nA self-made road warrior who was recently named \"Independent Artist of the Year\" by MusicRow Reveals 2018 Country Breakout Awards, Owens continues to maintain an active schedule of listening room and honky tonk shows along with festival appearances. He made his Grand Ole Opry debut in 2017. He also appeared at summertime events like CMA Music Festival and Jamboree In the Hills, both of which were voted as the top two American country music festivals of the year. Cracker Barrel has picked Owens' music to appear in several of the store's exclusive releases, including Country Faith America and Country Faith Love Songs, while Netflix included his song \"Country Never Goes Out of Style\" in the popular series The Ranch. No wonder Rolling Stone Country named Shane Owens one of the magazine's \"10 New Country Artists You Need to Know!\"\n\nNew music. New album. New shows. Shane Owens continues to more forward, but he also remains rooted in the sound that launched his career, breathing new life into a sound that's at once fresh and familiar. \"I've grown my business the old-school way,\" he explains. \"I played the honky-tonks for years. I developed myself and my sound. It can be tough when you've got a traditional sound, but I can't be anything I'm not. If it was easy to do, everybody would do it. And I'm nowhere near done doing it.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Marielle Kraft ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10118334.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Pop, Indie Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "An indie pop singer-songwriter based outside of Philly", "otherInfo": "Marielle Kraft online concert\n8pm EST\n\nInstagram: @mariellekraft\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/mariellekraft"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Elew ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/198485.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://jazzfoundation.org/covid19fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jared & The Mill ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8338992.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Western Indie Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jared & The Mill is a southwestern indie rock band, formed in 2011 in Phoenix, Arizona.

Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage. Whether Love Saves The Day makes one dollar or a million isn\u2019t a big concern to him. It stands as a huge success because he made the gritty, honest album that he intended by \u201ckeeping it raw, keeping it immediate, keeping it real.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that he has honed over the years: \u201cbe original and be true to what you do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To Benefit Jannus Landing, St. Petersburg"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "T Sisters ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8899665.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Indie Folk, Pop, Americana", "Time": "12:45 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Distinguished by close harmonies, catchy melodies and potent lyricism, the T Sisters have created a refreshing brew of indie-folk/Americana music.

Gros mixes all the sounds of New Orleans - funk, trad jazz, brass band, blues - and makes it his own signature gumbo. His new solo album Central City, shows Gros capturing New Orleans\u2019 distinct feel-good charm with help from some of its\u2019 most renowned players.\n\nGros began playing gigs when he was just fifteen years old but didn\u2019t truly kick off his career until after graduating from Loyola in 1989 with a degree in French Horn performance. During the seminal years that followed, the young man cut his teeth as a solo performer on Bourbon Street while also developing a reputation as a formidable sideman. He backed up some of the biggest names in the Crescent City,: such as Meters bassist George Porter Jr. and guitarist Snooks Eaglin. Studying under mentors decades his senior, Gros absorbed a lifetime of lessons in only a few years and quickly became part of the direct lineage of New Orleans music.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2013, Gros began his transition into the spotlight by leading Papa Grows Funk, a highly revered group that mixed hard-hitting funk grooves with often unpredictable jazz spontaneity. The band released six critically-acclaimed studio albums, including Needle in the Groove, which was co-produced by New Orleans legend and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Allen Toussaint. The group\u2019s weekly gigs at the world-famous Maple Leaf became a staple for both locals and tourists alike, eventually leading to Gros touring in far off countries like Japan and Brazil.\n\nHurricane Katrina\u2019s devastation in 2005 caused Gros to reanalyze his role in the world.\n\n\u201cBefore Katrina, I was simply a New Orleans musician, but after Katrina, I told my story of what New Orleans meant to me and why it is culturally significant to the world. It was at that point I became a New Orleans cultural ambassador, who happens to be a loudmouth, piano-playing, singer-songwriter.\u201d\n\nAfter Papa Grows Funk dissolved, Gros briefly returned to sideman work, playing organ for a series of all-star tributes to Dr. John and the Neville Brothers. The 2014 Dr. John tribute, The Music Mojo of Dr. John, was later released as a critically-acclaimed live album that featured Gros playing with Bruce Springsteen, Mavis Staples, Jason Isbell, and John Fogerty. More importantly for Gros, those tribute concerts allowed him to play alongside his two biggest influences: the Doctor and Art Neville, both of whom passed in 2019.\n\nIn 2016, Gros returned to the spotlight yet again with his second solo album River\u2019s On Fire, the much anticipated follow up to his 2004 debut Day\u2019s End. Co-produced by Gros and Tracy Freeman (Harry Connick Jr, Rebirth Brass Band, Bonerama), the album\u2019s fiery funk rock showed how Gros had matured as both a songwriter and bandleader. It firmly established Gros\u2019 identity as a solo force.\n\nNow, Gros is preparing to release Central City, his third solo album. The album is a collection of classic New Orleans songs, both new and old, filtered through his decades of dedication to his craft. The album features Gros\u2019 feel good originals alongside his takes on beloved songs by Allen Toussaint, Lloyd Price, and John Prine. Joining Gros on the album are a who\u2019s who in the keepers of the New Orleans tradition, including singer Ivan Neville (Dumpstaphunk), drummer Herlin Riley (Wynton Marsalis), banjoist Don Vappie, guitarist Brian Stoltz (Neville Brothers), trumpeter Mark Braud (Harry Connick Jr.), trombonist Mark Mullins (Bonerama), clarinetist Tim Laughlin, and his former boss George Porter Jr. (Meters). Together, they perfectly exploit the similarities between New Orleans jazz and early rock 'n' roll on songs such as \"Yeah Yeah Yeah\" and \"Personality.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m walking in the same path [as Dr. John, Allen Toussaint, and Art Neville,]\u201d explains Gros. \u201cI\u2019ve been following them my whole life. Now, they\u2019re no longer in front of me. They\u2019ve gotten off the path but the path is still very clear.\u201d\nGros began playing gigs when he was just fifteen years old but didn\u2019t truly kick off his career until after graduating from Loyola in 1989 with a degree in French Horn performance.

The group\u2019s weekly gigs at the world-famous Maple Leaf became a staple for both locals and tourists alike, eventually leading to Gros touring in far off countries like Japan and Brazil.\n\nHurricane Katrina\u2019s devastation in 2005 caused Gros to reanalyze his role in the world.\n\n\u201cBefore Katrina, I was simply a New Orleans musician, but after Katrina, I told my story of what New Orleans meant to me and why it is culturally significant to the world. It was at that point I became a New Orleans cultural ambassador, who happens to be a loudmouth, piano-playing, singer-songwriter.\u201d\n\nAfter Papa Grows Funk dissolved, Gros briefly returned to sideman work, playing organ for a series of all-star tributes to Dr. John and the Neville Brothers. The 2014 Dr. John tribute, The Music Mojo of Dr. John, was later released as a critically-acclaimed live album that featured Gros playing with Bruce Springsteen, Mavis Staples, Jason Isbell, and John Fogerty. More importantly for Gros, those tribute concerts allowed him to play alongside his two biggest influences: the Doctor and Art Neville, both of whom passed in 2019.\n\nIn 2016, Gros returned to the spotlight yet again with his second solo album River\u2019s On Fire, the much anticipated follow up to his 2004 debut Day\u2019s End. Co-produced by Gros and Tracy Freeman (Harry Connick Jr, Rebirth Brass Band, Bonerama), the album\u2019s fiery funk rock showed how Gros had matured as both a songwriter and bandleader. It firmly established Gros\u2019 identity as a solo force.\n\nNow, Gros is preparing to release Central City, his third solo album. The album is a collection of classic New Orleans songs, both new and old, filtered through his decades of dedication to his craft. The album features Gros\u2019 feel good originals alongside his takes on beloved songs by Allen Toussaint, Lloyd Price, and John Prine. Joining Gros on the album are a who\u2019s who in the keepers of the New Orleans tradition, including singer Ivan Neville (Dumpstaphunk), drummer Herlin Riley (Wynton Marsalis), banjoist Don Vappie, guitarist Brian Stoltz (Neville Brothers), trumpeter Mark Braud (Harry Connick Jr.), trombonist Mark Mullins (Bonerama), clarinetist Tim Laughlin, and his former boss George Porter Jr. (Meters). Together, they perfectly exploit the similarities between New Orleans jazz and early rock 'n' roll on songs such as \"Yeah Yeah Yeah\" and \"Personality.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m walking in the same path [as Dr. John, Allen Toussaint, and Art Neville,]\u201d explains Gros. \u201cI\u2019ve been following them my whole life. Now, they\u2019re no longer in front of me. They\u2019ve gotten off the path but the path is still very clear.\u201d", "otherInfo": "John \u201cPapa\u201d GroSTREAM #7: Live from Port Orleans Brewing Co.\nThursday, May 14th 8-9pm (CST)\nStreaming site: https://www.bandstream.live/live-show\n\nI am partnering with Port Orleans Brewing Company and Bandstream.live to perform my new record Central City in it\u2019s entirety.

Lockwood Porter's Communion in the Ashes is a rallying cry for the hopeless and heartbroken, its lyrics set to a soundtrack of anthemic heartland rock & roll. This is a record that addresses our modern-day social problems from a perspective of hope, encouraging those who listen to focus on activism and community-building rather than despair. Along the way, Porter delivers some of the most engaging, electrifying songs of his career, rooting these melodic calls-to-action in the stomp and epic swagger of a five-piece road band.\n\nBorn into a working-class family in rural Oklahoma, Porter launched his songwriting career after relocating to the San Francisco Bay Area, kicking things off with 2013's Judah's Gone. There, in the nation's most expensive real-estate market, he also taught classes to underprivileged students at an inner-city school, a job that gave him a close-up view of the nation\u2019s growing class divide and its many symptoms, including poverty, gentrification, and homelessness. As his cross-country touring increased, so did the presence of political and social issues within his music, with 2016's How to Dream Again taking influence from the socially-conscious works of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. After writing 2019's Communion in the Ashes, Porter returned to Oklahoma with the goal of contributing to a growing artistic community and, hopefully, affecting social change.\n\n\u201cThe tech boom of the last 10 years has totally transformed the whole Bay Area, and has essentially made it a playground for the rich. Working-class folks and artists aren't welcome there anymore, and this has manifested in rising housing costs, closure of music venues, and the proliferation of homeless tent cities,\u201d Porter divulges. \u201cIn the last verse of the title track, I can see in hindsight that I was saying a \u2018goodbye\u2019 to the Bay Area, even though I didn't know that I'd be leaving at the time.\u201d\n\nWith Communion In The Ashes, Porter crystallizes a sound that is uniquely his own: one that gatecrashes the borders between indie rock & roll, singer/songwriter folk, and Americana. Written alone on the acoustic guitar and recorded with Porter's band during a collaborative, five-day studio session in Chico, CA, the album champions togetherness as an antidote to the immense problems we face as a society. On the kinetic title track, a kick drum bangs out a steady pulse while Porter unveils his game plan: \"When the bridges are all burned, let's congregate the masses, let's hold a new communion in the ashes.\" The song doesn't turn a blind eye to the desperation of today's world; instead, it builds something new from the rubble, transforming desolation into hope. A similar feeling imbues the piano-propelled \"I Will Do No More A-Prayin\u2019,\" a secular hymn that nods to Porter's childhood days in the Southern Baptist church. If \"I Will Do No More A-Prayin\u2019\" evokes the solemnity of Sunday morning, though, the bulk of Communion in the Ashes rustles up the thrill of Saturday night. There are furiously strummed power chords, pounding percussion, vocal harmonies, and 80s-inspired synthesizers, shot through with a voice that's urgent, compelling, and quick to incite. These are songs about revolution and rebuilding, and Porter sings them accordingly, his voice echoing and rattling its way between the electric guitars and upright piano.\n\nGiven the album's communal emphasis, it's appropriate that Communion in the Ashes is also Porter's most collaborative release. All five band members contributed to the arrangement process, with drummer Peter Labberton pulling triple-duty as the album's engineer and mixer. The band worked swiftly, foregoing rehearsal in favor of instinctual performances and quick studio decisions. \"Get Back to the Wild,\" the one song not recorded live, gave the band a chance to experiment, building a two-bar drum and piano loop into a spiritually-minded song that examines the distance between human nature and human society. Porter and company looked to their own influences for cues, too, with Communion's touchstones running the gamut from Leonard Cohen\u2019s inventive songwriting and Tom Petty's concise melodies to Wilco's experimentation and War on Drugs' gorgeously textured tones. Even so, this is the most distinctive release in M. Lockwood Porter's catalog \u2014 an album that both nods to the past and pushes forward to the future, thanks in part to a full-band attack that lends fire, ferocity, and grit to the tracklist.\n\n\u201cI think the fully collaborative recording process was the biggest musical shift between recording How To Dream Again and Communion In The Ashes,\u201d explains Porter. \u201cJeremy Lyon has been playing in my live band since 2016, but this was the first M. Lockwood Porter album that he\u2019s worked on, and he brought a much wider palette of guitar tones to this album than I've used on past records. This is also the first time I\u2019ve recorded with synthesizers. I had given the band the vague direction that I wanted us to imagine ourselves as a \u2018dystopian gospel band\u2019 before we started recording, and my keyboardist Jeff Hashfield found a sound on his Prophet synthesizer that we ended up dubbing the \u2018Blade Runner church organ.\u2019 We ended up using it on nearly every song.\u201d\n\nThroughout Communion In The Ashes, Porter\u2019s electrifying \u201cdystopian gospel band\u201d explores how frightening our world can be. The record\u2019s enthralling cover art \u2014 designed by William Schaff, known for his longtime association with Songs: Ohia's Jason Molina \u2014 shines a light on that horrifying present, depicting a man (A preacher? An organizer? A demagogue?) addressing a crowd from the foreground of a burning, decaying city. With its Springsteen-sized catharsis, though, Communion in the Ashes offers listeners something new: a soundtrack with which to rise up, rebuild, and renew. Call it protest music if you'd like. Call it a political album if you must. Whatever the description, Communion in the Ashes packs the strongest punch of Porter's career, capturing not just one man's reaction to the present day, but an entire community's opportunity to better their own tomorrows.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Koah ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9094855.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "KOAH is an accomplished singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist active in both the United States East Coast and West Coast.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

Some of Kraus' biggest influences are LeAnn Rimes, Elton John, Phil Collins, Amy Grant, Gloria Estefan, Shania Twain, Faith Hill and various 80's rock artists.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Keith Kenny ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9369673.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Blues, Rock, Acoustic, Folk", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "If the audience at a Keith Kenny show were to close their eyes for the performance they would swear that there was a full band on stage. The audience, however, is too busy dancing to the one-man acts layered guitar riffs, foot stomping percussion, blues harmonica, and emotionally charged lyrics to even think about looking away.\nThe New Jersey native is able to emulate the sound of a full rock band with his percussive fingerstyle approach to the acoustic guitar and an array of effects pedals. Kenny has even customized a vintage red suitcase which has been dubbed \u201cThe Big Red Suitcase\u201d to use as a kick drum, which has appeared with him on stage for over a decade of live performances.\nHis debut appearances at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park paved the way for Kenny\u2019s developing one-man band show and led him into the national touring circuit and beyond. Over years of honing his craft on the road, Kenny caught the attention of one of his guitar idols, Mickey Melchiondo, a.k.a. Dean Ween from WEEN. Melchiondo recently asked Kenny to tour opening up for his new band, The Dean Ween Group, and has gained him new fans around the United States. Kenny has also been spreading his music internationally with multiple tours throughout Europe and performances in SE Asia to raise awareness about unexploded bombs. In recent years he has shared the stage with the likes of John Butler Trio, Keller Williams, WEEN, The Dean Ween Group, Leon Russell, John Hammond Jr., New Riders of the Purple Sage and John Kadlecik (Further & Dark Star Orchestra). In January of 2016, The Eagles of Death Metal released Kenny\u2019s version of \"I Love You All The Time\" as a part of their Pay it Forward Campaign to raise money for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.\nOn his latest self-titled release, Kenny teamed up with three-time Grammy Winning Producer Justin Guip (Sound engineer for Levon Helm and current touring drummer for Hot Tuna) to create a record that expanded on his signature one-man band sound. The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks. With an influential voice that lies somewhere between Neil Young and Jack White, Kenny delivers clear and concise visions of dynamic musical deliverance. Combining a deep dive into tone, originality and believability, he ushers the listener into his brand new living room of roots riddled rock and roll.\nNever going for the standard attack, he flies far from the 12-bar blues, three-chord rock and Americana stereotype to land some place between a rock and a new place. The album illustrates a highly skilled writer who utilizes the same down-home approach in his music as he does with his day-to-day interactions with others. It\u2019s a combination that will continue to see Kenny reach exciting new levels as he helps future fans \u201csee the light\u201d of his musical message.\nTo hear his full discography, watch recent videos, and check out upcoming tour dates visit www.KeithKenny.com\n(Excerpt from John Pfieffer & Jessica Smith of The Aquarian Weekly)", "otherInfo": "Virtual Tip Jar!\nVenmo: Keith-Kenny-1\nPaypal: Keith@KeithKenny.com or Paypal.me/KeithKenny\nCashApp: $KeithKenny\n\nMerchandise!

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jordan Fried ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10184282.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Improv Comedy, Filmmaker, Standup Comedy, Sketch Comedy, Videographer, Improvisation", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jordan Fried is a comedian and filmmaker from Warwick, NY.

Consisting of guitarist and vocalist Todd Tate alongside drummer Daniel Guaqueta, Sayla Dobro was brewed up in the Bay Area, between Marin and San Francisco. Originally created as a stage name for Tate\u2019s persona in a now defunct Marin bar-hopping band, \"The Deep Sounds of Bobby Peru\", Sayla Dobro has since evolved into a much more complex and mature getup.\n\nThe band really kicked off after Tate saw dobro guitar virtuoso Jerry Douglas play live - he instantly went out and bought a dobro guitar and starting writing and recording immediately. Now part of his namesake, Sayla Dobro is characterized by Tate\u2019s customized Regal RD-35 square neck dobro. Enter Colombian-raised, Mississippi-born multi-instrumentalist Daniel Guaqueta. The drummer and Tate came together through mutual friend Michael Starita, President of the San Francisco area Grammy chapter. Starita mixed the first two Sayla Dobro singles, \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d and \u201cJ-Train\u201d. During this time, he introduced Guaqueta and Tate and the rest was history.\n\nSayla Dobro\u2019s songs hearken seasoned folk-rockers like Beck and Calexico, thoughtfully self-produced and rough around the edges. It\u2019s no surprise that Sayla Dobro has been able to capture such a potent essence - the band\u2019s frontman and lead songwriter Todd Tate\u2019s industry experience runs deep. In the mid-nineties Tate\u2019s main focus was audio engineering at The Blue Room Studios, working on Grammy nominated Latin jazz with Carlos \u201cPatato\u201d Sanchez, and with popular rock artists like Train. On the brink of the millennium, Tate ditched full-time engineering and went to the other side of the glass to focus on making his own music. He made a rock record with a new group Life Love Misery (members of The Starship and Cacophony).\n\nMeanwhile, Guaqueta has a rich musical background of his own. He\u2019s written and released music with artists including Questions in Dialect, Buddy & The Squids, Mainframe Theory, and Storage 24. He\u2019s collaborated directly with Roy Mitchell-Cardenas (of Mutemath) and Mississippi rapper Kamikaze. His diverse background runs further; Guaqueta\u2019s visual artwork has earned honors for his music videos, including the Telly Award, the Addy Award, and the Ruma Award at Crossroads Film Festival.\n\nWith plans to release singles and videos \"very often\" in the upcoming months of 2016, Sayla Dobro is ready to hit the ground running. Supporters of the band\u2019s efforts to release a new single every month can download the band\u2019s single's as they are released in any format now at sayladobro.com/music or any online digital music service.

The audience, however, is too busy dancing to the one-man acts layered guitar riffs, foot stomping percussion, blues harmonica, and emotionally charged lyrics to even think about looking away.\nThe New Jersey native is able to emulate the sound of a full rock band with his percussive fingerstyle approach to the acoustic guitar and an array of effects pedals. Kenny has even customized a vintage red suitcase which has been dubbed \u201cThe Big Red Suitcase\u201d to use as a kick drum, which has appeared with him on stage for over a decade of live performances.\nHis debut appearances at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park paved the way for Kenny\u2019s developing one-man band show and led him into the national touring circuit and beyond. Over years of honing his craft on the road, Kenny caught the attention of one of his guitar idols, Mickey Melchiondo, a.k.a. Dean Ween from WEEN. Melchiondo recently asked Kenny to tour opening up for his new band, The Dean Ween Group, and has gained him new fans around the United States. Kenny has also been spreading his music internationally with multiple tours throughout Europe and performances in SE Asia to raise awareness about unexploded bombs. In recent years he has shared the stage with the likes of John Butler Trio, Keller Williams, WEEN, The Dean Ween Group, Leon Russell, John Hammond Jr., New Riders of the Purple Sage and John Kadlecik (Further & Dark Star Orchestra).

The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks. With an influential voice that lies somewhere between Neil Young and Jack White, Kenny delivers clear and concise visions of dynamic musical deliverance. Combining a deep dive into tone, originality and believability, he ushers the listener into his brand new living room of roots riddled rock and roll.\nNever going for the standard attack, he flies far from the 12-bar blues, three-chord rock and Americana stereotype to land some place between a rock and a new place. The album illustrates a highly skilled writer who utilizes the same down-home approach in his music as he does with his day-to-day interactions with others.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alice Dimicele ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8987963.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Acoustic, Folk, Folk Rock, Americana", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Alice DiMicele seeks to uplift the human experience through music.

Consisting of guitarist and vocalist Todd Tate alongside drummer Daniel Guaqueta, Sayla Dobro was brewed up in the Bay Area, between Marin and San Francisco. Originally created as a stage name for Tate\u2019s persona in a now defunct Marin bar-hopping band, \"The Deep Sounds of Bobby Peru\", Sayla Dobro has since evolved into a much more complex and mature getup.\n\nThe band really kicked off after Tate saw dobro guitar virtuoso Jerry Douglas play live - he instantly went out and bought a dobro guitar and starting writing and recording immediately. Now part of his namesake, Sayla Dobro is characterized by Tate\u2019s customized Regal RD-35 square neck dobro. Enter Colombian-raised, Mississippi-born multi-instrumentalist Daniel Guaqueta. The drummer and Tate came together through mutual friend Michael Starita, President of the San Francisco area Grammy chapter. Starita mixed the first two Sayla Dobro singles, \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d and \u201cJ-Train\u201d. During this time, he introduced Guaqueta and Tate and the rest was history.\n\nSayla Dobro\u2019s songs hearken seasoned folk-rockers like Beck and Calexico, thoughtfully self-produced and rough around the edges. It\u2019s no surprise that Sayla Dobro has been able to capture such a potent essence - the band\u2019s frontman and lead songwriter Todd Tate\u2019s industry experience runs deep. In the mid-nineties Tate\u2019s main focus was audio engineering at The Blue Room Studios, working on Grammy nominated Latin jazz with Carlos \u201cPatato\u201d Sanchez, and with popular rock artists like Train. On the brink of the millennium, Tate ditched full-time engineering and went to the other side of the glass to focus on making his own music. He made a rock record with a new group Life Love Misery (members of The Starship and Cacophony).\n\nMeanwhile, Guaqueta has a rich musical background of his own. He\u2019s written and released music with artists including Questions in Dialect, Buddy & The Squids, Mainframe Theory, and Storage 24. He\u2019s collaborated directly with Roy Mitchell-Cardenas (of Mutemath) and Mississippi rapper Kamikaze. His diverse background runs further; Guaqueta\u2019s visual artwork has earned honors for his music videos, including the Telly Award, the Addy Award, and the Ruma Award at Crossroads Film Festival.\n\nWith plans to release singles and videos \"very often\" in the upcoming months of 2016, Sayla Dobro is ready to hit the ground running. Supporters of the band\u2019s efforts to release a new single every month can download the band\u2019s single's as they are released in any format now at sayladobro.com/music or any online digital music service.

And now this commanding woman of soul is back with her original music and her EP \u201cFar From Paradise\u201d to set stages alight. The depths of her voice unlimited, she is already a fast festival favourite.\n\nKaren has that rare gift to communicate the unspeakable. Cameron Adams, from the Herald Sun, says, \u201cMs Andrews has one of those authentic sounds you hear. You can tell she has lived and loved.\u201d Her sensibility allows the audience to surrender to the music; the experience is mutually warm and commanding. Paul Sheehan from Sydney Morning Herald states, \u201cShe is one of the most original and dignified talents to emerge in Australian popular entertainment in a long time. She manages to be both imperial yet vulnerable.\u201d\n\nKaren had to know how to get the best from every instrument, every singer. To do so, she called upon the music she loved as a young girl \u2013 Soul. Blues and Gospel. In the crowded Andrews family home in Koonawarra, a young Karen listened to her brother\u2019s Motown records and the satin voice of Stevie Wonder. Singing along to those golden hits, and traditional Polynesian songs, was merely part of everyday family life; This would become the foundation of her original style \u2013 Oceanic Blues.\n\nOceanic Blues is the newest sub-genre of the Blues. Oceania\u2019s narrative tradition and the introduction of American Blues, Soul and Gospel since the 1960s, has shaped this distinctive style. The roots of the sound are gritty guitar, glowing valves, lush tremolo and deep reverb in a distinctively fluid Oceanic expression. This sound carries the mood and tones of Oceania expressed in rich, warm vocal tones.\n\nKaren Lee Andrews debuts her new sound and EP \u201cFar from Paradise\u201d. This EP mines the vibrant blues and soul at the heart of her musical heritage.\n\nAndrews mostly tours as a formidable trio, teaming up with Yanya Boston on drums and Adam Ventura on bass \u2013 two exceptional musicians. Each musician is outstanding in his or her own right, but the dynamic of the group is exhilarating to witness! The trio delivers a classic hard-hitting blues rock.

Josie saw through to his true intention, but she also saw that he was sincere about his music. Well, Tom went home and set to work arranging his music with a violin in mind. A rehearsal date was set, and one of the first songs they did was to become the title song on their first CD, Ready, Willing, and Able.\n\nTom had been in a number of rock bands, and they had always met an early demise. He was ready to try a different tactic for getting a band going. This time he was going to create a core of two people that could work together, and build from there.\n\nJosie had been wanting to get more into playing jazz violin. The spontaneity of improvisation was intriguing to her. Problem was, there wasn't a lot of opportunity for getting together with other jazz musicians. Her violin was always drowned out by the other instruments, and electric violins and violin pickups hadn't yet come into use.\n\nThe time was right for these two to get together. Tom's use of open tunings and fingerstyle guitar gave Josie the inspiration to improvise contrapuntal melodies. At first their music was a combination of folk and classical, which can be heard on their first CD.\n\nAs time went on ttheir sound evolved to encompass any musical inspiration that came their way.

Born in Las Cruces, NM and raised in Fort Collins, CO, Hoffman grew up singing and playing piano, drums and guitar. His father is the son of a New Mexican small businessman who was the owner of Hoffman's Melody Shop in Alamogordo, NM during the late 1940s through the late 1960s. Hoffman's mother was born in hanover, Germany, the daughter of a rocket scientist. in the 1950s her family emigrated to U.S., landing at Holloman Air Force Base in southern New Mexico. Hoffman feels strongly connected with these roots: his earliest musical instruction came from his Oma, a talented musician and painter, whose artwork of myriad New Mexican landscapes is featured on www.newmexicanmusic.com. Hoffman also plays his father's 1973 Guild Dreadnought as his main acoustic. In high school Hoffman's focus was drums, and much of his initial experience in bands took place behind a drum kit. However, he always took a keen interest in the language of music, studying intently both formally and in his own songwriting and composition. In 2009 Hoffman collaborated with Trent Nelson, and the two of them formed the band Strange Americans. Their debut album, A Royal Battle released in 2012 and was received with \"almost unanimous enthusiasm\" in the Denver community, (ListenUpDenver). The record placed on many lists including Marquee Magazine's 10 Best Local Releases of 2012 and landed Strange Americans alongside Denver bands to watch including the Lumineers. Since A Royal Battle Hoffman has released Lateral Moves (EP, solo, 2013), Mammoth Cave Live (EP, solo, 2014), and most recently released That Kind of Luster (Strange Americans, 2014). Strange Americans have shared the stage with such acts as Chris Stapleton, Water Liars, Cory Branan, Dead Confederate and The Both (Aimee Mann & Ted Leo). www.newmexicanmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Deaf Havana ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9038171.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "6:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "@deafhavana", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hot Milk ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8956587.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Emo Powerpop", "Time": "6:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "emo powerpop in your earholes from Manchester, UK.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jon McClure ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "STAY FREE ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8902842.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Rock, Punk", "Time": "6:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "...\u201dsomewhere between the light & dark, the love & noise, the nostalgia & NOW!\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Romain Swan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10273976.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Paris, France", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Romain Swan est un jeune chanteur, auteur, compositeur, interpr\u00e8te et guitariste.\nIl a commenc\u00e9 la musique \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 14 ans en d\u00e9couvrant l'instrument qu'il ne quittera plus jamais...\n\nRomain a explor\u00e9 tous les genres pour finalement cr\u00e9er le sien.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Entry is a choose-your-own-donation basis between $1-100.

At the age of ten he turned his bedroom into a small studio with a keyboard, beat machine and four-track recorder, and began enjoying music. He was previously a member of the five-man rap act known as Nappy Headz. In 2002 he founded his own label, Hard & B. T-Pain had been known locally in Florida for his work with Nappy Headz, and gained notoriety for his song \"Fucked Up\", a reworked version of Akon's \"Locked Up\". The song gained the attention of Akon, who then signed T-Pain to his newly formed Konvict Music record label. T-Pain released his solo debut single, \"I'm Sprung\", in August 2005. His debut album, Rappa Ternt Sanga, was released on November 8, 2005, under Konvict Music. The \"T\" in T-Pain actually stands for Tallahassee (Florida), and the Pains means the pain trying to get out of Tallahassee. He made the song \"I'm Sprung\" for a girl that he knew when he was younger. On BET's 106 & Park he told audiences that that girl is now his wife. T-Pain is related to the Omoegbele family. He is also known to be experimenting in the now world-famous \"Crunk-n-B\" style of music made famous by artists such as Ciara.\n\nHit singles \"Bartender Feat.

Though like almost all love stories, this one is not without its complications. Offering wistful rumination on how mental health can send shockwaves through even the most intimate and entwined of relationships, \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 sees Karima strike a masterful balance of meditative and melancholy songwriting.\n\n\u201cIn a world where we sometimes feel we can\u2019t speak out, we tend to take it the worst out on people closest to us.\u201d says Karima, opening-up about the track\u2019s fragile subject matter.\nRelocating from the shores of the Irish Sea to the expansive horizons of the Pacific last year, \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 was one of a number of new songs penned in Venice Beach, California, as the singer found herself instinctively drawn to the sun and sounds radiating from the West Coast and its simmering alternative scene. Finding a kindred spirit in LA producer Tim Carr (who also produced her sublime \u2018Shelf Life\u2019 track of last year), the textured and transient feel of \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 is testament to the stimulating new environs Karima found herself writing in.\n\u201cI was fantasising about making more, organic, saturated sounding records for a long time and alongside this, I wanted to record out in America as I was finding most of my musical influences were artists from America.\u201d she says. \u201cLast year I made the move to go out to California to find the sound for the new record and to immerse myself in the West Coast indie/alternative scene and out there, the relationship with Tim bloomed and the music was made.\u201d\n\nDusky of atmosphere and mellifluous of melody, the record also features appearances from close friend Simon Edwards on Bass (who notably played on Talk Talk\u2019s seminal \u2019Spirit of Eden\u2019 record; a favourite of Karima\u2019s), plus London-based singer/songwriter Klara from Sweden who feathers the record with its ethereal omnichord layerings.\n\nProduced by Tim Carr, the track was further mastered by Grammy-nominated Phillip Shaw Bova (Andy Shauf, Father John Misty).\n\n\u2018Orange Rose\u2019 arrives with a captivating video filmed in Las Vegas just before Christmas last year. \u201cI had the idea about a concept of self-destructive behaviour\u201d she says, \u201ca constant running away from our fears which potentially ends in us running away from the people who can make us whole again.\u201d Subtle of narrative and cinematic in quality, the video finds Karima lost deep in thought and caught-up between a rock and a hard place in the Nevada state city. Karima Francis is a critically acclaimed musician and songwriter, renowned for her innate ability to blend haunting melodies with honest lyrics and alluring ambiance. With an ear for music evident from an early age, Karima went on to release her debut album \u2018The Author\u2019 in 2009 to widespread critical acclaim. Her consequent album\u2019s \u2018The Remedy\u2019 (2012) and \u2018Black\u2019 (2016) witnessed further acknowledgment of her artistic abilities and saw her truly begin to spread her wings.

His work includes lead singer and creative force behind The Bible, formed in the 1980s, and reformed in 1994, as well as solo recordings and work for film. He lives in Ely.\n\nHewerdine (born Mark Hewerdine) moved to Cambridge as a child, but returned to London in his late teens, and worked in a record shop. Suffering from agoraphobia, it was not a happy time of his life, and he was fired from his job after being wrongly accused of theft. Returning to Cambridge, he teamed up with a friend with similar experiences and started to write songs. They formed the short-lived Placebo Thing, later renamed The Great Divide. They were heard by Mike Scott of The Waterboys, who recommended them to Ensign Records, where they cut two commercially unsuccessful singles. In 1985 Hewerdine, working once again in a record shop in Cambridge, formed The Bible, recruiting jazz drummer Tony Shepherd. They released an album of songs through the independent Norwich label Backs Records called Walking The Ghost Back Home.\n\nThe Bible became a fairly successful independent band, with a cult following spread mostly through word of mouth and live performances. Two tracks from the first album, Graceland and Mahalia were released as singles, but did not achieve very significant sales. The album however was very well received by music pundits, and this brought the band to the attention of Chrysalis Records. Signing to Chrysalis, Graceland and another track, Honey Be Good were (re)released as singles, and reached the lower end of the UK singles chart. A new album, Eureka followed, but failed commercially. In 1988, Hewerdine decided to leave the group and pursue solo projects. Calum MacColl and Neill MacColl from the group went on to form Liberty Horses.\n\nAt around this time Hewerdine met US \"new country\" singer Darden Smith, and this set him off in a new direction. Working together, he and Smith released a collaborative album, Evidence. Hewerdine also worked simultaneously on new solo songs, largely based on his earlier traumatic experiences in London. Eventually these were distilled down to produce the Ignorance album, released in 1992. Invited by Tori Amos to play support promoting these songs, Hewerdine managed to find a new audience and Ignorance and a single from the album, History, did relatively well commercially.\n\nAs Hewerdine's star rose, he started to write for other artists, among them Eddi Reader, Clive Gregson and Christine Collister. The Bible reformed for a tour in 1994. Further solo album releases followed, such as 1996's Baptist Hospital and 1999's Thanksgiving. Meanwhile Hewerdine was asked by long-time friend Nick Hornby to contribute music to the soundtrack for the movie version of his book High Fidelity, whose subject (working in a record shop) was also very close to Hewerdine's experiences.\n\nHewerdine continues to write and perform his own songs. Harmonograph, released on MVine/Red Grape Records in February 2006, is a collection of his songs written for other artists such as Eddi Reader and Hepburn, recorded by Hewerdine for the first time. 2008 saw two mini CD releases - Toy Box 1 and Toy Box 2 with art work by Hewerdine's partner. Hewerdine continues to tour regularly, playing a set featuring songs from through out his career.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lauren Davidson Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10351084.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Urban Country", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "CMA Artist and Grammy Recording Academy Member Lauren Davidson is an Urban Country singer/songwriter who has opened for Old Dominion, LOCASH, Carly Pearce, Justin Moore and others.", "otherInfo": "LIVE From Lauren's House\nEvery Friday @ 3:00 pm est\n3 songs - 3 questions\n\n*Send your Questions & Requests to info@laurendavidsonmusic.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ronny Graupe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10352429.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Free Improvisation, Structured Improvisation, Contemporary Jazz, Free Jazz, New Music, Improvisation", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Website: www.ronnygraupe.com\nRonny Graupe \u2013 Guitar, Born in Karl - Marx \u2013 Stadt, 1979;\nMember of the youthjazzbigband saxony and 1st price winner of the youth competition \"Jugend musiziert \u2013 Jugend jazzt\", 1997 in saxony.\nStudied music at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Theater \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\" Leipzig with Richie Beirach and Christian R\u00f6ver and the \"Rytmisk Musikkonservatorium\" in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n1998 - 2001 member of the \u201eBujazzo\u201c under the leadership of Peter Herbolzheimer.\n2001 Jazzprice of Leipzig and the Marion Ermer Stiftung.\n2003 the trio \"Hyperactive Kid\" with Philipp Gropper - Sax und Christian Lillinger - Drums was founded.\n2004 the trio \"Ronny Graupes Spoom\" with Jonas Westergaard - Bs and Christian Lillinger - Drums was founded.\n2004 moved to berlin.\nHe works currently with the following bands > Gropper/Graupe/Lillinger formerly known as Hyperactive Kid, Ronny Graupes Spoom, Aberratio Ictus, Yellow Bird, Uli Kempendorffs Field, Rolf K\u00fchn Unit, Dejan Terzic\u00b4Melanoia, Andreas Tschopp\u00b4s Bubaran, Henning Sieverts Symmethree a. o.\nPlayed concerts in Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Poland, Portugal, France, Italy, Turkey, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania, Venezuela, Ireland, Czech Republic, England, Burkina Fasso, the Ivory Coast, Cameron, Nigeria, on the Philippines and in the USA.\nHe is a member of the Jazzkollektiv Berlin.\nSince 2011 he is teaching jazz guitar and ensemble playing on the University of the Arts in Bern.\nThe newest releases in 2016 will be >\nRonny Graupe - The White Belt (with Jonas Westergaard and Christian Lillinger) (Pirouet Records);\nGropper/Graupe/Lillinger formaly known as Hyperactive Kid \u2013 Riot (WhyPlayJazz)", "otherInfo": "Concert with Live Streaming vol. 35\nImprovised Set\n\nSamuel Blaser - trombone\nRonny Graupe - guitar\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/into-the-shed-vol-35-samuel-blaser-and-ronny-graupe-tickets-103787561390\n\nSamuel Blaser\nAt a time when more musicians are trying to be heard than ever before, rare gems like Samuel Blaser seem, paradoxically, rise above it all. Since his 2007 debut as a leader, 7th Heaven (Between the Lines), Blaser has grown at an almost incomprehensible rate, from a straight-ahead hard bopper in his mid-twenties to an innovative free player and ever-searching composer and bandleader in his early thirties - one whose improvisational strength has received high praise from media the world over.\n\nBorn and raised in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Blaser lived in New York City for many years before relocating to Berlin, where he currently resides. He began trombone lessons at the age of 9, and his early interests ranged from Swiss folk music to American R&B and jazz. He entered the local conservatory at 14 and graduated in 2002 after being awards prizes in both the jazz and classical spheres, including the 2000 Benny Golson Prize. Participation in the heralded Vienna Art Orchestra and European Radio Big Band eventually led to a Fullbright Scholarship, facilitating studies in the United States at the Purchase College Conservatory of Music.\n\nIn his relatively short career, Blaser has worked with Swiss percussion legend Pierre Favre, pianist Hal Galper, drummer John Hollenbeck and saxophonist Michael Blake, and has worked with Grammy Award-winning producer Robert Sadin, and more recently with Daniel Humair and Michel Portal.\n\n2018 will see Blaser touring with his trio featuring French guitarist Marc Ducret and Danish drummer Peter Bruun. Blaser is also back on the road with his original quartet to promote Early in the Morning, an homage to the Blues with Russ Lossing on piano, Masa Kamaguchi on bass, drummer Gerry Hemingway, Wallace Roney on trumpet and Oliver Lake on alto saxophone.\n\nSamuel Blaser is a XO Sophisticated Brass Artist\n\nInto The Shed\nIn order to fight against the spread of the Coronavirus, tremendous cuts were done.

A friend had put on a hardcore show and needed someone to play songs between the bands, so he showed up with a rucksack full of Metal Hammer compilations and precisely no idea what he was doing. No one cared (apart from that one guy who wanted to hear Snapcase). Over that summer, he took his first regular night, acting as second DJ in the second room of a rock night held in a dance club. This was slightly successful, lasting a crazy three-ish months. Later that year, he and a couple of guys were given the opportunity to put on a student rock night at the NTU student venue. Still without a clue what they were doing, they persevered, honed their craft, and created the mighty organ now known as Assault, which has been running ever since, and going from strength to strength. At a similar time, he was resident at Nottingham's Pitty Patt Club burlesque revue, playing 50s rock n' roll and showtunes. And providing music for the performers to remove their clothes to. Naturally. Fast forward to 2008, and DJ Apocalypse was approached by the then-new Redeemer Clubnights to fill a residency at their Leicester venue, a venture which saw him play venues from London to Newcastle, and providing the backstage music for the High Voltage and Sonisphere festivals, as well as the prestigious Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards Ceremony. In the last couple of years, he has also picked up another couple of residencies; at Perdition in Nottingham, and Wake The Dead in Woking. Along the way, he's guested at a variety of nights and events, including the famous Wendy House's 10th birthday extravaganza, the Bizarre Ball, the Rammstein aftershow party at London's O2 Arena, and for the last three years the mighty Download Festival.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON).

The previously most recent album, 2014\u2019s Too Bright, stepped out saucily onto a bigger stage, expressing, with the production help of Adrian Utley, emotions arranged all along the slippery continuum from rage to irony to love. Now here we have seized the vocabulary of the full expression of all music.\n\nWHAT IS THIS\nHere in 13 ferocious and sophisticated tracks, Mike Hadreas and his collaborators blow through church music, makeout music, an array of the gothier radio popular formats, rhythm and blues, art pop, krautrock, queer soul, the RCA Studio B sound, and then also collect some of the sounds that only exist inside Freddy Krueger. Tremolo on the electric keys. Nightclubbing. Daywalking. Peter Greenawaying, Springsteening, Syreetaing.\n\nWHY\nLuridness was a quality of music in the 1960s that is mostly since shunned. The big male crooners were all fiercely lurid as an expression of passion or lustiness or general dickability. That\u2019s something perfect to take back. You took us to church and told us to believe in ghosts. You took us to school and told us to believe in the great American project of inclusion. Instead we started fucking to the great American project of rock and roll. There\u2019s more than one sexy soul song here. Seduction is also spellcraft. Rock and roll was an incantation, a beg to give it up baby. It\u2019s not that different from begging Some Thing to not let you die when you are alone and afraid.\n\nA QUICK BREAK ABOUT HOW\nBlake Mills \u2014 the one who produced the Alabama Shakes record and who performs with John Legend \u2014 produced the record with precision and expansion. Some things are pretty and some are blasted beyond recognition. In the studio with Shawn the engineer, Mike and Blake would hear quite different voices as they worked and they built this together.\n\nMORE ON THE TOPIC OF WHY\nGod is all around actually and some of these songs are about being equal and some are about the witchcraft of believing. This is church music the same way Prince\u2019s Black Album is \u2014 too dirty. It\u2019s femme art pop the way Kate Bush\u2019s The Dreaming is \u2014 too scary. Prayer is indistinguishable from OCD but feels a lot cleaner.\n\nLIFE IS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE EACH STRIVE FOR HAPPINESS\n1. \u201cI felt like when I made these other albums, people were like why are you talking about these things, and now people are going to be like, why aren\u2019t you talking about these things, because everything\u2019s so terrible. I\u2019m never not talking about it. My life is existing in the fucking face of it. My music will always be in protest.\u201d\n2. \u201cI pay my rent. I\u2019m approaching health. The things that are bothering me personally now are less clear, are more confusing. I don\u2019t think I really figured them out with these songs. There\u2019s something freeing about how I don\u2019t have it figured out. Unpacking little morsels, magnifying my discomfort, wading through buried harm, laughing at or digging in to the embarrassing drama of it all. I may never come out the other side but it\u2019s invigorating to try and hopefully, ultimately helpful. I think a lot of them are about trying to be happy in the face of whatever bullshit I created for myself or how horrible everything and everyone is.\u201d\n3. \u201cI can steal from people that are on the inside and act as if. I created my whole identity around never being on the inside.\u201d\n\nLISTENING IN\nWho gets to live now? That\u2019s a question up for active international debate. Lots of folks are getting a clear view into what they all think of us. When we can, we should not have to care. You should feel great listening here, even when you\u2019re sad. Our job is to find love and connection and goodness. Records like this, records that make you feel like you\u2019re 15 and just seeing the truth for the first time, are excessively rare.

Whether it was \u201cLet it Be\u201d by The Beatles, \u201cBorn to Run\u201d by Bruce Springsteen (a fellow New Jersey native), or \u201cIt\u2019s My Party\u201d by Leslie Gore she was into it. A 90\u2019s baby herself, Bowman\u2019s knowledge and love for music spans decades. Inspired by pop acts and bands of the 90\u2019s in particular she knew she wanted to pursue music at an early age. After graduating high school, not having a clue how to pursue a career in music, she started going into New York City looking to meet with producers and songwriters who might want to work with her. After several failed auditions, several unreturned phone calls, and a little bit of heartbreak she met a producer who saw something in her. Bowman, only a singer at the time began recording songs written by the producer. Suggesting she start writing herself, with the melody and concept already started Bowman alongside her producer finished writing what would be her first single \u201cProblem.\u201d \u201cProblem\u201d was added to Sirius XM 20 on 20 and in 2 weeks was a top 5 requested song. Her next single \u201cKing Boy\u201d trumped her first becoming the 5th most played song of the year on Sirius XM 20 on 20 while also selling over 20,000 copies, a major feat for an independent artist.\n\nWith the success of her first 2 releases Bowman found herself writing with more and more producers/songwriters. She had been working on new music with a writer at Warner Chappell Publishing when the synch team there received a request for a song about staying warm. Alongside the producer Bowman wrote \u201cKeep Me Warm,\u201d a release that would play in a national McDonald\u2019s ad campaign for over a month, as well as receive airplay on 3 different radio formats: Top 40, Hot AC, and AC.\n\nContinuing to work alongside different writers/producers she caught the attention of Kobalt Music. A publishing company who\u2019s rosters includes the likes of Max Martin, Mumford and Sons, Simon and Garfunkel, Lionel Richie, Dixie Chicks, Beck, and countless other successful artists and songwriters. Eventually signed to a Kobalt publishing deal herself Bowman released \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d through AWAL, Kobalt\u2019s global artist services company. \u201cGood Time Good Life\u201d debuted on NBC\u2019s This Is Us, ran in a national Target ad, a national Beaches Resort ad, and was chosen by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to drive The Oscar\u2019s 2017 promo aired on ABC for over 2 months. The Oscar promo lead to Bowman\u2019s national TV debut on Good Morning America where she performed \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d followed up with a performance at the Radio Disney Music Awards, and Live with Kelly and Ryan.\n\nWith the success of \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d and a move out west (a NJ native now in Los Angeles) Bowman found herself working on music going in a slightly different direction. She was doing less co-writes and found herself writing everyday on her own. Songs started pouring out of her. Her life was changing and the music she was writing was some of the realest she had ever written. In March of 2018 Bowman found herself traveling to London to explore a new city and work on new music. A NJ native, now based in Los Angeles, traveling to London. It was on a whim that she decided to attend an open mic night where she\u2019d perform a couple of her new songs for the first time. It was at that open mic night that she would meet the 2 cowriters/producers that would bring this new direction of music, this new project, to life. Bowman traveled back to London for over a month in the summer and in the fall to work on what will be her first ever EP. A lyrically driven, wearing her heart on her sleeve, completely open and honest EP titled Apartment 101 released in 2019.", "otherInfo": "Enjoy an hour of Erin Bowman Instagram Live for a cocktail, conversation & performance."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "J.R. Castillo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6288479.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cMusic has been a big part of my life, my entire life,\u201d says Texas musician J. R. Castillo. While a lot of artists can say the same, the influence of music on Castillo\u2019s life began years before he was born. When Castillo\u2019s father was a boy, he idolized his brother who was nine years older and in the Navy. Castillo\u2019s uncle would come home on leave from the Navy and play guitar on the front porch, and Castillo\u2019s father aspired to play just like his older brother. Tragically, his uncle lost his life serving in the Navy and his father\u2014now the oldest son and responsible for his family\u2014never learned to play like he wanted. \u201cAs he got older [my father] said, \u2018If I ever have a son, I want to put a guitar in his hands and make sure he learns to play,\u2019\u201d Castillo says, and to honor the brother he lost, Castillo\u2019s father put a guitar into his son\u2019s hands at a very early age. His mother also loved music. She encouraged him to sing and find harmonies as she introduced him to all kinds of music, and both his father and mother\u2014a \u201ccloset poet\u201d and \u201cgrammar queen,\u201d respectively\u2014encouraged their son to write. It was no surprise then when their son was fronting bands and performing his own music by the time he was 13. With the bands he was in during middle and high school, Castillo would work his own original music into sets of well-known covers at parties and festivals, and the reaction was always very positive. \u201cIt always seemed that every time I\u2019d announce, \u2018Here\u2019s a song that I wrote,\u2019 it immediately drew people in, which caught my attention,\u201d Castillo recalls. \u201cI saw that people all the sudden weren\u2019t just out there dancing and having a good time, their attention was on the song that I\u2019d written. The reaction of those first few folks\u2014they don\u2019t realize it, the influence they had\u2014as they were out there listening and giving me those words of encouragement after they heard the songs, it really encouraged me to continue with the song writing. It really set me on the path that I\u2019m on today.\u201d Despite his early success, he didn\u2019t immediately run off to Nashville to pursue a record deal; his family assumed that first he would get a college education, though they encouraged him to continue with his music while doing so. However, avoiding the temptation to quit college wasn\u2019t easy when record labels started showing interest during his sophomore year. \u201cIt kind of scared my folks a little bit, because they thought that I was just going to stop everything and pack my bags and move to Nashville. It just seemed like the right thing at that point in time.\u201d It was the advice of friend Casey Monahan at the Texas Music Office that persuaded him he could do both, a decision he\u2019s happy with in retrospect: \u201cI often look back at that moment and I know that it didn\u2019t have a huge an impact. If I had moved over there, it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. I was still able to do everything they wanted us to do, but at the same time we were still able to take care of things at home and I was able to continue my education.\u201d Over the last 15 years\u2014through his formative years, his time at the University of Texas, and up to the present day\u2014Castillo has written over a thousand songs for himself and other artists, 25 percent of which are in Spanish. His songwriting strays from that of many other artists, as his music is often more specific and personal than other artists\u2019 music. \u201cA lot of the stuff is based on life experiences and stuff that I\u2019ve gone through, personal stories,\u201d Castillo says of his songwriting. \u201cI try to take actual stories and actual experiences and lay them out in that three and a half minute length of a song.\u201d For Castillo, the joy of songwriting isn\u2019t in mass appeal, but connecting on a deeper, more-personal level with his listeners. \u201cI want to write about real things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about writing the basic love songs where everybody can relate. I want to write about stuff that people out there listening can actually hold on to and say, \u201cThat\u2019s my song. That guy wrote that song about my life and what I\u2019m going through.\u201d His latest single, \u201cThe Flip Side of Sober,\u201d was released on July 4, and is apart of a full CD release entitled The Hombre that Castillo expects to be released in late September. Other songs on the 16-track album include the classic Leo Sayer hit, \u201cMore Than I Can Say\u201d (one of his mother\u2019s favorites), and unofficial Texas High School football anthem, \u201cAny Given Friday.\u201d \u201cSome of my fellow artists and writers are like, \u2018Man you\u2019re nuts. You\u2019re the only one who would serve up that many songs in one project,\u2019\u201d Castillo remarks. \u201cBut hey, it\u2019s music. I\u2019m cranking it out. I feel blessed to be able to write as much as I do. It gives me an opportunity to share some of myself with the fans.\u201d By Andrew Miller, Nashville Music Guide", "otherInfo": "J.R.

The younger brother of Cajun fiddler Michael Doucet, Doucet has used his distinctive hybrid of folk-style fingerpicking and bluegrass-like flatpicking to strengthen the performances of Beausoleil, the band he's shared with his brother for over 21 years. With the release of his debut solo album, Quand J'ai Parti in 1991, Doucet successfully stepped into the spotlight.\nDoucet first played the guitar after recuperating from a broken arm sustained while practicing with his high school football team. Although he initially taught himself to play by using Bob Dylan and Paul Simon songbooks, Doucet became fascinated with flatpicking after listening to an album by Doc Watson.\n\nTogether with his brother and banjo player Raoul Breaux, Doucet played Cajun music in Louisiana clubs in 1975. When the project proved commercially unsuccessful, the band broke up with Doucet enrolling in college and his brother going on to form the Cajun rock band Coteau and the original lineup of Beausoleil. A turning point in Doucet's evolution as a guitarist came when he heard the playing of the late Clarence White on an album, The Kentucky Colonels 1965-1967, in 1980. Inspired by White's use of unusual chords and imaginative melodies, Doucet began to develop his own unique style.\n\nAlthough Doucet did not play on Beausoleil's first recording session in Paris, he joined the group before the recording of their debut album, The Spirit of Cajun Music, in 1976.\n\nGrand Texas Doucet moved to New Orleans, where he continues to reside, in 1980 to work at the World's Fair. In addition to his solo album and recordings with Beausoleil, Doucet was featured on albums by Chuck Guillory (Grand Texas), Octa Clark & Hector Duhon (Ensemble Encore) and Michael Doucet (Dit BeauSoleil).\nDoucet was accompanied on Quand J'ai Parti by members of Beausoleil (Michael Doucet, Jimmy Breaux, Tommy Comeaux, Billy Ware and Tommy Alesi) and influential dobro player Josh Graves, whom he met during a \"Legends of Folk Violin\" tour.\n\n\nMore to come", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SOLE channel Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10337291.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Deep House, House, House Music, Edm, Soulful Deep House, Tech House, Edm Dance, Afro House", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "SOLE channel Music initially began as a weekly Saturday night party in NYC called SOLE Channel.\nThe mission was to create an atmosphere around deep dance grooves and present it to a younger\ngeneration of club heads.\n\nWith so much love and support from many Dj\u2019s, Producers & Fans Mr. V knew\nthe time was right to create his own imprint to showcase\nhis ability as a producer and songwriter as well as breathe fresh ideas into underground music.\nConcentrating on the label's unique sound Mr. V says\n\"When I think of SOLE Channel Music I think of a label with vision and direction.

Ever the optimist, Woody pleaded to Trump to \u201copen your doors\u201d and \u201crip out the strangling red tape\u201d that kept the apartment from embracing all races.\n\nProduced by Eliza\u2019s son Cisco Ryder Gilliland, the recording features artists from Eliza\u2019s regular band of beloved Austin musicians: Mike Hardwick (Jon Dee Graham, Jerry Jeff Walker, Charlie Sexton) on pedal steel, slide and various guitars, Chris Maresh (Eric Johnson) on bass, Bukka Allen (Alejandro Escovedo, Joe Ely, Terry Allen) on piano and keyboards, Warren Hood on fiddle, mandolinist Kym Warner (Green Cards) and producer Cisco Ryder Gilliland on drums, with cameo appearances by rising star Jaimee Harris, folksinger BettySoo and the WEWIM choir of Austin, a group co-founded by Eliza and singer Charlie Faye that supports up-and-coming female musicians in the community.\n\n-------------------\n\nEliza Gilkyson is a politically minded, poetically gifted singer-songwriter who has become one of the most respected musicians in folk and Americana music circles.

Eliza is currently touring her new album in the virtual fashion of the day - online - streaming a weekly show on Friday nights.\n\nGilkyson\u2019s music, in the classic folk music tradition, has always offered a vivid reflection of the times we live in with each song a window into a world of struggle and beauty in a culture she feels is \u201ccaught somewhere between collapse and reinvention.\u201d\n\nEliza is an active member of the Austin music and political community, including the environmental organization Save Our Springs (www.sosalliance.org),and she is a co-founder of www.5604manor.org, an Austin-based activist resource center that promotes political activism and community involvement around issues of race, patriarchy and global injustice.\n\nPraise for 2020\n\n\"The singer exudes a poetic wisdom few songwriters achieve, and a timeless quality to the album's secular hymns hearkens Leonard Cohen.\" \u2013 Austin Chronicle\n\nEliza Gilkyson is still creating music of richness and depth.\" \u2013 Spirituality & Health Magazine\n\nGilkyson manages to articulate what has remained -- to most of us -- inexpressible, hidden by our fear of forever, and has done so by willing vulnerability and accountability to become her gritty resolve.\" \u2013 All Music", "otherInfo": "Eliza's weekly Friday shows continue!

He has recorded with and toured alongside some of independent rap music\u2019s most influential figures, including Sage Francis, Busdriver and Astronautalis.

Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bianca Jade Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9881966.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "R&b", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bianca Jade is a Cuban-Jamaican powerhouse RnB/Soul singer and songwriter from Miami, Florida now based in New York City.

I have a love affair with France, which is a wonderful, romantic place on every level. There is such a rich cultural history, with so much global influence.

The spirited \u201cCe Petit Chemin\u201d was originally recorded in the 30\u2019s by the beloved vocalist Mireille.

Najar wraps up the collection with \u201cChanson du C\u0153ur Bris\u00e9,\u201d a slightly melancholy, richly improvisational ballad whose raw emotion is underscored by guitarist\u2019s scrapes on the wood; and the breezy, balmy, Brazilian leaning \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d which Najar says needs \u201cno real explanation.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee. Bandmembers from both Umphrey's and Bisco have further more found each other in The Brain Damaged Eggmen, a Pink Floyd and The Beatles coverband\n\n\nDiscography\n\n* Encephalous Crime (self-released, 1996)\n* Uncivilized Area (1998)\n* Bisco Lives (2000)\n* They Missed the Perfume (2001)\n* Se\u00f1or Boombox (2002)\n* TranceFusion Radio Broadcast Vol. 1-4 (2003)\n* Wind at Four to Fly (2006)\n* Rocket 3 (2007)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sam Olson & Kelsey Wallner ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10115380.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Yahir ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/122791.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Latin, Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rainbow Kitten Surprise ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10022546.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Ethan Goodpaster, Darrick Bozzy Keller, Samuel Melo, Jess Haney, Charlie Holt", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Rainbow Kitten Surprise and all five of its members hail from the mountains of Boone, North Carolina.

There is something strangely meditative about the lyrical sunshine-goth he creates with his evolving band in Brooklyn, NY. He attributes much of his creativity to his mother-- a painter and self-proclaimed psychic who remembers the moment she was born. She moved with her son every few years around Europe and the U.S. in hopes to find a new community. When she decided to move once again, this time to devote herself to christianity in Kansas, he decided to go his own way at sixteen years-old.\n\nHNRY FLWR is a songwriter, producer, and crooner. His 7-piece band is like seeing Leonard Cohen fronting The Flaming lips. With spiritualizing synthesizers, guitars, Ringo-esque krautrock drums and HNRY\u2019s pension for jumping into the audience, the live show is cathartic and joyful while somehow staying mysteriously earnest.\n\nIn early 2017, HNRY released two singles that landed him on Deli Magazine\u2019s Best Emerging NYC Psych playlist. By the spring his first music video was out via Alt Citizen, who called the track \u201cmelodic, danceable, and devastating.\u201d That June their \u201cbrilliant\u201d (GoldFlakePaint) debut EP, FLOWERAMA, was released on Paper Garden Records and produced by David Groener Jr who has worked with Glen Hansard, They Might Be Giants, San Fermin and many more. HNRY kept busy that year, playing 40+ shows in NYC and on tour throughout the US. By the time the year was over, the album had gone viral on Spotify with over 500,000 streams.\n\nIn 2018 the success of their breakthrough debut and immersive live shows landed them a tour supporting TEEN in the U.S. and Canada. Locally, The New York Times called them a \u201cbuzzy\u201d band during Color Me Bushwick Festival and as the buzz continued throughout the year they landed support slots with Sunflower Bean, Shy Boys, Renata Zeigur, Grandchildren, Sound of Ceres, Uni, Katie Von Schleicher, and more. To finish out the year the Wild Honey Pie produced a psychedelic Buzzsession of HNRY FLWR playing a new song in a beautiful cathedral in Brooklyn they described as \u201cintoxicating, hazy music that lifts you off the ground and transports you to another era.\u201d\n\nTo keep the momentum going in 2019 HNRY FLWR and his band did a three week tour to SXSW where they played every day of the festival, sometimes twice a day, and before returning home stopped at the famous Daytrotter/PASTE studios in Iowa for a live in-studio performance.", "otherInfo": "Tickets: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/baby-tv-presents-hnry-flwr-tickets-103971511590"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Stevey ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9520864.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Folk-pop, Pop, Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"An especially unique style with hints of Damien Rice, Tracy Chapman, and Ed Sheeran.\"\n\"A voice like a bearded angel.\"\n\nA former American Idol contestant and Division-I collegiate athlete, Stevey is a touring singer-songwriter currently based in Fort Collins, Colorado.\n\nStevey\u2019s sophomore album 'ABOVE' releases in late May 2019, featuring singles: by the creek, find your place, & altitude.\n\n\"This collection serves as a sequel to my 'beneath' EP. These songs all revolve around bigger ideas and forms of self-expression... dreams, epiphanies, and breakthroughs,\" he explains.\n\nHis debut album 'beneath' was released globally in 2018.\n\nStevey (born, Steve Ertl) was raised in the dirt and timber of an eastern Iowa farm, where he discovered his voice by emulating his father whistling to an old-school country vinyl spinning on the record player. He later uncovered a passion for writing imagery-centric poetry and was published at age 11.\n\nWhile enduring the grueling lifestyle of Division-I college wrestling, he and a teammate formed the R&B group, verseAtile, placing three original pieces in the independent film, \u201c7 Minutes\u201d in 2005. Stevey continued his musical pursuits post-university by teaching himself guitar, winning multiple singing competitions, amassing 200,000+ YouTube views, and ultimately began performing nationwide as a singer-songwriter in 2011.\n\nStevey has shared the stage and supported artists such as: Nathaniel Rateliff, The Nadas, The Kinky Fingers, Carry Illinois, Maxwell Hughes, Royce Lovett, RAINNE, Shane Burke, The Wendy Woo Band, Clayton Risner, Elise Wunder, Alright Alright, and The Covz.\n\nStevey\u2019s writing is poignant and conscious, which is complemented with rich, creamy, soul-wrenching vocals.

Coffin has released several albums independent from the Flecktones, most notably the February 2005 release Bloom, recorded during the Flecktones year-long hiatus.\n\nHe also leads his own group the Jeff Coffin Mu'tet, which features a changing lineup, and focuses on playing original jazz compositions.\n\nJeff is known for playing two saxophones simultaneously, which is evidence of the influence of Rahsaan Roland Kirk on his playing. Other apparent influences include Eric Dolphy and Ornette Coleman.\n\nOn July 1, 2008, Coffin joined Dave Matthews Band for their 2008 summer tour after their saxophonist LeRoi Moore was injured in an ATV accident. Moore would succumb to his injuries on August 19. Coffin has since been in talks to be the band's permanent saxophonist.\n\nJeff Coffin has also played on hundreds of studio recordings, and has performed around the world including a 2007 performance at the esteemed Carnegie Hall with the Flecktones. As a highly in demand clinician, Jeff has presented clinics from Farmington, Maine to Perth, Australia and is also an internationally acclaimed Yamaha and Vandoren Performing Artist and clinician since 2000.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Grant Maloy Smith ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9184405.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Singer-songwriter, Americana, American Roots, Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A dynamic performer, capable of carrying a show solo acoustic, or with a band up to 7 pieces, Grant Maloy Smith personifies a whole new kind of American Roots.

The album continues to earn rave reviews, like this one from NO DEPRESSION, the bible of American Roots music: \u201cGrant\u2019s ability to capture the heartland in his music is amazing ... he has written A heartland masterpiece ... lyrics and music as potent as Woody Guthrie ... sent chills down my spine ... bound to become a classic ... A reminder of the darker period of Bob Dylan, and it\u2019s that good, that memorable...\u201d\n\nIn 2018 his charming Christmas song \u201cFly Possum Fly\u201d (featuring county singing sensation EmiSunshine) was both a radio single and a children\u2019s book.

Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011.

May\u2019s songwriting reveals her innate ability to emotionally engage with her audience through her lyrics. She shows us her heartbreak, but she also shows us her empowered and emboldened spirit. In her quest to find her most authentic self, May gifts each listener with a powerful, emotional experience that immediately connects her to us.\n\nRaised in a home full of art and music, Erlewine began writing songs at a very young age. As a teenager she hitchhiked across the country, honing her skills as a performer and absorbing the kind of stories and landscapes that would inform her music. She came to know the land and the pulse of the people. Her songs show a very real connection and concern with everyday folk. In the following years, Erlewine would perform in every kind of venue imaginable, from street corners to festival stages to the live-FM airwaves of A Prairie Home Companion.\n\nErlewine draws from a wide variety of influences to create her sound. Lyrically, her songs are rooted in hard-wrought wisdom, joy and sorrow, simplicity, and stories from her own everyday experiences. Musically, these messages are wrapped up in traditional folk roots, Americana, old-time country, swing, soul, and even rock n\u2019 roll. As a live performer, she is just as magnetic when fronting a seven-piece dance-party funk band as she is playing solo acoustic songs in a living room house concert.\n\nWith a long list of full length albums, two EPs, and numerous collaborations, Erlewine\u2019s catalog is proof of her creative power. Her work has been spotlighted by Rolling Stone and NBC\u2019s The Voice. National acts who have covered her songs include Greensky Bluegrass, Railroad Earth, Sawyer Fredericks (Season 8 winner of The Voice), Joshua Davis (Season 8 finalist of The Voice), Lindsay Lou & The Flatbellys, and others.\n\nErlewine uses her music as a platform for positive change. She considers her job a service-oriented one and carries the torch of the folk singer activist. Her voice on stage encourages connectedness and stresses the importance of environmental advocacy, social justice, creative empowerment and community building as necessary work in our world. May's body of work has become an anthem and an example of why we need to listen to women, and why we need to hear their stories.\n\nMay\u2019s music has touched people all over the world. Her words have held solace for weary hearts, offered a light in the darkness, and held a lot of space for the pain and joy of being alive in these times.

Most clear in my memory, even amid the party that a live music backstage scene can tend to be, Will was the happiest guy in the place \u2013 clearly exactly where he wanted to be, and loving every second. This was a contagious vibe from the outset, one that Will had no trouble channeling into music that rings in the heart of the listener, and a live show as inspiring as it is entertaining. Between two acclaimed and successful albums, 2012\u2019s Rose Queen and 2015\u2019s Ringling Road, and what now clocks in at a near-decade's worth of dogged road work, William Clark Green has established himself as one of the most important voices of his genre - a voice that now pipes up again on his anticipated new album, Hebert Island.\n\nTexas is a big place, complete with fully distinct sub-territories - we reserve the right to bust into several states, should that become strategically expedient - and our traveling musical artists tend to become experts on the rich mosaic that makes up Texas' cultural geography. Will has found himself onstage in a growing portion of her 254 counties, and has called several his home; as he puts it, \"I kinda spend six years everywhere\". Childhood northeast in Tyler, high school years in College Station, college years at Texas Tech in Lubbock, early music career years in the north-central hamlet of Eastland, and lately his most urban digs so far, in Fort Worth - but deep down, Will's Cajun roots call to him incessantly, and thus southeast Texas is never far from his mind. The new album is named for Will's retreat at Hebert Island (say \"AY-Bear\", though you'll occasionally hear \"HEE-Bert\") near Beaumont, and refers to the hilltop upon which his camphouse sits - not an actual island, but a potential one, should the occasional flood come to pass; high ground is valuable in this landscape. Will considers himself a \"half-ass coon-ass\" - a distantly-descended Cajun, but one who holds a deep appreciation for that history and that way of life. \"It's a real place\", Will insists, with the feeling that only such a beloved space can foster - his family has owned it since 1869, in the early years of Reconstruction, and is where they established one of the state's first rice farming operations. It's a place that echoes through time for William Clark Green, connecting his family's past and tradition to who he is as an artist, and as a man, today.\n\nIt's been over three years since Ringling Road. \"I'm not gonna force songs,\" Will sighs. \"We could have finished the record a long time ago, but we didn't like the mixes - we're the bosses, and we don't have to listen to ourselves.\" The pressures and deadlines of the professional recording artist are nothing new, and while he certainly notices that pressure, Will recognizes it to be a good problem to have. \"I remember when no one gave a shit, so yeah, it's incredible to have that want-to. So far, every record I've come out with has been my best record - I wrote my ass off for this one. I wanted to make sure it beat Ringling Road, and I'm not bragging on myself - I just knew it was going to take effort.\"\n\nThat effort has paid off; Hebert Island is a stellar new batch of songs from a guy who has gone to great lengths to keep his energy focused, through all distraction, on quality songcraft. \"My favorite songwriter is Guy Clark - the songwriter's songwriter. It's what I've always cared about the most...the craft of songs is really where it's at for me. I think good songs are undeniable.\" Mostly recorded at Nashville\u2019s Sound Emporium with Benjy Davis at the board, the new album also features players who have been backing Will for near the full ride, including guitarist Steven Marcus and bassist Cameron Moreland. \u201cGoner\u201d stands as a shimmering, no-hard-feelings take on the moment of breakup, the protagonist of the quasi-travelogue \u201cStay\u201d understands that it doesn\u2019t matter where you are, as long as you\u2019re close to love, and the ballad \u201cShe Loves Horses\u201d exemplifies both the warmth and strength that\u2019s developed in Will\u2019s songwriting and the performance power of his players.\n\nWill's desired contribution to the world is songs that change lives for the better, and he realizes that he's conduit as much as creator for that change. And in spite of - or, perhaps, because of - the demands and pressures of the life he's chosen, and the position of leadership he's earned through a decade of determination, William Clark Green is a guy who takes none of this for granted. \"Our path is guided by something that's greater than me, I believe that. We can be very proud of what we've accomplished; we've done it the right way...I feel very proud of what we've done, and I'm thankful every day for where we're at.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Autumn Helene ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10364169.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Auburn, United States", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Soulful songbird.

Royal\u2019s musical talents were nurtured at the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts (NOCCA) High School, in classrooms once shared by jazz greats such as Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Terrence Blanchard, and Donald Harrison. When Royal was only 16, he was granted a full scholarship to the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA and his career has taken off since then.\n\nTo date, Royal has played with hip-hop giants and jazz and funk legends alike, from Lettuce, to Bobby Brown, Alvin Batiste, Ellis Marsalis, Christian Scott, Branford, Delfeayo and Jason Marsalis, Tony Clifton, The Sam Kininger Band, and Johnta Austin. The impressive young artist has recorded with Mary J. Blige, Ashanti, Nelly and The Game, Erykah Badu, Goapele, D.J. Quick, and is also featured with the Regiment on Season 2 of The Boondocks. Royal has developed relationships with prominent New Orleans artists as well, such as George Porter Jr., Zigaboo Modeliste, Fred Wesley, Big Sam\u2019s Funky Nation, Galactic, and countless more. The range of Khris\u2019 musical relationships is versatile and reflects the scope of his talent. Although Royal continues to expand and develop his craft, from Jazz, hip-hop, rock, soul, electronic, funk, R & B, Blues, and Reggae \u2013musically, there is not much Khris Royal has not already mastered and incorporated into his unique style.\n\nIn addition to leading his own band, Khris Royal & Dark Matter (see below), Khris Royal has been the only horn player in George Porter Jr. & the Runnin\u2019 Pardners since Fall 2009.

His introduction to music came through his family: the early influence of Jimi Hendrix from his brothers, Bluegrass, Folk and Mountain music from both his parents, and boogie woogie from his grandmother.\n\nHis love for the Blues and American Roots Music began to blossom after moving to Texas at the young age of 5. His uncle gave him a copy of \"The Vaughan Brothers: Family Style\" and he was hooked. He got his first SRV album shortly after, and was off into the world of Blues. He began digging deeper and deeper for the nastiest, grooviest, and raunchy sounds he could find and focused his list of influences to include Albert King, Howlin' Wolf, Hound Dog Taylor, Elmore James, Lightnin' Hopkins, Lightnin' Slim, Albert Collins, Otis Rush, Little Walter, Willie Dixon, and the list GOES ON!! He sat in with bands from the time he was 11 years old and began meeting and playing with musicians in the San Antonio Blues scene. Thanks to local SA sax legend Frank Rodarte, Will landed a weekly Friday night gig while in the 7th grade, and 3 or 4 years later landed another weekly gig and began refining his chops.\n\nDuring his senior year of high school, the band got the opportunity to open for and back up the great Stephen Stills in Austin, TX. From there he moved on to other inspiring moments in music, opening for Lynard Skynard, Three Dog Night, and quite a few other notable acts.\n\nAfter graduating from school he co-formed his own group in the style of Classic Country and Rock! The band played legendary Texas venues such as Luckenbach, TX and Gruene Hall. After that Will began playing with anyone and everyone and opened solo for greats such as Dick Dale. When he was 22, he traveled to France to play with \"Mitch Webb & The Swindles\u201d at the Crappone Country Rendezvous Festival. It was there he met the Great-Nephew of Texas Country Legend Ernest Tubb. He joined the band and began touring the USA and Europe with Lucky Tubb and the Modern Day Troubadours. After getting a bit burned out on the party lifestyle on the road, he left the Troubadours to get back to what he does best, playing Roots/Blues, and writing his own material.\n\nIn 2013 he released his first self-produced album \"Travelin' Man\" and proceeded to play all across the State of Texas, and various other places in the Continental U.S.\n\nCurrently, Will is performing full time with legendary Texas rockabilly group Two Tons Of Steel, touring throughout Texas, the Mid-West US and Europe. To keep up with Will's schedule with Two Tons, check out www.twotons.com. However, in the mean time, Will continues to write, record, perform and sit in with many notable seasoned musicians in the San Antonio area, including the Texas Tornados, among many others.

Zane began honing his chops in LA's vibrant music circuit on his 12th birthday and later refined his style at USC's prestigious Thornton School of Music, becoming one of the most in-demand guitarists on both coasts in the process. Possessing an exciting and extremely rare combination of creativity and virtuosity, along with an audiophile's ear for guitar tone and an extraordinary ability to sightread, Zane has been referred to as \"The best guitarist in NY and LA\" by Bono of U2. More recently, John Mayer handpicked Zane to play guitar on his current world tour and latest album, sans audition, after Mayer discovered Zane's fiery performances online. But with his newfound passion for writing and singing his own material, Zane is quickly gaining significant attention as a lead vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. While Zane's guitar playing has been described as daring, passionate, soulful, and jaw-dropping - tremendous labels for a young man many are proclaiming to be the next great guitar hero - Zane is now rapidly accumulating equally praiseworthy descriptions about his compositions and vocal abilities. As people witness Zane's evolution from gunslinging guitarist to full-fledged frontman, comparisons to the early days surrounding the release of John Mayer's debut EP \"Inside Wants Out\" have even been serendipitously drawn. Bob Lefsetz has raved about CARNEY - where Zane began his meteoric rise as a lead guitarist - likening the band's sound to \"a mysterious trip into the heart of darkness.\" But, Zane's original songs lean slightly away from the raw and brooding Rock and Roll that defined CARNEY as they gravitate towards his roots in Jazz, Blues and Pop. His songwriting style is grounded in visual storytelling, honesty, surrender and hope and his melodies, while imaginative and adventurous, are irresistibly catchy and instantly familiar. Zane's lyrics have been likened to those of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray LaMontagne, and his voice has been compared to singing icons Jeff Buckley, Damien Rice, and Jimmy Gnecco. This unique combination of masterful guitars, unforgettable hooks, and emotively provoking lyrics - all expressed with his profoundly moving and honest voice - is what makes Zane such a one-of-a-kind talent; one that seems poised to join not only the greats of his generation, but those who've come before him. Live performance is where Zane's most inherent gift shines; his undeniably infectious charisma - one that captivates the audience the instant he takes the stage.

From 2008-14, he played with his band the Humadors, and their 2011 release, The Love Show, hit the Roots Rock chart\u2019s Top 50.\n\nIn 2016 Hubbard collaborated with Nashville producer and 3-time Grammy Nominee Ken Coomer to release the self-titled solo album Dan Hubbard. \u201cI was truly happy with it,\u201d Hubbard says. \u201cI felt like I finally made the record I had always wanted to, and I wasn\u2019t in any hurry to do another one.\u201d But he had a lot more to say, and the songs on Attention cover everything from lost love and suicide, to brokenness, anger, hatred, and\u2014a running theme in all Hubbard\u2019s work\u2014the redeeming power of love.\n\nHubbard\u2014the youngest of three boys\u2014credits his brother D.J. with inspiring him to write. \u201cMy older brother started writing songs, and he was really good. Seeing his talent made me believe I might have it in me too.\u201d he says. At age nine, Hubbard\u2019s other brother, Erik, died from brain cancer when he was just 12. By 15, Dan discovered guitar as an outlet. \u201clyrics started coming pretty effortlessly as I learned to play guitar,\u201d he says. \u201cThe feeling I experienced when I finished a song\u2026I wanted to keep feeling that.\u201d After graduating from Illinois State University, Hubbard knew he wanted to pursue music, and he\u2019s been honing his craft ever since.\n\nLike his earlier work, Attention draws its subjects from Hubbard\u2019s life. \u201cI tend to be a wallflower,\u201d he says. \u201cI just observe, and life never stops giving me material. The subject matter has become more intense with this album. I\u2019m trying to meet people in their deepest, most vulnerable places, and let them know that they\u2019re not alone.\u201d What haven\u2019t changed are Hubbard\u2019s vocals, which alternate between powerful rock and blues shouts to tender inflections. His notes soothe, pulling us into the warmth of the music before his lyrics burn their message on our hearts.\n\nThe 11-song collection opens quietly enough with the first verse of \u201cRun Towards the River,\u201d as Hubbard whispers urgently, \u201cCount of three, move your feet, like you never have in your life/One last look at the years he took, now there\u2019s no time left for goodbye/Take a deep breath, watch the trees blow, hand on the handle, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d Barely audible, the lyrics quickly blossom into a warning\u2014\u201cwatch for the wicked\u201d\u2014and encouragement\u2014\u201cthere will be love waiting for you\u201d\u2014in a tune fueled by propulsive guitars and drums that mimic the desperate need to flee. \u201cThis song looks at different abusive relationships, urging the victims to realize what\u2019s happening to them\u2014and to get out,\u201d Hubbard says.\n\n\u201cPoison Words\u201d illustrates Hubbard\u2019s subtle genius by balancing swelling horn choruses with aching steel guitar, subtle gospel piano flourishes, and shimmering roots rock guitars. Hubbard says he wrote the song out of his frustration with the church. \u201cI consider myself a Christian,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there are aspects of it that I struggle with.\u201d The song\u2019s chorus repeats \u201cpoison words\u201d almost like a prayer, calling into account the church\u2019s treatment of the LGBTQ community.\n\n\u201cScars\u201d shares the anguish and fear that Hubbard\u2019s family felt when they learned his brother Erik\u2019s illness was terminal. \u201cThe day he died wasn\u2019t the worst day,\u201d Hubbard says. \u201cIt was the day we found out he was going to die.\u201d \u201cScars\u201d is the sparsest song on the album, with the tinkling of bells and a haunting steel guitar.\n\nOn the flipside, the funky \u201cAin\u2019t No Fountain\u201d dances around the bankruptcy of our dreams, while \u201cEvery Time I See Your Face\u201d delivers a gospel-inflected jazz tune that celebrates the promise of love. It\u2019s a \u201csong about God disguised to sound like it\u2019s about a significant other,\u201d Hubbard says cheekily. Attention closes with \u201c80,\u201d a simple soul number that celebrates life, even in the face of the unknown: \u201c80 years old/Into the unknown/Scared and alone/Still love rock-n-roll.\u201d\n\nHubbard\u2019s new album reminds us that he\u2019s been here all along, writing powerful songs that touch our hearts and ask difficult questions about the world we live in. He challenges and reassures us at the same time, the hallmark of a great songwriter. \u201cWe\u2019re all struggling. I get it because I\u2019m in this, too,\u201d he says. \u201cI just want to make people reflect.\u201d\n\nWhen we pay Attention, Dan Hubbard gets us to smile, cry, and think deeply about our shared human experience.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "KOAH ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10353311.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Rock, Alternative, Indie, Singer/Songwriter, Alternative Singer/songwriter, Southern Rock, Electronic", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "KOAH is an accomplished singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist active in both the United States East Coast and West Coast.

No Depression christened her \u201cEqual parts June Carter Cash, Nick Cave and Murder By Death.\u201d From Under the Basement magazine summed her up by saying, \u201cImagine Bill Monroe and Sid Vicious having kids together.\u201d Common Folk Music went a step further, suggesting a sound equivalent to \u201cthe glint of a switchblade held to your throat.\u201d\n\nConsequently, while Emch chose to dub her latest project the Secret Emchy Society, the truth is she\u2019s always remained clear and concise when it comes to her convictions. A singer, songwriter, author, poet, radio host and outspoken advocate for causes affecting the LGBTQ community, she\u2019s pursued both cause and craft since first opting to become a performer from the time she was a child, while singing classic cabaret songs with her mother. At age 14, she picked up her first guitar and learned to play via the Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen songbooks. Since then, her career has blossomed, thanks to time with her bands Vagabondage, Feral, Sinners Tonic, and her bluegrass band, convincingly titled Rhubarb Whiskey, whose offshoot Oakland Wine Drinkers Union, Local 88 helped broaden her musical palette. At the same time, she found herself sharing stages with other Bay Area favorites, including T Sisters, 5 Cent Coffee, Mark Growden, Pony Hunt, Foxtail Brigade, and more.\n\nAfter a succession of albums, EPs and guest appearances with such standout artists as Juno-nominated singer Carolyn Mark, the band Unwoman, and longtime collaborator Sean Malroy, Emch expanded her ambitions and founded the aforementioned Secret Emchy Society, a loose collective that features a revolving group of like-minded musicians who hop on her bandwagon during various stops along the tour. The cast currently includes Emch on vocals, guitar and accordion, Hans Winold on bass, Dillie Dauley on viola, and Eric \u201cScratch\u201d Ingerson on drums.\n\nDespite the contributions of her talented co-conspirators, the band\u2019s first offering, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville qualifies as Emch\u2019s official solo debut after years of playing and songwriting with others. She describes it as \u201can album of hard earned heartbreakers and foot stompers about good friends and hard times.\" Emch wrote all the material either in whole or with occasional input from her collaborators, making for a series of songs that rejoice and reflect, ruminate and reminisce about times both good and bad, and especially the importance of being true to one\u2019s own ideas and identity. The music celebrates a variety of vintage styles, from rowdy barn-burners and old time honky tonk, to tears-in- your beer ballads, zydeco rave-ups, and brassy collusions of country and cabaret, aiming to strike its appeal with both the mainstream and the marginalized.\n\nAs her collaborator Carolyn Mark said of Emch\u2019s music \u201cIt pairs well with whisky and hitting the streets.\u201d\n\nBased on initial impressions, the critics seem to agree. \u201cFrom the very first listen I loved this album, after which I loved it more and more with every listen...\" said Mike Morrison of AmericanRootsUK.com. \"The songs on The Stars Fall Shooting are pretty and gritty, sexy and sad,\u201d writes Jessie Lynn McMains aka Rust Belt Jessie, Racine, Wisconsin\u2019s Poet Laureate. \u201cThe music is a mix of everything from honky tonk to alt-country, to jazz and zydeco and punk, and it slides into your ears like a good blend of rye whiskies sliding down your throat. Sweet and warm, with just enough of a burn.\"\n\nNone of this ought to come as any surprise considering that Emch\u2019s literary endeavors have closely paralleled her musical output. A well recognized writer and poet, she has published five chapbooks, founded / hosted / curated the Queer Open Mic for five years, and featured at dozens of spoken word showcases including Sister Spit, the Radar Reading series, K'vetch, Writers With Drinks, as well as co-hosted a queer radio show with Lynn Breedlove. She has been interviewed on PirateCat Radio, FCC Free Radio, Revelator Radio, OutsiderWriters.com, ReadThisMagazine.co.uk, Drinks with Tony (Radio Valencia) and on NPR for her writing, her music, and, she claims, \u201cher propensity for being in car accidents that are not her fault.\u201d Notably too, she has also been featured in the Accordion Babes Calendar and was notoriously Francis Bean Cobain\u2019s favorite \u2018babe\u2019 of that year.\n\nNevertheless, The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was borne from less than assuring circumstances. After burning out from years of day-job overtime, the loss of friends and family members and watching her own health decline due to the stress, Emch found herself sitting in a haunted bar in New Orleans, her spiritual second home. There she met a \u201cgrizzled and gorgeous\u201d old woman who told her, \u201cCome on honey, this is New Orleans. You gotta shake your ass!\u201d The musician took the women\u2019s admonition as a sign \u2013 it was time to get down to her real work as a musical artist.\n\nThe Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville was recorded at Lucky Mouse Studios in Victoria, British Columbia, with the help of vocalist/guitarist/producer Tolan McNeil and singer/pianist Carolyn Mark who trades vocals with Emch on \u201cHad Enough.\u201d \u201cShe was the first person to put me solo on a stage with a guitar in my hands,\u201d Emch recalls. In fact, it was Mark\u2019s decision to enlist Emch as her opening act for a show at the Epicurean Connection in Sonoma, California that launched the Secret Emchy Society\u2019s first official performance. Mark also recruited members of her own band, bassist Dennis Siemens and drummer/guitarist Joel Fernandes, to assist on Secret Emchy Society\u2019s debut. Other contributors include Grayson Walker on piano and accordion, back-up vocalist J. McLaughlan and Olivier Clements on brass.\n\n\u201cI flew from Oakland to Victoria and spent four days teaching the band the songs, laying down the core tracks, and making sure we were all on the same page,\u201d Emch recalls. \u201cWhat we came up with was an impressive array of harmonies, accordion, piano, upright bass, horns, drums, a whole passel of guitars, and a deep sense of satisfaction.\u201d\n\nEmch, who cites Hank Williams, Hazel Dickens, Shovels & Rope, Johnny Paycheck, Charles Mingus, Hurray for the Riff Raff, Bob Wills, and the Corn Sisters as key influences, went all out when it came to gathering material for the album. \u201cThere are scraps and orphans of songs that made it onto this record that were years and years old,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere are songs on this record that were less than two weeks old when they were recorded. All I know is that I threw every bit of myself into it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s little wonder then that the results are both highly personal and wholly contagious.\n\n\u201cWhat I have to offer the world is music, stories, and finding ways that I can throw the most powerful parts of myself into a few muddled chords and some danger,\u201d Emch insists.\n\nGiven those efforts, it\u2019s also clear that she\u2019s succeeded.\n\nFor more information and track by track descriptions, go to http://www.emchy.com", "otherInfo": "Join JBird McLaughlin and Secret Emchy Society as they play you some songs, tell you some tales, and give you a behind the scenes look at the making of the new album The Chaser!

The Army of Broken Toys's stage show exorcises personal tragedies and cleaves its audience's hearts with rollicking apocalyptic waltzes and powerful rock ballads that seem to emerge from under their ringmaster Walter Sickert\u2019s top hat.

The WIREFOREST boasts 7 musicians (guitars, upright bass, drums, viola, mandolin, broken toys, melodica, accordion, ukulele, flute...) and rolls with a surreal troupe of any number of midway and burlesque performers, The Bunny Collaborative.

The band has continued to participate in the challenge every year since its inception. The Toys have successfully funded two Kickstarter campaigns, and produced a 40+ show run of their original 'steampunk musical for people who hate musicals,' \"28 Seeds\" a cautionary tale for our time writ by the band's resident playwright/mustache, Meff and produced by Liars and Believers.

He has played solo and with bands, in large outdoor venues and tiny coffeehouses, to big crowds and small gatherings. He\u2019s stood on stages and tabletops, under the lights and in dimly lit corners, in large cities, small towns, a couple of state fairs, and one beauty pageant. He\u2019s played four hour shows single-handedly, and traded half-hour sets at a weekly house gig at a bar in Guatemala City with \u201csome guy named Luis, who sang songs like \u2018My Way\u2019 in Spanish. The pay was 15 quetzales and all the Gallo beer I could drink,\u201d according to Jim.\n\nAlong the way Jim has written songs for and appeared on Madison Square Garden TV\u2019s \u201cYankee Ticket\u201d pregame show, and Fox Sports Net\u2019s Minnesota Twins pregame show. Jim\u2019s music caught the attention of the Twins, and Jim\u2019s song Circle Me Bert was featured by the Twins in a 10,000 CD giveaway to fans attending a game. He has also written the music for a fishing show, and children\u2019s music for an up-coming educational video.\n\nJim\u2019s latest realease is entitled Into The Blue. It\u2019s rock/pop sprinkled with a bit of folk/country/jazz and garnished with a pinch of reggae on the side and served with a smile on the seriously humorous side of town. With song topics ranging from politics and religion (\u201cgod\u201d) to life as a dog (\u201cRoxygrrl\u201d), Into The Blue covers a lot of ground. Life, death, love, politics and religion--it's all in there.\n\nA true independent musician, Jim released Into The Blue on his own label, Door To Door Music, as he did with his previous releases, All Dressed Up And All Stressed Out (1996), Knives & Bleeding (1999). and Hello Hello (2002). Each release features songwriting that bears the mark of a variety of influences such as Lennon & McCartney, Bob Marley, Elvis Costello, Squeeze, even Hank Williams. A fan on Jim\u2019s CDBaby page summed it up this way:\n\u201cJim plays because he loves music. He plays with the same passion whether he is playing for thousands or a few fans. It is clear in every track that Jim is playing for his love of music and not just for all the hoopla.

A conformed church housed a bar in the front full of rogue townies, and a lounge in the back.\n\"Turn your phones off,\" the host of the lounge barked into the microphone. \"Turn them off, sit back, and pay attention. This guy is quiet, and he's going to tell you some stories.\"\nAnd my eyebrows raised when his hoarse voice breathed life into a quiet, rapt crowd. With his eyes closed, he sang songs - chunks of him offered up to a willing mass.\n\"I'm not a singer,\" he said eventually, looking down at his guitar. I leaned in to listen harder. \"I'm not a guitarist. I'm a song writer.\"\nIn his songs were stories and in his stories were words pushed together that took my breath away, and in his stories were words that oozed the Blood from the Before, and in his stories were ripped edges.\nI wanted to know it all. I wanted to know the names of the chunks and I wanted to inspect the hole in his chest and I wanted to know where those melodies come from and I wanted to know how he chooses the words.\nI wanted to know what he has written on the scraps of paper in his wallet and I wanted to know if his handwriting changes when he knows it's a good one.\nIt was a listening lounge, and we were supposed to be quiet and listen, but he played a song we all knew. And we sang the words with him. We couldn't help it - not one single person.\nA crooked grin formed behind the microphone and I'm fairly certain that's why he does what he does. Not for the lights. Not for the cheers. For sure not for the money.\nHe does it for the people that hear the story and say, \"Yes. Me, too. I have been there, too.\"\nIn a town out in the middle of the cornfields of Iowa, a group of people sang the words back to him that he had written. A melody chunked out of one disaster from his life, and sewn together with a rhyme, and\nmaybe that's how you heal the hurt.\n...\nVulnerability. Standing up on a stage when you'd rather be holding a pen.\nSure looks an awful lot like courage.\n\n\n- Rebecca Cooper, Author", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Wildermiss ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371381.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Indie Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A lot has happened since Wildermiss released its auspicious debut, a promising six-song EP titled Lost With You, in 2017. In the two years since, the members of Wildermiss\u2014Cole, guitarists Josh Hester and Seth Beamer, and drummer Caleb Thoemke\u2014have built up a massive and fiercely loyal grassroots following in its hometown of Denver, Colorado, and crisscrossed the country winning over fans as the supporting act on tours with the Oh Hellos, Jared and the Mill and Bronze Radio Return.\n\nMore than a fan favorite, the quartet has also earned accolades from the press and radio in the Mile High City on the strength of its music and live show. \u201cCarry Your Heart,\u201d a Lost With You single that has attracted more than half a million streams on Spotify, received heavy rotation on KTCL, the taste-making station that first introduced the country to the Oh Hellos, The Fray, Flobots, Churchill, and many other breakout acts in the past fifteen years.\n\nIn addition to selling out the Bluebird Theater and thrilling capacity crowds with intimate back-to-back New Year\u2019s Eve dates at the Larimer Lounge, Wildermiss has played prime mainstage sets at all of the city\u2019s biggest music festivals, including iHeart Radio\u2019s Big Gig at the 18,000-seat amphitheater Fiddler\u2019s Green, the Westword Music Showcase and the Underground Music Showcase, which drew tens of thousands of fans, in addition to sharing a bill at the 6,500-seat 1STBANK Center arena with the Revivalists, Elle King, American Authors.\n\nThe outfit\u2019s ascent has all been organic. The members of Wildermiss have attracted fans the old fashioned way by writing memorable songs and playing their hearts out each night, winning over fan after fan one at a time. As viewers who happened to catch Wildermiss on Last Call With Carson Daly can attest, the act isn\u2019t a tough sell. Portions of the band\u2019s set at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles were captured for broadcast, and the performance was so compelling that it ended up airing on two different episodes of NBC\u2019s late-night show.\n\nBut just as those performances served as a sneak peek for the fortunate few across the country who were still up in the wee hours of the morning, Lost With You merely hinted at the potential of Wildermiss. In My Mind, the outfit\u2019s new seven-song EP, surpasses any expectations set by the group\u2019s highly acclaimed debut. From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band.

Since her younger days, Hailey has opened for big time acts such as Deana Carter, Love and Theft, James Otto, Craig Wayne Boyd, The Moonshine Bandits, and more. She has performed at popular Nashville venues like The Bluebird Caf\u00e9, Tootsie\u2019s Orchid Lounge, and The Listening Room, and has turned heads at Oregon\u2019s biggest festivals, rodeos, venues and Portland\u2019s own Moda Center. Today, one of Hailey\u2019s favorite places to share her songs is in increasingly crowded local venues where her growing legions of fans, thanks to a solid following on social media, sing along to her original material.\n\nAlong with being a gifted, natural singer, Hailey\u2019s ability to weave her experiences into tightly crafted, catchy songs lifts her above the norm of today\u2019s it-all-sounds-the-same country. The ability to create an authentic space within each song is what keeps her fans coming back to her live performances and downloading new singles as quickly as they come out. These songs like \u201cRerun,\u201d and \u201cShooting Stars\u201d from her brand new EP \u201cThe Real Stuff\u201d, which reached #9 on the iTunes Country Music Chart, speak to the universal truths of life: love and heartbreak, moments and memories, and staying true to who you are without relying on the usual clich\u00e9s. The new EP, is her third studio recorded EP that features a collection of songs she has written since her move from her hometown to Nashville, TN in October 2016.\n\nHailey Verhaalen is an authentic talent whose inner flame shines bright, and a young woman with deep, family roots that keep her grounded, heart-driven and full of excitement for a promising, musical future.\n\n\n\nWebsite: http://haileyverhaalen.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/haileyvmusic\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HaileyVerhaalen\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn0jG0k0Qgs7Nw3YKNH2Fcw", "otherInfo": "Come help virtually celebrate the release of Hailey Verhaalen\u2019s new single \u201cSomeday When This is Over\u201d on May 15th at 7pm PST/9PM CST"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jared & The Mill ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8338992.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Western Indie Rock", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jared & The Mill is a southwestern indie rock band, formed in 2011 in Phoenix, Arizona. A collection of 5 childhood friends who met up in college, Jared & The Mill has spent the past few years touring extensively through the dive bars, venues, theaters, music festivals, and even arenas of the U.S. and Canada, playing alongside burgeoning bands and established acts, and developing a strong and rooted fan base along the way. The band has multiple and successful independent releases, the most recent 2016 release, Orme Dugas was produced by Ryan Hewitt and recorded in Nashville, Tennessee hitting #46 overall iTunes and #9 Billboard Heatseeker Mountain Region.\n\u201cOrme Dugas blurs lines to the point where the ambiguity becomes an asset unto itself, a record that sounds exactly like Jared & The Mill to the returning listener but a little more gray to a newcomer. It\u2019s not rock, it\u2019s not country, it\u2019s not folk, but it\u2019s not quite pop. So where do they fit? They\u2019ve opened for the Zac Brown Band, the War on Drugs, Allen Stone, and the Killers, to name a few, and while it\u2019s an impressive list, it\u2019s a still a grab bag. Their undefinable nature is also their strongest weapon.

A self-described \u2018military brat\u2019, Welling\u2019s struggle to feel rooted in any one place carved a unharmonious path of heartbreak, doubt, and insecurity that defined her 20s and early 30s\u2026 a journey that lead to her soul-defining rebirth as an international touring artist with a place to call home in Nashville, TN.\n\nHer bold, sultry voice, reminiscent of Sheryl Crow\u2019s grit, Natalie Maines\u2019 twang, and Stevie Nicks\u2019 heart, is upstaged only by the genuine love and connection this natural performer has with her fans both on and off stage. But embracing confidence has not always been easy for this singer-songwriter, who speaks candidly about her battle to be good to herself, and to quiet the inner voice nagging her to be \u201cperfect\u201d. Through the process of creating her latest work, a collection of songs that encapsulate Carrie\u2019s determination to embrace self-love, self-care, and leave the past behind, she\u2019s found a place of peace and healing, recognizing that authenticity and vulnerability is the glue that binds us all.\n\nIn 2018, a few years after the release of her first solo EP, The Edge, Welling put out a Patreon campaign, embracing her dream to finally quit the side hustle and focus on music full-time. Her patrons, which Carrie refers to as her \u201cchampions\u201d, have proven to be an integral part of the artist\u2019s journey - not only supporting her online but also at live performances across the globe. \u201cMy Patreon champions started out as my fans and now we\u2019re all friends. Some of them I talk to everyday, and they give me music ideas! They keep me going,\u201d she says, reflecting on the creator-founded platform.\n\nMelodies rich in folksy, Americana roots, paired with empowering, honest lyrics are stunningly showcased in Welling\u2019s forthcoming, full length album High Heels and Heavy Things. Created in a home studio in Nashville with purely organic instruments, this raw and vulnerable record was produced by Eric Holljes (Delta Rae) and features songs co-written by the talented likes of Holljes, Mary Bragg, Alex Wong, and Matt Zavala.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things has been a long time labor of love since it\u2019s conception in 2015, to its birth in April 2020. In between studio sessions Carrie took to the stage, opening for notable artists such as Delta Rae and David Cook, and performing at popular music festivals including the the Island Hopper Music Festival (Ft. Meyers, FL). She\u2019ll be a featured artist at the \u201cSongwriters Island Showcase\u201d in Isla Mujeres, Mexico in 2020, and will be opening once again for Delta Rae and David Cook (Summer Tour 2020). In the interim she\u2019s logged countless hours on the road, performing at venues and house concerts across the US, as well as an international tour through Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things will be available on iTunes and Spotify worldwide in Summer of 2020.
