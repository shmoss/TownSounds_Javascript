Sadly, I attempted violin as a young child and was brutally bad. My parents had some how had me listening to classical music at that time which probably explains the violin attempt. Then a miracle happened\u2026First, the Beatles arrived so, bye bye classical & then my aunt who was buying a new piano (the wealthier end of the family) offered me her old one. I\u2019m 8 1/2 so I was still agreeable to anything so I promised to take lessons and really work at it.\n\nI lied\u2026After a year and a half I quit\u2026..until I discovered Elton John. That was it! I was determined to be a musician. In the late 70\u2019s I joined a fairly succesful 50\u2019s/60\u2019s band called Slick. I played 6 nights a week and worked full time at a department store as a stock man (person in this politically correct universe). Exhaustion wasn\u2019t considered. I went to gigs with a thermos of tea and lemon since I was always sick. This lasted until the early 80\u2019s. I joined a band called Loose Change which (under my direction) played anything from the 1960\u2019s- whatever was current. That lasted 12 years. Many years of putting my ears in harms way and breathing in way to much bar smoke told me it was time to quit. This was somewhere around 1993/94 (I don\u2019t remember). The next time I played live was in 2004 at my local block party. That\u2019s what I needed to get the itch to play again but, I was working in retail at Sam Ash Music and simply had no time to gig. In 2007 I was offered a better job which offered me a 9-5 existence. The economy turned sour and earning extra cash became a priority. And then it happened\u2026.I walked into a local Italian restaurant called Vera\u2019s Trattoria to pick up a pizza and lo and behold (fancy words ehh?) a piano player was pumping out Jazz licks. Can you imagine? Live music! I decided to approach the owner to see if I could score a gig. He decided to try me the following week. I was hired as a permanent fixture on Saturday nights. Thus The Richie G Review was born. \u201cA one man band Piano/vocals using backing tracks and a voice harmonizer to create a full band sound. My current song list represents over seventy artists including Elton John, Billy Joel , James Taylor, The Beatles and hits from the 1960\u2019s thru today. Over 500 tunes and counting\u2013 Booking email onemanbandrichieg@gmail.com .\u201d I played at Vera\u2019s for 14 months and then a new owner took over. He decided that entertainment was unnecessary. I got to work recording a CD of covers and creating business cards. The hard work paid off! I\u2019m a permanent Wednesday night fixture at the Woodcliff lake Hilton as well as sprinkling in various weekend gigs.\n\nRidgewood Street Fair 2013-2014\n\n\n\n392561_413258562028352_398683286819213_1318553_160572558_nRIDGEWOOD\n\n\n\nChapter 2- Ginger Martini was Born Right around St Patty\u2019s Day of 2012, I was performing at the Elm Street Grill in Oakland NJ. I was approached by my soon to be partner Wendy Kelly. I was on the floor wiring up my equipment as she, asked me questions about what I do (kind of music, etc). I was excited believing that I was going to be hired for a private party. During the break, she handed me her card.It turned out she was interested in joining me. I wasn\u2019t looking but, I agreed to see what she sounded like at my rehearsal space (haha my basement). Three songs later I was convinced. We sounded great together. A week later, we had 50 plus songs ready for prime time. She joined me at The Paris Inn in Wayne NJ. Ever since we perform around 50% of my gigs together and get an incredible response. Wendy started a seasoned veteran of the Broadway, Standard, and Country Genres. She has since dragged me into her country word as I dragged her into my pop/rock world.

As NPR says of the British transplant, \u201chis timeless songwriting style, which seems to draw from great songwriters of every era, conveys quiet confidence and lovely intimacy.\u201d\n\nNodding to \u201870s rock with shimmering acoustic guitars, an understated rhythm section and flourishes of fiddle, mandolin, piano and dobro, \u2018Another Life\u2019 bridges the mainstream appeal of songwriters like Jesse Harris and Norah Jones and the quirkier sensibility of Loudon Wainwright. With funding entirely from fan contributions through PledgeMusic, Maddock worked with producer Matt Pierson, multi-instrumentalist Larry Campbell (who\u2019s played with Bob Dylan and Levon Helm) and bassist Tony Scherr (who plays with Norah Jones).\n\nThe 13 songs on 'Another Life' paint a portrait of a man reaching the midpoint of his life, a natural progression from themes in Maddock's earlier releases. He\u2019s looking back on roads not taken, and isn\u2019t always sure he chose the right one. On the title track, Maddock wants an extra 50 years to try \u201cacting, white-water rafting,\u201d \u201csome illegal substances,\u201d even having a kid or three. \u201cI\u2019ve Been There Too,\u201d built around an indelible guitar riff, shows Maddock\u2019s knack for instrumental hooks as well as lyrical ones. \u201cDon\u2019t Go Lonely,\u201d in a well-timed moment of levity, hints at reggae with dub bass, bubbling organ and the chorus\u2019s entreaty to \u201cgo get high, go get found, go crazy on this town / don\u2019t go lonely.\u201d\n\nAfter fronting the Columbia Records band Wood, whose debut \u2018Songs From Stamford Hill\u2019 was featured prominently on TV shows such as \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek,\u201d Maddock moved from England to New York City in 2003. His 2009 album \u2018Sunrise On Avenue C\u2019 won a New York Music Award for Best Americana Album, while follow-up 'Wake Up And Dream' ranked among the top albums of 2011 in WFUV's (NYC) Listener Poll. He's performed with Bruce Springsteen, Willie Nile, Aaron Comess (Spin Doctors) and David Immergluck (Counting Crows), sang on an album with Susan McKeown, and is a resident artist at Rockwood Music Hall.

Classified as an inspirational rapper, Serious is often told she sounds and looks like Grammy rapper/producer Missy Elliott, but Serious is just a different brand of artist once you partake in the \"experience\". The award-winning rapper was recently showcased in national publication ESSENCE MAGAZINE for her versatility. In March 2016, her music video for Thirsty, which has garnered over 18,000 views was showcased at the SXSW Video Screening for Wix.com.\n\nSerious knew from the age of 12 that she was created to rap. She didn\u2019t know how things would work out but kept working on her craft.\n\nShe was 21 years old, on missionary work in Johannesburg, South Africa and was asked by the perform at a stadium concert. After giving up on her gift for over 10 years she was very reluctant, but was obedient. That day Serious impacted many and knew that she would never give up on her gift.\nAfter her missionary work was complete, she headed home to record YES, a song tha took many locals in the New York Tri-state area by storm in 2000.Then in 2009 she felt the very strong urge to take her music to the next level and began to seek out better producers, management and the like.\nIn 2011 she signed a deal with Holywood Records, a Florida based label. During that year she auditioned for the Staten Island Gospel Fest and became a finalist and was honored to minister to folks from across the tri-state area. That same year, coordinators at WIADCA, a notable \u201csecular\u201d Caribbean organization that furnished scholarships to youngsters in addition to taking part in the Labor Day festivities in NYC invited Serious as the first and only female Christian rapper to perform on the Brooklyn Museum stage for the WIADCA GospelFest.\nSerious released Are You Serious Vol 1 in January 2012. The mixtape was available on all major Christian hip hop sites and Datpiff, garnering over 11k downloads.\nIn August of 2012, Serious was nominated as Female Rap Minister by the Kingdom Choice Awards Committee. Since the nomination, she has successfully toured various parts of Texas with her SAAB message, touching the hearts of women by simply testifying and sharing her music.\nNow under the label Serious PPL Music, which is headed by Christopher James, Serious continues to tour and do local and national shows. She is currently working on her debut album and is on her three year long tour called (Stilettos & A Book) SAAB.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Asbury Park, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "Christopher Paul Stelling", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9518993.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.01, 40.22], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Folk Revival, Singer, Songwriter, Anti-Folk, Americana", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Danny Clinch Transparent Gallery", "moreBioInfo": "Christopher Paul Stelling\nBest of Luck\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Americana or alt anything, it\u2019s really just soulful folk music,\u201d Ben Harper says of Best of Luck, the new album by Christopher Paul Stelling, which he produced.\n\nHarper and Stelling met a few years back when the Grammy award winning musician-producer invited Stelling to open a series of shows. \u201cBen gave me a true gift back then,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cI\u2019d been on the road for a long time and he put me onstage in front of his fans. He took me to the Beacon, The Ryman, Massey Hall, all these leg-endary rooms. Just to see that what I could do would even translate in spaces like that was revelatory.\u201d\n\nHarper says he instantly recognized a kindred spirit in Stelling\u2019s virtuosic finger picking and soulful delivery. \u201cIt was like finding a John Fahey or Leo Kottke that was a really great singer,\u201d he explains.\n\nThe recording of Best Of Luck culminated on a rainy night in Los Angeles, but the whole thing really began back in North Carolina. Stelling calls Asheville home, though he has been in a state of near constant motion for years. Leaving Florida while young to roam and perfect his craft, he made stops in Colorado, Boston, Seattle, New York and eventually North Carolina - all interspersed with relentless touring - hundreds of performances a year, in bars, coffee houses, nightclubs and theaters.\n\n\u201cThe lifestyle of constant touring was gaining on me,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cAnd then I was back home, and in the abrupt silence, there was a clarity. The fumes of hubris I had been running on for years were all but gone and my relationship with my environment and myself had turned toxic. I was scared but resolved to persevere. On Christmas Day, after a few false starts, I gave up drinking and decided to take a look at myself.\u201d\n\nAnd then, as if following some greater cosmic narrative, an email arrived that New Year\u2019s Day. It was Harper asking if he would be interested in making a record in Los Angeles. \u201cI had never worked with a producer before,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cI had always con-trolled everything; it was how I had survived. But I needed a mentor and a friend; I was too far from shore.\"\n\nStelling accepted an artist\u2019s residency at the Stetson Kennedy House outside of Jack-sonville Florida to prepare. Kennedy had been a folklorist and comrade of Woody Guthrie and Zora Neale Hurston. Woody stayed there for extended periods as well. \u201cI moved into this little house in a North Florida swamp just an hour from where I was born and raised,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cAnd I proceeded to freak out. It was the first time I\u2019d just sat still for years. Mostly, I took inventory of myself. But I left feeling like I\u2019d found a thread. After that, I would send Ben demos. He would respond with encouragement and tell me to keep digging, so I\u2019d keep digging. Looking back, the whole process was the medicine I needed.\u201d\n\nBest Of Luck is a supremely accessible and finely crafted record that deftly merges genres. Harper, who has previously produced records by Mavis Staples, Rickie Lee Jones, The Blind Boys of Alabama and others, recruited an all-star rhythm section with Jimmy Paxson (Stevie Nicks, Dixie Chicks) on drums and upright bass player Mike Va-lerio (Randy Newman, LA Philharmonic) to lend a versatility and finesse. \u201cI really be-lieve this record is the intersection where folk and soul meet,\u201d Harper says.\n\nThe album\u2019s title, Best Of Luck, mirrored perfectly the emotional landscape in which it was created. \u201cDepending on how you say it, it can either be a blessing or a dismissal,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cAnd that was exactly the point I was coming to with myself, my career as an artist, as a friend and as a person.\u201d\n\nThe first track, \u201cHave To Do For Now\u201d is a haunting evocation of a moment between an unexamined past and an uncertain future. The guitar refrain evokes a beautiful sense of wistfulness about the past. \u201cIt\u2019s a song about the fear of losing memories and the re-lief of letting them go,\u201d Stelling explains. \u201cIt was written in one sitting. A flood of memo-ries moving back to when I was very young and I fell from a tree house and split my head open. I\u2019d never really processed that trauma but it\u2019s one of my earliest and most visceral memories. I can\u2019t help but wonder how that day and others like it have influ-enced my life.\u201d\n\nThe sonic simplicity of \u201cLucky Stars\u201d reveals a richness of melody and emotionality. \u201cIt\u2019s part love song, part lullaby,\u201d Stelling says of the track, \u201cwith a gentle touch from the band and Ben\u2019s haunting lap steel matching my guitar in the instrumental section, ad-ditional vocals by my partner. It\u2019s about gratitude and the mysteries of the universe. Even to just be here and marvel at it all is enough for me most times. Even if it\u2019s mean-ingless, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\nThroughout the record, discontent and self-doubt are transformed into messages of resilience and hope. \u201cTrouble Don\u2019t Follow Me\u201d captures this perfectly, with an upbeat almost anthemic rhythm and soulful, gospel-tinged vocals. \u201cIt comes as no surprise to me that one of my most optimistic songs could be written in the most difficult hour,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cWhen all I needed was a little hope and a song I could play night after night and not get tired of. Something that captured the basic recipe for endurance. A song about marching on, a warning to anything that might stand in your way, and needing to feel strong for the people around you, so you can inspire them to do the same.\u201d\n\nThere is an uninhibited defiance to \u201cUntil I Die,\u201d a revved up folk-blues featuring a beautifully raw guitar and beat. \u201cThis song is a kaleidoscope in the hall of mirrors, a psychedelic rant,\u201d Stelling says. \u201cOne thing is for certain amidst the chaos and uncer-tainty, and that is having someone to love and who loves you back is unrivaled.\u201d\n\nWhen Harper talks about his admiration for Stelling, he refers to his family\u2019s legendary folk music store, filled with instruments and a fluid merging of styles and genres. \u201cWhen I listen to Chris, I hear my grandparent\u2019s store in Claremont,\u201d Harper says. \u201cHe\u2019s carrying on that tradition. A guy that can play any instrument from any country and play it with real feeling. He crosses genres but manages to respect them; he is a folk singer with an unusual soulfulness. He understands where this music comes from and why it\u2019s remains so essential. Of all the record\u2019s I have produced, this is one I\u2019m most proud of.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Stelling says, \u201cThis record was about learning to trust the people around me. If anything, after years of closely guarded decision-making I\u2019m delighted by the re-sults of this collaboration. This record has an undeniable sense of clarity. The songs are lean but never feel incomplete. Ben knew how to coax me out of my well-worn comfort zones, how to move fast and spontaneously and put me on the spot, and how to retreat and give me space to process things. People who know me have said they hear a lot more of me in this album than anything before. Realizing I couldn\u2019t heal the world, I started to heal myself, and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased by how that sounds.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1121 Elizabeth Ave, Elizabeth, NJ 07201", "Artist": "Manny Cabo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9101761.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.212344, 40.662132], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "Genres: Southern Pop Rock, Rock, Pop Rock, Classic Rock, Commercial Rock, Latin", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "C.

The last 15 years have borne witness to the Philadelphia five-piece exercising stylistic evolutions and aerial dynamics with humbling dexterity and untamed ambition. At their roots may be a theatrical progressive punk/post-hardcore band, but they\u2019ve never been content to remain comfortably within a familiar genre. Their continuous multi-directional movements have left them increasingly difficult to classify, the growth of their branches impossible to predict. The group\u2019s sixth full-length album, Pale Horses, is the best evidence to date of their eclectic agility.\nThe one constant in mewithoutYou's storied career has been lead singer Aaron Weiss' ability to sketch ornate, thought-provoking narratives. Seamlessly weaving his signature holler amidst whispered storytelling and stream-of-consciousness outpourings, his latest offerings vacillate between the emotionally wracked, vibrantly symbolic, and ambiguously metaphysical. His meandering, technicolor vision of a world apocalyptic\u2014populated with werewolves and vulturemen, shape-shifters and apparitions, android whales and an Idaho bride\u2014combines the fantastic opulence of the group\u2019s recent albums with the vulnerable personal confessions of their earliest work.\nLongtime band-mates Mike Weiss, Rickie Mazzotta and Greg Jehanian continue to craft dramatic, nightmare soundscapes which lavishly complement their singer\u2019s ecstatic hallucinations. The addition of Brandon Beaver (of Buried Beds, the Silver Ages) allows the group as a 5-piece to revisit its earlier intricate, layered fretwork, while adding new depths of vocal harmonies and ever-peculiar arrangements. Musically, the group hearkens boldly to the raw intensity of 2004's Catch for Us the Foxes, while building on the rich imagery of 2006's Brother, Sister.

Originates from unlikely sources, but they are close to home for him. \"King\" is his Grandmothers last name. \"Armor\" is his Grandfathers last name. Both on his mothers side of the family, whom he considers cornerstones, who have endured a lot and continue to keep moving forward. His name was originally conceptualized out of the desire to have a name that commanded attention & respect. It later began to have more meaning and purpose as he himself would endure both professional and personal challenges that would require a thick skin or suit of armor.\nThe super part of his name was actually tagged on by an organizer of a battle that took place at NYU in the early 2000's. The organizer felt it sounded more threatening, and put it on the flyer. Since then it just stuck. It also has become synonymous with the energy of his live performances. He says. \" I've met people who sincerely hate my name because its either too long, not hood enough, traditional enough, or sounds like it came from a video game , or a cartoon, and laugh because they think its over the top. Those encounters give me a chance to show them something different, how I do my thing, my approach to Hip Hop music. Then there are those people who absolutely love it. They think its the hardest, original name they've heard. Because of that polarity I won't change it. People show there true feelings, have unique responses to it, which starts some interesting conversations and allows me to engage my audience on another level.\" His Approach to Hip Hop can be defined as aggressive, dark, passionate, energetic, gritty, intellectual, witty, creative, uncompromising and autobiographic.\nIf he were to compare himself to a group of artists that inspire, influence, and shares similarities with. They would be Tech N9ne, Andre 3000, Pharoah Monch, Chino XL, Kool Kieth, Rza, Gza, Masta Ace, El-P, Rakim, Eminem, Canibus, Melle Mel, Joe Budden, Nas, Immortal Technique, ATCQ, and Jean Grae. These artists are a mix of Brutally honest, survivors, weird, loner types, perfectionists, passionate lyricists, with a gritty dark sided humor, intellectual, creative, versatile, some independent diy enthusiasts, but most of all driven, hopeless, Hip Hop, romantics.\nSuper King also possesses other distinct talents. One of them being a artist, specifically cartooning, and illustrating. He has interned for Marvel comics and a animation studio in the dumbo area in NYC. With the exception of the album artwork for his EP release \"The Werewolf Lullabies\", and the final stages of the logo for 8th Rank Records, he designed his personal logo, flyers, album covers, storyboards for music videos, & a indie film, and the conceptual art for the 8th Rank Records logo.\nHis other talent is for working out. Having been a personal trainer for a number of years nationally certified, a power lifter, now focusing on calisthenics training, and competitions based around that. He is always willing to offer his skill set through consultation and even training sessions. Just contact him at enraemercerfitness@gmail.com.\nHe is the founder and flagship artist of 8th Rank Records.\nin 2012 he turned it into an LLC. He always wanted to start his own business, and creating his own record label, a place he would have complete autonomy over his music was the obvious route to take. The name was inspired by his love of chess. The 8th Rank is any of the last squares on either side of the board. When one of the pawns, those little pieces in front of all the different larger pieces in the back reaches there, it becomes the strongest piece on the board, being able to move anywhere. A metaphor for going through something, and coming out on the other end in complete control of the direction of where you want to go from there. The snake is a symbol in alchemy referred to as the \"ouroboros\", usually a serpent as a circle eating itself. He wanted multiple meanings to be wrapped in the logo.\nRegarding projects he has released, his horror-core EP \"The Werewolf Lullabies\" Featured production from Eupham from Mindspray Crew, 100DBS, Tah Phrum Duh Bush, and cuts by DJ Milk Money. Artwork provided by Demostina. The Theme of the EP, revolves around a dream he had where in which he transform into a werewolf. The transformation is induced by high volumes of stress, betrayal of friends, and personal demons. The lead singles off the Ep are \" Warganism\", and \"The Most Precious Jewel\". The EP is available on Itunes, Amazon, Google play, and most digital music retailers. After the \"Werewolf Lullabies\" he released several singles. \"Mike Tyson Music\", Eye of The Pupil\", and \"Yada, Yada, Yada. Which you can stream on his reverbnation page. He is currently working on a full length album, release date TBD.\nJune of last year he performed at Sullivan Hall NYC, with his band named after his EP release \"The Werewolf Lullabies\". He created, and co headlined the show titled \"Wrath of the Written\". With rising MC, Nitty Scott MC. He has also toured the Connecticut area, and New Jersey. Upon completion of his album he will be booking extensive tours. Independently,and through festivals, both domestic, and international.

So now he\u2019s totally free to do both, and he does. The solo he played on the album Thrust, on the song \u201cActual Proof,\u201d is one of the best drum solos on any of my albums. So many people have remarked about that solo, saying, \u2018Incredible.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n-Herbie Hancock\n\nMIKE CLARK DRUMMER / BAND LEADER\n\nMIKE CLARK gained worldwide recognition as one of America\u2019s foremost jazz and funk drummers while playing with Herbie Hancock\u2019s group in the early 1970\u2019s. Mike became known as a major innovator through his incisive playing on Hancock\u2019s Thrust album, which garnered him an international cult following.\n\nWhile often referred to as the \u201cTony Williams of funk\u201d, Mike considers himself a jazz drummer, and in fact has become one of the most vital to sit behind a set. He's performed with jazz greats such as Herbie Hancock, Chet Baker, Vince Guaraldi, Tony Bennett, Wayne Shorter, Joe Henderson, Eddie Henderson, Rob Dixon, Bobby Hutcherson, Woody Shaw, Donald Harrison, Larry Coryell, Jack Wilkins, Mike Wolff, Wallace Roney, Geri Allen, Billy Childs, James Genus, Bob Hurst, Chris Potter, Onaje Allan Gumbs, Bobby McFerrin, Al Jarreau, Dave Liebman, Nat Adderly, Oscar Brown Jr., Bill Doggett, Nicholas Payton, Christian McBride, Mose Allison, Maxine Brown, Gil Evans and his orchestra and many illuminating etceteras too numerous to list.\n\nBorn in Sacramento, CA, while growing up Mike had the benefit of traveling around the country with his father, a union man for the railroad. He was also a drummer at one time and had a keen ear, a killing record collection, and a great appreciation for music. This allowed the younger Clark to soak up the diverse regional music of the United States, which he credits as providing an invaluable education. Clark was a prodigy as well, picking up his first sticks at the tender age of five and sitting in--and getting \u201chouse\u201d --with bands in Texas and New Orleans when he was as young as 7 and 8.\n\nHe continued to play in a variety of blues, R&B, organ trios, and jazz bands, settling in Oakland, CA, until his introduction to Herbie Hancock and his recruitment into the Headhunters in 1973.\n\nAt the tail end of the 70\u2018s and in 1980, shortly before moving to New York City, Mike did a short but remarkable stint with Brand X, the acclaimed British fusion band founded by Phil Collins, doing two tours and recording their seminal Do They Hurt? and Product.\n\nThe winter of 2000 saw him diversifying his efforts with a foray into the popular jam band scene. His group Prescription Renewal electrified audiences across the country with an eclectic core of cross- generational multi talents, such as Charlie Hunter, Fred Wesley, Skerik, Robert Walter, and DJ Logic, and featured special guests such as George Porter Jr. of Funky Meters\u2019 fame, Kyle Hollingsworth of String Cheese Incident, Les Claypool, Will Bernard, Larry Goldings and fellow Headhunters alumni, Bill Summers, and proved a hit on the thriving young jam band scene. He followed that with several successful tours of the Roots Funk All Stars, another hot ad hoc association that married Mike with James Brown trombonist Fred Wesley, former Headhunter cohort and funk bassist legend Paul Jackson, Dr. Lonnie Smith and Robben Ford.\n\nNext to James Brown's drummer Clyde Stubblefield, Mike's beats with The Headhunters (most notably on \"God Make Me Funky\") are some of the most sampled in hip hop. Featured in Downbeat, Musician, International Musician & Recording World, Modern Drummer, Jazz Times, Guitar Player, Jazz Is and numerous jazz history and method books, Mike is a former faculty member of Drummers Collective, and is a popular and busy clinician around the country. His book Funk Drumming: Innovative Grooves & Advanced Concepts was published last year by Hal Leonard and is a best seller.\n\nHis numerous recording credits include albums with Herbie Hancock, the Headhunters, Brand X, Eddie Henderson, Jack Wilkins, Mark Puricelli, Mike Wolff, and Alien Army, a group led by guitar great Jack Wilkins. As a bandleader, his release Give The Drummer Some was very enthusiastically received, earning a rare four and a half stars in Downbeat, as was The Funk Stops Here, a joint effort with Hancock alumni Paul Jackson. In 2001, his solo CD, Actual Proof met with critical acclaim, as did the 2003 acoustic jazz release, Summertime, featuring Chris Potter and Billy Childs, which spent many weeks in the top ten charts.\n\nOther efforts included a compilation of his legendary, innovative funk beat samples, Mike Clark\u2014The Headhunter, a re-release of the widely acclaimed Thrust album, and, in 1998, The Return Of The Headhunters, featuring Herbie Hancock. Next came Herbie Hancock\u2019s Box Set, featuring Headhunters classics \u201cActual Proof\u201d and \u201cButterfly,\u201d from Thrust, a few choice cuts from Manchild, and also some historical tracks from the classic Flood, previously only available in Japan. The Headhunters\u2019 newest effort, Evolution/Revolution, released in 2003, featured the latest Headhunter configuration, with original founding members Mike, Bill Summers and Paul Jackson, joined by Donald Harrison, Victor Atkins (Los Hombres Caliente), and Nicholas Payton.\n\nHis 2009 release Blueprints of Jazz, Vol. I produced by Talking House Productions, which featured Christian McBride, Donald Harrison, Patrice Rushen, Jed Levy and Christian Scott, was received with critical acclaim and named one of the best recordings of the decade by Downbeat.\n\nHis latest effort, Carnival of Soul released June 11th by Owl Records and climbing the charts, was described by the Indianapolis Star as \u201ca jazz party with a kaleidoscopic array of players.\u201d Those players include guest turns by renowned country blues singer Delbert McClinton, fellow drumming icon Lenny White, tenor player Rob Dixon, and three separate organ-based ensembles offering up some delicious soul-infused jazz.\n\nA true original, Mike\u2019s work continues to delight and astound his fans around the world.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "327 Bowery, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Ampevene", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.991787, 40.725751], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Bowery Electric", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Moon Sugar in The Map Room"}, {"Address": "40 Wooster St 3rd floor, New York, NY 10013", "Artist": "Jackson Howard Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9074846.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00262, 40.722275], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "Genres: Soul-infused acoustic indie", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Sofar NYC", "moreBioInfo": "Relaxed, raw, and steeped in classic acoustic troubadours like James Taylor and Jim Croce, Jackson Howard plays and indie-folk/acoustic pop blend with as much attention to detail in the fingerstyle guitar as in the lyrics.

His refusal to compromise his vision and sell out his music has earned him a fiercely loyal underground following. Hancock's vision, as he puts it, is \"to bring people together and make them feel good about music. It's a spiritual thing and without spirituality, you've got nothin'. There ain't much on the radio that strikes me as being original or from the heart, most of it's from the pocketbook and it shows.\" Wayne is proud of his rural roots and culture and has thoroughly absorbed the spirit of country music's forefathers such as Ernest Tubb, Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers.

He is widely recognized for his ability to steadfastly create a unique body of original works while reinventing the standard jazz repertoire \u2013 investing time-tested classics with keen insight, fresh ideas and extraordinary technique. Whether unaccompanied, in duo, working with trios and quintets, Hersch has explored the jazz tradition to its fullest even as he opens new and undiscovered doors.

Previo a su nueva producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica, MONTEZ DE DURANGO, la agrupaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s importante del g\u00e9nero duranguense, lanz\u00f3 un disco con el g\u00e9nero que a su estilo, s\u00f3lo ellos pueden interpretar: \u201cCERRANDO TRATO\u201d es el t\u00edtulo del \u00e1lbum, y los corridos es el g\u00e9nero que interpretan en su totalidad en este disco. Las mejores historias contadas bajo los acordes de la tambora, son incluidas en el \u00e1lbum del grupo que liderea Jos\u00e9 Luis Terrazas, quien en este momento se encuentra preparando el nuevo material de MONTEZ DE DURANGO y que a mediados del 2010 es lanzado al mercado. \u201cPaseando y tomando\u201d es el primer sencillo que se desprendi\u00f3 de esta producci\u00f3n. MMXII \u201cMMXII\u201d es el t\u00edtulo de este \u00e1lbum que en este 2012, trae para nosotros MONTEZ DE DURANGO. Esta es una de las producciones m\u00e1s esperadas de esta agrupaci\u00f3n duranguense, ya que antes que saliera a la venta ya viene con un exito radial \"He Renunciado A Ti\" \u201cDescuide\u201d del compositor del momento \"Horacio Palencia\" es el primer sencillo que se promociona, y se trata de un tema a ritmo de balada duranguense, y esa es precisamente la novedad musical que MONTEZ trae consigo en este \u00e1lbum, ya que ha renovado el estilo duranguense que lo ha caracterizado, d\u00e1ndo m\u00e1s fuerza a los instrumentos de viento que ya formaban parte de su estilo.

Indeed, since he debuted almost two and a half years ago on New York City hip hop station WWPR Power 105.1 FM, Norie\u2019s Sunday night show \u201cAnything Goes-Caribbean Edition\u201d, a vigorous blend of soca, reggaeton, roots reggae and dancehall, accented with a distinctive Brooklyn flavor, consistently tops the ratings for the 8-10 PM time slot according to Arbitron statistics.\n\nRespectfully referred to as Da Reggae Don, DJ Norie was born to Panamanian parents in Brooklyn, which is often referred to a Jamaica\u2019s 15th parish, due to its concentration of immigrants from reggae\u2019s birthplace. Raised in Brooklyn\u2019s East Flatbush area, Norie became familiar with the music of Shabba Ranks, Super Cat and Ninja Man (dancehall reggae superstars of the late 1980s and early \u201890s) by listening to coveted sound clash cassettes that furthered the popularity of the latest reggae hits and the renown of the era\u2019s premier Jamaican sound systems. \u201cListening to the cassettes of Stone Love, Kilimanjaro and other sounds I thought, I want to be a part of that,\u201d Norie recalled.\n\nBarely into his teens, Norie began working with a neighborhood sound doing odd jobs such as carrying speakers and other equipment to their various gigs around Brooklyn. He paid close attention to the deejays (or selectors in Jamaican parlance) observing their proficiency in choosing just the right tunes to elicit roaring responses from the crowd and keep them on the dance floor. When the selectors needed to take a break, Norie got the chance to display his burgeoning skills on the wheels of steel; however, these early career-training sessions took place unbeknownst to Norie\u2019s mother. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will get in trouble for saying this now but my mom used to work nights so I used to sneak out to play at these basement parties, and basically that is how I learned to select,\u201d Norie laughingly discloses. \u201cIt was kind of hard in the beginning; they used to line up four or five records, tell me what to play and when I played them, people used to go crazy. So it used to seem like, yeah, I can do this, even though I was scared as s*#t. But I did it anyway and it was a good experience.\u201d\n\n\n\nNorie\u2019s fears subsided with repeated stints at the turntables and eventually he was recruited by Spectrum Disco, working with selectors Redds and Super C; as Spectrum\u2019s popularity spread throughout Brooklyn and the greater New York area during the 1990s, so too did Norie\u2019s renown as an intimidating selector. In the late 1990s Super Claude, the founder of Afrique Sound Station, one of the most venerated sound systems in the New York area, recruited Norie to join the set. Alongside Afrique\u2019s remarkable team of selectors, which included Jagga B, Crazy Richie and Super Twitch, Norie\u2019s talents were taken to a wider audience that spanned many states and several countries. \u201cSometimes you have to make a move, enhance yourself and go for you, and Afrique is where my name really started from, its what took me to the level of traveling with the music,\u201d Norie reflects. \u201cI will never forget Spectrum Disco because that is where I came from but Afrique has been in the business for more than 20 years, they set the trend for \u2018nuff sounds and it is a blessing to have been a part of it.\u201d\n\nNorie has also played on numerous Brooklyn based pirate and Internet stations that exclusively play reggae and Caribbean music (he even started one of his own, My Radio 94.3 FM), a phenomenon indicative of the vast potential for Caribbean music in the New York area. But Norie\u2019s expertise in selecting dancehall also resonated with a mainstream listenership, as he found out when he joined up with (hip hop) DJ Self as one of six deejays comprising a collective called Da Union, which enabled him to take dancehall into several (Manhattan) clubs where it had previously been excluded. This led to a few guest appearances on Power 105.1 FM, and eventually his Sunday night show on the station, which has contributed to his enviable status as America\u2019s most influential radio personality for dancehall reggae. As such, Norie is usually the first to transform a core dancehall anthem into an international hit, which he recently did with Stephen and Damian Marley\u2019s single \u201cJah Army\u201d, featuring Buju Banton.\n\nNorie is also the personal deejay for Beenie Man, with whom he travels whenever the artist has a show outside of Jamaica and he has also toured with Elephant Man, Bounty Killer, Mavado and Serani. On March 30, 2011 at New York City\u2019s BB King\u2019s nightclub, Norie made history selecting the rhythms for seven time Grammy winner Stephen Marley\u2019s first performance done solely to backing tracks (that is, without his band\u2019s accompaniment); Marley headlined Norie\u2019s two year anniversary party for his Power 105 show, which was also the one year anniversary celebration for his immensely popular monthly live concert series, \u201cAnything Goes\u201d. \u201cStephen was a little hesitant at first, because he never performed to tracks before, but he did it and he was happy about it, so it is a great experience to have under my belt,\u201d Norie shares.\n\nNorie has recently partnered on several projects with Queens New York based VP Records, the largest independent reggae label in the world. He selects the music at each of VP\u2019s album release parties and the label\u2019s artists are regularly showcased at his \u201cAnything Goes\u201d series. For VP Records\u2019 \u201cReggae Gold 2011\u201d, a collection of the year\u2019s biggest reggae hits, Da Reggae Don provided a vibrant, 35-minute bonus mix CD, rife with artists\u2019 shout-outs to Norie (including 2011 Celebrity Apprentice winner/country superstar John Rich) and customized renditions of popular songs. Additionally, Norie has just started recording artists on his own dancehall rhythms and he plans to release those tracks as part of his own compilation series sometime in the near future.\n\nEach of Norie\u2019s endeavors is in pursuit of his ultimate goal: expanding the overall popularity of Caribbean music, especially dancehall reggae, the music that inspired his career path almost 20 years ago. \u201cMy radio show has served a lot of purposes; not only did it allow my fans to get to know me but it allowed me to give back to this music game,\u201d Norie explains. \u201cBut I would like to get further in radio, be more than just a deejay because then I can help reggae by impressing upon program directors that New York\u2019s Caribbean population is really an untapped market that no one is paying attention to so why not go out and support it? We don\u2019t have to follow the same trends that everyone has been doing for years and years, we can do things differently, add on and make it much stronger.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "55 Christopher St, New York, NY 10014", "Artist": "Emily Braden", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9261815.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.002238, 40.733782], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "55 Bar", "moreBioInfo": "www.emilybraden.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "8 Park St, Montclair, NJ 07042", "Artist": "Weatherworn", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9113096.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.21896, 40.81543], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Indie, Punk", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Meatlocker", "moreBioInfo": "Drawing musical influences from alternative and punk icons Saves The Day, The Get-Up Kids, The Menzingers, and Weezer, Northern Virginia\u2019s Weatherworn makes rousing rock and roll music that would fit in perfectly on both Vagrant Records artist compilations from the early-00s and any individual \u201cmixtape\u201d soundtrack. Weatherworn started out as a solo acoustic act called Prior Engagements in 2016, and morphed into a loud, boisterous three-piece rock band with a one-word name in late-2018. The band\u2019s singer and guitarist frontman, Joey Lins, writes sharp lyrics and catchy melodies that showcase the struggles of many twenty-something adults across the globe; these struggles end up becoming extremely relatable quarter life crisis\u2019 of sorts for himself and his peers. Lins eloquently and personally introduces the listener to such important topics and the modern societal pressures that come with adulthood in the 21st century with vigor. He also addresses a topic that is happily becoming less taboo to discuss now than it was years ago: depression. However, Weatherworn\u2019s music is FAR from depressing, and each tune gives its listeners an uplifting kick in the posterior.

The right vocalist can make you fall in love at first listen, elicit tears, or bring you back to a different era altogether. A microphone and a stage remain the only necessities. That holds true for New York-based singer and songwriter Morgan James. On her full-length debut for Epic Records, Hunter, she casts an unbreakable spell with a powerhouse voice equally inspired by smoky soul, swaggering R&B, theatrical swing, and a virtuosic classical poise.\n\nThe Idaho native discovered her passion for music early on and pursued it\nwholeheartedly at the prestigious Juilliard School. While in the midst of the institution's rigorous academic program, she soon realized that her path would diverge from the classical world. \"I didn't want a career in opera, but Juilliard still shaped me,\" she confesses. \"The traditional training really made me a disciplined singer. I carry that with me to this day.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Morgan spent the next few years facing the proverbial struggles of being a young artist in New York. Low on money, she bounced back and forth between bartending and restaurant gigs while fighting to survive. Immersed in classic sixties and seventies soul records, she concurrently experienced a pivotal revelation. \"Out of that frustration came this other voice,\" she says. \"It was my true voice, and I feel like I discovered it in the middle of so much hardship just trying to be heard. I embraced who I was at that very moment.\"\n\nSoon, she would be heard in a big way. In 2008, Morgan booked her first Broadway show\u2014appearing in The Addams Family alongside Nathan Lane, as well as in prominent and leading roles in Wonderland, Godspell (Turn Back, O Man), and Berry Gordy's Motown The Musical as Teena Marie. The latter set the stage for her to\nproperly launch her solo career. Gordy recognized the vocalist's immense talent, and introduced her to Doug Morris and L.A. Reid, opening the door for a deal with Epic Records in 2012.\n\nAround the same time, Morgan booked a landmark show at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, where she paid tribute to Nina Simone with a set of songs that were closely associated with the legendary artist. The incendiary show was recorded and released as the critically acclaimed Morgan James Live on Epic Records. It also proved to be the perfect segue for her first studio album, released in June of 2014.\n\n\"I always knew to make a neo-soul pop record,\" Morgan says. \"The foundation is all real ingredients, and those roots of soul and R&B are pretty strong. It's the culmination of my musical life up to this point. The painful songs are straight out of a bad relationship with someone from my past. The joyful moments are wonderful memories. It's all coming from me. I've lived every one of these stories, and I love the genres I'm representing. It's one point-of-view\u2014mine.\"\n\nThe title track and album opener \"Hunter\" boasts a seductive hook with cinematic noir flair. Flaunting the singer's immense delivery and dynamic presence, it's an undeniable and classy come-on that proves as animalistic as it does magnetic. \"From a woman's perspective, it's such an empowering and sexy song,\" she smiles. \"It totally makes me feel like a warrior! Music is so sensual and life-affirming. That's what I look for. You don't often see a girl take this position, and that's what I love about it!\"\n\nMorgan assumed co-writing duties on eight of the collection's fourteen tracks and even performed all of her own background vocals and harmonies. From the empowering farewell of \"Fed Up On You\" to the mournful rumination of \"You Never Lied\", she continually bares it all\u2014both emotionally and musically. \"I sing like I'm never going to sing ever again,\" Morgan affirms. \"I wanted to capture that power and passion every time. At some moments, it might sound flawless; at others, it might sound like it's going to break. I'm revealing something about myself with\nevery song. You've got to do that. My favorite artists, whether Joni Mitchell or Michael Jackson, are and were, always honest.\"\n\nThere's a unique structure to the album. The first five songs boast electronic elements, while the last six don't have any. \"There's a gradient of the record that goes down,\" she says. \"By the time you get to the last song, it's just piano and voice. It starts with a song about power and ego, and it ends on one about surrender and selflessness. I have all of that in me. Maybe we all do.\"\n\nUltimately, her honesty permeates everything that Morgan James does, and it's why you'll always remember her voice. \"I want people to walk away from this album feeling fulfilled. That's the way it used to be. Often, I think I'm from another time,\u201d she says, her voice trailing off. \u201cI just want to bring back the power of the singular legacy voice.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "333 E 60th St, New York, NY 10022", "Artist": "DJ Dynamite", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10063414.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.962493, 40.760756], "Date": "Sun Feb 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-09", "Genre": "Genres: Hip-Hop, House, Reggae, 80s, Funk, B-Boy Breaks, Dance Classics, Top 40", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Sapphire New York", "moreBioInfo": "Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Dynamite migrated to the USA at 5 years old.

Spirit Fiction features two different band lineups, each with a unique expressive urgency. Several tracks feature Ravi\u2019s long-term quartet with pianist Luis Perdomo, bassist Drew Gress and drummer E.J. Strickland. Coltrane also enlisted a quintet featuring trumpeter Ralph Alessi, pianist Geri Allen, bassist James Genus and drummer Eric Harland \u2014 the personnel featured on From the Round Box, his acclaimed sophomore release from 2000. \u201cThere was something about that lineup that I knew I wanted to revisit someday,\u201d Coltrane says. \u201cThe energies of the two groups on Spirit Fiction are unique. The quintet stuff is looser, and the quartet has played together for close to 10 years so it has that particular sound.\u201d Joe Lovano, a Blue Note recording artist since the early 1990s, served as producer of the quintet sessions. Lovano also joins the quintet on tenor saxophone for an explosive version of Ornette Coleman\u2019s \u201cCheck Out Time,\u201d from Coleman\u2019s 1968 Blue Note album Love Call. \u201cI\u2019ve always produced my own recordings except for the first one, Moving Pictures, which was produced by Steve Coleman,\u201d says Coltrane. \u201cJoe was a truly supportive producer on this project. He has been an important figure in my life for over 20 years \u2014 the first record I heard him on was Monk In Motian, with Geri Allen.\" Lovano also plays alongside Ravi and Geri Allen in an intimate reading of Paul Motian\u2019s \u201cFantasm.\u201d Having helped mark Blue Note\u2019s 70th anniversary as a member of the Blue Note 7 (documented on the 2009 release Mosaic), Ravi is thrilled to join the Blue Note roster. \u201c[Blue Note Chairman Emeritus] Bruce Lundvall has been very supportive of my work and this project. I'm honored to be on Blue Note under his watch. He\u2019s very music-driven, which is incredibly encouraging. He\u2019s continued the Alfred Lion example of putting music first and taking chances.\u201d According to Coltrane, \"The title, Spirit Fiction is an abstract turn of phrase that came out of a stream of consciousness. The phrase seemed to mesh with the layered, superimposed nature of the title track. It also felt like a gentle indicator of the \"science\" involved in recording that track. In some ways, it ultimately refers to the open ended idea of simply embracing imagination.\" The mysteriously grooving title track is a \u201cmashup,\u201d Coltrane explains:\"The technique layers separate recordings together. Half the quartet records with a specific direction in mind, then the other half records with their own direction in mind. The idea is not to assemble but to imagine instead how things may interact. What is interesting is that the way we played on that piece is not unlike how the four of us would play together traditionally speaking.\u201d Born on Long Island in 1965, Ravi is the second son of John and Alice Coltrane. His father (who recorded the landmark Blue Train for Blue Note in 1957) died when Ravi was only two. Alice, a renowned composer and pianist, raised Ravi on the West Coast and proved a strong role model in her own right. Ravi had the honor of producing and playing on Alice Coltrane\u2019s Translinear Light, released three years prior to her death in 2007. A move back east to New York and pivotal stints with Elvin Jones, Wallace Roney and Steve Coleman led Ravi to begin asserting himself as a leader in the mid 1990's. He followed Moving Pictures and From the Round Box with Mad 6, In Flux, and Blending Times. He also continued appearing as a sideman with the likes of McCoy Tyner, Jack DeJohnette, Jeff 'Tain' Watts, and Flying Lotus (a.k.a. Steven Ellison, Ravi's cousin) , and as a co-leader of the Saxophone Summit with Lovano and Dave Liebman.. Ravi brings all of this rich experience to bear on the music of Spirit Fiction. His leadoff track, \u201cRoads Cross,\u201d is a quartet improvisation with a subtle plan: \u201cWe are performing as two duos, each duo with a reciprocal agenda regarding pulse and tempo. The directions overlap and even intersect and keep moving \u2013 a real energy and wholeness hopefully is created.\" Later in the program, on \u201cCross Roads,\u201d the quartet pursues the same improvisational idea with remarkably contrasting results. Of the drum and tenor saxophone duet \u201cSpring & Hudson,\u201d Ravi recalls: \u201cI always like playing duets. I sketched out a simple form with some odd measures and some breaks - something I thought would be fun to play in that context. E.J. and I faced each other directly when we played it, and you get a different energy that way. This title is a nod to the Half Note. The tiny stage above the bar compelled the musicians to literally face each other and that kind of proximity always affects the way musicians play together.\" \u201cthe change, my girl\u201d is a title that came to Ravi in a dream. \u201cPeople were at a session in the dream and someone said, \u2018Let\u2019s play \u201cthe change, my girl.\u201d\u2019 My reaction was, \u2018OK, great.\u2019 It was just another tune that we all knew. The ballad uses some delayed voice leading and harmonic rhythms that imply looking at one thing in more than one way.\u201d The fiery soprano saxophone feature \u201cMarilyn & Tammy\u201d is named for Ravi\u2019s aunt, songwriter Marilyn McLeod and her late daughter, Tamra Ellison. \u201cMarilyn wrote \u2018Love Hangover,\u2019 \u2018Same Ole Love\u2019 for Anita Baker, she was under contract with Motown in the \u201970s. She and Tammy were like best friends, and this tune reminded me of their energy.\u201d Spirit Fiction also features three striking pieces by Ralph Alessi, Ravi\u2019s longest-standing musical associate. \u201cI'm an admirer of Ralph's compositions. I've always enjoyed playing his tunes and of course I wanted to record a few. I said to him, \u2018Here\u2019s what I\u2019m planning, whadda ya got?\u2019\u201d We also hear the compositional voices of Paul Motian and Ornette Coleman \u2014 and it\u2019s fitting that Ornette\u2019s \u201cCheck Out Time\u201d and Motian\u2019s eerily evocative \u201cFantasm\u201d (from Keith Jarrett\u2019s Byablue) both featured the late saxophonist Dewey Redman, another of Ravi\u2019s notable forebears. One of the most personally informed song choices on the recording arose from a request from Ravi to Joe for suggestions on a Paul Motion tune (Motian passed away just one month prior to Ravi's quintet session). Lovano had played \"Fantasm\" on Motian's 1981 album Psalm and suggested the tune. \"I felt a trio with Geri and Joe would be the most relevant setting\u201d, says Coltrane. \u201cI love the sound of two tenors, and with Geri you know you're going to hear things that are really unique, the way she supports. It was a real privilege to play Paul's music with Geri and Joe.\" Even as he foregrounds his own development and eschews any attempt to recreate the hallowed jazz past, Ravi Coltrane knows as well as anyone the importance of the music\u2019s lineage. Reflecting on the place of Ornette and Motian, and implicitly his father, in the story of his own career, Ravi concludes: \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for those guys, we wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d", "otherInfo": "The son of saxophone bellwether John Coltrane and fusion paragon Turiya Alice Coltrane, Ravi Coltrane was not yet two years old when his father died in July 1967. But in the subsequent five decades, he has inherited and cherished the call to push jazz ahead, honoring and preserving its past while ever aiming for its next step. In the early 1990s, he began playing with a host of jazz greats including drummer Elvin Jones and saxophonist Steve Coleman; beginning with Moving Pictures (1998), his own albums have embraced a searching approach to his instrument while reconsidering song structures, warping expectations, and rewriting rules. The music of Ravi Coltrane is a strong and vibrant connector linking the past, present, and future of jazz. Whether he was conjuring an air of stillness and contemplation or churning up great waves of rhythmic energy, whether his sound was softly introspective or as big as all outdoors, Coltrane showed the breadth of his vision and the acuity of his thoughts.

From the late 70's onward as a sideman to jazz legends including Joe Henderson, Art Farmer and Stan Getz, he has solidified a reputation as a versatile master of jazz piano, as well as a relentlessly probing composer and conceptualist. He is widely recognized for his ability to steadfastly create a unique body of original works while reinventing the standard jazz repertoire \u2013 investing time-tested classics with keen insight, fresh ideas and extraordinary technique. Whether unaccompanied, in duo, working with trios and quintets, Hersch has explored the jazz tradition to its fullest even as he opens new and undiscovered doors. Hersch's numerous accomplishments include a 2003 Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship for composition, two Grammy\u00ae nominations for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance and a Grammy\u00ae nomination for Best Instrumental Composition. He has appeared on over one hundred recordings, including more than two-dozen albums as bandleader/solo pianist. His career as a performer has been greatly enhanced by his composing activities, a vital part of nearly all of his live concerts and recordings. In 2003, Hersch created Leaves of Grass (Palmetto Records), a large-scale setting of Walt Whitman's poetry for two voices (Kurt Elling and Kate McGarry) and an instrumental octet; the work was presented in March 2005 in a sold-out performance at Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall as part of a six-city US tour. Hersch has toured with concert pianist Christopher O'Riley (\"Heard Fresh: Music for Two Pianos\") and he has also collaborated with artists ranging from Bill Frisell, Toots Thielemans and Charlie Haden to singers Ren\u00e9e Fleming, Norma Winstone and Audra McDonald. He has received commissions from The Gilmore Keyboard Festival, The Doris Duke Foundation, The Miller Theatre at Columbia University, The Gramercy Trio and The Brooklyn Youth Chorus. His solo piano compositions and chamber music are published by Edition Peters. Naxos Records has released Fred Hersch: Concert Music 2001-2006, a disc of his through-composed \"classical\" works. Hersch is considered to be the most prolific and widely-praised solo jazz pianist of his generation. In 2006, Palmetto Records released the solo disc Fred Hersch in Amsterdam: Live at the Bimhuis; its release led to Hersch becoming the first pianist in the 70-year history of New York's legendary Village Vanguard to play an entire week as a solo pianist shortly after the disc's release. In addition, he leads a trio, a quintet and has ongoing special collaborations with jazz and classical instrumentalists and vocalists around the world. His newest project features an unconventional line-up of piano, trumpet, voice and percussion; The Fred Hersch Pocket Orchestra: Live at Jazz Standard will be released in April 2009 on Sunnyside Records. Hersch has acted as a passionate spokesman and fund-raiser for AIDS services and education agencies since 1993. He has produced and performed on four benefit recordings four benefit recordings and at numerous concerts for the charities Classical Action: Performing Arts Against AIDS and Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS that have raised over $250,000 to date. Hersch has been featured on CBS Sunday Morning with Dr. Billy Taylor and on a wide variety of National Public Radio programs including Fresh Air, Jazz Set, Studio 360 and Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz.

Fewer still have been rewarded with Broadway\u2019s coveted Tony Award (Best Featured Actress in a Musical \u2013 The Wiz), nominated for the London theater\u2019s West End equivalent, the Laurence Oliver Award (Best Actress in a Musical \u2013 Lady Day), won three Grammy\u00ae Awards (2010 Best Jazz Vocal Album for \"Eleanora Fagan (1915-1959): To Billie With Love From Dee Dee\", 1998\u2019s Best Jazz Vocal Performance and Best Arrangement Accompanying a Vocal for \"Cottontail\" \u2013 Slide Hampton, arranger \u2013 \"Dear Ella \"), and France\u2019s 1998 top honor Victoire de la Musique (Best Jazz Vocal Album).\n\nDEE DEE CAPTURED THE HEARTS of audiences worldwide in The Wiz with her signature song, If You Believe. According to Nick Ashford of Ashford and Simpson, Dee Dee\u2019s rendition \"personified a generation and gave us all hope.\"\n\nAS A SPARKLING AMBASSADOR FOR JAZZ, she bathed in its music before she could walk. Her mother played the greatest albums of Ella Fitzgerald, whose artistry provided an inspiration for Dee Dee throughout her career. Her father was a trumpeter who taught music \u2013 to Booker Little, Charles Lloyd and George Coleman, among others. It is the kind of background that leaves its mark on an adolescent, especially one who appeared solo and with a trio as soon as she was able. Dee Dee\u2019s other vocation, that of globetrotter, reared its head when she toured the Soviet Union in 1969 with the University of Illinois Big Band. A year later, she followed her then husband, Cecil Bridgewater, to New York.\n\nDEE DEE MADE HER PHENOMENAL NEW YORK DEBUT in 1970 as the lead vocalist for the band led by Thad Jones and Mel Lewis, one of the premier jazz orchestras of the time. These New York years marked an early career in concerts and on recordings with such giants as Sonny Rollins, Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon, Max Roach and Roland Kirk, and rich experiences with Norman Connors, Stanley Clarke and Frank Foster\u2019s \"Loud Minority.\"\n\nDEE DEE DOESN\u2019T CARE MUCH FOR LABELS, and in 1974 she jumped at the chance to act and sing on Broadway where her voice, beauty and stage presence won her great success and a Tony Award for her role as Glinda the Good Witch in The Wiz. This began a long line of awards and accolades as well as opportunities to work in Tokyo, Los Angeles, Paris and in London where she garnered the coveted \u201cLaurence Olivier\u201d Award nomination as Best Actress for her tour de force portrayal of jazz legend Billie Holiday in Stephen Stahl\u2019s Lady Day. Performing the lead in equally demanding acting/singing roles as Sophisticated Ladies, Cosmopolitan Greetings, Black Ballad, Carmen Jazz and the musical Cabaret (the first black actress to star as Sally Bowles), she secured her reputation as a consummate entertainer.\n\nNAMED AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS\u2019 FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) in October 1999, Dee Dee joined the battle against world hunger. Appealing for international solidarity to finance global grass-roots projects, the FAO\u2019s Ambassadors aid in developing self-reliance in long-term conservation and management of sustainable agriculture, rural development and the conservation and management of natural resources.\n\nTAKING OVER THE REIGNS OF JAZZSET FROM THE ILLUSTRIOUS BRANFORD MARSALIS, Dee Dee continues to bring her message to listeners. NPR's JazzSet\u00a9 with Dee Dee Bridgewater is the jazz lover's ears and eyes on the world of live music.

He bought a loop pedal and began learning how to integrate it into his gigs, often sharing with concert-goers how he builds his backing band: himself.\n\nTaking inspiration from a wide variety of musicians and songwriters has helped Liberio create his unique sound.

His company Wood Violins is the premier manufacturer of electric violins, violas and cellos worldwide and he holds the patent for the first-ever self-supporting violin. The company stands behind its claim to have made the most important change to the violin in 400 years and is often referred to as the \u201cStradivarius of electric violins.\u201d With a design as stunning as their sound, Wood Violins pack both sonic and visual punch. Their premier electric violin, The Viper, has found favor with musicians as varied as Lady Gaga\u2019s violinist Judy Kang, Carrie Underwood\u2019s violinist Jimmy Herman, and Big and Rich\u2019s violinist Shawn Bailey.\n\nWood is a world-renowned performer who rose to fame as string master and original member of the internationally acclaimed Trans Siberian Orchestra. A successful solo artist in his own right, Wood writes and records original music for film and television, has released six solo albums, and tours with his band The Mark Wood Experience (MWE) which features his wife, vocalist Laura Kaye, and their drummer son Elijah. His commission credits include The Juilliard School and extensive TV broadcast music including The Winter Olympics and The Tour de France (for which he won an Emmy).\n\nIn addition to his continued solo and commission work, Wood has collaborated with and appeared alongside some of the biggest names in music such as Lenny Kravitz, Celine Dion, and Kanye West. As a member of his touring band, Wood had the honor of performing with the legendary Billy Joel for both historic final concerts at Shea stadium, sharing the stage with Paul McCartney, Steven Tyler, and Roger Daltry. He also starred in a Kanye West produced national Pepsi TV commercial and has appeared on the world\u2019s most venerable stages including Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and Madison Square Garden.\n\nBut his true passion is music education. His program Electrify Your Strings (EYS) \u2013 founded in 2001 \u2013 is an intensive rock and roll workshop for school music education departments that boosts student self-esteem and motivation and helps raise money for music education. Today EYS visits upwards of 75 schools per year and there is a waiting list of schools wanting to participate. The organization has been featured on The Today Show and CBS Evening News and in countless local media outlets.\n\nBut for Wood, it\u2019s all about the kids. He\u2019s dedicated to providing educators with the opportunity to ignite their students\u2019 passions and to inspiring students to open their minds and unlock their potential. His book \u201cElectrify Your Strings: The Mark Wood Improvisational Violin Method\u201d (published by Cherry Lane) is regarded as the definitive electric violin method book. The first in a series of forthcoming educational books, Wood is passionate about providing educators and students with the tools they need to succeed in the classroom and beyond.\n\nA genuine family man, Wood runs his operations alongside his wife, business partner, and longtime collaborator Laura Kaye out of their home in Port Washington, New York. Their child Elijah is a drummer (Shania Twain, Jordan Rudess, Grace VanderWaal, America's Got Talent) and occasionally tours with EYS and The Mark Wood Experience. In addition to EYS, Wood and his family run the annual MWROC Music Festival (a week-long music camp), as well as the Mark Wood Electrify Your Music Foundation, a 501-C3 dedicated to supporting music and the arts.\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of students reached, millions of dollars raised to help high school music departments across the US, and dozens of school orchestra programs saved from the chopping block because of funds raised through his efforts, Mark Wood has proven himself a man of ideas, action and results.

He began taking lessons and jamming with the kids in his neighborhood. He soon discovered artists that would influence his career, such as Django Reinhardt, Wes Montgomery, Charlie Byrd, and Andr\u00e9s Segovia.\n\nWhen Amanda was born, naturally Rob passed on his love of music to her. Amanda began singing at the age of 3, and was quickly drawn to musical theater. After many regional and Off-Broadway theater productions, Amanda graced the Broadway stage (Lyceum Theatre) in 2007. Her credits also include the Powerhouse Theater (Vassar College), The Irish Repertory Theatre, and more. Amanda soon began listening to artists such as Doris Day, Betty Hutton, and Diana Krall.\n\nIn 2012, Amanda & Rob began collaborating, when Amanda expressed interest in starting a jazz band. They began writing original music in the fall of 2013. Amanda & Rob have a unique connection on stage. Rob\u2019s beautifully composed arrangements perfectly match the emotions in Amanda\u2019s passionate lyrics. They\u2019ve been compared to Les Paul & Mary Ford, Diana Krall, and Bucky Pizzarelli.\n\nThe Scalicis have since played over 500 shows together, and have toured in Florida, Georgia, Virginia, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Canada, and London. They\u2019ve hit the stage of Rockwood Music Hall, Engelman Recital Hall, LaGuardia Plaza Hotel, Crossroads Live Music Venue, The Troubador (London), The Bull\u2019s Head - Barnes (one of the premier jazz venues in Britain), and more.\n\nThe Scalicis have quickly become known in the digital world for their creative content and original music.

A legend in the Homeric sense of a myth, the\u201cword that speaks\u201d which has flowered here through song: like Caruso, Gigli, Del Monaco, Corelli\u2026\nA legend (of Andrea Bocelli\u2019s stature) is not created by design: the most astute marketing would never be able to produce such a result. It is simply that people \u201crecognized\u201d him and voted for him. And so it happened, in an apparently equal context (a singing competition, the Sanremo festival in 1994) and yet a most perfect one, because the infancy of a legend follows a course which breaks traditions. From then on the tone of his voice has brought tenderness to the world and his fame has increased exponentially. Because \u201cif God would have a singing voice, He would sound a lot like Andrea Bocelli\u201d: even Celine Dion\u2019s famous comment is a clear, unadorned testament to the artist\u2019s mythical status as well as the perception of a gift\u2026That voice, that simultaneously melancholic and radiant colour, unrivalled in the expression of the song of a lover or a father, a matchless expression of earthly desire or heavenly love, with 65 million record sales to testify to it.\n\nThe responsibility of talent\n\n\u201dI don\u2019t think one decides to become a singer, It is decided for you by the reactions of the people around you.\u201d Andrea Bocelli had to reckon with a double gift, both elements of which are completely absorbing. The first aspect is a timbre which is as recognisable as a signature, full and powerful, with a versatility ranging from the belcanto to the furore of verismo, from the sacred repertoire to the popular ballads. The second gift is a more delicate one: life\u2019s journey led Andrea Bocelli in adolescence to a different ability which deprived him of sight. This was truly a privation which increased the flow of an extraordinary and unique sensibility which transforms and transcends boundaries, causing him to excel in his interpretation of the lyrics, in his perception of the subtleties of musical expression.\n\nThe empowerment of an unusual journey\n\nBocelli, the superb voice that the opera had been awaiting for years, \u201cexploded\u201d onto the world stage performing one song. An anomalous route offering extraordinary possibilities: a real breath of fresh air in a world \u2013 that of the opera \u2013 which risked forgetting its own popular origins.\nIt rang out all over the world in \u201cTime to say goodbye\u201d, while on stage it resonated in the operatic masterpieces: a voice which combines the power of the heroic tone with a youthful tenor\u2019s grace strengthened by an unusually polished timbre.\n\nAn old fashioned training of a modern tenor\n\nTuscan, like Puccini and Mascagni, Andrea Bocelli was born on 22nd September 1958 and grew up at the family farm in Lajatico, nestling between the vines of the Pisan countryside. His parents must receive the credit for having encouraged young Andrea\u2019s musical talent, allowing him to start studying the piano from the age of only six years old. Later his musical passion would extend to the flute and the saxophone but it was in his voice that Andrea discovered the ideal instrument\nand this was the beginning of the formative process which would produce Bocelli, the star, \u201ca modern but old fashioned tenor\u201d (as he likes to describe himself). In 1970 he enjoyed his first success in a singing competition: performing \u2018O sole mio\u2019. After studying singing with Maestro Luciano Bettarini), Bocelli approached Franco Corelli, an artist whom he had always worshipped. In order to pay for singing lessons, Andrea would play the piano in the local bars and in the meantime he continued to develop his interest in the humanities and graduated in Law at the University of Pisa. Just in the same period that saw him take off in the world of pop, having been discovered by Caterina Caselli and signed to her record label \u201cSugar\u201d, Andrea had an opportunity to make his debut on the operatic stage, in 1994 in Verdi\u2019s Macbeth (in the role of Macduff) directed by Claudio Desderi. That Christmas he was invited to sing the Adeste Fideles in St Peters before the Pope. No more courtrooms or requests in piano bars: this was the start of a meteoric rise. Andrea Bocelli had found the stage. In fact the stage had found Andrea Bocelli and would never leave him.\n\nCon te partir\u00f2...\n\nThere is something miraculous about the parallel track along which the tenor Andrea Bocelli\u2019s career developed. In 1996 the melody of the song \u201cCon te Partiro`\u201d (and later its arrangement as a duet with Sarah Brightman with the title \u201cTime to say Goodbye\u201d) was heard in every corner of the world. The Bocelli phenomenon was being talked about everywhere: an artist whose explosion onto the recording world - with an album entitled Romanza \u2013 was breaking all records.\nIn Germany, for example, the duet became the best selling single of all time.\nAt the same time Andrea embarked on his operatic adventure, with a careful management of his voice. In Torre del Lago, in the summer of 1997, Bocelli performed parts of Madame Butterfly and Tosca, and also the \u201caria dei 9 do\u201d from La fille du regiment which received a standing ovation. In 1998 came a new debut, this time playing Rodolfo - alongside Daniela Dessi - in Puccini\u2019s La Boh\u00e8me in Cagliari. That same year he met M. Zubin Mehta and this led to the beginning of a successful collaboration between them. 1999 was a very intense year. Andrea performed at the Arena in Verona for the first time where he was applauded by an audience of eighteen thousand. In October, he made his debut in the United States in Massenet\u2019s Werther. At the same time his album Sogno was released, which included Andrea\u2019s duet with C\u00e9line Dion of \u201cThe Prayer\u201d, which had already won the Golden Globe Award and was subsequently nominated for an Oscar. From this point on the Bocelli legend, supported by huge record sales, was unstoppable. His concerts would find the most celebrated directors on the podium such as Lorin Maazel, Seiji Ozawa, Valeri Gergev, Zubin Mehta and Myun Whun Chung.\nIn January 2001, Andrea made his debut on stage in Verona in Mascagni\u2019s Amico Fritz. On 28th October, on the invitation of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, he sang Schubert\u2019s Ave Maria at \u201cGround Zero\u201d before the world as part of the memorial to the victims of 9/11. In the summer of 2002 he performed in the role of Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly at Torre del Lago. Following further successful pop recordings and international awards in 2004 Bocelli continued to develop his operatic stage career (playing Cavaradossi in Tosca and then the lead in Werther in Bologna) as well as performing at many large concert venues\n\nThe essential (is invisibile to the eye)\n\n\u201cYou can only see properly with your heart. The essential is invisible to the eye\u201d so wrote Antoine de Saint-Exupery\u2026 The essential thing, in the career of an opera singer, is to be found in his discography. In Bocelli\u2019s case it is by his recordings that his voice can be guaranteed to be kept constantly up to the minute for generations to come. As Caruso did at the start of the last century, so Bocelli continues to do at the beginning of the millennium. His first \u201cclassical\u201d recording dates back to 1997 and was entitled Viaggio Italiano. It was a Caterina Caselli Sugar project undertaken with the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra: spanning Puccini to Schubert, Verdi to Donizzetti. 1998 saw the release of Aria \u2013 The Opera Album, with the Orchestra of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino directed by Gianandrea Noseda. The dawn of the new millennium, was marked by the release of a cd dedicated to Sacred Arias with the Orchestra and Choir of the National Academy of Saint Cecilia conducted by Myung-Whun Chung : an homage to Christianity which remains one of his most shining artistic productions becoming the best selling classical album ever released by a solo artist. Bocelli earned a place in the Guiness Book of World Records by occupying the first, second and third place in the American classical music charts.\n\nA voice for the new millennium\n\nThe year 2000 marked a new milestone in Andrea Bocelli\u2019s recording career: Puccini\u2019s La Boh\u00e8me, with Zubin Mehta conducting and Barbara Frittoli in the role of Mim\u00ec. Andrea had already played the role of Rodolfo in 1998 prompting praise from Corelli, who commented: \u201cAndrea is an operatic tenor with a voice of rare beauty. His sense of romance and melody goes beyond the very essence of Rodolfo the bohemian\u201d.\nStill under the baton of M\u00b0 Mehta, the start of the millennium also celebrated the release of the Verdi album which gave Andrea the opportunity to immerse himself in this national treasure\u2019s works. In 2001 it was the turn of Verdi\u2019s Requiem, a recording with a formidable cast, starting from the conductor Valere Gergiev. In the autumn of 2002 Andrea Bocelli combined his energies with those of Lorin Maazel, with whom he undertook a very special recording project: Sentimento, a collection of romantic pieces by composers such as Tosti, Denza and Gastaldon, arranged for the orchestra by M\u00b0 Maazel, who also demonstrated his refined musical talents as a concert violinist, accompanying Bocelli\u2019s voice. The project was an enormous success earning Andrea a double nomination at the 2003 \u201cClassical Brit Awards\u201d, where he won both \u201cAlbum of the Year\u201d and \u201cBest Selling Classical Album of the Year\u201d. In May 2003 Andrea sang the role of Mario in his album of Giacomo Puccini\u2019s Tosca under the direction of Zubin Mehta.\nIn spring 2004 Bocelli released Il Trovatore which had been recorded at the \u201cBellini\u201d opera house in Catania in 2001. Bocelli was accompanied by , Veronica Villarroel, Carlo Guelfi, Carlo Colombara.\n\nOn the Opera stage: the great love\n\nAccustomed to leaping over apparently insurmountable obstacles, the Tuscan tenor extended his repertoire (not disdaining an occasional carefully measured venture into melodic cross-over territory). Bocelli sang Werther which was released onto the market in spring. The following year his repertoire of operatic recordings was enriched by two great landmarks of realism: Leoncavallo\u2019s Pagliacci and Marcagni\u2019s Cavalleria Rusticana, both directed by Steven Mercurio.\nHis more recent projects include the demanding role of Andrea Ch\u00e9nier by Giordano and finally the most audacious and bewitching love story of all time, Bizet\u2019s Carmen, directed by Myung Whun Chung. For his concerts Bocelli conquered the most lauded strongholds of the classical music world such as the Wiener Staatsoper. In 2008, while his new album Incanto was a sell-out success, Andrea performed in Carmen at the Rome Opera, followed by Puccini\u2019s Messa di Gloria in Padova, and then La Petite Messe Solennelle in the United States, directed by Placido Domingo. He appeared as Turiddu in the Cavalleria Rusticana on the prestigious stage of the Deutsche Opera in Berlin and then flew to South America where he performed to an audience of more than 110,000 in San Paolo, Brazil.\n\nNew Challenges\n\nHaving always been sensitive to the call for solidarity, Bocelli\u2019s name is frequently to be found heading the list of artists appearing at concerts to support causes such as aid for the earthquake victims of the Abruzzo, alongside stars such as Angela Gheorghiu and in evocative venues such as the Colosseum in Rome. And it is to promote the image of the Eternal City that Franco Zeffirelli, the film director, asked him to play Mario Cavadarossi from Puccini\u2019s Tosca, protagonist of his film Promo di Roma with actress Monica Bellucci. In the meantime the annual appointment at the Teatro del Silenzio (Theatre of Silence) in his home village of Lajatico in Tuscany reached its fourth year. Bocelli himself is honorary president of the project and co-founder of the theatre. Among the guests who have appeared with him on the stage of that stunning open-air amphitheatre are Placido Domingo, Lang Lang, Laura Pausini, David Foster, Sarah Brightman, Heather Headley, Noa, Roberto Bolle and Nicola Piovani. In September 2009 Bocelli made his triumphant debut at Carnegie Hall in New York in a triple concert where he performed sacred arias and lieder. In November he was awarded another prestigious token of recognition \u2013 the Vittorio de Sica Prize \u2013conferred by the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano.\nAs many of the legendary voices of the past such as Caruso and Sinatra have done before him, Andrea Bocelli too celebrates the Christmas tradition. His new album My Christmas shot to success in no time. Released on 3rd November 2009 in the USA, it went straight into the charts at number three and reached second place where it remained for six consecutive weeks. Achieving sales of more than 4 million, this makes it the 5th top selling album in the world in 2009. And these can be added to the 65 million records already sold to date.\nFrom March 2010 there will be another star shining on Hollywood\u2019s Walk of Fame dedicated to our Tuscan tenor, one of a very few Italians to figure in this prestigious firmament.\nIn the meantime the Andrea Bocelli website www.andreabocelli.com has achieved over a million hits in one year.\n\u201cThe more I immerse myself in singing the less I understand, I only know that God has given me a voice which allows me to express what I feel, and in this sense I believe I can describe it as a recognizable voice\u201d\u2026 The true greatness of an artist is measured also by his humility, in spite of the world fame and awareness of the cultural and social function which his name represents.

Two musicians\u2014husband-and-wife duo Mario [guitar, synths, vocals] and Sarah Quintero [bass, guitar, vocals]\u2014simply pick up their instruments and mainline dense distortion, spacey soundscapes, and unnervingly serene vocal transmissions directly from the heart.\nThis unpredictable, yet unassuming sound quietly heralded their arrival in 2016 on the D.I.Y. debut LP, Tidals. Brooklyn Vegan stumbled upon the project and streamed \u201cWalls.\u201d The song eventually entranced musician and producer Aaron Harris (ISIS/Palms) who shared it with his Palms singer and Deftones frontman Chino Moreno. An invite to open the Deftones summer tour followed as the band would go on to share the stage with everyone from Melvins, Quicksand, Hum, and Glassjaw to Pelican and Pallbearer. Ipecac Recordings co-founders Mike Patton and Greg Werckman fell under the band\u2019s spell and signed them. The Harris-produced Seismic dropped on Ipecac Recordings in 2017 to acclaim from Revolver, Metal Injection, New Noise, MetalSucks, and many others. Between tours, 2018 saw them reveal the Hanging By Faith remix EP and one-off single \u201cKiss the Ring\u201d [feat. Allen Epley].\nMario may be able to explain how it all happened, but the \u201cwhy\u201d still eludes him\u2026\n\u201cThree years ago, we were just playing tiny local shows, and all of these crazy things have happened since,\u201d he smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting story to us, because we\u2019ve never had a gimmick or a hook.

This time around, Spotlights once again personally handled production, working out of a tiny Brooklyn rehearsal space. However, for the first time, they enlisted the talents of drummer Chris Enriquez behind the kit on the entire body of work rather than a combination of Mario and guest performers.\nSonically, the group further canvased new territory. Whether it be the hummable guitar lead peeking through trudging grooves on \u201cUntil The Bleeding Stops\u201d or the ghostly pop chorus of \u201cParticle Noise,\u201d they ascend to a tipping point between volumetric riffing and blissful melodies. \u201cXerox\u201d bears a sense of delicate intimacy within the delivery. Meanwhile, the first single \u201cThe Age of Decay\u201d crescendos towards an emotionally charged harmony colored by shimmering keys and bright guitars before off-kilter riffs seesaw back-and-forth on the bridge.\n\u201c\u2018The Age of Decay\u2019 encapsulates everything we do on this record,\u201d continues Mario. \u201cIt\u2019s got some of the heaviest moments as well as the most dynamic and melodic. It shows little bits of what we get into throughout the whole album in one track. It\u2019s a love story in this age of decay. There are some personal points connected to our relationship about how things grew from when we met. We moved around the country and chased this thing together we\u2019ve been chasing our whole lives. Meanwhile, it\u2019s also about being in a world that can be fucking hard to deal with. It\u2019s a broad stroke. It\u2019s not just a picture of darkness and decay, but love.\u201d\nIn the end, Spotlights paint such a picture on their own terms and without template or form.\n\u201cIt\u2019s intangible,\u201d Mario leaves off. \u201cIt\u2019s intense. It\u2019s beautiful. There\u2019s an impending darkness underneath everything and a sense of unease, but it\u2019s also honest and vulnerable. It\u2019s important to us.

The disc also contains two originals that reveal some of Neikrug\u2019s journey from her hometown of Los Angeles to New York City, where she argues she truly belongs.\n\nHobgood, who recruited his regular trio mates \u2013 drummer Jared Schonig and bassist Matt Clohesy \u2013 for Changes, describes Neikrug as \u201can intellectual and complex person.\u201d \u201cI can honestly say that she\u2019s the most theoretically informed singer that I\u2019ve ever worked with \u2013 in terms of just knowing music,\u201d Hobgood says. \u201cShe understands the basic structures of music and how to talk about it. She has a healthy combination of being strong-willed with being totally open-minded to suggestions. Those are attributes of a singer with a long career.\u201d\n\nChanges begins with a hypnotic reading of \u201cNo Moon at All\u201d on which Neikrug initiates by pairing her comely soprano with Hobgood\u2019s economical piano accompaniment. Soon after the rhythm section enters the fray and buoys her along as she demonstrates her assured sense of swing, bluesy phrasing and remarkable scatting acumen.\n\nNeikrug\u2019s graceful rendition of \u201cSpring Can Really Hang You Up the Most\u201d is the second of the Great American Songbook compositions to appear on Changes. Neikrug says that she started singing the Fran Landesman and Tommy Wolf tune when she was only 17, but with little understanding of its emotional subtext. \u201cHow could I? First of all, living in Los Angeles, I only had summer my whole life. So, what is spring?\u201d Neikrug laughs. \u201cAfter I first moved to New York, I finally understood what spring was all about. I found out why so many songs are written about the weather and the seasons, because they make a huge difference in your mental and emotional state.\u201d\n\nThe disc shift gears with Neikrug\u2019s divine makeover of Al Green\u2019s R&B staple, \u201cLet\u2019s Stay Together\u201d on which she sings the pleading lyrics and succinct melody atop Hobgood\u2019s beguiling arrangement. Hobgood suggested the song to Neikrug during one of their first think-tank sessions while they were scanning Rolling Stone magazine\u2019s \u201c100 Best Songs.\u201d\n\nNeikrug\u2019s burgeoning songwriting talent gets the spotlight with \u201cChanges,\u201d the disc\u2019s title track. Spurred by a lithe samba rhythm, the song touches on the difficult period between graduating from Frost School of Music at the University of Miami with a bachelor of music degree in studio music and jazz vocal performance and applying for the Sarah Vaughan International Vocal Competition. \u201cI was going through my first major depressive episode,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was experiencing a rough time because I didn\u2019t have any structure or job yet. It was weird for me to be out in the real world and think, \u2018Okay? What do I do? How do I make a schedule? Where do I go?\u2019\u201d\n\nNow in hindsight, Neikrug sees that struggling, transitional period as a blessing because it afforded her some of life\u2019s big lows and highs, which enabled her to write more convincing life-based songs and interpret emotionally gripping standards. \u201cHaving to build yourself up when you\u2019re down is not an easy thing to do\u201d she says. \u201cBut how else are you going to write music from the heart and emote these big experiences that you can put into your art? In the worst way, it\u2019s kind of cool.\u201d\n\nChanges continues with the first of two intriguing mash-ups, \u201cNever Let Me Go/I\u2019ll Be There.\u201d Neikrug and Hobgood delve into Ray Evans and Jay Livingston\u2019s 1956 standard as a sparkling duet before the rhythm section slides in for a sumptuous rendition of the Jackson Five\u2019s Motown gem. \u201cI\u2019ve been pitching \u2018I\u2019ll Be There\u2019 as just a lush jazz ballad to a number of singers for about 15 years. Nobody has bit until now,\u201d Hobgood says.\n\nNeikrug returns to jazz standards with a blistering version of \u201cThe Song Is You,\u201d on which she flaunts her rhythmic and tonal agility before delivering her second original \u201cNew York Song,\u201d articulating her long desire to move to the Big Apple then returning to standard repertoire again by digging deep into the jazz canon for her bewitching, R&B-laden refurbishing of \u201cAfter You\u2019ve Gone,\u201d a Henry Creamer and Turner Layton classic that\u2019s 100-years-old. At the Sarah Vaughan International Competition, she\u2019d performed a vastly different, more up-tempo treatment of \u201cAfter You\u2019ve Gone\u201d during the final round.\n\nNeikrug then performs what she argues is the song that sealed her win at that aforementioned competition \u2013 Bob Dorough and Terrell Kirk\u2019s \u201cDevil May Care.\u201d Again, she explains that Hobgood\u2019s mesmeric arrangement differs from the one she performed at the competition, which she described as \u201csassier and more down-home blues.\n\nChanges concludes with its second mash-up \u2013 two Joni Mitchell songs \u201cHelp Me/Be Cool.\u201d After college graduation, Neikrug went on a Joni Mitchell binge, beginning with the 1971 landmark LP, Blue. \u201c[\u2018Help Me\u2019] sounds almost as if it were written for my voice,\u201d Neikrug says. \u201cThe key is perfect; the melody is perfect. The song is challenging enough that I had a desire to learn it. But it was also about storytelling and being young and full of angst.\u201d\n\nAfter agreeing on \u201cHelp Me,\u201d Hobgood suggested intertwining it with \u201cBe Cool.\u201d Neikrug had her reservations though. \u201cTo be honest, the first time I heard it, I said, \u2018OK, could you give me something a little bit harder to sing?\u2019\u201d Neikrug laughs. \u201cBut Laurence wanted to do a mash-up. It almost resembles how I wish pop music sounded. It still sounds really hip but it\u2019s challenging, eye-opening and re-imaginative.\u201d\n\nBlending the right amount of reverence for the jazz tradition with a knowing glance to modern pop and R&B classics, sprinkled with two inviting originals, Changes will delight both jazz purists and novices without making any unwise artistic compromises as she superbly negotiates the glories of jazz\u2019s past with a wide-eyed optimism that betrays her tender age. \u201cWhen you\u2019re recording your debut album, fresh out of college, you\u2019re not exactly sure how you want to present yourself,\u201d Neikrug explains. \u201cIt was easier figuring that out by discovering who I didn\u2019t want to be. I\u2019m just trying to take the jazz tradition and move it in my direction.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Birdland is please to welcome back to the stage the Arianna Neikrug Quartet!"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Chris Morrissey", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Mon Feb 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:45 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Jim Campilongo Trio, Rich Hinman - Rockwood Stage 2"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Josh Dion", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Mon Feb 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-10", "Genre": "Genres: Pop Punk, Pop", "Time": "8:45 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Jim Campilongo Trio, Rich Hinman - Rockwood Stage 2"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Jim Campilongo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7978214.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Mon Feb 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-10", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Country", "Time": "8:45 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Billboard Magazine calls Jim Campilongo \"an American treasure\", an accolade which this guitarist's artistry and influential career has richly earned him.

Born on a military base in Nogales, Arizona in 1922 and raised in Watts, California, his earliest musical influences came from the church\u2013 choir and group singing\u2013 and from \u201chearing Duke Ellington over the radio when [he] was eight years old.\u201d He studied double bass and composition in a formal way (five years with H. Rheinshagen, principal bassist of the New York Philharmonic, and compositional techniques with the legendary Lloyd Reese) while absorbing vernacular music from the great jazz masters, first-hand. His early professional experience, in the 40\u2019s, found him touring with bands like Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory and Lionel Hampton.\n\nEventually he settled in New York where he played and recorded with the leading musicians of the 1950\u2019s\u2013 Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Art Tatum and Duke Ellington himself. One of the few bassists to do so, Mingus quickly developed as a leader of musicians. He was also an accomplished pianist who could have made a career playing that instrument. By the mid-50\u2019s he had formed his own publishing and recording companies to protect and document his growing repertoire of original music. He also founded the \u201cJazz Workshop,\u201d a group which enabled young composers to have their new works performed in concert and on recordings.\n\nMingus soon found himself at the forefront of the avant-garde. His recordings bear witness to the extraordinarily creative body of work that followed. They include: Pithecanthropus Erectus, The Clown, Tijuana Moods, Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Ah Um, The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, Cumbia and Jazz Fusion, Let My Children Hear Music. He recorded over a hundred albums and wrote over three hundred scores.\nAlthough he wrote his first concert piece, \u201cHalf-Mast Inhibition,\u201d when he was seventeen years old, it was not recorded until twenty years later by a 22-piece orchestra with Gunther Schuller conducting. It was the presentation of \u201cRevelations\u201d which combined jazz and classical idioms, at the 1955 Brandeis Festival of the Creative Arts, that established him as one of the foremost jazz composers of his day.\n\nIn 1971 Mingus was awarded the Slee Chair of Music and spent a semester teaching composition at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In the same year his autobiography, Beneath the Underdog, was published by Knopf. In 1972 it appeared in a Bantam paperback and was reissued after his death, in 1980, by Viking/Penguin and again by Pantheon Books, in 1991. In 1972 he also re-signed with Columbia Records. His music was performed frequently by ballet companies, and Alvin Ailey choreographed an hour program called \u201cThe Mingus Dances\u201d during a 1972 collaboration with the Robert Joffrey Ballet Company.\n\nHe toured extensively throughout Europe, Japan, Canada, South America and the United States until the end of 1977 when he was diagnosed as having a rare nerve disease, Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis. He was confined to a wheelchair, and although he was no longer able to write music on paper or compose at the piano, his last works were sung into a tape recorder.\n\nFrom the 1960\u2019s until his death in 1979 at age 56, Mingus remained in the forefront of American music. When asked to comment on his accomplishments, Mingus said that his abilities as a bassist were the result of hard work but that his talent for composition came from God.\n\nMingus received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Smithsonian Institute, and the Guggenheim Foundation (two grants). He also received an honorary degree from Brandeis and an award from Yale University. At a memorial following Mingus\u2019 death, Steve Schlesinger of the Guggenheim Foundation commented that Mingus was one of the few artists who received two grants and added: \u201cI look forward to the day when we can transcend labels like jazz and acknowledge Charles Mingus as the major American composer that he is.\u201d The New Yorker wrote: \u201cFor sheer melodic and rhythmic and structural originality, his compositions may equal anything written in western music in the twentieth century.\u201d\n\nHe died in Mexico on January 5, 1979, and his wife, Sue Graham Mingus, scattered his ashes in the Ganges River in India. Both New York City and Washington, D.C. honored him posthumously with a \u201cCharles Mingus Day.\u201d\n\nAfter his death, the National Endowment for the Arts provided grants for a Mingus foundation created by Sue Mingus called \u201cLet My Children Hear Music\u201d which catalogued all of Mingus\u2019 works. The microfilms of these works were then given to the Music Division of the New York Public Library where they are currently available for study and scholarship \u2013 a first for jazz. Sue Mingus has founded three working repertory bands called the Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Orchestra, and the Mingus Big Band, which continue to perform his music. Biographies of Charles Mingus include Mingus by Brian Priestley, Mingus/Mingus by Janet Coleman and Al Young, Myself When I Am Real by Gene Santoro, and Tonight at Noon, a memoir by Sue Mingus.\n\nMingus\u2019 masterwork, \u201cEpitaph,\u201d a composition which is more than 4000 measures long and which requires two hours to perform, was discovered during the cataloguing process. With the help of a grant from the Ford Foundation, the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by Gunther Schuller, in a concert produced by Sue Mingus at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989, ten years after Mingus\u2019 death.\n\nThe New Yorker wrote that \u201cEpitaph\u201d represents the first advance in jazz composition since Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cBlack, Brown, and Beige,\u201d which was written in 1943. The New York Times said it ranked with the \u201cmost memorable jazz events of the decade.\u201d Convinced that it would never be performed in his lifetime, Mingus called his work \u201cEpitaph,\u201d declaring that he wrote it \u201cfor my tombstone.\u201d\n\nThe Library of Congress purchased the Charles Mingus Collection, a major acquisition, in 1993; this included autographed manuscripts, photographs, literary manuscripts, correspondence, and tape recordings of interviews, broadcasts, recording sessions, and Mingus composing at the piano.\n\nSue Mingus has published a number of educational books through Hal Leonard Publishing, including Charles Mingus: More Than a Fake Book, Charles Mingus: More Than a Play-Along, Charles Mingus: Easy Piano Solos, many big band charts\u2014 including the Simply Mingus set of big band music charts\u2013 and a Mingus guitar book.\n\nReprinted in part from More than a Fake Book \u00a9 1991 Jazz Workshop, Inc.\n\nLinks to Additional Biographical and Historical Information on the Web\n\nLibrary of Congress\nAn index to the holdings of the Charles Mingus Collection, Music Division of the Library of Congress.\nhttp://www.loc.gov/performingarts/encyclopedia/collections/mingus.html", "otherInfo": "Mingus himself is continually evolving as a composer, bassist and leader.

The album was born from a commitment to write a song per week for 52 weeks. Through this discipline of writing and seeking to find God's beauty and hope in the joy and the pain, PJ stepped into his stride. \"Set Me Free\" is a prayerful realization that God desires to set our hearts free from our hurt and difficulty while \"It Is You\" reminds us that Christ is the true desire of our hearts.\n\n\n\nGrace Beyond Strength, which was released in June 2012, landed him a spot as an iTunes New & Noteworthy Featured Artist.

Whether it's prayers, psalms, or contemporary classics, this youthful Brooklyn tenor finds in music something rich and affirming, an endeavor that makes the soul soar and the spirit rise and speaks to the human condition. In fact, Shulem feels music aspires to go beyond the current historical context to illuminate what he sees as the perfect dream: when the world is at peace. There are some voices that have to be heard \u2013 and Shulem\u2019s is one of them.\nMarking the first time that a singer from the orthodox Hasidic community has been signed to a major label, Shulem\u2019s debut album, The Perfect Dream, will be released on Decca Gold, an imprint of Universal Music Group\u2019s Verve Label Group. Produced by Jon Cohen, the album is an arresting arrival of a fresh voice -- new to many --and yet already seasoned by years of performing for his congregation and the Hasidic community. The Perfect Dream finds Shulem masterfully embracing a broad range of material reflecting his varied musical tastes. His considerable vocal talents are supremely showcased in the two singles of the album, Les Miserables\u2019 \u201cBring Him Home\u201d and \"Jerusalem Of Gold\".\n\u201cWhen I sing and perform, everything that I believe in my heart and soul is part of each note and every phrase which is what I strive to share with others. It's very exciting,\" Shulem says of this new step in his career, and I am looking forward to being able to sing for more people and develop as an artist. I am so grateful to have been given this opportunity.\u201d Decca Gold President, Graham Parker adds that \u201cShulem really does see himself as someone who can impact people in a meaningful, heart to heart way. People are touched by his voice and his ability to communicate a hopeful message. All the songs that are on the album come from a place of hope and inspiration -- of thinking of things bigger than yourself. That's what makes him so special.\u201d\nGrowing up in Brooklyn's Boro Park neighborhood, Shulem was exposed primarily to the cantorial music preferred by his father as well as his older brother, who's now a synagogue cantor in Manhattan. Shulem, who was a featured child soloist in his community, explains, \"There are many different kinds and forms of cantorial music. I was hearing a wide variety of styles and approaches which broadened my awareness.\u201d Opera, particularly Luciano Pavarotti, also became an important influence, along with Michael Jackson that led him to artists such as Billy Joel, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Andrea Bocelli, and Josh Groban. \u201cI listened to a lot of different things,\u201d Shulem says. \u201dI will look up certain people and study what they do -- how they achieve certain things either with their voice or in their career. I listen to their voices and think, 'Oh, I can do that or fit that in' and try to make that happen somehow.\u2019 Music, like any creative endeavor, is fluid and is a river of influences that constantly evolves.\u201d\nHis passion for music came when Shulem was young. He was a lead soloist with the famed Shira choir, while videos of him performing stylized arrangements of \u201cAvinu Malkeinu\u201d and the Passover song \"Chad Gadya\" became viral sensations. It was the latter, in fact, that Decca Gold's Graham Parker became \"obsessed\" with, leading him to investigate Shulem online and ultimately arrange for a meeting. \u201cI kept looking at that video, staring at Shulem, watching him sing,\u201d remembers Parker, a cantor himself. \u201cShulem\u2019s voice was just so beautiful and you could tell by the way he was using his instrument that he was in total command. I looked at the other videos he's done and knew this was someone who was very special.\u201d\nAt first, Shulem thought Parker's call was a prank. \u201cI just could not believe that Graham was for real. What can a major record company want with a Hasidic singer like me?\u201d he says now with a laugh. \u201cBut we had a great conversation about my career and what I was doing and what I wanted to accomplish.\u201d\nThe song selection for The Perfect Dream was a careful, painstaking process, with all parties, including producer Jon Cohen, working to find the perfect material to both fit both Shulem's voice and persona. \u201cWe settled on a complete sound for the project. I myself am kind of surprised the album shows so many variations of my voice and it was exciting to be able to have that latitude.\u201d\nThe release of The Perfect Dream extends Shulem\u2019s reach further.

Making people believe you deserve their attention, is at the top of the list. But when you get the attention of such legends as Teddy Riley and Quincy Jones, your future gets a whole lot brighter.\n\nLenny Harold, a New Jersey native R&B crooner and songwriter, wears his homegrown local artist roots just as proudly as the many stamps on his passport.\n\nHaving toured the world over, for five years, as a member of the reformatted legendary R&B group Blackstreet, led by the New Jack Swing creator himself, Teddy Riley, Lenny has had a hefty helping of what a major label star\u2019s life would be like. Yet, he still grinds just as hard as any local artist you may come across. That\u2019s what has kept Lenny Harold on the radar of many music lovers. From his winning tenure on Showtime at The Apollo [under old moniker Chanj] to his ovation grabbing tributes to Patti Labelle and Berry Gordy in the years following. Lenny\u2019s striking tenor range mixed with smooth vibrato has even turned many of today\u2019s industry heavyweights into mere fans from the likes of Marsha Ambrosius to Jamie Foxx.\n\nThis vocal prowess became highly evident on Lenny Harold\u2019s first official offering, \u201cThe Journal of Wonders: Tale of The Phoenix in The Moon Labyrinth,\u201d which led to an EP entitled \u201cYesterday Morning.\u201d Which Lenny details as the full story behind \u201cWaiting on Yesterday,\u201d a song from that first project, of a romantic mistake.\n\nTwo years later, while with Blackstreet, Lenny would then begin a new journey of reinvention, with a project entitled, \u201cNew Testament: Mountain High,\u201d first of a trilogy of projects to come. This musical sharing would begin to truly solidify the seriousness of his artistry, as many more took notice and loved.\n\nBut as with most unstoppable independent artists, a chance at personal success is always looming. Inspired by the experience of touring the world, finding his own fandom in places like Japan, Nigeria, London, and Germany, and sharing the stage with R&B greats, as a member of Blackstreet, Lenny felt the need to leave the group, after five years, to explore his solo career with full force.\n\nWith his latest singles, \u201cMore\u201d (which became an instant fan favorite) & \u201cHeat\u201d reaching number 7 on the UK Soul Charts, the release of his highly anticipated album, \u201cCOSMIC,\u201d has excited the hearts of his \u2018Wonders\u2019 [the name he gave his fans] and still introducing him to more ears, there\u2019s only greatness from here.\n\nLenny shares, \u201cCOSMIC is something bold, honest, sexy and beautiful, with love at it\u2019s core.

Don\u2019t get me wrong I love a solid heartbreak tune, but I had never written anything else.\" admits Brent Cowles, as he described the impetus for \"High to Low\", his brand new single available October 18th.\n\n\"I wanted to make people dance and smile\" he continued. So Brent locked himself in an LA studio with producer and songwriter Lewis Pesacov, of Fool's Gold fame, and they put together the funky foundations for \"High To Low.\u201d Brent and Lewis built the song around the bass-line. The result is exuberant, good time rock n roll. Says Brent, \"It\u2019s a song about dancing like everyone is watching, and you don\u2019t give a damn.\"\n\nBlurring the lines between boisterous rock, R&B, and contemplative folk, Brent\u2019s infectious voice and knack for melody seem to swing effortlessly from quavering intimacy to a soulful roar as they soar atop his exuberant, explosive arrangements.\n\nGrowing up, Cowles first discovered the power of his voice singing hymns at his father\u2019s church in Colorado Springs. Having a pastor for a parent meant heavy involvement in religious life, but Cowles never quite seemed to fit in. At 16 he fell in love with secular music; at 17 he recorded his first proper demos in a friend\u2019s basement; at 18 he was married; at 19 he was divorced. Meanwhile, what began as a solo musical project blossomed into the critically acclaimed band You Me & Apollo, which quickly took over his life. The Denver Post raved that the group created \u201csome of the most exciting original music in Colorado,\u201d while Westword proclaimed that their live show was a \u201cclinic in roots rock mixed with old-school swing and blues,\u201d and Seattle NPR station KEXP hailed \u201cCowles\u2019 Otis Redding and Sam Cooke inspired vocals.\u201d The band released two albums and toured nationally before they called it quits and amicably went their separate ways.\n\nThe parting was a necessary but difficult one for Cowles. In the ensuing months and years, he would find himself alone more than ever before, at one point living out of his Chevy Tahoe just to make ends meet. But rather than break him, the experience only strengthened his resolve. \"High to Low\u201d gives the listener a real sense of Brent\u2019s current mood. His songs are more evolved yet simpler, his lyrics are stronger yet fragile. He hopes you love it, live it and get down with it.", "otherInfo": "21 AND OVER ADMITTED DOORS 7:00 PM"}, {"Address": "173 7th Ave S, New York, NY 10014", "Artist": "Meghan Fitton", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10028780.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00168, 40.73536], "Date": "Tue Feb 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-11", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Soul, folk, Country", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Baby Brasa", "moreBioInfo": "Just a Boston girl in the big city trying to tell stories.

A year later he was enrolled in music lessons, starting on piano and eventually picking up the sax, and by middle school was playing in state symphonic bands, touring with classical horn trios, and singing his heart out any chance he could get.\n\nUltimately Kevin found his place in the jazz and blues scene in highschool and college, while also exploring his talents as a guitar player. By the time he graduated from George Washington University, Daniel had played in two quartets, four high school orchestras, two jazz and blue bands, one bluegrass band, one punk ska group, and even sang tenor in an acapella group. But it was his move to New York City in 2013, and a sudden and unexpected tragedy, that put Kevin on the path towards his eventual solo career.\n\nThat winter, during a dinner party in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Kevin received a phone call from his sister that would change everything. His mother and stepfather, adventure-seekers and amateur pilots, had been flying back from their mountain house in western North Carolina when their plane had crashed, killing both of them. Daniel\u2019s life was turned upside down, his family torn apart and the world forever changed. During his return to North Carolina to help with family business, and while reliving his parent\u2019s lives through photos, essays, and family stories, Kevin wrote over a dozen songs, all fueled by the grief of losing his parents as well as the celebration of the large lives they were known for. From those songs six were chosen to record, including one written specifically for Kevin\u2019s parent\u2019s memorial service.\n\nThe result of those recordings was FLY, Kevin Daniel\u2019s inaugural EP. The six-song project was recorded in 2014 in Brooklyn and embodies the depth of Daniel\u2019s emotions during a time of supreme distress. Southern sounds of banjo and country-loving three-part harmonies were backed by rock riffs and pop lyrics, which spoke true to life and the celebration of living. \u201cI always knew I wanted to record my own music, and a life spent being in other people\u2019s bands had prepared me to lead my own, both in the studio and on the stage. It was losing my parents that gave me the kick in the ass to finally do it\u201d, says Daniel. The EP is available on all digital outlets as well as on 12-inch opaque blue vinyl.\n\nKevin Daniel recently finished his second EP, Myself Through You, which was recorded at Degraw Sound in Brooklyn, NY, and produced, engineered, and mixed by Ben Rice. Kevin gathered together a host of talented, professional musicians from all backgrounds for the project, which resulted in a richly recorded blend of genres and instruments. \u201cWhen I started thinking about this EP, I knew I wanted to get some of the best musicians I know in the studio. With Ben\u2019s help we created a space where people could come in, lay down their own version of the parts, and create something unique to them as well as the record,\u201d says Kevin.\n\nFeaturing instrumentation as diverse as pedal steel guitar, flugelhorn, and bluegrass banjo, the songs on Myself Through You deliver sublime lamentations of the country-tinged Americana Daniel has created over the last few years. The EP\u2019s title track Myself Through You\u2019 is Daniel\u2019s attempt to take a subjective look at his own life. \u201cI often find myself trying to take a step back and see life from someone else\u2019s eyes,\u201d says Kevin. \u201cThis song came into being at a time where I was really struggling to understand someone else\u2019s point of view. I think we all struggle with that daily.\u201d\n\nFollowing the release of Myself Through You in early 2018 Kevin Daniel will look to tour throughout the US, taking a full band, and explosive live performance to his soon to be new fans.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "185 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Fred Arcoleo", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.988346, 40.722035], "Date": "Tue Feb 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall Stage 3", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Celebrating Rockwood Music Hall's 15-Year Anniversary!"}, {"Address": "146 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Harrison Storm", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7878068.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.963479, 40.7101], "Date": "Tue Feb 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-11", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Songwriter\\nAcoustic", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Baby's All Right", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Hollow Coves with Harrison Storm at Baby's All Right in Brooklyn, NY."}, {"Address": "241 E 24th St, New York, NY 10010", "Artist": "Jason Chatfield Comedy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9080218.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.980868, 40.738845], "Date": "Tue Feb 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-11", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy, Spoken, Cartoon, Standup Comedy", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "New York Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "For the last 12 years Jason has performed comedy all over the world, including places where they think his Australian accent is some kind of birth defect.\n\nHe performs regularly at comedy clubs around New York City as well as hosting and performing all over the US, including the Columbus Improv, Carolina Comedy Club, Catch a Rising Star, Bananas Comedy Club, 7 Angels Theatre in Connecticut and Rockwells Comedy.\n\nChatfield has appeared on national television along with regional, national and international commercials including his ongoing character of \"Dan Driff\" for the national Selsun Blue campaign.\nYou can see him in the new season of NBC's Doodle Wars!\n\nJason has also been a syndicated cartoonist for 11 years, appearing daily in over 120 newspapers in 34 countries as well as regularly appearing in The New Yorker and MAD Magazine.

As one of the industry's most successful songwriters, he has penned some of the era's most memorable songs and earned a mantle full of awards and nominations.\n\nThe list of accomplishments McDonald brings is among music's most noteworthy. His is the voice behind songs like \"Amazed,\" \"Smile\" and \"No News\" and the pen behind songs like \"My Front Porch Looking In\" and \"Let Them Be Little.\" He has earned six gold and platinum albums, several CMA and ACM awards as well as BMI awards for songwriting. In writing and singing \"I'm Already There,\" he was responsible for a song embraced so warmly by the military and their families it became an unofficial anthem for U.S. troops serving the Middle East.\n\n\"That has to be the most rewarding part about writing songs,\" he says, \"when you can actually see the effect it has had on other people's lives.\"\n\nHe has also written songs recorded by John Michael Montgomery, Clay Walker, Billy Dean, Sara Evans and the Wilkinsons, among others.\n\nI feel like I have reached a crossroads in my personal and professional life,\" he says. \"I want to have a better balance and spend more time with my family and yet keep being an artist, hopefully making music that can really make a difference in people's lives.\"\n\nRichie also released a Christian record (\"something I always wanted to do and another side of me the fans get to hear\").\n\nMcDonald is embracing as strongly as ever the wide-ranging nature of his musical talents.\n\n\"Songwriting, recording and live performance are all connected for me,\" he says. \"My passion is writing, but when I write a song and get to record it myself, it means that much more to me because then I get to perform it. I think they're all intertwined and I don't think I could do one without the other. Still, I feel like it all starts with the song, and the rest will take care of itself.\"\n\n\"Nobody said it was going to be easy,\" he says with a characteristic smile. I think the great thing is I do have relationships I've built over the years. It's nice to go into a radio station and see familiar faces and not feel like a total stranger.\"\n\nHe is renewing those relationships as an artist extending his impact on the musical genre he loves, and a family man deepening his ties at home. As he carves out the proper balance between home and road, he is looking forward to the joys and thrills of that connection with his audience.\n\nBeing on stage is a thrill that never gets old for any performer, and for Richie McDonald, it is one he can see both through his windshield and in his rear-view mirror.\n\n\"I'm grateful every day,\" he says, \"for the chance to continue to do something I love so much.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "405 E 6th St, New York, NY 10009", "Artist": "Ryoju Fukushiro", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8680564.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.985708, 40.726311], "Date": "Tue Feb 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-11", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, R&B, soul, Funk, Smooth Jazz, Lounge, Pop, Classical, Free Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Caravan Of Dreams", "moreBioInfo": "Ryoju Fukushiro (Riyo) was born into a musical family in Kyoto, Japan in April 1986. When he was 17 years old, he devoted himself to taking Jazz saxophone lessons from Yoshiyuki Yamanaka, who is one of the most known warm toned tenor saxophonists in the Jazz scene of Japan.\n\nRyoju started to perform his own gigs when he was 19 years old in the Kansai area. Gaining a skill of a lyrical tone reminiscent of Stan Getz, he won the Grand Prix in the Jazz contest \u2018\u2019The Third Kobe Next Jazz Competition\u2019\u2019 in 2009.\n\nAfter moving to Tokyo in 2012, Ryoju made an appearance in the Jazz Magazine \u2018\u2019Jazz Hihyou\u2019\u2019 as a young energetic saxophonist. Soon after that, he recorded the self-sponsored original CD \u2018\u2019Bamboo Grove\u2019\u2019. His original tune ''Bamboo Grove'' was aired on radio for an electricity company, YAMABISHI's commercial song in 2013.\n\nIn March 2013, Ryoju visited San Francisco to participate in the Jazz competition \u2018\u2019Jazz Search West 2013\u2019\u2019, and won First Place the following month at the finals.

The album\u2019s uplifting lead single \u201cRevival\u201d is also available today to stream or download.\n\nWe'd tell you Gregory Porter is back, but you probably already knew. You probably felt the earth rumbling, announcing the man's bone-deep baritone, or you felt the air change as the warmth of his sound filled the atmosphere like a hug from above. That's because All Rise, his sixth studio album, marks a return to Porter's beloved original songwriting \u2014 heart-on-sleeve lyrics imbued with everyday philosophy and real-life detail, set to a stirring mix of jazz, soul, blues, and gospel. Produced by Troy Miller (Laura Mvula, Jamie Cullum, Emili Sand\u00e9), the set also represents the evolution of Porter's art to something even more emphatic, emotive, intimate, and universal too.\n\nAs Porter worked out this album's direction, he looked inward, upward, and around him, and arrived at a raison d'\u00eatre found in the title, ALL RISE. \u201cWe hear that phrase when presidents or judges come into the room,\u201d says Porter, \u201cbut I'm thinking all of us rise \u2014 not just one person being exalted. We are all exalted and lifted up by love. This is my political thought and my real truth. It comes from my personality, my mother's personality, the personality of the blues, and of black people. It's this idea of making do with the scraps, of resurrection and ascension, and of whatever the current situation is, it can get better through love.\u201d\n\nThough Porter had an acclaimed role in the original 1999 Broadway cast of It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues \u2014 and staged his own Nat King Cole & Me musical in 2004 \u2014 it was inevitable that he'd became known for his songs. That was made abundantly clear when both of Porter's indie albums \u2014 2010's Water and 2012's Be Good \u2014 received Grammy nominations, paving the way for his world-beating 2013 Blue Note debut, Liquid Spirit, which won the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album. He hasn't let down his legion of fans since, whether collaborating with Disclosure on \"Holding On,\" scoring another Grammy for Take Me to the Alley (2016), or telling his life story through Cole's songbook. Like others, Porter is still surprised by his runaway success, but he has a theory: \"I was soothed by my voice as a child and I think that's the same thing others get from it. I'm trying to heal myself with these songs.\"\n\nAnd that's the thing about love that All Rise keeps circling. Even when it's painful, confusing, out of reach, or under attack, love is ultimately curative. Once again, Porter cuts through the noise of genres and the mess of life to reach us all where we live: the heart.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1272 Broadway,, Brooklyn, NY 11221", "Artist": "Wildly", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.924884, 40.690956], "Date": "Tue Feb 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "the broadway", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Broadway Presents: Color Tongue / Wildly (Release Show) / Tuff Sunshine / Adios Ghost"}, {"Address": "599 Johnson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Semaphore", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8140884.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.923155, 40.709325], "Date": "Tue Feb 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-11", "Genre": "Genres: Shoe Gaze, Alternative, Math Rock, Pop Punk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Elsewhere - Zone One", "moreBioInfo": "As a trained jazz saxophonist who also plays over half a dozen instruments, Siddhu Anandalingam has been writing and creating music while growing up listening to his dad\u2019s old record collection.

His fusion of music playing and easy going banter captures the vivacity of great bandleaders of the past. This exuberance is evident on Newman\u2019s 2016 debut album, Eyes on the City, which pays tribute to his musical journey in New York.\nAlong with his Quartet, fellow musicians from Cincinnati\u2019s College-Conservatory of Music, Newman has allured audiences during his residencies at some of New York\u2019s most iconic venues. His first foray into creating an old school big band night was at the elegant Duane Park for \u201cAfter Dark,\u201d a jazz and burlesque revue on the downtown scene in Tribeca. \u201cAfter Dark\u201d lead to a weekly residency at the legendary Oak Room at The Plaza Hotel, a venue steeped in history which was frequented by the likes of Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli and countless others over its one hundred year history. Newman and his Quartet played each Wednesday to a mixed crowd seeking a slice of history, welcoming Lady Gaga as a surprise guest, until the venue closed in 2011. Currently, Newman performs every Tuesday and Thursday, as bandleader in a residency at Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel, and select Friday nights at NYC\u2019s legendary Rainbow Room with his orchestra. Brian also routinely appears for special live performances with a diverse array of musical acts, which have included Tony Bennett, Jose Feliciano, Stevie Wonder, Mark Murphy, Dierks Bentley, Willie Nile, Molly Ringwald, David Loeb, Steve Wynn\u2019s Orchestra, Ray Benson\u2019s Asleep at the Wheel and Tommy London.\nNewman\u2019s personal style, which meshes classic suits, vintage tattoos and rock-n-roll, has attracted commercial brands such as Jack Daniel\u2019s, Marc Jacobs and Tiffany & Co., who have collaborated with Newman for special events and performances. The Jack Daniel\u2019s partnership in 2012, which launched the brand\u2019s Sinatra Select premium Tennessee Whiskey, brought Newman alongside Frank Sinatra Jr. himself, in a performance in Cannes, France.\nBrian married burlesque star, Angie Pontani of the World Famous Pontani Sisters in February 2013, with whom he most notably performs in connection with Pontani\u2019s New York Burlesque Festival and Burlesque-a-Pades shows. The couple have a daughter, and reside in the neighborhood of Brooklyn.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "510 E 11th St,, New York, NY 10009", "Artist": "Leah Tash", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8991719.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.981225, 40.728088], "Date": "Tue Feb 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-11", "Genre": "Genres: singer-songwriter, folk, rock, Blues", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "11th Street Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Leah Tash was born and raised in New York City.

During her time in college at The New School, this infatuation grew into a tool Leah began to incorporate into her songwriting. Leah began performing at 17 years old, and since then has been exposed to a multitude of genres throughout her travels in and out of New York. This has been essential in her development as both a songwriter and a performer, as she continues to blend many genres in her own work.

However, in this day and age, that might be why the story of Spotlights feels so serendipitous and strange, if not utterly surprising. This story also instantly appealed to some rather influential peers who lent an early endorsement. Two musicians\u2014husband-and-wife duo Mario [guitar, synths, vocals] and Sarah Quintero [bass, guitar, vocals]\u2014simply pick up their instruments and mainline dense distortion, spacey soundscapes, and unnervingly serene vocal transmissions directly from the heart.\nThis unpredictable, yet unassuming sound quietly heralded their arrival in 2016 on the D.I.Y. debut LP, Tidals. Brooklyn Vegan stumbled upon the project and streamed \u201cWalls.\u201d The song eventually entranced musician and producer Aaron Harris (ISIS/Palms) who shared it with his Palms singer and Deftones frontman Chino Moreno. An invite to open the Deftones summer tour followed as the band would go on to share the stage with everyone from Melvins, Quicksand, Hum, and Glassjaw to Pelican and Pallbearer. Ipecac Recordings co-founders Mike Patton and Greg Werckman fell under the band\u2019s spell and signed them. The Harris-produced Seismic dropped on Ipecac Recordings in 2017 to acclaim from Revolver, Metal Injection, New Noise, MetalSucks, and many others. Between tours, 2018 saw them reveal the Hanging By Faith remix EP and one-off single \u201cKiss the Ring\u201d [feat. Allen Epley].\nMario may be able to explain how it all happened, but the \u201cwhy\u201d still eludes him\u2026\n\u201cThree years ago, we were just playing tiny local shows, and all of these crazy things have happened since,\u201d he smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting story to us, because we\u2019ve never had a gimmick or a hook. What sets us apart is the music. We try to bring different worlds together in a way that\u2019s as original as possible. We know the specifics of how it happened, but we don\u2019t really know why.\u201d\nThe group\u2019s 2019 third full-length, Love and Decay, may indirectly offer an answer. This time around, Spotlights once again personally handled production, working out of a tiny Brooklyn rehearsal space. However, for the first time, they enlisted the talents of drummer Chris Enriquez behind the kit on the entire body of work rather than a combination of Mario and guest performers.\nSonically, the group further canvased new territory. Whether it be the hummable guitar lead peeking through trudging grooves on \u201cUntil The Bleeding Stops\u201d or the ghostly pop chorus of \u201cParticle Noise,\u201d they ascend to a tipping point between volumetric riffing and blissful melodies. \u201cXerox\u201d bears a sense of delicate intimacy within the delivery. Meanwhile, the first single \u201cThe Age of Decay\u201d crescendos towards an emotionally charged harmony colored by shimmering keys and bright guitars before off-kilter riffs seesaw back-and-forth on the bridge.\n\u201c\u2018The Age of Decay\u2019 encapsulates everything we do on this record,\u201d continues Mario. \u201cIt\u2019s got some of the heaviest moments as well as the most dynamic and melodic. It shows little bits of what we get into throughout the whole album in one track. It\u2019s a love story in this age of decay. There are some personal points connected to our relationship about how things grew from when we met. We moved around the country and chased this thing together we\u2019ve been chasing our whole lives. Meanwhile, it\u2019s also about being in a world that can be fucking hard to deal with. It\u2019s a broad stroke. It\u2019s not just a picture of darkness and decay, but love.\u201d\nIn the end, Spotlights paint such a picture on their own terms and without template or form.\n\u201cIt\u2019s intangible,\u201d Mario leaves off. \u201cIt\u2019s intense. It\u2019s beautiful. There\u2019s an impending darkness underneath everything and a sense of unease, but it\u2019s also honest and vulnerable. It\u2019s important to us. Regardless of why anyone might react, that\u2019s why we do it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Elsewhere is intended to be a safe space to enjoy music, art, expression, and free play.

Stream new track \"Ifrit,\" from Retrocausal, and pre-order the album, here: https://clericmimicry.bandcamp.com/album/retrocausal-2 Founded in Philly in 2003, Cleric resides in the circle of bands like The Dillinger Escape Plan and Car Bomb \u2013 elite musicians playing avant-metal that wows on both a cerebral level and a gut level. Cleric's brand of metal is marked by dark, cinematic atmospheres and free jazz-informed forays, bursting through a base of highly technical, mathy shred. As a review in Chicago Reader phrased it, the sound is \"a kind of metal, the way [David Lynch's] Lost Highway is a kind of movie. It's an elastic tissue of creepy electronic noise and barely-human screaming, impregnated with patches of riff-salad grind and hypercube mathcore.\" On Retrocausal, Cleric has pushed its style to new heights. Meshuggah-esque hypnosis, doomful synths, spastic skronking, and blastbeats weave together into highly unpredictable, kitchen-sink epics, many surpassing the 9-minute mark. An ominous vibe, straight off a movie screen, underlies everything; lurking in the shadows are mysterious samples and field recordings evoking deep sea and outer space. None other than John Zorn is a fan and collaborator who lent his talents to Retrocausal. Elder statesman of musical freedom, a man whose massive body of work incorporates jazz, classical, metal, klezmer, film scores, and more, Zorn guests on Retrocausal's closer, \"Grey Lodge.\" Cleric's relationship with Zorn began in 2013 when he invited the band to work with him on his ongoing Masada project, and continued with his tapping guitarist Matt Hollenberg to join his band Simulacrum (along with John Medeski of Medeski, Martin, and Wood). In addition to Zorn, Retrocausal features guest appearances by Mick Barr (Krallice, Orthrelm, Ocrilim) and Timba Harris (Secret Chiefs 3). A concept album, Retrocausal is an adventure story set in a dystopian future. Cleric vocalist/keyboardist Nick Shellenberger explains: \"Lyrically, Retrocausal opens a window into a bleak sci-fi landscape plagued by environmental fallout, in which corrupt governments send their citizens to die, and centers around one submarine crew that learns of their intended fate and chooses to pursue the beyond, despite the terrors that await. Told from different perspectives throughout the record, it's a story of hope, fear, uncertainty, and constant struggle in the face of failure and death, and in search of something that may never be.\" The album was recorded, mixed, and mastered by Colin Marston (Gorguts, Dysrhythmia) at The Thousand Caves in Queens, New York. The artwork was created by Cleric's Nick Shellenberger. Label boss Spruance states, \"When we here at Web of Mimicry ran across Cleric's music it almost seemed as if some kind of prophecy was being fulfilled. The music registered in our minds as a kind of missing link, like an inevitable stage in metal-oriented music that has needed to happen for a long time now.\" I am Cleric. I am from PHILADELPHIA.

Her father, the late Luis Russell, was a native of Panama who moved to New Orleans and then New York City, becoming a pioneering pianist/composer/bandleader, and Louis Armstrong's long-time musical director. Her mother, Carline Ray, an outstanding bassist and vocalist, has performed with Mary Lou Williams and International Sweethearts of Rhythm. Considering her roots and family pedigree, it\u2019s no surprise that Catherine Russell is a one-of-a-kind singer and musician. Cat is in demand as a backing singer and multi-instrumentalist, having performed and recorded with artists including Steely Dan, Levon Helm, David Bowie, Cyndi Lauper, Paul Simon, Jackson Browne, Michael Feinstein, Carrie Smith, and Rosanne Cash.\n\nOf her debut album \"Cat\", (World Village/Harmonia Mundi), she made critic and Sinatra biographer, Will Friedwald's top 10 list who stated \"She is a fresh and original voice. The most exciting debut album I've heard in a long time.\" \"It's a delight to hear the real thing in Catherine Russell\", wrote the dean of jazz writers, Nat Hentoff, in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nCatherine Russell's second album on World Village, \"Sentimental Streak\", was released in 2008 to universal acclaim, hitting the Billboard and I-Tunes Jazz Charts, and JazzWeek and Living Blues Radio Charts. Cat was a guest on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" and NPR's \"Fresh Air\". She won the prestigious German Record Critics' Award in the Jazz category and Living Blues magazine's 2008 critics' poll as \"Artist Deserving More Attention.\" L'Acadamie du Jazz in France chose \"Sentimental Streak\" as finaliste for Prix du Jazz Vocal 2008, while Grammy Award winning writer and jazz critic Francis Davis picked \"Sentimental Streak\" as Vocal Album of the Year in the 2008 Village Voice Jazz Critics Poll.\n\nSince the release of her albums, Catherine Russell has performed on three continents. She's been the surprise hit at major events including the Chicago Blues Festival, Montreal Jazz Festival, Bern Jazz Festival, Rochester International Jazz Festival, Tanglewood Jazz Festival, Lotus World Music Festival, I Love Jazz Festival in Brazil, Panama Jazz Festival, and at premier venues like The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Scullers Jazz Club in Boston, The Dakota in Minneapolis, and Yoshi's in San Francisco. All Music Guide says, \"Russell emerged as a retro old school vocalist for the ages.\"\n\nCatherine Russell's \"Inside This Heart of Mine\" is a personal selection of gems from the 1920s through the Present; vital interpretations, bursting with soul and humor. Deepening the approach of her previous recordings -- an off-the-beaten-path song selection, sparkling small group acoustic swing, and a stunning vocal approach -- with \"Inside This Heart Of Mine\", vocalist Catherine Russell joins the ranks of the greatest interpreters and performers of American Popular Song.\n\nStrictly Romancin', released in 2012, is a paean to natural attractions; to a lover, an art form, and to one\u2019s family heritage. Our faithful heroine explores love\u2019s foibles, failures, and bliss, from amorous to humorous, embodying the lost art of song savvy, inhabiting the lyric, and allowing each melody to shine. On this 14 song collection, this ever soulful jazz/blues vocalist takes us on a journey; from Harlem dance hall, to Parisian Caf\u00e9, to Store Front Church, to New Orleans Gin Joint, to Uptown Cabaret, blurring distinctions between the carnal and the eternal, in a musical tour de force. Strictly Romancin' was awarded Prix du Jazz Vocal (Vocal Album of The Year) by the Jazz Academy in France, Grand Prix du Hot Club de France, and a Bistro Award for Outstanding Recording, after reaching #1 on multiple Jazz Charts (JazzWeek, I-Tunes, Amazon), and #6 on Billboard. She also received a Nightlife Award as Outstanding Jazz Performer.\n\nIn 2012, Catherine Russell won a Grammy Award for her appearance as a featured artist on the soundtrack album for the HBO TV series Boardwalk Empire.\n\nCatherine's 5th album, \"Bring It Back\", will be released in February 2014 on the Jazz Village label, a new imprint from Harmonia Mundi.\n\nCatherine Russell is that rarest of entities \u2013 a genuine jazz and blues singer \u2013 who can sing virtually anything. Her voice is full blown feminity incarnate; a dusky, stalwart and soulful instrument that radiates interpretive power yet remains touchingly vulnerable.

Organized by post-bop pianist Marc Cary, The Harlem Sessions (originating at Gin Fizz and now based at Smoke Jazz Club) invites musicians, poets, artists, philosophers and dancers to build and explore a new common repertoire with original ensemble arrangements. A key player in galvanizing this fresh and dynamic sense of cultural awareness, drummer/composer Curtis Nowosad was on hand anchoring the groove every week during the gathering\u2019s first years \u2013 and he\u2019s still part of the action today.\n\nHaving made his home in Harlem since 2013 when he was working on his masters at the Manhattan School of Music, the 31-year-old Canadian native emerges as a powerful musical force for social justice on a groundbreaking self-titled jazz and blues-driven collection that illuminates past and present American history while creating some profound history of its own.\n\nWhile it may seem curious to some that Curtis would self-title his third overall album, it\u2019s reflective of a desire to share his deeper core identity. He imparts his truth and the issues that have long mattered to him via five impactful originals and edgy, intensely rendered versions of three thematically related pieces: Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s \u201cHome is Where the Hatred Is,\u201d Skip James\u2019 \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Co-produced with Cary, it\u2019s also the drummer\u2019s first collection to feature the explosive and intuitive chemistry of his NY-based ensemble that has held court in NYC everywhere from Smalls, Fat Cat and Rockwood Music Hall to The Jazz Standard and full week residencies at Dizzy\u2019s Club at Jazz at Lincoln Center.\n\nThe group includes Duane Eubanks (trumpet), Braxton Cook (alto sax), Andrew Renfroe (guitar), Jonathan Thomas (piano, Fender Rhodes, organ) and Luke Sellick (bass). Guests include Corey Wallace (trombone), Matthew Whitaker (organ) and vocalists Michael Mayo (whose beautiful wordless vocal brings a rich humanity to \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d and \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d) and Brianna Thomas, who brings the burning soul-blues angles and edges to \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Cary himself guests on Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer and synth.\n\nCurtis laid the foundation for this current release with two previous critically acclaimed collections, his debut The Skeptic & the Cynic (which spent two weeks at #1 on the Canadian Jazz charts and featured Grammy-nominated pianist Taylor Eigsti) and the WCMA-winning and JUNO-nominated Dialectics (Cellar Live), which made DownBeat Magazine\u2019s \u201cBest of 2015\u201d list, reached #3 on the CMJ jazz charts and spent ten weeks on the JazzWeek charts. The Skeptic & the Cynic was comprised mostly of cover songs by Michael Jackson, Bob Marley, Joni Mitchell, Pink Floyd, Black Star and 2Pac, along with two originals. Recorded in Winnipeg in 2014 after Curtis\u2019 first year at Manhattan School of Music, Dialectics featured mostly original music along with arrangements of compositions by Thelonious Monk, Wayne Shorter and the jazz standard \u201cI Remember You.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recorded my first two albums in my hometown of Winnipeg,\u201d Curtis says, \u201cwith a band made up of my former teachers from the University of Manitoba. Those works were geared towards my growth as a musician and gaining a deeper knowledge of jazz. Stylistically, the new one is definitely a departure from those, yet is a much better reflection of who I am and the themes and issues that matter to me. It\u2019s more important to me than just, \u2018here are some new songs.\u2019 These social issues were always simmering in my mind, and I was very vocal about them among the people I know and love, but it took a while before I was able to convey my feelings musically.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ve lived a lot of life between the release of Dialectics and now,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019ve gained a great deal of life and musical experience and been through a lot, so it felt appropriate to self-title the album. The music is very personal to me. I have gained a lot of insight living in Harlem for the past 5 1/2 years, and as a European-descended practitioner of Black American Music, I feel it is my duty to approach this music and these themes in a respectful, earnest and serious manner. I also feel that as I have made the transition from being an \u2018outsider looking in\u2019 (being from Canada) to an \u2018insider looking out,\u2019 so to speak, I have a unique perspective that I have chosen to express with this album.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding the world from Curtis\u2019 perspective will no doubt prompt listeners not only to enjoy some of the most inventive, hard-hitting jazz they\u2019ve heard in a long time, but also to start Googling and brushing up on their social history. Four of his five originals are devoted to activists who gave their lives or livelihoods to the struggle for a better planet.\n\nThe dreamy and mystical, then percussively busier and bustling \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d is dedicated to the Standing Rock Sioux and all other indigenous people in the U.S., Canada and worldwide who are fighting for their rights to exist without encroachment. Ranging from lilting and simmering gospel to fiery bebop to an electric piano, organ and affected saxophone jam, \u201cNever Forget What They Did to Fred Hampton\u201d reflects both the forward thinking, socially conscious vision and the violent chaos that beset the Black Panther movement. Curtis composed the track on the anniversary of the FBI\u2019s assassination of Hampton, one of the movement\u2019s young, charismatic leaders who was head of the Chicago Chapter of the Party when he was gunned down in December 1969, at the age of 21. \u201cHis murder must be remembered and understood as we celebrate his message and vision of a brighter future for African Americans and all people devoted to justice and solidarity,\u201d the drummer says.\n\nThe emotional, deeply soulful ballad \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d is dedicated to Brazilian politician Marielle Franco, who was the leading voice in her country against police brutality and corruption before her assassination in March 2018. \u201cBlues 4 Colin K\u201d is a lively, high energy blues romp with a hypnotic soul transporting melody designed to shed light on former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who like Muhammad Ali fifty years before him, was robbed of his best years of competing for taking a stand (via taking a knee during the national anthem) against injustice and the oppression of Black people. Curtis balances the heavy themes with a personal statement of a different kind, the romantic and whimsical \u201cWaltz 4 Meg,\u201d dedicated to his wife Megan, whom he has known for over half his life.\n\nCurtis, who started playing drums at 12 and picked up piano at 16, grew up in Winnipeg, the son of a piano teacher mother and saxophonist father. While he grew up hearing jazz around the house, Curtis opted instead for bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Yet his mindset shifted quickly from hard rock to jazz when he heard Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers, particularly their 1963 album Caravan. \u201cI liked John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman and started learning with records I checked out of the public library,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was something about Blakey being a thunderous drummer and bandleader that tapped into my spirit and made me realize I wanted to be that kind of musician as well. Why jazz? Its sense of freedom just spoke to me, and I think that\u2019s what attracts a lot of people. There are no limits. I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to interact with a lot of New York musicians when I was in high school and college, and that played a large part as well.\u201d\n\nEstablishing himself on the NY jazz scene, Curtis has played in the bands of Philip Harper, Craig Harris, rising star saxophonist Braxton Cook and renowned pianist Marc Cary (who both make major contributions to the album) while headlining major jazz festivals in Canada and several in the U.S. He has also performed with four NEA Jazz Masters: Candido Camero, Dave Liebman, Jimmy Owens and Kenny Barron. A recipient of several awards and scholarships, in 2014 Nowosad performed at the Bimhuis in Amsterdam as a winner of the Keep an Eye Jazz Award. He was twice selected to participate in Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC and also attended the Banff Jazz Workshop.\n\nCurtis is an alumnus of the University of Manitoba, where he studied with Terreon Gully and Quincy Davis, and holds a master\u2019s degree from Manhattan School of Music, where he was a student of John Riley, and performed with the multi-Grammy nominated MSM Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra, under the direction of Bobby Sanabria. He currently serves on MSM\u2019s Precollege jazz faculty and is an endorser of Canopus Drums.\n\n\u201cFrom a purely musical standpoint, this album was creatively fulfilling because it was the first time that I had handled all of the audio editing myself, which was quite a task because there are so many layers, from horns to vocals to electronic sounds,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cIt was a challenge to figure out how to bring the right people into unique configurations for each song so that we could best bring their artistry to life, and we were still adding guests a week before the recording session. It was going to be a purely instrumental project until Marc and I talked about adding vocals \u2013 which led us to bring the incomparable Michael Mayo and Brianna Thomas on board.\n\n\u201cThematically, my feeling is that if we never deal with history we will never know how to grow and move forward as a society\u201d he adds. \u201cOne of the problems in the U.S, Canada and many other countries is that we don\u2019t do nearly enough to understand that history and take the necessary steps toward dismantling systems of oppression. Jazz has always inherently reflected the times it\u2019s created in, but often when it\u2019s institutionalized in colleges and university programs, we tend to focus on jazz history alone as opposed to the American and world history it emerges from. I hope this project will inspire listeners to read up on the different icons I was inspired to write about, and open their eyes and ears to not only what was going on in previous generations but also today. By better understanding those important connections, we can collectively begin to question all the societal structures around us.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Mickey Utley Band", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8488718.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Norwegian Cruise Lines - Bliss", "moreBioInfo": "Mickey Utley Band", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "EG Vines", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9198242.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Roots Rock, Americana, Soul, Folk Rock", "Time": "4:30 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Having burst onto Nashville\u2019s bustling Americana scene with his debut EP in 2018, E.G.

Reflecting over its troubled past, he sinks into the still lingering scars of the civil rights era and slavery. \u201cIt\u2019s me going back after not having been there for a while and looking at how everything has changed physically with the campus, but there\u2019s still underlying problems,\u201d he states.\n\nInspired by America\u2019s gun violence epidemic, Vines ruminates over his desensitization towards news of mass shootings throughout the melancholy Americana of \u201cFeel Again\u201d. Mournful pedal steel sweeps throughout the song as Vines doles out its passionate and all-too-honest message. He flips the blues grit dial to 11 in \u201cBlood In The Streets\u201d, a favorite of his live shows and one that he was especially excited to record in the studio. \u201cThat was a fun one to record,\u201d Vines recalls. \u201cIt really came to life in the studio with the group. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s rock, it\u2019s loose.\u201d Closing track \u201cPoor Man, Rich Man\u201d sees Vines leaning into a heaping helping of gospel-tinged soul to contrast very different upbringings. As he sinks further into the song\u2019s swampy groove, Vines ultimately settles on a message of love, expressing, \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel right / then try to hold each other tight.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Jonesboro, Arkansas, Vines first cut his teeth as the frontman to an alternative rock band in high school. Since then, he\u2019s become a respected name amongst the greats of Nashville\u2019s expansive roots rock cabal. First moving to Music City in 2009, Vines quickly became a hot commodity for his work with The Bandoliers, a respected facet of the blues and Southern rock scene in the mid-2010s. The band released their last album in 2015, at which point Vines acted on the urge to go solo.\n\nDropping his debut EP, Conversation\u2014produced by Eddie Spear (Brandi Carlile, The Delta Saints)\u2014in 2018, the rocker gave listeners their first taste of a more thoughtful, nuanced side to his songwriting. It was a much longer process than he was used to, with Spear acting as a songwriting mentor more so than a traditional producer, scrapping Vines\u2019 initial batch of tunes and pushing him to hone his craft before releasing new material. The finished product was worth the wait, and showcased Vines\u2019 newfound, stirringly eclectic Americana sound.\n\nAll in all, Family Business is an album about family, but not solely the nuclear sense. Vines has a knack for injecting his thoughts on hot button issues and well-crafted life anecdotes into his music as any bonafide roots rocker should, but his vision is wider in scope. In communicating his ideas on love, loss, and life, he instantly creates a connection with listeners that feels universally relatable and utterly personal. To this end, he aims to make us\u2014one and all, as humankind\u2014feel like family.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "240 W 35th St, New York, NY 10001", "Artist": "Anyone's-Guess", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.991777, 40.752246], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Jack Doyle's", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Rewired For Autism\nCocktails for a cause!"}, {"Address": "111 E 48th St, New York, NY 10017", "Artist": "The Cafe Society", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8283629.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.973666, 40.755508], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Swing, Blues, Jazz Blues, Jazz Instrument", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "The Parlour", "moreBioInfo": "In the 1940s, there was one integrated jazz club in New York City where all the greats played: Caf\u00e9 Society in the West Village.\n\nToday, The Caf\u00e9 Society is a group of jazz musicians in Brooklyn, NY, led by bassist Jim Greene, saxophonist Justin Flynn, and vocalist Emily Wade Adams.

Sadly, I attempted violin as a young child and was brutally bad. My parents had some how had me listening to classical music at that time which probably explains the violin attempt. Then a miracle happened\u2026First, the Beatles arrived so, bye bye classical & then my aunt who was buying a new piano (the wealthier end of the family) offered me her old one. I\u2019m 8 1/2 so I was still agreeable to anything so I promised to take lessons and really work at it.\n\nI lied\u2026After a year and a half I quit\u2026..until I discovered Elton John. That was it! I was determined to be a musician. In the late 70\u2019s I joined a fairly succesful 50\u2019s/60\u2019s band called Slick. I played 6 nights a week and worked full time at a department store as a stock man (person in this politically correct universe). Exhaustion wasn\u2019t considered. I went to gigs with a thermos of tea and lemon since I was always sick. This lasted until the early 80\u2019s. I joined a band called Loose Change which (under my direction) played anything from the 1960\u2019s- whatever was current. That lasted 12 years. Many years of putting my ears in harms way and breathing in way to much bar smoke told me it was time to quit. This was somewhere around 1993/94 (I don\u2019t remember). The next time I played live was in 2004 at my local block party. That\u2019s what I needed to get the itch to play again but, I was working in retail at Sam Ash Music and simply had no time to gig. In 2007 I was offered a better job which offered me a 9-5 existence. The economy turned sour and earning extra cash became a priority. And then it happened\u2026.I walked into a local Italian restaurant called Vera\u2019s Trattoria to pick up a pizza and lo and behold (fancy words ehh?) a piano player was pumping out Jazz licks. Can you imagine? Live music! I decided to approach the owner to see if I could score a gig. He decided to try me the following week. I was hired as a permanent fixture on Saturday nights. Thus The Richie G Review was born. \u201cA one man band Piano/vocals using backing tracks and a voice harmonizer to create a full band sound.

Over 500 tunes and counting\u2013 Booking email onemanbandrichieg@gmail.com .\u201d I played at Vera\u2019s for 14 months and then a new owner took over. He decided that entertainment was unnecessary. I got to work recording a CD of covers and creating business cards. The hard work paid off! I\u2019m a permanent Wednesday night fixture at the Woodcliff lake Hilton as well as sprinkling in various weekend gigs.\n\nRidgewood Street Fair 2013-2014\n\n\n\n392561_413258562028352_398683286819213_1318553_160572558_nRIDGEWOOD\n\n\n\nChapter 2- Ginger Martini was Born Right around St Patty\u2019s Day of 2012, I was performing at the Elm Street Grill in Oakland NJ. I was approached by my soon to be partner Wendy Kelly. I was on the floor wiring up my equipment as she, asked me questions about what I do (kind of music, etc). I was excited believing that I was going to be hired for a private party. During the break, she handed me her card.It turned out she was interested in joining me. I wasn\u2019t looking but, I agreed to see what she sounded like at my rehearsal space (haha my basement). Three songs later I was convinced. We sounded great together. A week later, we had 50 plus songs ready for prime time. She joined me at The Paris Inn in Wayne NJ. Ever since we perform around 50% of my gigs together and get an incredible response. Wendy started a seasoned veteran of the Broadway, Standard, and Country Genres. She has since dragged me into her country word as I dragged her into my pop/rock world.

The album was born from a commitment to write a song per week for 52 weeks. Through this discipline of writing and seeking to find God's beauty and hope in the joy and the pain, PJ stepped into his stride. \"Set Me Free\" is a prayerful realization that God desires to set our hearts free from our hurt and difficulty while \"It Is You\" reminds us that Christ is the true desire of our hearts.\n\n\n\nGrace Beyond Strength, which was released in June 2012, landed him a spot as an iTunes New & Noteworthy Featured Artist.

Collective Soul helped shape and define alternative rock with lots of guitars and attitude.\n\nCollective Soul was formed in the small town of Stockbridge, Ga., in the early 1990\u2019s. The group consists of principal songwriter and frontman Ed Roland (lead vocals/keyboards/guitars), Dean Roland (rhythm guitarist), Will Turpin (bassist), Johnny Rabb (drummer) and Jesse Triplett (lead guitarist).\n\nThe band\u2019s debut album Hints Allegations and Things Left Unsaid was originally released in 1993 on Atlanta indie label Rising Storm. The album was a collection of Ed Roland\u2019s demos that spread like fire through the college circuit and the popularity of the album locally spurred Atlantic to pick it up for a major-label release. \u201cShine\u201d quickly became the rock anthem played across the country on radio and on MTV and set the band up for an arena tour with Aerosmith.\n\nTheir self-titled second album was a triple platinum juggernaut and would define their sound with guitar driven songs and passionate vocals. The album produced five Top Ten hits and two of the singles\u2013\u201cDecember\u201d and \u201cThe World I Know\u201d\u2013charted on the Top 40, which spoke to the band\u2019s crossover appeal.\n\nIn 1997, the band went back into the studio to produce their third album Disciplined Breakdown. The album earned Collective Soul a spot on the charts at #16, and produced hit singles \u201cPrecious Declaration,\u201d which was #1 four weeks; and \u201cListen,\u201d #1 for five weeks), which also charted on the Billboard Hot 100, at #65 and #72, respectively.\n\nCritically acclaimed Dosage was released in 1999 and produced the hit singles \u201cRun\u201d and \u201cHeavy,\u201d which would take Billboard\u2019s top spot for a record 15 weeks.\n\nCollective Soul\u2019s fifth album, Blender, was released in 2000 and, according to Rolling Stone, \u201csimply shreds with unapologetic classic-rock energy.\u201d The album went gold and produced smash hits including \u201cWhy, Part 2,\u201d \u201cVent,\u201d and duet with Elton John \u201cPerfect Day.\u201d\n\nThe band released a greatest hits collection in 2001 entitled 7even Year Itch: Greatest Hits 1994-2001. Following that album, Collective Soul recognized the music industry was evolving and was one of the first bands to create their own label to have more independence and control over their sound. And, in 2004, that label El Music Group released the dynamic album Youth. From the Ground Up (2005) and Home (2006) were also released under the El Music Group label, along with a DVD featuring their live concert with the Atlanta City Youth Orchestra.\n\nIn 2007, the band teamed with Target to be the exclusive retailer for the band\u2019s next album Afterwords, from Roadrunner Records. This arrangement was one of the first such exclusive album release deals to be made by a band with a sole retailer. The album was loved by fans and opened at #25 on the Billboard Comprehensive Albums Chart and was #5 on the Billboard Top Internet Albums Chart.\n\nIn 2008, Collective Soul found themselves on the soundtrack for the film Twilight with \u201cTremble for My Beloved\u201d from Dosage. Following the film\u2019s success, the song\u2019s exposure earned Collective Soul new popularity and connected with a younger audience.\n\nCollective Soul released their self-titled eighth studio album in 2009. The single \u201cStaring Down\u201d charted at #18 on Billboard\u2018s Adult Top 40. The album debuted at #24 on the Billboard 200 and the single \u201cYou\u201d also charted on the Billboard Adult Top 40.\n\nCollective Soul\u2019s music has often been covered by well-known artists. In 2001, Dolly Parton won a Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance with her cover version of \u201cShine\u201d. In further recognition of their artistic achievement, Collective Soul was inducted into The Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 2009. Additionally, as the principal songwriter for the group, Roland was individually inducted as a songwriter in 2014.\n\nThe platinum-selling rock band is readying for the Fall 2015 release of their long-awaited ninth album, See What You Started by Continuing, followed by a tour to celebrate the band\u2019s 21st birthday. Ed Roland says the band took some time off, came back energized about what they are and always have been: a rock band. \u201cThis is the best and most rocking album we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s one of those, \u2018just sit back and rock\u2019 records.\u201d\n\nCollective Soul continues to rock quite simply for the love of music. The band that helped sonically define alternative rock is more focused and energized than ever. And as Ed Roland puts it, fans can continue to expect \u201clots of guitars and a fun attitude from the southern gentlemen of rock and roll.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "217 E Houston St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Brent Cowles", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9426996.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.986751, 40.722165], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Mercury Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "\"I wanted to write a song that wasn\u2019t sad or negative. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love a solid heartbreak tune, but I had never written anything else.\" admits Brent Cowles, as he described the impetus for \"High to Low\", his brand new single available October 18th.\n\n\"I wanted to make people dance and smile\" he continued. So Brent locked himself in an LA studio with producer and songwriter Lewis Pesacov, of Fool's Gold fame, and they put together the funky foundations for \"High To Low.\u201d Brent and Lewis built the song around the bass-line. The result is exuberant, good time rock n roll. Says Brent, \"It\u2019s a song about dancing like everyone is watching, and you don\u2019t give a damn.\"\n\nBlurring the lines between boisterous rock, R&B, and contemplative folk, Brent\u2019s infectious voice and knack for melody seem to swing effortlessly from quavering intimacy to a soulful roar as they soar atop his exuberant, explosive arrangements.\n\nGrowing up, Cowles first discovered the power of his voice singing hymns at his father\u2019s church in Colorado Springs. Having a pastor for a parent meant heavy involvement in religious life, but Cowles never quite seemed to fit in. At 16 he fell in love with secular music; at 17 he recorded his first proper demos in a friend\u2019s basement; at 18 he was married; at 19 he was divorced. Meanwhile, what began as a solo musical project blossomed into the critically acclaimed band You Me & Apollo, which quickly took over his life. The Denver Post raved that the group created \u201csome of the most exciting original music in Colorado,\u201d while Westword proclaimed that their live show was a \u201cclinic in roots rock mixed with old-school swing and blues,\u201d and Seattle NPR station KEXP hailed \u201cCowles\u2019 Otis Redding and Sam Cooke inspired vocals.\u201d The band released two albums and toured nationally before they called it quits and amicably went their separate ways.\n\nThe parting was a necessary but difficult one for Cowles. In the ensuing months and years, he would find himself alone more than ever before, at one point living out of his Chevy Tahoe just to make ends meet. But rather than break him, the experience only strengthened his resolve. \"High to Low\u201d gives the listener a real sense of Brent\u2019s current mood.

Organized by post-bop pianist Marc Cary, The Harlem Sessions (originating at Gin Fizz and now based at Smoke Jazz Club) invites musicians, poets, artists, philosophers and dancers to build and explore a new common repertoire with original ensemble arrangements. A key player in galvanizing this fresh and dynamic sense of cultural awareness, drummer/composer Curtis Nowosad was on hand anchoring the groove every week during the gathering\u2019s first years \u2013 and he\u2019s still part of the action today.\n\nHaving made his home in Harlem since 2013 when he was working on his masters at the Manhattan School of Music, the 31-year-old Canadian native emerges as a powerful musical force for social justice on a groundbreaking self-titled jazz and blues-driven collection that illuminates past and present American history while creating some profound history of its own.\n\nWhile it may seem curious to some that Curtis would self-title his third overall album, it\u2019s reflective of a desire to share his deeper core identity. He imparts his truth and the issues that have long mattered to him via five impactful originals and edgy, intensely rendered versions of three thematically related pieces: Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s \u201cHome is Where the Hatred Is,\u201d Skip James\u2019 \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Co-produced with Cary, it\u2019s also the drummer\u2019s first collection to feature the explosive and intuitive chemistry of his NY-based ensemble that has held court in NYC everywhere from Smalls, Fat Cat and Rockwood Music Hall to The Jazz Standard and full week residencies at Dizzy\u2019s Club at Jazz at Lincoln Center.\n\nThe group includes Duane Eubanks (trumpet), Braxton Cook (alto sax), Andrew Renfroe (guitar), Jonathan Thomas (piano, Fender Rhodes, organ) and Luke Sellick (bass). Guests include Corey Wallace (trombone), Matthew Whitaker (organ) and vocalists Michael Mayo (whose beautiful wordless vocal brings a rich humanity to \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d and \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d) and Brianna Thomas, who brings the burning soul-blues angles and edges to \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Cary himself guests on Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer and synth.\n\nCurtis laid the foundation for this current release with two previous critically acclaimed collections, his debut The Skeptic & the Cynic (which spent two weeks at #1 on the Canadian Jazz charts and featured Grammy-nominated pianist Taylor Eigsti) and the WCMA-winning and JUNO-nominated Dialectics (Cellar Live), which made DownBeat Magazine\u2019s \u201cBest of 2015\u201d list, reached #3 on the CMJ jazz charts and spent ten weeks on the JazzWeek charts. The Skeptic & the Cynic was comprised mostly of cover songs by Michael Jackson, Bob Marley, Joni Mitchell, Pink Floyd, Black Star and 2Pac, along with two originals. Recorded in Winnipeg in 2014 after Curtis\u2019 first year at Manhattan School of Music, Dialectics featured mostly original music along with arrangements of compositions by Thelonious Monk, Wayne Shorter and the jazz standard \u201cI Remember You.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recorded my first two albums in my hometown of Winnipeg,\u201d Curtis says, \u201cwith a band made up of my former teachers from the University of Manitoba. Those works were geared towards my growth as a musician and gaining a deeper knowledge of jazz. Stylistically, the new one is definitely a departure from those, yet is a much better reflection of who I am and the themes and issues that matter to me. It\u2019s more important to me than just, \u2018here are some new songs.\u2019 These social issues were always simmering in my mind, and I was very vocal about them among the people I know and love, but it took a while before I was able to convey my feelings musically.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ve lived a lot of life between the release of Dialectics and now,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019ve gained a great deal of life and musical experience and been through a lot, so it felt appropriate to self-title the album. The music is very personal to me. I have gained a lot of insight living in Harlem for the past 5 1/2 years, and as a European-descended practitioner of Black American Music, I feel it is my duty to approach this music and these themes in a respectful, earnest and serious manner. I also feel that as I have made the transition from being an \u2018outsider looking in\u2019 (being from Canada) to an \u2018insider looking out,\u2019 so to speak, I have a unique perspective that I have chosen to express with this album.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding the world from Curtis\u2019 perspective will no doubt prompt listeners not only to enjoy some of the most inventive, hard-hitting jazz they\u2019ve heard in a long time, but also to start Googling and brushing up on their social history. Four of his five originals are devoted to activists who gave their lives or livelihoods to the struggle for a better planet.\n\nThe dreamy and mystical, then percussively busier and bustling \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d is dedicated to the Standing Rock Sioux and all other indigenous people in the U.S., Canada and worldwide who are fighting for their rights to exist without encroachment. Ranging from lilting and simmering gospel to fiery bebop to an electric piano, organ and affected saxophone jam, \u201cNever Forget What They Did to Fred Hampton\u201d reflects both the forward thinking, socially conscious vision and the violent chaos that beset the Black Panther movement. Curtis composed the track on the anniversary of the FBI\u2019s assassination of Hampton, one of the movement\u2019s young, charismatic leaders who was head of the Chicago Chapter of the Party when he was gunned down in December 1969, at the age of 21. \u201cHis murder must be remembered and understood as we celebrate his message and vision of a brighter future for African Americans and all people devoted to justice and solidarity,\u201d the drummer says.\n\nThe emotional, deeply soulful ballad \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d is dedicated to Brazilian politician Marielle Franco, who was the leading voice in her country against police brutality and corruption before her assassination in March 2018. \u201cBlues 4 Colin K\u201d is a lively, high energy blues romp with a hypnotic soul transporting melody designed to shed light on former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who like Muhammad Ali fifty years before him, was robbed of his best years of competing for taking a stand (via taking a knee during the national anthem) against injustice and the oppression of Black people. Curtis balances the heavy themes with a personal statement of a different kind, the romantic and whimsical \u201cWaltz 4 Meg,\u201d dedicated to his wife Megan, whom he has known for over half his life.\n\nCurtis, who started playing drums at 12 and picked up piano at 16, grew up in Winnipeg, the son of a piano teacher mother and saxophonist father. While he grew up hearing jazz around the house, Curtis opted instead for bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Yet his mindset shifted quickly from hard rock to jazz when he heard Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers, particularly their 1963 album Caravan. \u201cI liked John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman and started learning with records I checked out of the public library,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was something about Blakey being a thunderous drummer and bandleader that tapped into my spirit and made me realize I wanted to be that kind of musician as well. Why jazz? Its sense of freedom just spoke to me, and I think that\u2019s what attracts a lot of people. There are no limits. I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to interact with a lot of New York musicians when I was in high school and college, and that played a large part as well.\u201d\n\nEstablishing himself on the NY jazz scene, Curtis has played in the bands of Philip Harper, Craig Harris, rising star saxophonist Braxton Cook and renowned pianist Marc Cary (who both make major contributions to the album) while headlining major jazz festivals in Canada and several in the U.S. He has also performed with four NEA Jazz Masters: Candido Camero, Dave Liebman, Jimmy Owens and Kenny Barron. A recipient of several awards and scholarships, in 2014 Nowosad performed at the Bimhuis in Amsterdam as a winner of the Keep an Eye Jazz Award. He was twice selected to participate in Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC and also attended the Banff Jazz Workshop.\n\nCurtis is an alumnus of the University of Manitoba, where he studied with Terreon Gully and Quincy Davis, and holds a master\u2019s degree from Manhattan School of Music, where he was a student of John Riley, and performed with the multi-Grammy nominated MSM Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra, under the direction of Bobby Sanabria. He currently serves on MSM\u2019s Precollege jazz faculty and is an endorser of Canopus Drums.\n\n\u201cFrom a purely musical standpoint, this album was creatively fulfilling because it was the first time that I had handled all of the audio editing myself, which was quite a task because there are so many layers, from horns to vocals to electronic sounds,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cIt was a challenge to figure out how to bring the right people into unique configurations for each song so that we could best bring their artistry to life, and we were still adding guests a week before the recording session. It was going to be a purely instrumental project until Marc and I talked about adding vocals \u2013 which led us to bring the incomparable Michael Mayo and Brianna Thomas on board.\n\n\u201cThematically, my feeling is that if we never deal with history we will never know how to grow and move forward as a society\u201d he adds. \u201cOne of the problems in the U.S, Canada and many other countries is that we don\u2019t do nearly enough to understand that history and take the necessary steps toward dismantling systems of oppression. Jazz has always inherently reflected the times it\u2019s created in, but often when it\u2019s institutionalized in colleges and university programs, we tend to focus on jazz history alone as opposed to the American and world history it emerges from. I hope this project will inspire listeners to read up on the different icons I was inspired to write about, and open their eyes and ears to not only what was going on in previous generations but also today. By better understanding those important connections, we can collectively begin to question all the societal structures around us.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "327 Bowery, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Spanking Charlene", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.991787, 40.725751], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Bowery Electric", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Spanking Charlene Record Release Party!

On the title track, Maddock wants an extra 50 years to try \u201cacting, white-water rafting,\u201d \u201csome illegal substances,\u201d even having a kid or three. \u201cI\u2019ve Been There Too,\u201d built around an indelible guitar riff, shows Maddock\u2019s knack for instrumental hooks as well as lyrical ones. \u201cDon\u2019t Go Lonely,\u201d in a well-timed moment of levity, hints at reggae with dub bass, bubbling organ and the chorus\u2019s entreaty to \u201cgo get high, go get found, go crazy on this town / don\u2019t go lonely.\u201d\n\nAfter fronting the Columbia Records band Wood, whose debut \u2018Songs From Stamford Hill\u2019 was featured prominently on TV shows such as \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek,\u201d Maddock moved from England to New York City in 2003. His 2009 album \u2018Sunrise On Avenue C\u2019 won a New York Music Award for Best Americana Album, while follow-up 'Wake Up And Dream' ranked among the top albums of 2011 in WFUV's (NYC) Listener Poll. He's performed with Bruce Springsteen, Willie Nile, Aaron Comess (Spin Doctors) and David Immergluck (Counting Crows), sang on an album with Susan McKeown, and is a resident artist at Rockwood Music Hall. According to radio legend Vin Scelsa, Maddock's \"heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely crafted\" music \"touches the soul.\"\n\nA seasoned live performer, Maddock will play songs from 'Another Life' at shows in New York City and across the Northeast this summer, as well as at festivals in the U.S. and Europe.", "otherInfo": "James Maddock - Rockwood Stage 2"}, {"Address": "327 Bowery, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "heap", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.991787, 40.725751], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Bowery Electric", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Spanking Charlene Record Release Party!

Name another band that can play a country festival with Florida Georgia Line or Keith Urban one day and then jet off to the U.K. to share the stage with Metallica or Slayer the next.\n\nOn the Nashville trio\u2019s long-awaited fourth album, they push their country, hard rock and southern rock bona fides to the limit while also introducing elements of funk and soul. The result is a dirty, greasy and hard-hitting sound that can only belong to The Cadillac Three \u2014 one they've christened COUNTRY FUZZ.\n\nBut COUNTRY FUZZ isn\u2019t just the name of the group\u2019s new album. It\u2019s also their aesthetic, the phrase that best sums up both the music and lifestyle of singer-guitarist Jaren Johnston, drummer Neil Mason and lap-steel alchemist Kelby Ray, three guys who have become closer than brothers while growing up and playing in bands together in America\u2019s most buzzed-about music city.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been COUNTRY FUZZ forever,\u201d says Jaren. \u201cWhen I think of Southern rock, I think of Lynyrd Skynyrd. When I think of country, I think Garth Brooks. This record and this band are all of that. But it\u2019s also ZZ Top and Jerry Reed. It\u2019s Medeski Martin & Wood and Prince. There\u2019s no better way to describe who we are than Country Fuzz.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to land on something that is your own thing, but we\u2019re proud to say we did that,\u201d Neil says of the band\u2019s sound. \u201cIt works for us in any direction that we\u2019re going. COUNTRY FUZZ is anything from a stripped-down country ballad to a sludgy, riff-heavy rock song. And it\u2019s also country-funk.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve matured as musicians and as a band,\u201d says Kelby, whose lap steel lays down the bass line for The Cadillac Three and is largely responsible for the trio\u2019s one-of-a-kind vibe. \u201cOur sound is second nature to us and that only comes from playing together for as long as we have.\u201d\n\nAveraging 140 shows a year, The Cadillac Three are perpetually burning up the highway, Traveling 40 out of 52 weeks. It\u2019s grueling, committed work, but Jaren, Neil and Kelby wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Nor would the band\u2019s fans, who make pilgrimages to see The Cadillac Three and will often catch an entire weekend\u2019s worth of gigs. To reward that devotion, the group was adamant about giving their fans as many songs as they could on COUNTRY FUZZ.\n\nThe 16 tracks on the record touch on all eras of the band\u2019s history, from the swampy stomp of their 2012 self-titled debut and the power chords of 2016\u2019s BURY ME IN MY BOOTS to the polish of 2017\u2019s LEGACY.\n\nThe trio wrote much of COUNTRY FUZZ, which they also produced, with their live show in mind. \u201dAs many shows as we play, we still switch our sets up every night. We really try to do something different, and now we have 16 new songs that we can add in,\u201d says Neil.\n\nWith its serpentine lick and Jaren\u2019s thick-as-syrup delivery, \u201cSlow Rollin\u201d echoes the band\u2019s most-played live song, the fan favorite \u201cTennessee Mojo.\u201d The group wrote \u201cSlow Rollin\u201d on the bus before a show in Las Vegas, with Jaren plugging in and rattling the back lounge. \u201cI had the amp in the back of the bus, and when you turn it to 11, it\u2019s loud as fuck,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI wrote that riff and was like, \u2018How the hell didn\u2019t we write \u2018Slow Rollin\u2019 yet?\u2019 It\u2019s such an obvious TC3 song.\u201d\n\nSo is \u201cHard Out Here for a Country Boy,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek list of all the things that good ol\u2019 boys deal with on a daily basis while trying to live \u201cthat slow life in a real fast world.\u201d Chris Janson sings a verse and adds harmonica, while the band\u2019s recent tourmate Travis Tritt lends his unmistakable voice to the commanding choruses.\n\n\u201cHeat\u201d is equally hard-hitting. A fiery salute to a lady who\u2019s as combustible as \u201cin a bar fight with gasoline,\u201d it slinks along on Neil\u2019s rhythmic beat before exploding in a noisy breakdown that blends Kelby\u2019s steel with Jaren\u2019s guitar. Even so, Neil calls it more of a vocal song.\u201dIt\u2019s a chance for Jaren to show off his voice and the way that it\u2019s matured,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile the band still sing about cold beer, hell-raising and Saturday nights, the idea of maturity underscores all of COUNTRY FUZZ. The Cadillac Three have never been as cohesive a unit as they are here, with all three musicians seemingly sharing the same musically tattooed brain. When Kelby adds subtle slide in the stunning closer \u201cAfter Last Call\u201d to accentuate Jaren\u2019s delivery, Neil instinctively knows to pull back and give the notes room to breathe. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been pretty good at that,\u201d says Jaren. \u201cBut we\u2019re all focusing more on our instruments. I care more about playing guitar now than I ever have, and I\u2019ve been honing that. And Kelby is figuring out different ways to make his lap steel work in the songs, especially with the funkier stuff.\u201d\n\nThat new funky direction is readily apparent in the devil disco of \u201cThe Jam\u201d and on the swerving \u201cBlue El Camino,\u201d two tracks on COUNTRY FUZZ that point to the future of The Cadillac Three. \u201cWhen we started playing \u201cThe Jam\u201d at soundcheck, I used the lap steel to build a bass line and glue together Jaren\u2019s funky guitar,\u201d says Kelby. \u201cIt\u2019s a cool new sound for us\u201d\n\n\u201cThe funkier aspects of this record is where we\u2019re wanting to go, but with big ol\u2019 country hooks,\u201d adds Jaren, \u201cbecause that is what we\u2019re addicted to from growing up in Nashville. We love country songwriting and huge hooks.\u201d\n\nStill, The Cadillac Three refuse to be categorized. Listen to the song \u201cLabels,\u201d a brilliant, succinct slice of songwriting from Neil with Corey Crowder and Luke Dick, that asks, \u201cI wonder what you see when you look at me?\u201d It\u2019s a pulsing anthem, with Jaren repeating, \u201cNobody wants to be labeled,\u201d and stands as one of the band\u2019s most incisive songs.\n\nAlong with the heavy-funk explorations, Country Fuzz marks a first for the group: \u201cBack Home\u201d is the only song the group has ever recorded that at least one of its members didn\u2019t write. Co-written by Craig Wiseman, James McNair and Chris Tompkins, the tune is a straight-ahead blast of country-rock nostalgia and proved irresistible to The Cadillac Three.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine anyone doing \u201cBack Home\u201d more than I could us doing it,\u201d says Neil. \u201cThat\u2019s the true test of what is or isn\u2019t a Cadillac Three song.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe story was so good and the syncopation of the lyrics flowed so well that I knew we could make it work,'\u201c says Jaren. \u201cThat song is a hit, but it\u2019s still very much us.\u201d\n\nWithout a doubt, The Cadillac Three know exactly who they are \u2014 and they say the same is true of their fans. It\u2019s all one big community that\u2019s summed up by Country Fuzz. The trio is even launching a clothing line under the Country Fuzz name.\n\n\u201cThe Cadillac Three are at a place now where we\u2019re not scared to take chances and see what we can actually become,\u201d says Jaren.\n\n\u201cThe path we\u2019re on is the natural way we do things, making each album and idea bigger than the last one,\u201d Kelby says. \u201cIt's like a pitstop on a motorcycle ride, where you stop here, grab a beer, look around, learn from it, and then keep riding.\u201d\n\nAnd COUNTRY FUZZ provides the soundtrack for that ride.\n\n\u201cThis album has a little bit of everything, and you can see where we started and where we\u2019re going,\u201d Jaren says. \u201cThe Cadillac Three is evolving in a badass new way.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "319 Frost St, Brooklyn, NY", "Artist": "Tove Lo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9239039.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.938692, 40.719277], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Dirrrrty Pop!, International, Swedish, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Steel", "moreBioInfo": "Get my new single #CoolGirl out NOW!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3454 Broadway, New York, NY 10031", "Artist": "Lee O.

Michael Simone, the songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist behind the band, has immersed himself in music since he was a teenager, and his varied passions and interests\u2014from Prince to Led Zeppelin, The Cure to Waylon Jennings, and Jeff Buckley to The Smiths, everything has culminated to produce a record that sounds like \u201870s alt-rock while maintaining a timeless story of heartbreak and trying to find one\u2019s place in the world. Even before Ocean Carolina, Simone was part of several successful bands and projects\u2014including playing guitar and bass for Mercury / Polygram recording artist The Veldt, fronting Seems So Bright, and selling roughly 250,000 units as an electronic producer under the moniker of Lovesky\u2014but all of his connections seemed to have been building towards this band. Featuring Tony Leone (Chris Robinson Brotherhood / Levon Helm / Phil Lesh), Jon Graboff (formerly of Ryan Adams and the Cardinals and pedal steel player for Willie Nelson, Noel Gallagher, and others), guitarist Dave Wanamaker (Expanding Man / Loveless) and Simone\u2019s life-long friend Alex Cox, Ocean Carolina features many accomplished studio and stage musicians. Using all of the techniques he\u2019s learned from his career\u2014from production, keyboards, synth, rhythm, guitar, and earnest songwriting\u2014Simone began the recording process for Maudlin Days, a record that has more in common with \u201870s alt-rock or Southern rock than anything else. The songs are sincere and honest, but they also capture the energy and spark of Ocean Carolina\u2019s live performances. \u201cFor the first time, I just wanted to be the guy who showed up in the studio with my guitar and played and sang my songs with a band and capture that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were lucky enough to get Jon Graboff involved as a producer and second guitar\u2026and we knocked out the entire thing in eleven days. Jon was adamant on making sure we stuck to the tradition of making albums the way they used to be made,\u201d Simone says. Michael\u2019s passion for music and songwriting shine through and combine to create a unique voice. \u201cIt was a whirlwind, and looking back, I can\u2019t believe we actually pulled it off,\u201d he says, but even this is a familiar tale: few musicians relax and trust their ability and process. Maudlin Days is an exercise in giving up control and allowing the music to be what it\u2019s meant to become. The single, \u201cIf It Burns out Bright,\u201d immediately mimics the energy and drive of something exploding. It\u2019s catchy and upbeat, and the direct, sweet lyrics help to contrast the inherent risk of violence in the title: \u201cEverything will be all right, darling blue / Even if it burns out bright, I have you.\u201d The combination of comforting phrases and vocals contrasted with catchy music is at once memorable and soothing. Even when discussing eternity and the end of time, Simone\u2019s songs are accessible and thoughtful. Other tracks like \u201cWords\u201d showcase the energy of their compressed recording time: though the actual rhythm is slower, the song doesn\u2019t lose any forward momentum: it kicks off with a wailing guitar part, and maintains that tension throughout. Simone\u2019s low, warm voice sings, \u201cSo I push the needle in the red / All the evil things I said arrive / Can I find the freedom in the wheel? / Got no words but I can make this right,\u201d and the listener is carried along with him, looking towards a better future. Each song seems to tell part of a story about looking at heartbreak and people\u2019s human failings. However, they all dare the narrator\u2014and the listener\u2014to triumph in spite of the pain, and to grow stronger, if not back together. Maudlin Days will be released on June 30, 2015.

With its dynamic sense of tension and cinematic mastery of mood, TAUK\u2019s all-instrumental blend of progressive rock, hip-hop, and jazz proves to be the perfect backdrop for such explorations, giving way to an album that\u2019s both powerfully hypnotic and intensely thought-provoking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all very much interested in A.I., and this idea of machines getting out of the hands of the people trying to control them,\u201d notes TAUK guitarist Matt Jalbert, whose bandmates include bassist Charlie Dolan, keyboardist Alric \u201cA.C.\u201d Carter, and drummer Isaac Teel. \u201cThis album felt like a good setting to tell that kind of story, but in a way where we could have fun with it and let the listener escape into a whole other world.\u201d\n\nEqually inspired by classic sci-fi like Blade Runner and more recent films like Ex Machina, Shapeshifter II: Outbreak embeds that narrative into TAUK\u2019s most sonically adventurous, emotionally expansive work to date. A continuation of their early-2018 EP Shapeshifter I: Construct, the new album picks up its predecessor\u2019s narrative thread with \u201cPrelude\u201d: a fantastically unsettling intro track whose frenetic keyboard work and chilling vocal samples set the tone for what\u2019s to come. \u201cThe idea is that in the EP you\u2019re seeing the construction of this being, and in the album you\u2019re seeing it break out and become something that you can\u2019t ignore anymore,\u201d Carter explains.\n\nFrom there, TAUK charge forward with the driving rhythms of \u201cRecreational Outrage\u201d (a track laced with the ominous throb of a robotic heartbeat), the futuristic soundscape and heady grooves of \u201cCMF 9000,\u201d the gauzy reverie and glorious chaos of \u201cCheckmate,\u201d and the bright melodies and soulful guitar sprawl of \u201cConvoy.\u201d One of the album\u2019s most mesmerizing moments, \u201cLet It Ride\u201d builds a brilliant tapestry from its luminous keyboard tones, kinetic guitar work, and kaleidoscopic rhythms. And on \u201cUpside Down,\u201d TAUK close out Shapeshifter II: Outbreak with a thrillingly epic burst of unfettered experimentalism.\n\nFree-flowing yet elaborately composed, Shapeshifter II: Outbreak came to life in collaboration with TAUK\u2019s longtime cohort Robert Carranza\u2014a Grammy Award-winning producer/mixer/engineer also known for his work The Mars Volta, Ozomatli, Marilyn Manson, and Taj Mahal. In a departure from their previous releases (including 2016\u2019s Sir Nebula), the band shunned the typical studio environment and holed up for weeks in a long-abandoned, century-old home that Teel describes as \u201cthe Jumanji house meets Addams Family meets Amityville Horror.\u201d Located in their homeland of Long Island, the house turned out to be the ideal spot for their makeshift studio, allowing for a creativity-enhancing seclusion. \u201cOverall the whole process was incredibly organic\u2014there were no constrictions as far as time or space, nothing ever felt forced,\u201d says Dolan. \u201cThere was a greater feeling of possibility, and it ended up being a really liberating experience for all of us.\u201d Jalbert adds: \u201cThe location definitely added to the vibe of everything we were going for. It was like we set up a laboratory in the middle of nowhere and shut off the rest of the world, which really helped get us into a specific headspace.\u201d\n\nTrue to its thematic terrain, Shapeshifter II: Outbreak endlessly blurs the boundaries between organic and electronic, with TAUK broadening their sonic palette to include a vast spectrum of synth sounds and programmed effects (such as those exquisitely eerie vocal samples heard in \u201cPrelude\u201d). And in sculpting the album\u2019s intricate arrangements, TAUK called on such esteemed musicians as The Naughty Horns, Ghost-Note\u2019s Nate Werth (a percussionist who\u2019s also played with David Crosby, Q-Tip, and Snarky Puppy), and Juan Alderete (longtime bassist for Racer X and The Mars Volta).\n\nThroughout Shapeshifter II: Outbreak, TAUK reveal the potent chemistry they discovered in childhood, when longtime friends Dolan, Jalbert, and Carter formed their first band in seventh grade. After playing together in various projects, the trio brought Teel into the fold in 2012, cementing the final lineup. Since then, TAUK have shared stages with acts like Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Widespread Panic, and Lettuce, appeared at festivals like Electric Forest and Bonnaroo, and earned acclaim from major outlets like the Washington Post (who praised TAUK for \u201ccreating a hard-charging, often melodic fusion that\u2014thanks to a penchant for improv\u2014offers limitless possibilities\u201d). As Teel points out, the band\u2019s incessant touring over the years has significantly strengthened their musical connection. \u201cThe four of us as individuals are all very animated souls in our own right,\u201d he says. \u201cWe each have our ideas and our perspectives, and when it all comes together, it creates this collective statement that takes on a life of its own.\u201d\n\nIn creating Shapeshifter II: Outbreak, TAUK made that statement more deliberate and impactful than ever before. But while several upcoming videos and the vibrant artwork of illustrator Raul Urias add a new dimension to the album\u2019s concept, the band purposely maintained a certain open-endedness in its execution. \u201cPeople tell us all kinds of stories about what our songs mean to them, and it\u2019s always cool to see how wide the gamut of those stories is,\u201d says Carter. \u201cWhat the song means to me might not be the same as what it means to you, but that\u2019s one of the great things about this whole experience. There\u2019s room for everyone to develop whatever narrative they want.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "10 Columbus Cir, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "Edward Simon", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8506585.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.982566, 40.768443], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Latin Jazz, Latin Jazz World Music, Venezuelan", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Dizzy's Club", "moreBioInfo": "Edward Simon was born in the coastal town of Punta Card\u00f3n, Venezuela where he grew up in a family of musicians surrounded by the sounds and rhythms of Latin and Caribbean music. The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\n\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\n\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\n\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers. While he may be considered as part of a new generation of \"multilingual\" musicians which have grown up studying classical, jazz and Latin American music, Edward is inventing a language that transcends any rigid genre.", "otherInfo": "Saxophonist Bobby Watson began his career with Art Blakey\u2019s Jazz Messengers, later becoming the musical director of the quintessential group.

Since 1991, the group has enthralled listeners with a singular sound that fearlessly crisscrosses genres. The trio\u2019s questing spirit drives it to explore the intersections between rock, jazz, classical, and world music. It even throws in the occasional surf or spaghetti Western tune for good measure.\n\nComprised of Bert Lams, Hideyo Moriya and Paul Richards, the group has established a unique, personal connection with audiences. In addition to dazzling musicianship and interplay, The California Guitar Trio's (CGT) shows are full of captivating stories and humor that enable concertgoers to feel like they're part of the music, not just spectators.

The trio\u2019s most recent release Komorebi showcases its acoustic side, with beautiful lush originals and innovative cover arrangements of Beatles, Beach Boys and more. Other highlights include Masterworks and album of classical works, with expansive takes on Bach, Beethoven, Arvo P\u00e4rt, and Schubert. Andromeda, which combines their many influences into a visionary album of original material; CG3+2, an exploration of kinetic rock territory in collaboration with bassist Tony Levin and drummer Pat Mastelotto; and Echoes, which reimagines timeless material by artists such as Mike Oldfield, Penguin Caf\u00e9 Orchestra, Pink Floyd, and Queen.\n\nThe trio\u2019s output has made a major global impact, having served as the soundtrack for Olympics coverage, and programs on CNN, CBS, NBC, and ESPN. They have fans in high places too: Nasa used their music to wake the crew aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour.\n\nCGT's lineup is truly the sum of its distinct parts: A Utah native now residing in Los Angeles, Paul Richards immersed himself in rock, blues, jazz, and folk during his early days and while attending The University of Utah\u2019s jazz guitar program. Bert Lams, originally from Belgium, graduated from the prestigious Royal Conservatory of Music in Brussels, specializing in classical guitar. Tokyo-born Hideyo Moriya began his guitar journey with surf music and British rock, before relocating to Boston to study at Berklee.\n\nAll three felt the call to push themselves to the limit by enrolling in Robert Fripp\u2019s challenging Guitar Craft courses, where they first met in 1987. They went on to tour together as part of Fripp\u2019s League of Crafty Guitarists, before forming the California Guitar Trio in Los Angeles four years later.\n\nRecently, the trio expanded its collaborative possibilities by working within a six-guitar format with the Montreal Guitar Trio. During these groundbreaking, highly-entertaining shows, the acts perform inventive arrangements of each other\u2019s repertoire, and new music for guitar sextet.\n\n26 years and 1,800+ gigs later, the CGT remains intensely committed to explore, evolve and communicate a wide-ranging musical worldview.\n\n- By Anil Prasad", "otherInfo": "CGT show"}, {"Address": "15 Vandam St, New York, NY 10013", "Artist": "Chronicle", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8464875.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00995, 40.72446], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Southern Gospel", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Huron Club At Soho Playhouse", "moreBioInfo": "We started out as friends, and now make up the group \"CHRONICLE\".

Formed in 2011 by NJ native, Rob Ferreira and New England veteran vocalist, Matthew Paul, DFH rounded out the lineup with bassist, Darren Furman and drummer, Mark Birkelbach and released two EP's and a series of singles while touring regionally, sharing the stage with national acts, Queensryche, 3 Doors Down and more along the way. The year 2013 saw them win the WDHA-FM Clash for Cash and hit the road for a 5-week tour in support of their EP, THE SIXES, produced by Sevendust guitarist, Clint Lowery. In 2015, DFH again scored a highly coveted opening slot on the 3 day NJ festival, Food Truck and Rock Carnival sharing the stage with the likes of Slash, Stone Temple Pilots & Godsmack. Dead Fish Handshake has returned from the studio with the first taste of new music since 2014 with their new single, \"Devolution\" \u2013 a look at what the band has been up to creatively since their last release. About the sound: The vocals wear a rough edge (Matthew Paul), which is both showcased and balanced by creative and catchy melodies. Guitar turns (Rob Ferreira) strike with an atmospheric feel that\u2019s high energy instead of ambient, a rare quality that\u2019s previously emerged in bands like Nine Inch Nails and U2. They\u2019re rounded out by the partnership of clean, consistent bass work (Darren Furman) and driving, steady drum lines (Mark Birkelbach). These ingredients have positioned them dead center of the rock radio dial. Dead Fish Handshake\u2019s unadulterated rock \u2018n\u2019 roll sound is a result of their no bells-and-whistles approach. In a time where the industry is a far cry from what it used to be and listeners seek out a new flavor each week, Dead Fish Handshake is locked in and set on taking their listeners for a memorable audio experience with lasting power. They have all hands on deck in making the most of every opportunity and grateful for every step of the way. \"...great riffs and near perfect arrangements with hooks that you won\u2019t be able to get out of your heads\" \u2013 The Aquarian.

Oh, and give your music away. Which isn\u2019t to say he won\u2019t be selling his debut full-length offering, Messenger ( Released 2/16/2010 on Lightning Rod). But free is how he came to make it, more or less.\n\nIt worked like this, for Joe Pug anyhow: The day before his senior year as a playwright student at the University of North Carolina, he sat down for a cup of coffee and had the clearest thought of his life: I am profoundly unhappy here. Then came the second clearest.\n\nPug packed up his belongings and pointed his car towards Chicago. Working as a carpenter by day, the 23 year-old Pug spent nights playing the guitar he hadn\u2019t picked up since his teenage years. Using ideas originally slated for a play he was writing called \u201cAustin Fish,\u201d Pug began creating the sublime lyrical arrangements that would become the Nation of Heat EP.\n\nThe songs were recorded fast and fervently at a Chicago studio where a friend snuck him in to late night slots other musicians had canceled. He was short on money, but his bare-boned sincerity didn\u2019t require much more than a microphone and it dripped off of each note he sang.\n\nThe early rumblings of critical praise for the EP were confirmed when his first headlining gig sold out Chicago\u2019s storied Schubas Tavern in 2008. As word spread, Pug struck upon an idea that would later prove to be one of the most significant in his young career. He offered his existing fans unlimited copies of a free 2-song sampler CD to pass along to their friends. He sent the CDs out at his own expense, even covering the postage. Inside each package was a personal note thanking the fan for helping to spread the word. The response was overwhelming, and to date he has sent out over 15,000 CDs to 50 states and 14 different countries. Without access to radio, Pug managed to turn his fans into his very own broadcast system. The offer still stands, and to this day it\u2019s featured prominently on www.joepugmusic.com.\n\n\u201cLook, in the end, I just trust my fans, and the nature of people in general. I need to pay my bills like anyone else does. But I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to ask someone to pay $15 when they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting. So in a way by sending out these CDs, I\u2019m wagering that they\u2019ll like my music, and that if they do they\u2019ll come to shows, buy CDs, and help me spread the word even further. And so far I\u2019ve been proven right. Without question, the more sampler CDs I send out, the more music I sell.\u201d\n\nNation of Heat took on a life of its own, passing from friend to friend and iPod to iPod. The crowds swelled and the media took notice. Tours with Steve Earle, M. Ward, and Josh Ritter followed, as did invitations to Lollapalooza and the Newport Folk Festival. He crisscrossed the country incessantly, traveling mostly alone in his 1995 Plymouth Voyager with no stereo or air conditioning. As the tours went on, he became closely linked to the burgeoning indie-folk scene that was coalescing loosely around Pug and his young contemporaries in bands such as The Low Anthem, Langhorne Slim, and Horse Feathers.\n\nAfter over 200 shows, Pug took a brief respite to record his full-length debut. If Nation of Heat heralded the arrival of a talent to watch, Messenger assigns Pug a deserved spot among the finest songwriters of his generation. From the opening notes of the title track that leads off the record, it\u2019s clear that the artist has no intention of retreating to the comfortable or the familiar. While the scathing war indictment \u201cBury Me Far (From My Uniform)\u201d and the sparse, poetic \u201cUnsophisticated Heart\u201d illustrate that Pug is still a master of the guy-and-guitar song, it\u2019s the supporting cast Pug brought on board that truly brings out the record\u2019s subtle beauty.\n\nFrom the haunting, ethereal pedal steel guitar that sneaks delicately under \u201cThe Sharpest Crown\u201d to the barrelhouse rhythm section that propels \u201cThe Door Is Always Open\u201d, it\u2019s clear that Pug is as comfortable exploring this new territory as he is solo. \u201cThe first record, it was a breeze,\u201d he says. \u201cDidn\u2019t even know we were making it, just me and a guitar\u2026the songs completely unadorned. This one, it\u2019s like that thing where there\u2019s an explosion and you realize how many options there are in the world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Joe Pug"}, {"Address": "61 Wythe Ave, New York, NY 11249", "Artist": "Rocky and The Pressers", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6315775.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.957549, 40.722053], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Reggae", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Bowl", "moreBioInfo": "\"Dance At The Playhouse\" on iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/dance-at-the-playhouse/id716775043?ign-mpt=uo=4", "otherInfo": "Morgan Heritage was cancelled this eveningMorgan Heritage ticket buyers are allowed free entry"}, {"Address": "599 Johnson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Luna Rose", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.923155, 40.709325], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Elsewhere - Zone One", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Elsewhere is intended to be a safe space to enjoy music, art, expression, and free play.

Pepper and Abbey Road eras and beyond.\n\nBased in the Los Angeles area, the band has toured extensively since its founding in 1997 -- performing at hundreds of venues throughout the U.S. and in many countries across the globe, including Japan, Malaysia, France, Hong Kong, The United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Mexico, and Brazil -- where they've skillfully recreated the Beatles' music multiple thousands of times, yet always with a freshness and excitement that audiences love.\n\nWhat makes The Fab Four unique among Beatles tribute bands is the not-so-simple fact that the four band members play all their own music live. This is just one more factor that gives their performances an energy and immediacy that backing tracks and sequencers can\u2019t.\n\nConsidering the complexity of the Beatles\u2019 later work and the fact that it was never intended to be performed live, what The Fab Four do onstage is phenomenal. Without a \u201cfifth Beatle\u201d anywhere in sight to make their job easier, these four highly accomplished musicians recreate all the sounds of an incredibly diverse catalog of Beatles favorites 100 percent live and in real time -- and their technical precision, musical artistry, and onstage chemistry make every concert a stunning performance!\n\nAudiences will appreciate their dynamic stage presence and the almost boundless energy that keeps them moving around the stage practically non-stop throughout the night, as they systematically move through the different Beatles eras, changing costumes between sets to represent the early Beatlemania years, the Sgt. Pepper/psychedelic era, and the Abbey Road period and beyond, with many shows also including a Shea Stadium set.\n\nThe band typically changes costumes twice, for a total of three period-perfect looks: the identical black chesterfield suits worn by the original lads during their Ed Sullivan Show debut, the colorful satin Sgt. Pepper uniforms and regalia worn by the Beatles during their psychedelic era, and the totally divergent clothing styles that marked the later Beatles and post-Beatles years. Select shows also feature the beige safari-style jackets and black trousers that have come to be known as the Beatles' Shea Stadium suits.\n\nThe band also periodically plays specialty shows for various Beatles-related anniversaries, such as shows that feature an entire Beatles album, played from start to finish, along with additional selections from the rest of the Beatles' extensive catalog. True to the material and era they cover, each of these shows brings in additional, highly authentic costumes from the period.\n\nThe Fab Four truly are The Ultimate Tribute to The Beatles -- the most accurate representation of the originals you'll find this side of the 1960s!", "otherInfo": "Emmy Award-winning Beatles tribute band The Fab Four is a highly polished tribute act that has been wowing audiences across the U.S. and around the world with its dynamic portrayal of the Beatles for over two decades.

Depending on the hour of the day he's a cultural icon, a rock god, an entrepreneur, a TV star, a father, the face of the American Diabetes Association, a supercross enthusiast, solo artist, Poison frontman, and a generous donor to a myriad of charitable causes.\n\nMichaels first rose to fame as the frontman of Poison. As one of rock's most iconic and enduring bands, Poison defined the fast, gritty, and glamorous rock 'n' roll scene. Since the band's beginning, Poison has achieved massive success- releasing eight studio albums, four live albums, and selling over 30 million records worldwide and 16.5 million records in the U.S. alone.\n\nThe band has charted 10 singles in the Top 40 on Billboard's Hot 100 including the number-one single, \"Every Rose Has It's Thorn.\" Twenty-five years after their debut, Poison is still recording music and performing together.\n\nBret Michaels' solo career has been equally successful: his most recent solo album, \"Custom Built,\" released in July of 2010, topped the charts, reaching #1 on Billboard's Hard Rock list. His current solo tour, \"Get Your Rock On\" is selling out arenas across the country and his forthcoming solo album of the same name will be released this summer.\n\nMichaels has achieved stunning success in the realm of reality TV as well. His \"Rock of Love\" television series is one of the most successful in VH1's history. VH1 and Bret Michaels teamed up again for his family-oriented 2010 docu-series \"Bret Michaels: Life As I Know It.\" He went head to head with some of the brightest minds in business on Donald Trump's NBC hit, \"Celebrity Apprentice\" and went on to \"Trump\" the competition with his Trop-A-Rocka Snapple drink.\n\nMichaels' Trop-a-Rocka Diet Snapple proved to be a fan-favorite- so much so that fans rallied to continue its distribution. He is thrilled to be continuing his partnership with Snapple, remarking, \"When I created my Diet Snapple Trop-A-Rocka Tea, I made it my mission to design the best-tasting diet drink on earth \u2013 made from the best stuff on earth. Creating Diet Snapple Trop-A-Rocka Tea and donating $250,000 to Diabetes research was just the beginning. I'm thrilled that Snapple will be making Trop-A-Rocka a part of its permanent offering.\"\n\nPhilanthropy remains an important facet of Michaels' career. A lifelong diabetic, he partnered with the American Diabetes Association in 2010, acting as a spokesperson and sponsor. Beyond his role as spokesperson Michaels has gone on to help Ford raise an additional $400,000 for diabetes research at the Barrett-Jackson auto auction this past February as well as donating numerous items for auction for Diabetes related events.\n\nMichaels' charitable outreach extends far beyond diabetes, however. Rocking out and giving back go hand in hand for Michaels, who supports a diverse array of charities and causes. In March 2011, he performed at Muhammad Ali's Celebrity Fight Night in support of the Muhammad Ali Foundation, which gives to those suffering from Parkinson's disease. Michaels was so touched by the event and the cause that he donated $20,000 of his own money to the Muhammad Ali Foundation to help heal those afflicted by Parkinson's. Michaels took on the role of fundraiser as well, raising more than $200,000 for the Barrow Brain Tumor Foundation, with a star-studded dinner in his own home. He is also a supporter of the Camelot Therapeutic ranch and sponsors a horse with his family. The ranch provides services at no charge to adults and children with disabilities.\n\nMichaels continues to stretch himself and challenge himself to take on new projects in music, business, and beyond. He recently partnered with legendary guitar company, Dean Guitars, to design his first ever signature Bret Michaels series. Michaels calls Dean Guitars \"the only guitars that can keep up with me, holding up tour after tour.\" He is also actively involved in the world of extreme sports. He created and awarded the first annual Bret Michaels Rock Hard, Ride Hard Award for supercross - a cash prize for the toughest and most tenacious supercross rider of the season - on May 7, 2011. The award will be given out again in 2012.\n\nMichaels has teamed with PetSmart for the \"Pet's Rock\" collection, which will debut in 2012. \"As a dedicated pet owners myself, this is a natural partnership for me, and I can\u2019t wait to unveil the collection,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cI know my own pets rock, and I wanted to design a line of pet products every bit as fun and cool as they are.\"\n\nAlso in 2012, Michaels is teaming up with Reader's Digest for their We Hear You America campaign - the popular national, grassroots initiative that serves as a catalyst to empower Americans to help their local communities by casting votes at ReadersDigest.com on behalf of their hometowns. Bret Michaels is the perfect partner for this campaign because he brings his experiences as a survivor, a rocker, a father, a philanthropist, and an American who has traveled this great land by tour bus from coast-to-coast. \"As a musician and an artist, I wanted to get involved in the We Hear You America campaign because it's not only about inspiring people to improve their lives and their communities, but about giving everyone a voice,\" says Michaels. \"It starts with all of you. Go to ReadersDigest.com every day to vote for your hometown. Your votes, joined with others in your community, could get your hometown funds and promotional support from the We Hear You America campaign.\"\n\nBret Michaels may have been in spotlight for decades, but he is certainly showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe official web site: http://www.bretmichaels.com\n\n###\n\nMAKE A DIFFERENCE", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "233 West St, New York, NY 10013", "Artist": "Drew Emmitt", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6066513.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.012344, 40.721325], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Bluegrass, Rock, Country", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "City Vineyard", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cLord you know I\u2019ve been so many places/At least I know I have a longer view\u201d, sings Leftover Salmon lead singer and mandolin player Drew Emmitt over a rollicking mandolin lick on the title track of his third solo effort, Long Road. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the road since the 80\u2019s \u2013 can you believe that?

With a love of music and skateboarding, Lindell formed a few punky garage bands early on while his musical horizons expanded. He listened to the deep blues of Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Jimmy Reed and Albert King before drifting toward the R&B sounds of The Impressions, Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway, soaking up the soul and learning how to craft a song. After performing at bars on the West Coast with a few short-lived bands, Eric formed his own group in 1993. He quickly gained a loyal Northern California audience thanks to countless performances and many late-night jam sessions. Established stars like Charlie Musselwhite and Tom Waits attended his shows, as did overflow crowds of music fans.\n\nWith music on his mind, Lindell headed to New Orleans in 1999, where he quickly discovered the pulsating and dynamic roots scene. He gravitated toward the West Bank dive bars of Gretna and Algiers, where he befriended many older area musicians who helped him get regular work as a performer. Some of New Orleans' finest players, including keyboardist Ivan Neville and drummers Harold Brown (War), Stanton Moore (Galactic) and Johnny Vidacovich (Professor Longhair, Astral Project) often joined him on stage. Galactic bassist Rob Mercurio began sitting in as well, and word of Lindell's immense talents quickly spread around the city. Stars like Branford Marsalis, The Neville Brothers and John Scofield began showing up at his gigs and embracing this fresh California kid's funky music. According to Lindell, \"It's a great feeling to be recognized for your music in New Orleans.\" Since 2003, in addition to his own gigs, Lindell regularly joins forces with Ivan Neville, Moore and Mercurio (when time and schedules permit) and they perform to overflow crowds as Dragon Smoke.\n\n2006's Change In The Weather delighted and surprised music fans hungry for a truly original artist. Lindell's deceptively simple sounding songs, laid back grooves and hook-laden melodies were fueled by guests including Brown, Neville and Moore. Critics across the country went wild, with reviews and features in Relix, OffBeat, Guitar Player, Down Beat, The New Yorker, The New York Press and many other national and regional publications. Singer And Musician magazine put Eric on the cover and many newspaper entertainment sections did the same.\n\n2007's Low On Cash, Rich In Love and 2009's Gulf Coast Highway pushed Lindell farther into the spotlight. Appearances on Late Night With Conan O'Brien and National Public Radio's Mountain Stage solidified his stature as an artist who simply could not be ignored. Many of his songs have appeared in films and television shows, including Boston Legal and Treme. He has collaborated and shared stages with blues and rock luminaries, including John Fogerty, Luther Dickinson and Anson Funderburgh.\n\nWith Revolution In Your Heart, Lindell was more than ready to come home to Alligator. \"The timing is perfect. I'm so excited to get back to focusing on what I do and have such a great team behind me,\" he says. Upon release of the album, Lindell and his band will tour heavily, reuniting with old friends and, as always, earning new fans at every stop. AllMusic declares Lindell a singular talent, saying, \"He plays soulful, funk-drenched, tight and focused grooves. He is a quadruple threat as a solid songwriter, impressive guitarist, affecting singer and harmonica blower. This is music that's deceptively difficult to create. Lindell makes it seem not just easy, but natural.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1650 Broadway, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "Peter Noone", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9620908.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983533, 40.761865], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Iridium", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "158 Bleecker St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Echosmith", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10060026.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.999882, 40.728425], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Le Poisson Rouge", "moreBioInfo": "Echosmith is back in a big way!\n\nAfter making waves in 2019 with new music, siblings Sydney, Noah and Graham Sierota are kicking off 2020 on a high note: dropping their first studio album in over six years, Lonely Generation.\n\nSydney describes it as \u201ca coming-of-age album,\u201d telling POPSTAR!, \u201cThis album really lets you know where we\u2019re at and what we\u2019ve been feeling through this process of growing up.\u201d\n\nThe multi-platinum alt-pop sibling band turned the music industry on its ear with their 2013 hit \u201cCool Kids,\u201d and \u201cBright,\u201d which earned triple and double platinum statuses, respectively.

Even though the duo comprised of Doctur Dot and Johnny Venus are more than capable of pulling off such feats, they are here to instill something simpler. Something bigger. Something that you, the listener, the fan, the artist, the critic may not even realize that you need yet:\n\nFreedom to be yourself.\n\nThat freedom is what attracted the duo to each other when they were students at Southwest Atlanta\u2019s storied Benjamin E. Mays High School. Roaming the same hallways that produced all four members of Goodie Mob decades before them, Earthgang first met each other during an emergency evacuation. After seeing that they had similar tastes in music ranging from Madonna to Madlib, their relationship blossomed from casual conversations about rap to forming a group of their own. But before they even recorded their first project together, they already found themselves hitting the road as they each enrolled at prestigious HBCU Hampton University in Virginia. Though both of them attended the college on academic scholarships with Dot majoring in Psychology and Venus studying to be an architect, they found themselves using the campus as their recording studio.\n\nThe work paid off as Earthgang\u2019s first two projects, 2010\u2019s The Better Party and 2011\u2019s Mad Men landed them shows on both ends of the country at the Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival and Stanford University\u2019s Blackfest. Their follow-up mixtape Good News, backed by energetic live shows, boosted their profile in Atlanta\u2019s congested indie rap scene, but it was their ambitious 2012 debut album Shallow Graves For Toys that captured nationwide attention and peaked at #11 on the Billboard Emerging Artists chart. The wide-ranging project displayed their ability to create with acoustic folk singers like Marian Mereba as well as chest-thumping declarations with producers 808 Mafia (Gucci Mane, Waka Flocka Flame) with Noisey calling it \u201cone of the most well thought-out releases of the year.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur projects are more conceptual than just making songs,\u201d insists Doctur Dot, whose handle is based off his childhood nickname \u201cDoc,\u201d which he earned for always seeming to have answers for everything. \u201cWe are making ourselves vulnerable to the world through our music. Most people don\u2019t allow themselves to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe set out to make the best music that feels the best to us,\u201d adds Johnny Venus, whose name derives from his astrological sign Libra, but challenges the common perception of the symbol by making it asexual. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural synergy for us. We don\u2019t just try to make explosions happen.\u201d\n\nEarthgang\u2019s most recent offering Torba did just that as they showcased their versatility alongside the likes of both Mac Miller and OG Maco over production that ranged from hazy to urgent. That release, coupled with successful tours opening for Ab Soul and Fashawn, Earthgang took another step towards becoming one of the most unique voices in Hip Hop today. Their upcoming album Strays With Rabies (released through their Spillage Village imprint) aims to put their evolving songwriting skills at the forefront after already proving their rap skills to be far above average.\n\nWith a lyrical spectrum that has graduated from \u201choping your mama lose her temper\u201d on Mad Men to \u201cseeing the whole world with my eyes closed\u201d on Torba, Earthgang is rapidly growing into a musical force that will liberate listeners from all walks of life.

Listeners are crying out for something true\u2013\u2013some meaty songs that\u2019ll give us some comfort, even as they cut closer to the bone.\n\n\n\nEveryone is finally ready for the gritty, thundering country Jason Boland and the Stragglers have sharpened over almost 20 years\u2019 worth of selling out roomy venues and commanding stages across the nation. And new album Squelch provides the ideal vehicle.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make something that we're proud of,\u201d lead songwriter and vocalist Boland says. \u201cIf any more people want to take notice of it, they\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince coming together in Stillwater, Oklahoma, Boland and his tightknit crew have sold more than half a million albums independently and earned a devoted following that\u2019s swelled far beyond the band\u2019s red dirt roots. At a Stragglers show, oil patch roughnecks, hippies, college kids, and intelligentsia all sway side-by-side like a traveling reincarnation of Austin\u2019s Armadillo World Headquarters in its cosmic cowboy, Willie Nelson heyday.\n\n\n\nWhile the Stragglers draw from rock and folk, make no mistake: they traffic in unfiltered, unfettered honky-tonk, raw and lean. Equal parts subtle, meditative, and snarling, and often wickedly funny, Squelch is a deeply rooted exercise in exhuming beauty by trading smoke and mirrors for what\u2019s real.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe pay homage, but we don't want to copy or be a throwback act,\u201d Boland says. \u201cAll you can do is try to take the music that inspires you and take it further. And make it personal.\u201d If he has felt any pressure to make his \u201cpersonal\u201d what others have in mind, it doesn\u2019t show. Boland has never constructed an identity or sound for mass or even niche consumption. He is who he is, and he\u2019s all in.\n\n\n\nRecorded at Orb Recording Studios in Austin and mixed at Sonic Ranch in El Paso, Squelch was produced by Jim Ward (At the Drive-In, Sparta, Sleepercar) and marks the band\u2019s eighth time in the studio. Like two previous Stragglers\u2019 albums, debut Pearl Snaps and 2013\u2019s critically acclaimed Dark and Dirty Mile, Squelch was recorded and mixed directly to tape. \u201cIt's one thing when you can say, \u2018Okay, now, engineer, you do your magic,\u2019\u201d Boland says. \u201cThere is no magic when you record and mix to tape. It is what it is. I think it\u2019s a fuller, richer sound. And it\u2019s just more honest.\u201d\n\n\n\nOpener \u201cBreak 19\u201d thumps brazenly, reveling in bassist Grant Tracy\u2019s heart-pounding walks and punctuated by Nick Worley\u2019s whirling fiddle, Brad Rice\u2019s locomotive drumming, and newest Straggler Cody Angel\u2019s achy pedal steel. There\u2019s not a throwaway line to be found, as Boland\u2019s deep baritone rumbles through a sly takedown of modern media and absolute certainty after copping to trying it all the wrong way first and realizing \u201cthe more I see, the less I claim to know.\u201d It\u2019s a fitting introduction to The Stragglers\u2019 signature blend of social consciousness, self-awareness, and swing.\n\n\n\n\u201cI Guess It\u2019s Alright\u201d is classic Boland wordplay layered over a breakneck shot of adrenaline. A rollicking sendup of society\u2019s uneven tolerance for bad behavior, the track roars that for those with power, life is open season and consequences are nil. \u201cI guess it\u2019s alright to be an asshole if you\u2019re good,\u201d he pounds over growling guitar. \u201cFat and Merry\u201d bristles with snark, taking aim at quintessentially American hustle, from suburban flight and gentrification, to waste and nonstop consumption. It\u2019s got to be the only song ever to bemoan \u201ccoffee shops and escalades where escalades and cocaine could be found\u201d with a world-weary fiddle echo. \u201cNobody wants to come off as judgmental, but you have to make judgments,\u201d Boland says. \u201cWith your tongue in your cheek is a nice way to do it. None of us are above reproach. We\u2019re all just having a good day or a bad day, same as everybody else.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFirst to Know\u201d is a love song for adults. \u201cIf my voice sounds scared and frozen, it\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid and cold / And when I am you\u2019ll always be the first to know,\u201d Boland sings, both as an ode to the one who knows him best and a plea for understanding. It\u2019s also a reminder that sometimes, what you see really is what you get, and while that may occasionally disappoint, ultimately, it\u2019s cause for trust and hope.\n\n\n\nAversion to artifice permeates Squelch in just about every way, from the recording process to the album\u2019s themes to Boland himself. \u201cLose Early\u201d is a sauntering rendition of dust to dust and a skewering of the lie that you have to sell your soul to eat, while \u201cDo You Love Me Any Less\u201d questions whether or not absence hinders affection. Written by original Stragglers fiddler Dana Hazzard, haunting and heartbreaking \u201cChristmas in Huntsville\u201d is the only track Boland didn\u2019t pen. Images of Christmas at home flood the imprisoned narrator\u2019s mind as he heads to his holiday-timed execution for a murder he didn\u2019t commit. Closer \u201cFuck, Fight, and Rodeo\u201d kicks out the footlights in a two-minute, hell-in-a-hand-basket hoedown.\n\n\n\nAsked why he feels so compelled to focus on lost causes and society\u2019s ills, Boland explains, \u201cBecause we\u2019ve talked about the rest of it. It\u2019s almost out of obligation\u2013\u2013and it\u2019s an obligation that\u2019s more intense because of the fact that nobody else is talking about it\u2013\u2013some rock, rap, Americana, and folk does. But nobody is doing it the way we do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nBoland just exited his 30s, but he seems older, based on his experiences. He\u2019s lived through alcoholism, a should-have-killed-him car crash, a ruptured vocal chord, and other trials. He wears his hard-won wisdom easily, without ceremony or conceit, and has evolved naturally as a writer, becoming more and more comfortable with his knack for recognizing the universally significant\u2013\u2013even divine\u2013\u2013in the ordinary. \u201cHoly Relic Sale\u201d is a stunning example, and one of the songs that makes Boland most proud. \u201cMy wife\u2019s got a pair of lucky blue socks,\u201d he says. \u201cOne day, we just had an awesome day\u2013\u2013everything went right. We got home, and she pulled the socks out of the dresser and said, \u2018I thought I had these on all day.\u2019 It\u2019s the classic story of \u2018it\u2019s not the things.\u2019 The things are there to remind you to concentrate on the positive facts of life. The little relics that we have are going to wear out or get lost, but the light and the energy are within you.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn stage, Boland leads a raucous party. Off stage, he\u2019s mellow and warm, often wryly philosophical. But no matter where he is, he\u2019s always grateful. \u201cYou play the dimly lit honky tonks of the world and take the music to the people, several at a time,\u201d he says. \u201cSome shows are huge, some shows aren't. You take the good and the bad and you go down the road. And you think, \u2018Isn't that what everybody's going for?\u2019 Well no, it's not. But that's what we look back on and always smile about\u2013\u2013the shaky ground that we've always been on. The uncertainty of it all.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "183 W 10th St, New York, NY 10014", "Artist": "John Medeski", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6047463.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.002722, 40.734367], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Smalls Jazz Club", "moreBioInfo": "Anthony John Medeski (born 28 June 1965) is an American keyboard player and composer.

After being forced into a two year hiatus due to Lyme Disease, Sonali has come back stronger than ever and hit the ground running. Splitting most of her time between South Florida and NYC, Sonali has just finished a tour with Hollister and High School Nation, shared a bill with Nick Jonas and Zedd, and opened for the headliner, Pitbull, at Florida's acclaimed SunFest Music Festival. In addition to gracing the cover of South Florida's major publication Lifestyle Magazine, Sonali was also the subject of a documentary that aired on JUS Broadcasting, which highlighted her career and journey with Lyme. These notable accomplishments led her to become the 2019 Recipient of the Cultural Ambassador Award, presented by Miss Universe Sushmita Sen in California.\n\nStudying and making music ever since she was a young girl, Sonali\u2019s biggest plunge into the music world came when she was invited to attend the prestigious Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. There, she was afforded the pleasure of working with some of the best in the industry, studying under numerous GRAMMY award-winning professors and music industry veterans such as Questlove, Bob Power (D'Angelo, A Tribe Called Quest), Nick Sansano (Sonic Youth, Public Enemy), and Amund Bj\u00f6rklund (Train). While there, she would also attend guest lectures by Pharrell, Benny Blanco, Rob Thomas, and Stargate. During her college career, Sonali and her classmates collaborated to create a viral cover of Rihanna\u2019s \"Diamonds.\" After being featured on Buzzfeed and by Ryan Seacrest, the video garnered the attention of Rihanna herself, who invited the group to a show in Newark, where she personally congratulated them on their work.\n\nJust as Sonali graduated from NYU and was about to embark on her first tour, she was diagnosed with Chronic Lyme Disease. Instead of spending the next few years on the road and recording as she had planned, she was forced to devote most of her time to recovering and getting back on her feet. As much of a setback as it was, the unintentional break did allow her the time to be introspective and reconsider her career and sound. While at NYU, Sonali learned a great deal about music production, which had opened her eyes to the world of electronic music. Trading in the acoustic guitar for synths and drum machines, Sonali released her follow-up EP Runaway in summer 2019 with producers Eren Cannata and KOIL PreAmple.\n\nThrough this new sound, Sonali hopes to use her platform to help give another voice to Indian-Americans in the entertainment industry. \"My family is from India and that's been a huge part of my upbringing,\" Sonali shares. \"Growing up, I never had anyone on screen or in music that I could look up to in that sense, and I don't want that to be the case for kids today. Indians are finally starting to get a voice in the TV and Film world, and it's about time that spills over into the music industry!\"\n\nWith a new sound and reenergized passion, Sonali is ready to pick up where she left off.\n\nManager: Amit Nerurkar (face-less)\nContact: management@itsmesonali.com", "otherInfo": "Breaking Sound presents SONALI, Bohdi & Dandelot\n\nWe showcase the hottest emerging artists & bands in premium locations around the city. #BreakingSoundNYC\n\nFEATURING -- SONALI, Bohdi & Dandelot\n\n21+.

The band combines the complexity and insight of The Silver Jews with the immediacy, economy, and seaside sensibilities of The Ramones and the softly intricate rhythms of the Caribbean music heard at every bodega in town. Basketball player-poet Johnny Dydo fronts the band, his baritone visions exploding through his grunge-princess regalia leaving fans and passers-by collecting and contemplating shards of pink hair, coded dreams, and bits of seashells whose songs can only be imagined in some integrity long ago crushed by the surf or swept away by the Atlantic. Johnny's persona embodies the apparent contradictions that define the band... masculine and feminine, funny and a little scary, brilliant surface and depths so remote they would be unobservable if not for the clarity and specificity of the plan according to which they are constructed.\nThe Johns have toured extensively in Europe and played at the Egersund Visefestival in Norway and the Down by the River Festival in Berlin.

La figura de Keith Richards lo marc\u00f3 y lo llev\u00f3 a emprender un camino que sigue hasta el d\u00eda de hoy.\n\nA temprana edad, llev\u00f3 el estudio y el conocimiento de la guitarra a tal nivel que llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n de grandes personalidades del instrumento como Diego Mizrahi, que le dio un lugar en su escuela para que diera clases.\n\nPero la vida de conservatorio y de escuela no era todo para Juan, que con apetito de nuevas experiencias se lanz\u00f3 a la ruta con como dice \u00e9l \u201c3 viejos lobos del rock\u201d para poder comenzar no solo a vivir el otro lado de esta profesi\u00f3n sino para poder sentir lo que era trabajar con la m\u00fasica por primera vez. Todos los fines de semana sal\u00eda de gira por el interior del pa\u00eds con el \u00fanico objetivo de tocar y tocar.\n\nTerminada la secundaria, Juan tuvo que tomar su primera gran decisi\u00f3n: querer estudiar m\u00fasica. En sus palabras comenta \u201cNo vengo de una familia de m\u00fasicos, para nada. No puedo decir que cuando era chico escuchaba practicar a mi pap\u00e1 o a mi mam\u00e1 cantar canciones. No, no s\u00e9 lo que es eso. Por este motivo, la discusi\u00f3n con ellos sobre mi futuro, fue dif\u00edcil\u201d. Pero Juan pudo hacer entenderles a sus padres que la m\u00fasica es todo para \u00e9l, y as\u00ed aplic\u00f3 para la ITMC, una escuela terciaria de m\u00fasica ubicada en Saavedra, Buenos Aires, en donde obtuvo una beca completa por un a\u00f1o.\n\nSalir a tocar y al mismo tiempo estudiar, lo llev\u00f3 a conocer mucha gente y a tener diversas experiencia que lo llevaron a entender lo que era tocar para la gente, y para su propio ego. \u201cEntend\u00ed que un m\u00fasico arriba del escenario se tiene que entregar al 100% o por lo menos yo lo creo as\u00ed\u201d, afirma.\n\nPero como todos saben, la vida del m\u00fasico es dif\u00edcil, y mucho m\u00e1s en Argentina. Por eso, por un tiempo Juan debi\u00f3 recurrir a la herencia laboral familiar, trabajar en un banco. Durante 7 largos a\u00f1os debi\u00f3 cumplir un horario pero sin dejar atr\u00e1s su pasi\u00f3n. Mientras contaba plata detr\u00e1s de un mostrador, Juan se dio el lujo de pasar por diversas experiencias musicales, desde bandas de country y western, hasta proyectos de reggae y rock. Ha tocado en lugares m\u00edticos como el Gran Rex, abriendo para bandas como SOJA y\n\nGroundation, junto a Calican Groove, y en el Luna Park teloneando a Ivete Sangalo. Adem\u00e1s, junto a Aitor Gra\u00f1a, le abrieron el show a Manu Chao en el Estadio de Ferro.\n\nLejos de perder la motivaci\u00f3n, comenz\u00f3 a estudiar nuevamente guitarra con Pino Marrone y canto con Susana Rossi. \u201cCon ellos aprend\u00ed a ver mi instrumento y la m\u00fasica desde otra perspectiva. Mas como un pintor que como un m\u00fasico que solo toca por tocar\u201d.\n\nCon mayor confianza, lleg\u00f3 el momento en donde sus primeras composiciones empezaron a aparecer por la necesidad de sacar todo lo que ten\u00eda adentro. Y se hicieron realidad con su proyecto junto a Dami\u00e1n Chavez llamado Moos, con el cu\u00e1l grabaron su primer disco con la producci\u00f3n del gran Tweety Gonz\u00e1lez. Pero al no poder plasmar del todo su m\u00fasica, decidi\u00f3 armar un tri\u00f3 junto a Aitor Gra\u00f1a en bater\u00eda y Yulie Ruth en bajo para grabar \u201cIdas y Vueltas\u201d y \u201cBlow the Truth\u201d, sus dos primeros temas como solista.\n\nPero se avecinaba otra gran decisi\u00f3n en la historia de Juan. Tras meses de venir pensando en esto, decidi\u00f3 agarrar el tim\u00f3n y dar un giro de 360\u00b0 grados en su vida, renunciar al banco e irse a probar suerte a la ciudad de Nueva York. Al principio era solo por 20 d\u00edas que hoy se han convertido en un tiempo indefinido. Para un m\u00fasico con su b\u00fasqueda, su hambre y su curiosidad, esta ciudad ha sido el nido ideal para cobijarlo en su etapa m\u00e1s creativa, y es por eso que hoy en d\u00eda toca semanalmente por toda la ciudad, buscando ser escuchado y abierto a escuchar y experimentar diversos sonidos que se le apararezcan por delante.\n\nHoy, desde la \u201cGran Manzana\u201d, nos presenta su primer disco de estudio llamado \u201c\u00c9rase una vez\u201d, un suave camino hecho canci\u00f3n que cuenta las experiencias de la vida de este joven que elije el rock, el blues y el folk como medios pertinentes para contar su historia, esa que los ocupados en su rutina laboral no se animan a explorar.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "234 Starr St, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Mary Vision", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9644411.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.922471, 40.705626], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Psychedelic Rock, Alternative, Glam Rock, Psychedelic, Garage, Post-Grunge", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Turk's Inn", "moreBioInfo": "Mary Vision is a psych-rock band hailing from Brooklyn, NY.

Over the past several years, Butler\u2019s live shows have been a showcase of brilliant improvisation and beautiful electronic music. Groove-driven but given to richly textured sound design, rhythmically fractured but melodically sumptuous, Johnny Butler\u2019s music is a bridge between the past and the present, bringing the artist face-to-face with a creative legacy that spans decades. On Raise it Up, Butler seamlessly alternates between saxophone, looping, and samples, building a nearly infinite palate of planetary and interplanetary sonics merged into a Frankenstein\u2019s monster-ish list of styles and influences Looking back, his full-length debut Carousel (voted \u201cBest of 2013\u201d by Jazz Journalists Association) appears to be much more of a mission statement than a simple introduction- laying the foundation for a field on which a brand new sound would soon be born. While Carousel was an introspective, moody travelogue through the Brooklyn cityscape, it certainly hinted at Johnny Butler\u2019s inclination to expand beyond terrestrial means. \"After dabbling with resonances from John Coltrane and Miles Davis and enveloping his processed saxophone sound in cavernous reverb, Brooklyn-based Johnny Butler turns a polyphony of overdubbed horns (triggered by laptop) into Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis machine.\" \u2014\u2009DownBeat Magazine Johnny has played at Bonnaroo, Mountain Jam, Bear Creek, Gathering of the Vibes, Telluride Jazz, Voodoo Fest in New Orleans, helped write and record the tenor and baritone saxophone parts on Beyonce\u2018s album 4, played with tUnE-yArDs at Summer Stage in New York, Donald Fagen (Steely Dan) and Warren Haynes at a Midnight Ramble at Levon Helm\u2019s Studio, Govt Mule at the Beacon Theater in New York, Joe Lally (Fugazi), Strangefolk at StrangeCreek, La La Brooks of Phil Spector\u2019s Crystals, The Skeletons Big Band, worked with Grammy-award winner and former American Idol Judge Randy Jackson at Jim Henson Studios in Los Angeles, and has opened up for Stevie Wonder, The Avett Brothers, Dr. John, Fitz and the Tantrums, Counting Crows, moe., Soulive, Sharon Jones and Dap Kings, Trombone Shorty, and the Funky Meters.

With True Love (released on May 3 via Rondette Jazz), vocalist John Dokes turns his attention, and his elegant baritone, to something deeper. Over the course of ten well-chosen songs and an equally diverse range of moods, Dokes explores the more profound, committed side of affairs of the heart, bringing soulful nuance and hard-earned wisdom to each tale of ardent amour.\n\nAs Dokes makes clear with each knowing inflection and wry turn of phrase, committed love doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into comfortable routine. Throughout the album\u2019s ten songs, Dokes imbues each lyric with smoldering passion or heart-wrenching loss, all the more affecting for being so deeply felt. Even in his suave delivery of the album\u2019s sole original track, \u201cCool Enough,\u201d the crooner undercuts his dapper cool with a tinge of self-doubt, pleading to know, \u201cAm I cool?\u201d\n\nThough he may have his moments of uncertainty, there\u2019s little question while listening to True Love that Dokes falls squarely into the \u201ccool\u201d camp. Formerly a champion lindy hopper, he continues to get audiences dancing in his regular gig singing with the George Gee Big Band; he carries the same self-confidence from the ballroom to the boardroom, as the Chief Content Officer and President of Accuweather Network, following similarly successful tenures at Viacom and Marvel Entertainment.\n\nWhen working with the world-class quartet on True Love, though, the executive suite is the furthest thing from Dokes\u2019 mind. The album is the second in a planned trilogy, each of which pairs Dokes with a different frontline horn. The first was 2017\u2019s Forever Reasons, his initial small group endeavor (following his big band debut, John Dokes Sings, George Gee Swings), which featured trombonist David Gibson with the same rhythm section as this release: pianist Steve Einerson (Eric Alexander, Eddie Henderson), bassist Alex Claffy (Kurt Rosenwinkel, Jimmy Cobb), and drummer Lawrence Leathers (C\u00e9cile McLorin Salvant, Aaron Diehl).\n\nOn True Love they\u2019re joined by alto saxophonist Mark Gross (Delfeayo Marsalis, Dave Holland), whose sinuous tone is an ideal match for Dokes\u2019 dulcet baritone. Their chemistry is immediately apparent on \u201cA Sleepin\u2019 Bee,\u201d the opening track, calling to mind the playful back-and-forth between Nancy Wilson and Cannonball Adderley on their immortal 1961 rendition, which inspired Dokes to include the song here. The song\u2019s lyric, by writer Truman Capote, also lends the album its title, as Dokes concludes the song by repeating the phrase like an echoing memory.", "otherInfo": "John Dokes - Celebrates The Songs Of Love"}, {"Address": "125 MacDougal St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "The Tristones", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8881953.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.000148, 40.730557], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Groove", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "15 Vandam St, New York, NY 10013", "Artist": "Chronicles", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6302171.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00995, 40.72446], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Metal, Progressive Metal", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Huron Club At Soho Playhouse", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Feuding tailors, a cocaine-addicted rabbi and a Jewish woman who joins a fundamentalist Christian sect are just a few of the sometimes poignant, often humorous stories told through music in singer-songwriter Daniel Cainer's Jewish Chronicles.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\n\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\n\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\n\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers. While he may be considered as part of a new generation of \"multilingual\" musicians which have grown up studying classical, jazz and Latin American music, Edward is inventing a language that transcends any rigid genre.", "otherInfo": "Saxophonist Bobby Watson began his career with Art Blakey\u2019s Jazz Messengers, later becoming the musical director of the quintessential group.

The album announces Regen as a formidable talent with the rarest of gifts - an original voice that speaks to the human condition with authority and hope. Regen\u2019s songs define our times, but are meant to last for all time.\n\nRegen knows a thing or two about navigating the unexpected. Coming of age in the 1980s, he nourished himself on a steady diet of MTV and synth pop. And while he could have spent his life in search of New Wave glory, he instead moved to New York City and became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of jazz piano great Kenny Barron, toured with artists like Little Jimmy Scott and Kyle Eastwood, and slowly carved-out a name for himself as a solo artist who defied easy categorization.\n\nLike Bruce Hornsby before him, Regen creates infectious melodies that often belie the music\u2019s harmonic sophistication. Like Randy Newman, he draws on the richness of the American musical vernacular, distilling an ocean into a creek the artist can call his own. It\u2019s on the axis of those seemingly diverse worlds that Jon Regen\u2019s sound is born. It's also on the axis of differing worlds that Higher Ground sprang to life.\n\nHaving experienced a new level of artistic success following his critically-acclaimed 2015 album Stop Time (produced by Mitchell Froom and featuring members of Elvis Costello\u2019s Imposters), Regen wasn\u2019t eager to rush into the studio for a follow-up. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t going to make a record of just any songs, produced just any way,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI never gave up the idea of recording again, but I knew I didn\u2019t want to make the same album I did last time. I wanted to be inspired.\u201d\n\nParenthood helped Regen meditate on several factors. \u201cI wondered if, in this new divided world \u2013 and in this era of instant internet fame, if music still resonated the way I remembered it could.\u201d\n\nWith no stream of roadwork planned (he was too busy being a full-time dad), Regen played local shows around New York City and dug into his work as the Editor of Keyboard Magazine. \u201cFor the first time in decades, I had a regular jazz gig,\u201d he says. \u201cI became reacquainted with the piano in a way I hadn\u2019t been able to while I was constantly touring. I also threw myself into my writing work, relishing the chance to explore the inspiration behind otherpeople\u2019s music.\u201d Then in September 2018, Jamiroquai\u2019s Matt Johnson invited Regen to the group\u2019s gig at the Forest Hills Tennis Center in Queens, New York.\n\nThe location proved remarkable: Regen\u2019s parents had lived on the same street during the 1960s. Possibly more remarkable was the gig itself: \u201cI saw 14,000 people dancing to funk music in the New York rain that night, and my faith in the healing power of music was instantly restored.\u201d\n\nWhen Regen and Johnson met at the afterparty, they hit it off instantly, despite being something of an unlikely pairing. \u201cMatt\u2019s a proper British synth whiz, and I\u2019m a gravely-voiced New York singer/songwriter. But I thought, \u2018Maybe there\u2019s something to this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe pair wrote the song \u201cWide Awake\u201d as a way of testing the waters - with Johnson in London and Regen at home in New York City. And despite the distance, the duo struck creative magic. \u201cIt was just this great marriage of Matt\u2019s studio wizardry and my songwriting and piano styles,\u201d Regen explains. \u201cFunnily enough, that song would never have been born had I not bought an old Roland Juno-60 synthesizer and started fooling around with it on top of my Steinway grand piano. But once I did, I knew I was onto something fresh. It was a sound that was new to me, so I chased it.\u201d\n\nJohnson says, \u201cWhen he sent me his idea, I was struck by the rich quality of his voice. As the track progressed, I learned that Jon could also play great jazz piano. For me, this album shows off all the best in Jon - great songs, great piano and a truly distinctive voice.\u201d\n\nBut a lingering question remained: Could the duo record an entire album without anyone ever playing in the same place at the same time? They were about to find out.\n\nFor Regen, making the album became a mission unto itself, regardless of the challenges the pair faced. \u201cI wrote lyrics while my son watched \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 and recorded piano and vocals in my apartment while he napped,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore we knew it, the project was materializing before our eyes.\u201d\n\nNo stranger to formidable companions, Regen enlisted an all-star cast that reads like the lineup of a supergroup; keyboardists Benmont Tench, Chuck Leavell, Ricky Peterson (David Sanborn, Fleetwood Mac) and Matt Rollings (Lyle Lovett, Willie Nelson,) signed-on, as did Duran Duran\u2019s Nick Rhodes.\n\n\u201cFor someone who used to air drum to Rio as a kid, hearing Nick\u2019s synth work on my music was positively surreal,\u201d Regen says. \u201cIn a lot of ways, this record is about the moment when your heroes become your peers.\u201d\n\nTench says that there was never a second thought about lending his talents to the album. \u201cNot only is Jon an annoyingly great piano player,\u201d the veteran keyboardist says, \u201che isn\u2019t sitting still in the songwriting department, either: this is a laudable leap forward in both style and expression.\u201d\n\nHaving scored a premiere rhythm section for his previous album, Regen was once again drawn to top players like bassists Larry Klein (Joni Mitchell) and Tim Lefebvre (David Bowie, Tedeschi Trucks Band), and drummers Keith Carlock (Steely Dan) and Jerry Marotta (Peter Gabriel). Previous Regen collaborators like guitarists Andy Summers (The Police) and George Marinelli (Bonnie Raitt) return here, as do cellist Julia Kent and Swiss harmonica ace Gr\u00e9goire Maret. And as impressive as the guest list on Higher Ground is, what\u2019s even more miraculous is that every musician played his or her parts in their respective hometowns. The entire album was recorded remotely, across different cities, oceans and countries.\n\nListening to Higher Ground, it\u2019s not hard to imagine what led musical luminaries to join in. The album strikes the perfect balance between gravity and levity, between deep introspection and knowing when to cast worries aside and get down to celebrating the moment.\n\nThe album opener \u201cWide Awake\u201d gives us a glimpse of the myriad of styles Regen pulls from. Funky, R&B grooves collide with jazz and pop flourishes, and lyrics that never overstate the tune\u2019s status as a love song. And the title track \u201cHigher Ground\u201d sounds like something culled from an earlier time and, perhaps, like John Hiatt\u2019s \u201cHave a Little Faith\u201d not just a song but a hymn to the heart. \u201cThat one is for my son,\u201d Regen remarks. \u201cThe lyric, \u2018I\u2019m a better man now, \u2018cause I stand on higher ground\u2019 is about him showing me what\u2019s really important in this world. The title became a mantra for the entire album, pushing me to elevate my singing, songwriting and piano playing at every turn.\u201d\n\nAs good as he is at walking in the alleyways of America\u2019s musical past, Regen moves himself into the contemporary via the socially-conscious \u201cWho Cares If Everybody Else Knows.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a lyric that all right-minded people can relate to,\u201d Johnson says, \u201cand I feel it\u2019s where I took Jon furthest from his comfort zone musically. The track sounds completely modern and Nick put in some really interesting sounds at the end to finish it off.\u201d\n\nOn other tracks, Regen\u2019s piano mastery is firmly on display. \u201cHole in My Heart\u201d features a dreamy, triple-tracked piano solo that channels the best of early Bowie and later Hornsby. The libidinous, New Orleans-inflected \u201cEvery Night\u201d recalls Dr. John at his swampiest. And \u201cEast Side Blues\u201d pits Regen\u2019s blues-drenched piano against the street noise of his native New York City, marrying humor with high musical art.\n\nOne song, \u201cThe Last to Go,\u201d bridges Regen\u2019s recent past with the music of his youth. \u201cBenmont played on that one and recorded the organ at Mitchell Froom\u2019s studio in Los Angeles,\u201d Regen explains. \u201cMitchell produced my last album, Stop Time, and played the first organ solo I ever heard, on Crowded House\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over.\u2019 And so the circle completes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Last to Go\u201d not only summarizes many of the album\u2019s themes, it\u2019s also unquestionably a new high in Regen\u2019s compositional output. \u201cIt was the last song I wrote for the album,\u201d he says. \u201cI was up late in New York City one night, thinking about the album and my approaching birthday \u2013 of where I have been, and where I still hope to go. I traced my life back through big events, and more personal earthquakes. And of course, with the world we live in now full of disinformation and vitriol, we all look for a guiding light. My wife is that for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter I wrote that song, I called Benmont to play organ on it. Because nobody can move air on a Hammond like Ben. He also had his daughter on the exact same day I had my son, and I had a feeling he feels about his wife the way I do about mine.\u201d\n\nThe balance between light and dark heard on the album is not lost on Regen. \u201cLooking back at the album now, I see it\u2019s full of both optimism and fear,\u201d he says. \u201cSongs like \u2018Wide Awake\u2019 and \u2018Higher Ground\u2019 speak to the power of love and family and the happiness they bring. But songs like \u2018Who Cares If Everybody Else Knows\u2019 and \u2018Before\u2019 are darker. They are me grappling with the madness of life as a new parent in 2019 \u2013 where no one seems to stand for anything besides greed and power. Those are tough sentiments to reconcile. In the end, I suppose life is about just that \u2013 how to explain the unexplainable.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "30 W 26th St, New York, NY 10010", "Artist": "Jesse Daniel", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9294807.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.990409, 40.74427], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Honky Tonk, Rockn Roll, Country, Bakersfield Sound, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Hill Country", "moreBioInfo": "Jesse Daniel has quickly become a household name in today\u2019s country music scene and has received critical acclaim from the likes of Saving Country Music, No Depression and Paste Magazine, among others, for his self titled debut.

He is a son of jazz legend Roland Alexander, an American post-bop jazz tenor saxophone player from Boston, Massachusetts. Taru started to play drums at the early age of seven years old surrounded by the greatest jazz musicians like Freddie Hubbard, Reggie Workman, Gary Bartz, and Kiani Zawadi. At the age of nine, he was studying drums under the leadership of master drummers Rudy Collins, Andre Strobert and Walter Perkins at the New Muse music school in Brooklyn, New York. By the age of thirteen, Taru started to perform professionally with his father Roland Alexander\u2019s quintet (Roland Alexander-tenor saxophone, Kiani Zawadi-trombone, Hilton Ruiz-piano, Paul Brown-bass). At the same time, he started to study drums with Justin DiCioccio at the La Guardia Music & Art High School in New York.\n\nWhile still studying at the age of sixteen, Taru recorded his first album as a sideman accompanying Fred Ho Afro-Asian Ensemble on the Black Saint record label. Soon after, he established himself at the New York jazz scene and became one of the soughs after drummers. He also toured the US with the Moe Better Blues Band & The Drums of Fire bands.

Not the types to shy away from a challenge, they took up an unusual, near-futuristic tactic.\n\nInstead of getting together to write and record, the Transatlantic five-piece set up an online hub for their homemade demos. They tasked each other with delivering a set number of songs per week \u2013 each of which the other band members could modify at will. \u201cI think we all knew the intensity of how good we wanted to make the record.\u201d says drummer Olly Peacock. Many months were committed to focusing these musical chain letters. Over 50 compositions whittled down and blended.\n\nThe resulting tight, 10-song long-player was perfected in two ten-day sessions in Charlottesville, VA with longtime friend Sam Farrar (Phantom Planet) whose role was strongly editorial \u201cUnlike other producers we've worked with, in Sam we had somebody who was familiar with our entire back catalog, and knew what it was that we were going after,\u201d says Tom Gray. \u201cHe could help us achieve our aims even better than we could ourselves.\u201d This return to a form of self-production seems to have allowed Gomez to incorporate the lush pop of recent records like How We Operate with the free-form feel of early, beloved Gomez albums like Bring it On.\n\nThis is a record in glorious Technicolor; the sound of a band enjoying themselves\u2026not alone though. The other musicians on the record include Luke Steele (Empire of the Sun, Sleepy Jackson) and Stuart Bogie (Antibalas, TV on the Radio, Iron and Wine). Whatever's On Your Mind shares a lineage with In Our Gun, thanks to both a preponderance of strings and horns (check out the brass on the opening track, \u201cOptions\u201d, the punctuation-abetted, groovy \u201cI Will Take You There,\u201d and the seasonal swells of the pre-chorus to \u201cX-Rays\u201d) and an electronic dance-aspect that always carries along with it some sort of guitar chunkiness. (\u201cSong In My Heart\u201d begins almost Gaga-esque before its keyboard lick is replicated by a strummed acoustic). At 38 minutes it's Gomez's shortest album to date, there is no fat on the disc.\n\nStill, it maintains Gomez's trademarks: Ben Ottewell's gritty vocals tear through the carefully arranged background harmonies of \u201cThe Place and The People,\u201d while bassist Paul \u201cBlackie\u201d Blackburn's overdriven bass gives a near-African beat to \u201cEqualize,\u201d and \u201cJust as Lost As You\u201d finds Ball yearning and introspective, while somehow still sounding hopefully positive, as the band explodes behind him in a memorable, throttling thrust. The title track alone should convince you that this is a band reaching further than they have before to achieve a balance in their work between musical exploration and lyrical content. The songwriting is adult, but the spirit is freewheeling.\n\nThe change of pace and influx of creativity has helped the band find themselves again. \"Sometimes we might have been a little trapped by our own muso-ness\" says Gray, \"but this album is liberating. It doesn't feel at all stuffy. It's a real joy.\" Whatever\u2019s On Your Mind finds Gomez driving forward on a beautifully lush and dynamic album. There is a fresh feeling of rebirth and awakening. One to raise a smile even from the naysayers.

Artists across the board have discovered Jacobs\u2019 musicianship and supple versatility, resulting in an impressive variety of formats in which he has played over the last few years. After a decade, five records, and 200 shows a year as principal songwriter and frontman for beloved Baltimore-based band The Bridge from 2001-2011, Jacobs wasted no time continuing to write music of his own and exploring different configurations for his craft. He released his debut solo album, Songs for Cats and Dogs, in 2012, and continued to perform relentlessly, both with his new band and as a solo artist. In doing so, he quickly garnered the admiration of a variety of predecessors and peers: rock legend Steve Winwood saw Jacobs perform in 2014 and soon invited him to open his national tour. The following year, Sturgill Simpson extended the same invitation. Never limited by genre, Jacobs and New Orleans heavyweight Ivan Neville recorded a collaborative album under the band name \u201cNeville Jacobs\u201d, which will be released in 2017. As an adapting, evolving, versatile musician who has survived on his own merit, Jacobs continues to win over audiences of many tastes, as he brings his characteristic authenticity and soul to every set.\n\nJacobs feels there are common threads across many genres of music, and he has harnessed over a decade of trans-genre exploration on his second solo album, Dust to Gold, released in 2016, from American Showplace Music. The album is a soul-stirring expression of the current chapter of his creative evolution, featuring twelve well-crafted songs that masterfully weave through the sweet and rugged landscape of soul, country, folk, blues, gospel, and rock and roll. Through every turn, one can easily feel Jacobs\u2019 reverence to his influences, but the result is an original, eclectic record with a sound that is authentically his. In a given moment, Jacobs\u2019 guitar playing is gritty, soulful, rich, and lyrical. It\u2019s subtle, yet adventurous. His voice is at once sweet and sultry, with a honeyed whiskey croon that delivers his thoughtful, expressive lyrics.\n\nI know that the well I seek is bound to be the deepest of all been ever told I know that to plant a seed is alchemy, we can watch the dust turn into gold\n\nSo sings the hypnotic refrain in \u201cTurn Into Gold\u201d, a meditative slide-guitar rocker where Jacobs sings about channeling the muse, or \u201ctapping the source\u201d, as he calls it. It\u2019s about the desire to be \u201cenraptured in the mystery, the unknown, the questions, the answers all at once,\u201d Jacobs describes. This is the place in which his songwriting occurs, and from where Jacobs\u2019 performances derive so much electricity. In discussing the song\u2019s inspiration, Jacobs reflects, \u201cif I\u2019m playing or singing and I\u2019m really connected to that source and I\u2019m really locked in and there\u2019s a room full of people experiencing that, the hope is then for them to get locked into their own thing, and it\u2019s this beautiful, ecstatic magic that happens. To me, this is that elusive goal that I chase every time I sit down to write a song or every time I get on stage to perform.\u201d\n\nOther songs on Dust to Gold paint Jacobs\u2019 desire to express the beauty and struggle of the human condition. In \u201cCold Carolina\u201d, Jacobs pleads softly and emotively about a despondent relationship, the feeling of displacement, and the seeking of redemption, of salvation. In \u201cLittle Dreamer\u201d, Jacobs, accompanied by his wife, Kat Jacobs, sings sweetly to their unborn child, whom he discovered was on the way only moments before leaving to start recording the album. \u201cIt\u2019s a blink of an eye, this life / tiny grains in sands of time / so tie your purposes on wings and fly to the heavens with the grace and courage of a thousand kings\u201d, he sings to the tiny, nascent being.\n\nThe opening track, \u201cThe Devil or Jesse James\u201d, is a rousing mixture of New Orleans rhythm, blues, and rock and roll with ethereal tendrils of psychedelic guitar reaching out across the soundscape; painting a tale of a man trying to change identities and run away from one\u2019s past. On the album, the full band includes a richly funky rhythm section, featuring Todd\n\nHerrington on bass, Dusty Ray Simmons on drums, as well as John Ginty on Hammond organ and keyboards, who has been a master side man for years, working with Robert Randolph and the Family Band, Jewel, Citizen Cope; and most currently tours with the Dixie Chicks.\n\nThough \u201cDust to Gold\u201d clearly showcases Jacobs\u2019 well-worn songwriting chops, he is an improviser at heart, and he brings the spirit of seeking and living in the moment to the stage each time. In every performance, he tries to push the envelope, exploring the depth of each song anew. Whether live or on the album, Jacobs\u2019 dynamic voice and guitar envelope the listener completely and instantly, transporting you into the rich, sultry folds of his soulful sound.\n\nCris Jacobs continues to nurture a devoted audience that knows that whatever the instrumentation or setting he plays, it will be richly authentic, and conveyed with an improviser\u2019s curious spirit and palpable presence. We can only expect further evolution from Jacobs, an artist constantly inspired by the search for \u201cthose beautiful, sad, inspiring, heartbreaking magical corners of life. The most rewarding, and terrifying part of trying to be an artist is the journey itself, the vulnerability and riskiness in seeking them out trying to express them. Sometimes you hit dead ends, and sometimes you strike pure gold.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Cris Jacobs - Rockwood Stage 2"}, {"Address": "116 E 16th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Ryan Long", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/126491.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988348, 40.735421], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Jeff Leach, Ian Lara, Aaron Berg, & More!"}, {"Address": "167 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Gal Friday", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.988702, 40.72133], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Slipper Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "An elegant evening of booze, laffs, & boobs.

Since then he has recorded and released 2 albums, and is currently working on his 3rd. In March of 2014 Frank was named Skype / Microsofts Music Brand Ambassador which led him to participate on a panel at TED 2014 with fellow artist Amanda Palmer. Frank's distinctive voice and remarkable knack for expressing an endless gamut of emotions continue to garner him much deserved acclaim.

Over the last 25 years, the four time Grammy-nominated DJ and producer has been astounding audiences across the world with his fusions of house, hip-hop, Latin, jazz, funk & soul, reggae, alternative pop and broken beats. By releasing literally thousands of original tracks and hundreds of remixes, Kenny has earned a reputation as a living encyclopedia of beats as both a solo artist, and as one-half of the legendary house duo, Masters At Work. At an early age, Kenny began absorbing the hip-hop beats being played at local house and block parties in Sunset Park, Brooklyn where he grew up. He began his musical career as a buyer for a local record shop called WNR Music Center, where he broadened his musical knowledge and found his love of \u201cdiggin\u201d for records. To date, Kenny\u2019s collection totals over 50,000 records. In the late 80\u2019s, Mike Delgado, a good friend and partner of Kenny\u2019s, organized a series of parties under the alias Masters At Work which the two of them would play at. Brooklyn DJ/producer Todd Terry attended these parties, and soon after, Kenny would cut school to watch Todd work on beats and record with singers and rappers. The combination of working at the store, learning how records were produced, and being around creative people influenced Kenny to begin his own productions. He then met King Grand (Russell Cole) and the two formed a group called KAOS. In 1987, Kenny and Todd produced the group\u2019s album titled Courts In Session, which was released the next year on Gregg Fore\u2019s label Bad Boy Records. Over time, Kenny had built up the Masters At Work brand from its party-origins, and in 1987 the club hits \u201cAlright Alright\u201d and \u201cDum Dum Cry\u201d were released by Todd Terry under the Masters At Work name. In return for the releases, Todd introduced Kenny to \u201cLittle\u201d Louie Vega, another talented young Bronx DJ. In 1990, Kenny and Louie officially began a creative partnership, appropriately dubbed Masters At Work (MAW), and their sound quickly became a force in the clubs. They were soon sought after by artists and labels, and eventually remixed everyone from Michael Jackson and Luther Vandross, to Madonna and Daft Punk. With Louie influenced by salsa, house and freestyle and Kenny by hip-hop and reggae, the two went on to become labeled by many as the most revolutionary house production team of the 90\u2019s. In 1993, Kenny and Louie collaborated on a project called Nuyorican Soul, which was named after their heritage (Puerto Rican), residence (New York City), and style of music (Soul). During a MAW gig at the Southport Weekender festival in England, Kenny was inspired by the dancers in the jazz room and had an idea for a syncopated beat style of music, which he dubbed the \u201cbroken beat\u201d style. Nuyorican Soul released its first single \u201cThe Nervous Track\u201d on Nervous Records shortly after, which became the first broken beat record ever released. In this time frame, not only did Kenny collaborate with Louie on MAW projects, he also produced and remixed tracks in the hip-hop and reggae scene. \u201cGet Up (Clap Your Hands)\u201d and \u201cThe Madd Racket\u201d were huge club tracks, and he also produced the Unreleased Project which featured Shaggy on the Gunshot\u201d track. Kenny\u2019s breakthrough as a solo artist came in 1995. One night, disheartened by the music that was being released throughout the business, Kenny went home and pulled out a series of classic records, and after three days he\u2019d produced an entire album, The Bucketheads. This was a huge turning point for him, as one track on the album, \u201cThe Bomb (These Sounds Fall Into My Mind)\u201d broke through the European pop charts and became his first major solo hit. Under different aliases, Kenny went on to release numerous projects on influential labels like Strictly Rhythm, Freeze, Nervous, Henry Street Records and TNT. Starting in 2000, and over the next decade, Kenny also went on to create classic remixes for the likes of R. Kelly, Shirley Bassey, The Jackson 5, DJ Gregory, Aaliyah, Soul Fuzion, and Kanye West. Alongside being a DJ and producer, Kenny also holds the title of record label owner. Frank Mendez of Nu Groove Records gave him his first label Dopewax, so that he\u2019d have an outlet to release anything he wanted. Kenny kept the label going after Nu Groove closed its doors, and it\u2019s been a consistent outlet of house music to this day. Initially, the releases were primarily raw, tracky, beat records produced by Kenny. He then started going into the vocal side of things, and even released remixes of Kanye West and Jill Scott tracks on the label. Demos started to come in, and now Dopewax is open to other artists & producers along with Kenny\u2019s music. Kenny has another label, Kay-Dee Records, which focuses on re-recording and releasing rare and classic music: everything from funk, soul & breaks, to gospel and movie soundtracks. It was initially born out of a challenge from Scottish DJ legend Keb Darge, who wanted to come up with a funk version of MAW\u2019s \u201cThe Nervous Track\u201d. Keb came back a short while later with \u201cNervous\u201d by The New Mastersounds, which would be the first release on Kay-Dee. The idea for Kay-Dee then became to record new productions with classic recording techniques. Kenny sought out to find old masters and produce entirely new mixes of them. Not to remix, but to mix down the original and create new masters to give collectors and DJ\u2019s a completely new version. Kay-Dee Records is a true haven for those with a passion for rare \u201creal\u201d music, and a deep love for vinyl. Aside from his own artist projects, Kenny has been a producer for a slew of other artists. For nearly fifteen years, he has produced music for R&B singer Raheem De Vaughn. Kenny produced eleven tracks on Raheem\u2019s 2011 album Love & War Masterpeace, which was Grammy-nominated for Best R&B Album Of The Year. Featured artists of those tracks include Ludacris, Wale, Damian Marley, Jill Scott and Anthony Hamilton. Two of Kenny\u2019s latest projects include producing rapper Rasheed Chappell\u2019s Future Before Nostalgia album, and also putting together a 12-piece funk & soul band called The Fantastic Souls. Throughout his career, Kenny admits there were times when he wasn\u2019t inspired to create music because of what was dominating the new direction of sound. However, learning to listen without prejudice has allowed him to continue to discover new styles, artists and musicians, and keep his love for the music alive. Kenny stays inspired and motivated not by doing what he likes, but doing what he loves. This is what makes his music timeless. Look out for him on tour this summer in Ibiza and throughout the rest of the world, and for new upcoming releases on his Dopewax imprint.

Liberio didn\u2019t always think that a career in music was possible, but he does now. After stints on The Voice Season 4, honing his craft on Vancouver-based cruise ships, and sharing the stage with Justin Bieber, this vocalist and multi-instrumentalist has created a sound of his own.\n\nAnd after playing over 300 shows in 2014 and continuing that streak into 2015, he\u2019s building a fanbase for his loop-based performances and unique style. Often performing a mix of originals and covers, Liberio looks beyond Top 40 and searches for songs both new and old that have the same feel. He also knows his strengths, and blends these songs to fit his aesthetic while maintaining the [core] of each song. An avid music listener, he enjoys blending genres and describes his music as \u201cAdele meets EDM with a hip hop beat\u201d.\n\nLiberio is now known for using a loop pedal and building a band around himself, but it wasn\u2019t always that way. After building a band for a gig but the players not working out long-term, he took inspiration from Ed Sheeran\u2019s approach to a live show. He bought a loop pedal and began learning how to integrate it into his gigs, often sharing with concert-goers how he builds his backing band: himself.\n\nTaking inspiration from a wide variety of musicians and songwriters has helped Liberio create his unique sound. Artists like Billy Joel, Whitney Houston, Chris Cornell, and Adam Levine have inspired him in different ways, and he\u2019s used that to write music that stands out.\n\nHe\u2019s currently working on an EP of originals, \u201cDichotomy\u201d, that he is producing himself. It will feature primarily new music, but also some older music that he\u2019s previously never produced. 2016 will also feature playing multiple shows a week, sometimes with a full band and sometimes continuing his loop-based solo show.\n\nJ. Liberio is the example of a singer/songwriter with the drive, passion, and work ethic it takes to be seen in a busy music landscape. \u201cDichotomy\u201d is described as \u201ca division or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different\u201d, which is how Liberio has created his music to stand out.\n\nConnect with him on Soundcloud, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "315 West 44th St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Nicole Zuraitis Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8256346.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.989689, 40.759], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Contemporary Vocal Jazz, Jazz, Vocal Jazz, Singer, Songwriter, Musician, Singer song writer, folk, americana, singer songwriter, Vocal, jazz vocals, Soul Jazz, Soul-Blues", "Time": "5:30 PM", "Venue": "Birdland", "moreBioInfo": ">> Grammy\u00ae Nominated New York based vocalist and pianist Nicole Zuraitis blends clever songwriting skills, an effervescent presence and unparalleled vocals in a consummate package that has thrilled audiences across Manhattan and across the world.

Produced by Sahaj Ticotin and Howard Benson, September Mourning revives the concept of rock star meets superhero. If Marilyn Manson and X-Men's Storm had a kid, it would be September Mourning, who also cites influences as varied as Motionless In White, Disturbed, and Muse.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor me, the project is a story, a theatrical art piece,\u201d September explains. \u201cMusic is the backbone, but for this to work, it has to include the imagery and the narrative all symbiotically linked into the whole. Music taps into your innermost being. There\u2019s something very intimate and personal about it.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe character of September Mourning is a human-reaper hybrid, who feels the need to give some human souls a second chance, and thus toys with Fate. To expound on this narrative, September is working with iconic comic book artist Marc Silvestri, who started out on the original X-Men comics and went on to form Top Cow Productions (Witchblade, The Darkness). Together, they are putting together the story of September Mourning in graphic form, to accompany, and enhance the musical message.\n\n\n\nHaving performed at large festivals like Rock on the Range and Download Festival and shared the stage with acts like Marilyn Manson and Avatar, September Mourning has already built up an impressive fan base, which she calls her \u201cChildren of Fate,\u201d constantly encouraging them to have \u201cthe courage to embrace their passion\u2026 to allow yourself to follow your heart and not be a slave to your fears.

Sadly, I attempted violin as a young child and was brutally bad. My parents had some how had me listening to classical music at that time which probably explains the violin attempt. Then a miracle happened\u2026First, the Beatles arrived so, bye bye classical & then my aunt who was buying a new piano (the wealthier end of the family) offered me her old one. I\u2019m 8 1/2 so I was still agreeable to anything so I promised to take lessons and really work at it.\n\nI lied\u2026After a year and a half I quit\u2026..until I discovered Elton John. That was it! I was determined to be a musician. In the late 70\u2019s I joined a fairly succesful 50\u2019s/60\u2019s band called Slick. I played 6 nights a week and worked full time at a department store as a stock man (person in this politically correct universe). Exhaustion wasn\u2019t considered. I went to gigs with a thermos of tea and lemon since I was always sick. This lasted until the early 80\u2019s. I joined a band called Loose Change which (under my direction) played anything from the 1960\u2019s- whatever was current. That lasted 12 years. Many years of putting my ears in harms way and breathing in way to much bar smoke told me it was time to quit. This was somewhere around 1993/94 (I don\u2019t remember). The next time I played live was in 2004 at my local block party. That\u2019s what I needed to get the itch to play again but, I was working in retail at Sam Ash Music and simply had no time to gig. In 2007 I was offered a better job which offered me a 9-5 existence. The economy turned sour and earning extra cash became a priority. And then it happened\u2026.I walked into a local Italian restaurant called Vera\u2019s Trattoria to pick up a pizza and lo and behold (fancy words ehh?) a piano player was pumping out Jazz licks. Can you imagine? Live music! I decided to approach the owner to see if I could score a gig. He decided to try me the following week. I was hired as a permanent fixture on Saturday nights. Thus The Richie G Review was born. \u201cA one man band Piano/vocals using backing tracks and a voice harmonizer to create a full band sound. My current song list represents over seventy artists including Elton John, Billy Joel , James Taylor, The Beatles and hits from the 1960\u2019s thru today. Over 500 tunes and counting\u2013 Booking email onemanbandrichieg@gmail.com .\u201d I played at Vera\u2019s for 14 months and then a new owner took over. He decided that entertainment was unnecessary. I got to work recording a CD of covers and creating business cards. The hard work paid off! I\u2019m a permanent Wednesday night fixture at the Woodcliff lake Hilton as well as sprinkling in various weekend gigs.\n\nRidgewood Street Fair 2013-2014\n\n\n\n392561_413258562028352_398683286819213_1318553_160572558_nRIDGEWOOD\n\n\n\nChapter 2- Ginger Martini was Born Right around St Patty\u2019s Day of 2012, I was performing at the Elm Street Grill in Oakland NJ. I was approached by my soon to be partner Wendy Kelly. I was on the floor wiring up my equipment as she, asked me questions about what I do (kind of music, etc). I was excited believing that I was going to be hired for a private party. During the break, she handed me her card.It turned out she was interested in joining me. I wasn\u2019t looking but, I agreed to see what she sounded like at my rehearsal space (haha my basement). Three songs later I was convinced. We sounded great together. A week later, we had 50 plus songs ready for prime time. She joined me at The Paris Inn in Wayne NJ. Ever since we perform around 50% of my gigs together and get an incredible response. Wendy started a seasoned veteran of the Broadway, Standard, and Country Genres. She has since dragged me into her country word as I dragged her into my pop/rock world.

Curtis\n\n\n\nreleased the album in 2015 just before hitting the road again for a North American tour. The album featured a recording of \u201cBootleg Gasoline\u201d which was also made into a music video in 2016.

Known for her smooth, effortless sound, sensitive interpretations, satisfying swing, and unique approach to the American songbook, Audrey sings with a style that radiates her warm, generous personality. Jazztimes\u2019 Christopher Loudon writes, \u201c\u2026her voice is like pure sterling. Her phrasing is exquisite, her clarity and enunciation on par with the great Jo Stafford and her breath control\u2014a talent so often, and so wrongfully, overlooked\u2014rivals Sinatra\u2019s.\"\n\n\n\nAudrey\u2019s steady stream of appearances\u2014including recent performances at the Tanglewood Jazz Festival and New York\u2019s prestigious JVC Jazz Festival\u2014have made her more sought after than ever. Based in New York City, she regularly performs at numerous venues including 55 Bar, Bargemusic, Sweet Rhythm, Cleopatra\u2019s Needle, and The Kitano Hotel. She has become a familiar face at the Metropolitan Room and recently completed a five-month engagement at Bruno Jamais Restaurant and Club.\n\n\n\nAudrey received critical praise for her \u201cvocal prowess\u201d in her debut album, Here In My Arms, in which she worked with an extraordinary line-up of musicians: pianist John Cowherd, bassist Doug Weiss, drummer Gerald Cleaver, guitarist Chis Bergson, percussionist Daniel Sadownick, and David Mann on flute and saxophones. In 2009, Audrey produced her latest CD, Dream Awhile, which features many of the players that have worked with her in New York clubs throughout her career, including pianist Joe Barbato, bassist Joe Fitzgerald, guitarist Chris Bergson, and drummers Anthony Pinciotti and Todd Isler. The recording wowed critics, who lauded her thoughtful, charming, and uniquely personal interpretations of 11 lesser-known jazz standards.\n\n\n\nAudrey is a storyteller at heart, a performer who loves connecting with her audiences. She respects the power of lyrics, but is equally fascinated by how an artist can alter the mood, meaning and impact of a song through its arrangement. Audrey has an insatiable desire to learn, a vast repertoire, years of jazz piano studies, a well-developed ear for scat and improv, and a musically open mind. These elements combine to make Audrey a singer, bandleader and arranger who delights her audiences and fellow musicians. An avid researcher and broad listener, Audrey continuously adds to her distinctive musical vocabulary, and always surprises audiences with her delightfully original versions of jazz standards. Also inspired by the cabaret world, she enjoys sharing anecdotes between songs, offering an unusually friendly, intimate, and enlightening jazz atmosphere.\n\n\n\nAudrey started studying classical piano and cello as a young child, but deep down she alway wanted to be a singer. Audrey explored her love of jazz and popular song by spending hours absorbing the styles of Fred Astaire (she also studied tap) and singing along with the various Broadway musicals\u2014such as The Pajama Game and Guys and Dolls\u2014that comprised much of her father\u2019s record collection. Audrey finally began to explore her vocal skills while studying at Brown University, where she founded the school\u2019s first co-ed jazz a cappella group, The Higher Keys, for which she transcribed and arranged for the first time.\n\n\n\nAfter graduation, her love of music led to employment in the marketing and A&R departments of CBS Masterworks (now SONY Classical) and then as the Director of Marketing for Chesky Records. She earned an MBA at Columbia Business School and worked as an account executive for advertising giant Ogilvy & Mather. But eventually her deep love for jazz drew her back to singing.\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Audrey met Jon Raney (pianist and son of jazz great, Jimmy Raney). He encouraged her to pursue a career as a singer, and worked with her on a demo in 2000 alongside drummer Ronnie Zito (whose rhythmic skills drove the bands of Woody Herman and Bobby Darin) and bassist Jay Leonhart (a Judy Garland and Tony Bennett favorite). Audrey has also studied privately with vocal priestess Sheila Jordan, as well as Mark Murphy, Grammy nominee and four-time winner of the Downbeat Readers Poll for Male Jazz Singer of the Year. According to Murphy, Audrey \u201chas that rare quality of light infectious swing that lights up her tall willowy persona.\u201d\n\n\n\nAudrey\u2019s eclectic background and tireless curiosity continue to inform her understated, intelligent style. Inspired by numerous jazz greats including Joe Williams, Anita O'Day, and Bill Evans, she\u2019s also influenced by an array of musicians and styles, including pop diva Annie Lennox, Yoruban chant, the Brazilian jazz guitarist/composer Djavan, and the atonal explorations of classical composer Arnold Schoenberg.\n\n\n\nEver the explorer, Audrey continues to expand her musical and creative horizons. She is currently working on numerous projects, including a show of her original songs, a recording of early jazz tunes, and a tribute to legendary vocalist Anita O\u2019Day.

Casually virtuosic\u201d (The Guardian)\n\nBarb Jungr was born in the northwest of England in a little mill town, Rochdale, known then as the home of Gracie Fields. Something that everyone who heard her singing on the pavement said as they walked past. \u201cOh she\u2019s like a young Gracie Fields!\u201d. Like Gracie Fields she has had an extensive career as a vocal artist and an entertainer. Growing up in Stockport in the rain, with a Czech father and German mother meant she developed comedic talent very early on, alongside a love of and passion for, music.\n\nThe family moved to Stockport when she was 7, where they found had a garden and an indoor toilet, a great change for the young Barb, who immediately set about organising the other children into shows, which often involed the use of crepe paper. She survived a Convent education by being good at singing, sports and being very, very naughty - not quite bad enough to be bad, per se, but bad enough to be elected as Deputy Head Girl by the bad girls so they had someone on their team on the inside, as it were.\n\nJungr played the violin rather well, and was in the orchestra and school shows, when she wasn\u2019t hurtling down a hockey pitch with a dangerous stick or belting around a netball court, for the Catholic school league. If you really want to understand competition, join a Convent netball team.\n\nJungr began making music with 3 schoolfriends who took the local folk clubs by storm, or at least by a light wind. She studied botany at Leeds, don\u2019t ask her why, and saw a lot of bands, and played in a lot of bands. She left University to avoid doing a PhD on 6 annuals on the Derbyshire limestone and moved to London, where a boyfriend told her she should be using her vocal talent, because only an idiot wouldn\u2019t. So she did.\n\nFrom there she made records, joined bands, and found herself in among the wondrous community of the newly emerging alternative cabaret movement alongside some of the biggest names in British comedy today, many of whom she counts as friends. She won a Perrier Award with Arnold Brown and her musical partner Michael Parker, made radio programmes, toured the UK, and learned everything anyone ever needs to know about costume from Julian Clary alongside whom she worked on TV, radio and tours for some years.\n\nIn the 1990\u2019s she started to make themed shows, travelled all over the world singing and giving workshops (including the bush in Cameroon and more) and developed as a solo artist. By this time she\u2019d started to work with great musicians and arrangers, from all backgrounds musical and more, and returned to Edinburgh relaunched and revitalised in a collection called \u201cSex Religion and Politics\u201d, which has been her focus lyrically for some time. Her affinity with and for the works of Brel, Dylan and Cohen has been well documented. She emerged not only as a great vocal artist but also as an entertainer.\n\nShe began to travel to and from New York, and now has several awards for her work from there. She tours America, Australia and works in mainland Europe, in short, she\u2019s come a long way, that little girl from Rochdale and Stockport.\n\nShe writes for theatre, other singers and herself.

His passionate performances are punctuated by a crisp acoustic guitar and soaring tenor vocals.

And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.\n\nKyle takes in the world, processes it and turns it into song with his own special touch.

His songs are autobiographical anthems of growing up in South Central Pennsylvania with a passion for \u201890s country, a reverence for the guitar masters, and a self-awareness that connects like super glue with his growing fan base.\n\nGenuine in his songwriting, gifted in his self-taught musicianship, and energetic in his stage performance, Gallaher doesn\u2019t just understand his fans: he is cut from the same cloth. Whether he is performing in a dusty roadhouse or a state prison he delivers his truth in songs that reflect the dignity of simple things and a deeply-rooted respect for what matters.\n\nHis voice is as raw as unvarnished wood with a smoky texture reflective of the backwoods bars where he honed his unbridled stage craft. He commits completely to the emotional quality of each cut and his vocals are earnest and believable.\n\n\u201cConway Twitty said something like \u2018A good country song takes a page out of someone\u2019s life and puts it to music,\u2019\u201d Gallaher recalled. \u201cI think about that with every song I write. When someone hears my music, my hope is that they relate to it.\u201d\n\nGallaher was a toddler when he started banging Campbell\u2019s soup cans with pencils as drumsticks. He grew up in Camp Hill, PA. His family wasn\u2019t musical, but they recognized musical talent and bought him his first guitar when he was 6 years old. He still has it.\n\n\u201cI fell in love with it,\u201d Gallaher said. \u201cI always felt that music was instilled in me; it was God\u2019s plan. It just fit me. I didn\u2019t have a choice. I had to play music.\u201d\n\nHe is equally obsessive about the outdoors. He grew up hunting and fishing and also earned the highest rank attainable in the Boy Scouts of America, Eagle Scout. The designation was founded more than 100 years ago and only four percent of Boy Scouts are granted this honor.\n\nHe brought that passion and dedication to Nashville. After a year at his family\u2019s alma mater Penn State, he enrolled at Belmont University to learn everything he could about the music business. He quickly formed a four-piece band, played weekend gigs up the Eastern corridor, and showed up for class on Monday morning.\n\n\u201cTalk about two different worlds,\u201d he laughed. \u201cHere I was renting a van before I could buy one. I was just so fixated on the whole road thing and how to work a crowd. You can\u2019t learn that in a classroom, you have to do it.\u201d\n\nWhat it taught him was an appreciation for hard work, preparation, and an even deeper fondness for the foundation of the format including the icons of the \u201890s who influenced his childhood musical manna: Brooks & Dunn, Travis Tritt, Vince Gill and Tim McGraw.\n\nA now signed Warner/Chappell songwriter, Gallaher has opened for Lynyrd Skynyrd, Hank Williams Jr., Blake Shelton, 3 Doors Down, Lee Brice, and more. 2019 will mark the 9th year he has toured the Pennsylvania State Prisons on his annual, \u201cBarbed Tour.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "6 Delancey St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Anna of the North", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7858689.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.993383, 40.720353], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bowery Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "Alternative Pop \u2014 Scandinavia Listen to new single \"Oslo\" on Spotify: http://found.ee/oslolisten", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "5 Seymour St., Montclair, NJ 07042", "Artist": "Ms. Lauryn Hill", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8611782.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.216499, 40.812501], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop, Soul", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Wellmont Theater", "moreBioInfo": "Ms. Lauryn Hill\u2019s prolific rhymes catapulted her into the public eye as a member of the Fugees & as a solo artist with her debut The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "526 Main St, Islip, NY 11751", "Artist": "Rorie Kelly", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8984026.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.21261, 40.72936], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: singer-songwriter", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Blue Restaurant & Bar", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cIndependent, free, and full of complexity.

If not for an intervention - stumbling upon the catalog of Weird Al Yankovic at 11 years old - he would have followed in his father\u2019s path or perhaps become a jazz purist. But Weird Al changed everything. Jake started a parody band and sang his newly-written lyrics to classics like \u201cAll Star\u201d by Smashmouth and \u201cMen in Black\u201d by Will Smith, along with composing new family classics such as \u201cAmy, You\u2019re Turning 49\u201d and \u201cCharles, Charles Sherman.\u201d\n\nFast forward some years beyond his time studying at Berklee College of Music and it\u2019s clear Jake has found a way to combine his appreciation of great songwriting with his piano/organ-playing prowess. He has become a go-to musician on recordings, and tours for artists including Meshell Ndegeocello, Bilal, Andrew Bird and Nick Hakim. Chance the Rapper\u2019s Grammy-winning song \u201cNo Problem\u201d includes some of Jake\u2019s work.\n\nMore recently, Jake has re-tapped his well of musicality and songmaking to create his upcoming album, Jake Sherman Gets Sexy. Due out in March 2020, the album is a journey through modern dating and relationships, with a point of view that is somehow both poignant and Weird Al-esque.\n\n\nInstagram and Twitter:\n@JakeShermanWooo", "otherInfo": "Elliott Skinner\u2019s \u201cIt Must Be Love\u201d w/ Special Guest Jake Sherman - Rockwood Stage 2"}, {"Address": "127 E 23rd St, New York, NY 11226", "Artist": "EarthGang", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9349168.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.984987, 40.739781], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Hip-Hop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Gramercy Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "Earthgang isn\u2019t here to \u201csave Hip Hop.\u201d They aren\u2019t here to change how you think of their hometown of Atlanta, Georgia or the music that comes from it either. Even though the duo comprised of Doctur Dot and Johnny Venus are more than capable of pulling off such feats, they are here to instill something simpler. Something bigger. Something that you, the listener, the fan, the artist, the critic may not even realize that you need yet:\n\nFreedom to be yourself.\n\nThat freedom is what attracted the duo to each other when they were students at Southwest Atlanta\u2019s storied Benjamin E. Mays High School. Roaming the same hallways that produced all four members of Goodie Mob decades before them, Earthgang first met each other during an emergency evacuation. After seeing that they had similar tastes in music ranging from Madonna to Madlib, their relationship blossomed from casual conversations about rap to forming a group of their own. But before they even recorded their first project together, they already found themselves hitting the road as they each enrolled at prestigious HBCU Hampton University in Virginia. Though both of them attended the college on academic scholarships with Dot majoring in Psychology and Venus studying to be an architect, they found themselves using the campus as their recording studio.\n\nThe work paid off as Earthgang\u2019s first two projects, 2010\u2019s The Better Party and 2011\u2019s Mad Men landed them shows on both ends of the country at the Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival and Stanford University\u2019s Blackfest. Their follow-up mixtape Good News, backed by energetic live shows, boosted their profile in Atlanta\u2019s congested indie rap scene, but it was their ambitious 2012 debut album Shallow Graves For Toys that captured nationwide attention and peaked at #11 on the Billboard Emerging Artists chart. The wide-ranging project displayed their ability to create with acoustic folk singers like Marian Mereba as well as chest-thumping declarations with producers 808 Mafia (Gucci Mane, Waka Flocka Flame) with Noisey calling it \u201cone of the most well thought-out releases of the year.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur projects are more conceptual than just making songs,\u201d insists Doctur Dot, whose handle is based off his childhood nickname \u201cDoc,\u201d which he earned for always seeming to have answers for everything. \u201cWe are making ourselves vulnerable to the world through our music. Most people don\u2019t allow themselves to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe set out to make the best music that feels the best to us,\u201d adds Johnny Venus, whose name derives from his astrological sign Libra, but challenges the common perception of the symbol by making it asexual. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural synergy for us. We don\u2019t just try to make explosions happen.\u201d\n\nEarthgang\u2019s most recent offering Torba did just that as they showcased their versatility alongside the likes of both Mac Miller and OG Maco over production that ranged from hazy to urgent. That release, coupled with successful tours opening for Ab Soul and Fashawn, Earthgang took another step towards becoming one of the most unique voices in Hip Hop today. Their upcoming album Strays With Rabies (released through their Spillage Village imprint) aims to put their evolving songwriting skills at the forefront after already proving their rap skills to be far above average.\n\nWith a lyrical spectrum that has graduated from \u201choping your mama lose her temper\u201d on Mad Men to \u201cseeing the whole world with my eyes closed\u201d on Torba, Earthgang is rapidly growing into a musical force that will liberate listeners from all walks of life.

Her arrangements are thoughtful and complex, and her sumptuous powerhouse of a voice will leave you awed at the 5\u20192 framed young Indian woman.\n\nThe Dreamer, produced by Neha and mastered by award-winning engineer Mark Donahue, is the singer-songwriter\u2019s debut album, arriving as a delicate and fresh surprise, chock-full of lasting impressions. Neha (pronounced NEY-ha) penned eleven of the twelve tunes on her album, demonstrating her prowess as an artful songwriter.\n\nA gifted singer, composer & pianist, Neha\u2019s style can be characterized as a smorgasbord of musical personalities. She cites influences such as Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Otis Redding, Donny Hathaway, Sam Cooke, Dinah Washington, and Carmen MacRae, to name a few. While definitely rooted in jazz, elements of folk, blues, pop and her mother's classical indian musical background also permeate.\n\nA graduate of Northwestern University with a degree in Economics, Neha spent four years post-college working for the tech giant, Google, Inc in the Bay Area. She penned some of her first tracks from her cubicle, and spent much of her free time hitting the jam sessions and songwriting open mics in San Francisco before quitting to pursue her Masters degree at the prestigious New England Conservatory of Music.\n\nSince graduating from NEC in May of 2012, Neha been actively engaged in the Boston performance scene, performing at prestigious venues like Scullers Jazz Club, Lizard Lounge, and Club Passim. In New York, her performance credits include headlining at the famous off-Broadway show \"Sleep No More,\" and being regulars at venues such as The Rockwood Music Hall, Jazz at the Kitano Room, and Caffe Vivaldi. Most recently, Neha came off a mini tour performing the world premiere of \"Project Gilgamesh\" in Cleveland, Ohio written by multi-talented contemporary violinist and composer Daniel Bernard Roumain.\n\nAn account of all things reverie, The Dreamer openly explores Neha\u2019s deepest personal thoughts and wants. Songs like \u201cThe Dreamer,\u201d and \u201cWay Back Then\u201d explore her desire to go against cultural and social expectations of her, while songs \"The Darkness\" and \"Whole\" give us an intimate understanding of who Neha is as a person. Other songs like \"The Willow Tree,\" and \"The French Man\" play on her innocence and penchant for day dreaming, delivered through charming lyrics and wispy vocal lines.\n\n\nBacked-up by her exceptionally talented six bandmates whom she met at NEC (Connor Baker - drums, Evan Allen - piano, Dorsey Bass - bass, Bobby Spellman - Trumpet, Katie Seiler - vocals, Rachel Panitch - violin and vocals), The Dreamer is a tenderly crafted record, a definitive smorgasbord of Neha\u2019s life experiences. Rooted in her love affair with jazz, folk, blues, and her mother\u2019s long standing classical Indian musical training, the record results in a gorgeously personal and open account of Neha's life and deepest vulnerabilities, painted in piercing melodies and whimsically crafted arrangements.\n\n\"Music is as necessary to me as food or air\" says the first generation Indian-American singer-songwriter. \"Leaving the life I led in San Francisco [at Google] and starting all over was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but definitely the most gratifying as well. I spent so much of my life dancing around [creativity], wishing I could be part of that community of creating music and art, but never had the courage to follow through. Finally I just realized I owed it to myself to really go for it, head first. Everyone should have the chance to pursue what they've always envisioned for themselves.\"\n\nNeha currently resides in Brooklyn, NY where she teaches on the faculty at the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music in Park Slope and at the Jalopy Theater and Music School in Red Hook.

It was only in 2011 that they decided to go in a different direction and form \"Owls & Lions,\" a project that would allow them to perform a lot of the more soulful laid-back music Jay had written and stored up over the years. As they built up credibility and momentum performing at Weddings & Private Events - they continued to perform their original music throughout venues in the NJ/NYC area. Nicole being from Nebraska and Jay a born and bred Jersey boy- they soon learned they possessed a unique kind of charm that came through in the way they performed their music as a duo. It only took a few years for \"Owls & Lions\" to take off and become the popular musical act that it is today.\n\nAs well as being a singing/guitar playing Lion- Jay Della Valle is Owner of the Award Winning DJ/Entertainment Company, Spinners Entertainment.

With a love of music and skateboarding, Lindell formed a few punky garage bands early on while his musical horizons expanded. He listened to the deep blues of Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Jimmy Reed and Albert King before drifting toward the R&B sounds of The Impressions, Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway, soaking up the soul and learning how to craft a song. After performing at bars on the West Coast with a few short-lived bands, Eric formed his own group in 1993. He quickly gained a loyal Northern California audience thanks to countless performances and many late-night jam sessions. Established stars like Charlie Musselwhite and Tom Waits attended his shows, as did overflow crowds of music fans.\n\nWith music on his mind, Lindell headed to New Orleans in 1999, where he quickly discovered the pulsating and dynamic roots scene. He gravitated toward the West Bank dive bars of Gretna and Algiers, where he befriended many older area musicians who helped him get regular work as a performer. Some of New Orleans' finest players, including keyboardist Ivan Neville and drummers Harold Brown (War), Stanton Moore (Galactic) and Johnny Vidacovich (Professor Longhair, Astral Project) often joined him on stage. Galactic bassist Rob Mercurio began sitting in as well, and word of Lindell's immense talents quickly spread around the city. Stars like Branford Marsalis, The Neville Brothers and John Scofield began showing up at his gigs and embracing this fresh California kid's funky music. According to Lindell, \"It's a great feeling to be recognized for your music in New Orleans.\" Since 2003, in addition to his own gigs, Lindell regularly joins forces with Ivan Neville, Moore and Mercurio (when time and schedules permit) and they perform to overflow crowds as Dragon Smoke.\n\n2006's Change In The Weather delighted and surprised music fans hungry for a truly original artist. Lindell's deceptively simple sounding songs, laid back grooves and hook-laden melodies were fueled by guests including Brown, Neville and Moore. Critics across the country went wild, with reviews and features in Relix, OffBeat, Guitar Player, Down Beat, The New Yorker, The New York Press and many other national and regional publications. Singer And Musician magazine put Eric on the cover and many newspaper entertainment sections did the same.\n\n2007's Low On Cash, Rich In Love and 2009's Gulf Coast Highway pushed Lindell farther into the spotlight. Appearances on Late Night With Conan O'Brien and National Public Radio's Mountain Stage solidified his stature as an artist who simply could not be ignored. Many of his songs have appeared in films and television shows, including Boston Legal and Treme. He has collaborated and shared stages with blues and rock luminaries, including John Fogerty, Luther Dickinson and Anson Funderburgh.\n\nWith Revolution In Your Heart, Lindell was more than ready to come home to Alligator. \"The timing is perfect. I'm so excited to get back to focusing on what I do and have such a great team behind me,\" he says. Upon release of the album, Lindell and his band will tour heavily, reuniting with old friends and, as always, earning new fans at every stop.

Born on a military base in Nogales, Arizona in 1922 and raised in Watts, California, his earliest musical influences came from the church\u2013 choir and group singing\u2013 and from \u201chearing Duke Ellington over the radio when [he] was eight years old.\u201d He studied double bass and composition in a formal way (five years with H. Rheinshagen, principal bassist of the New York Philharmonic, and compositional techniques with the legendary Lloyd Reese) while absorbing vernacular music from the great jazz masters, first-hand. His early professional experience, in the 40\u2019s, found him touring with bands like Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory and Lionel Hampton.\n\nEventually he settled in New York where he played and recorded with the leading musicians of the 1950\u2019s\u2013 Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Art Tatum and Duke Ellington himself. One of the few bassists to do so, Mingus quickly developed as a leader of musicians. He was also an accomplished pianist who could have made a career playing that instrument. By the mid-50\u2019s he had formed his own publishing and recording companies to protect and document his growing repertoire of original music. He also founded the \u201cJazz Workshop,\u201d a group which enabled young composers to have their new works performed in concert and on recordings.\n\nMingus soon found himself at the forefront of the avant-garde. His recordings bear witness to the extraordinarily creative body of work that followed. They include: Pithecanthropus Erectus, The Clown, Tijuana Moods, Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Ah Um, The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, Cumbia and Jazz Fusion, Let My Children Hear Music. He recorded over a hundred albums and wrote over three hundred scores.\nAlthough he wrote his first concert piece, \u201cHalf-Mast Inhibition,\u201d when he was seventeen years old, it was not recorded until twenty years later by a 22-piece orchestra with Gunther Schuller conducting. It was the presentation of \u201cRevelations\u201d which combined jazz and classical idioms, at the 1955 Brandeis Festival of the Creative Arts, that established him as one of the foremost jazz composers of his day.\n\nIn 1971 Mingus was awarded the Slee Chair of Music and spent a semester teaching composition at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In the same year his autobiography, Beneath the Underdog, was published by Knopf. In 1972 it appeared in a Bantam paperback and was reissued after his death, in 1980, by Viking/Penguin and again by Pantheon Books, in 1991. In 1972 he also re-signed with Columbia Records. His music was performed frequently by ballet companies, and Alvin Ailey choreographed an hour program called \u201cThe Mingus Dances\u201d during a 1972 collaboration with the Robert Joffrey Ballet Company.\n\nHe toured extensively throughout Europe, Japan, Canada, South America and the United States until the end of 1977 when he was diagnosed as having a rare nerve disease, Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis. He was confined to a wheelchair, and although he was no longer able to write music on paper or compose at the piano, his last works were sung into a tape recorder.\n\nFrom the 1960\u2019s until his death in 1979 at age 56, Mingus remained in the forefront of American music. When asked to comment on his accomplishments, Mingus said that his abilities as a bassist were the result of hard work but that his talent for composition came from God.\n\nMingus received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Smithsonian Institute, and the Guggenheim Foundation (two grants). He also received an honorary degree from Brandeis and an award from Yale University. At a memorial following Mingus\u2019 death, Steve Schlesinger of the Guggenheim Foundation commented that Mingus was one of the few artists who received two grants and added: \u201cI look forward to the day when we can transcend labels like jazz and acknowledge Charles Mingus as the major American composer that he is.\u201d The New Yorker wrote: \u201cFor sheer melodic and rhythmic and structural originality, his compositions may equal anything written in western music in the twentieth century.\u201d\n\nHe died in Mexico on January 5, 1979, and his wife, Sue Graham Mingus, scattered his ashes in the Ganges River in India. Both New York City and Washington, D.C. honored him posthumously with a \u201cCharles Mingus Day.\u201d\n\nAfter his death, the National Endowment for the Arts provided grants for a Mingus foundation created by Sue Mingus called \u201cLet My Children Hear Music\u201d which catalogued all of Mingus\u2019 works. The microfilms of these works were then given to the Music Division of the New York Public Library where they are currently available for study and scholarship \u2013 a first for jazz. Sue Mingus has founded three working repertory bands called the Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Orchestra, and the Mingus Big Band, which continue to perform his music. Biographies of Charles Mingus include Mingus by Brian Priestley, Mingus/Mingus by Janet Coleman and Al Young, Myself When I Am Real by Gene Santoro, and Tonight at Noon, a memoir by Sue Mingus.\n\nMingus\u2019 masterwork, \u201cEpitaph,\u201d a composition which is more than 4000 measures long and which requires two hours to perform, was discovered during the cataloguing process. With the help of a grant from the Ford Foundation, the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by Gunther Schuller, in a concert produced by Sue Mingus at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989, ten years after Mingus\u2019 death.\n\nThe New Yorker wrote that \u201cEpitaph\u201d represents the first advance in jazz composition since Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cBlack, Brown, and Beige,\u201d which was written in 1943. The New York Times said it ranked with the \u201cmost memorable jazz events of the decade.\u201d Convinced that it would never be performed in his lifetime, Mingus called his work \u201cEpitaph,\u201d declaring that he wrote it \u201cfor my tombstone.\u201d\n\nThe Library of Congress purchased the Charles Mingus Collection, a major acquisition, in 1993; this included autographed manuscripts, photographs, literary manuscripts, correspondence, and tape recordings of interviews, broadcasts, recording sessions, and Mingus composing at the piano.\n\nSue Mingus has published a number of educational books through Hal Leonard Publishing, including Charles Mingus: More Than a Fake Book, Charles Mingus: More Than a Play-Along, Charles Mingus: Easy Piano Solos, many big band charts\u2014 including the Simply Mingus set of big band music charts\u2013 and a Mingus guitar book.\n\nReprinted in part from More than a Fake Book \u00a9 1991 Jazz Workshop, Inc.\n\nLinks to Additional Biographical and Historical Information on the Web\n\nLibrary of Congress\nAn index to the holdings of the Charles Mingus Collection, Music Division of the Library of Congress.\nhttp://www.loc.gov/performingarts/encyclopedia/collections/mingus.html", "otherInfo": "Jazz Standard proudly presents our tenth annual Mingus High School Competition 1979).

Connor tracked Mr. Goggin down at Trout Recording in Brooklyn and handed him dozens of demos. Goggin found some gems in the dozens of 4 track tunes, and it wasn't long before Connor and Goggin had recorded Plug In - Connor\u2019s debut solo effort (think Ben Folds hanging out with Billy Bragg listening to Guided by Voices). A big fat positive response, including an nod for Best Lyrics in American Songwriter Magazine, sent Connor on a whirlwind tour across the U.S and as far away as the Middle East.\n\nIn the years that followed, Connor released three more solo albums with Bryce Goggin producing, including the EP Blood like Fire (Songs for Syria) - a charity album about the war in Syria. 100% of the proceeds from this EP are allocated to educating Syrian refugee children via the Karam Foundation. Singles from the Songs for Syria EP received heavy rotation on TV and radio stations thoughought the entire Middle East. During 2013, Connor would get a call from a friend in Iraq or a relative in Saudi Arabia that his video was on TV. Connor has continued to advocate for awareness of the Syrian crisis with several video singles. Currently, his song Man of Peace is featured in the Oscar contending documentary Little Gandhi, about one of the Syrian Revolution's greatest peace activists Ghiyath Matar.\n\nIn June of 2015, a stranger pulled up to Dylan's house in Connecticut and left a large package on the front porch. When he got home later that day, Connor opened the heavy box to find a custom Martin acoustic guitar, and a note that said 'happy strumming.\" This mysterious gift provided the fuel that Dylan needed to put the finishing touches on a trove of unfinished songs. Connor had been composing fragments of material in places as mundane as his living room, and as exotic as Turkey, Cyprus, and Germany. In February 2016 , Connor headed into the studio with Bryce Goggin at the helm of course. They resurfaced in August of that year with a 10 song LP titled Spirit Glue. The title emanates from the friends and family here and here after who made the songs and recordings possible: the one hundred and twenty fans who funded the album through PledgeMusic; the former high school student who painted the cover portrait; the soul brother who directed and edited an accompanying music video for every song on the record; and the musicians who donated their talents to the tracks. Spirit Glue is now available on all digital platforms including iTunes, Amazon, GooglePlay, Spotify, etc.\nAND is available on vinyl through cdbaby.com and dylanconnor.com.\n\nMost recently, Dylan wrote the song \"Bring you Back\" for the feature film \"Adverse\" starring Mickey Rourke, Lou Diamond Phillips, and Sean Astin.", "otherInfo": "Solo gig.

His early professional experience, in the 40\u2019s, found him touring with bands like Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory and Lionel Hampton.\n\nEventually he settled in New York where he played and recorded with the leading musicians of the 1950\u2019s\u2013 Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Art Tatum and Duke Ellington himself. One of the few bassists to do so, Mingus quickly developed as a leader of musicians. He was also an accomplished pianist who could have made a career playing that instrument. By the mid-50\u2019s he had formed his own publishing and recording companies to protect and document his growing repertoire of original music. He also founded the \u201cJazz Workshop,\u201d a group which enabled young composers to have their new works performed in concert and on recordings.\n\nMingus soon found himself at the forefront of the avant-garde. His recordings bear witness to the extraordinarily creative body of work that followed. They include: Pithecanthropus Erectus, The Clown, Tijuana Moods, Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Ah Um, The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, Cumbia and Jazz Fusion, Let My Children Hear Music. He recorded over a hundred albums and wrote over three hundred scores.\nAlthough he wrote his first concert piece, \u201cHalf-Mast Inhibition,\u201d when he was seventeen years old, it was not recorded until twenty years later by a 22-piece orchestra with Gunther Schuller conducting. It was the presentation of \u201cRevelations\u201d which combined jazz and classical idioms, at the 1955 Brandeis Festival of the Creative Arts, that established him as one of the foremost jazz composers of his day.\n\nIn 1971 Mingus was awarded the Slee Chair of Music and spent a semester teaching composition at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In the same year his autobiography, Beneath the Underdog, was published by Knopf. In 1972 it appeared in a Bantam paperback and was reissued after his death, in 1980, by Viking/Penguin and again by Pantheon Books, in 1991. In 1972 he also re-signed with Columbia Records. His music was performed frequently by ballet companies, and Alvin Ailey choreographed an hour program called \u201cThe Mingus Dances\u201d during a 1972 collaboration with the Robert Joffrey Ballet Company.\n\nHe toured extensively throughout Europe, Japan, Canada, South America and the United States until the end of 1977 when he was diagnosed as having a rare nerve disease, Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis. He was confined to a wheelchair, and although he was no longer able to write music on paper or compose at the piano, his last works were sung into a tape recorder.\n\nFrom the 1960\u2019s until his death in 1979 at age 56, Mingus remained in the forefront of American music. When asked to comment on his accomplishments, Mingus said that his abilities as a bassist were the result of hard work but that his talent for composition came from God.\n\nMingus received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Smithsonian Institute, and the Guggenheim Foundation (two grants). He also received an honorary degree from Brandeis and an award from Yale University. At a memorial following Mingus\u2019 death, Steve Schlesinger of the Guggenheim Foundation commented that Mingus was one of the few artists who received two grants and added: \u201cI look forward to the day when we can transcend labels like jazz and acknowledge Charles Mingus as the major American composer that he is.\u201d The New Yorker wrote: \u201cFor sheer melodic and rhythmic and structural originality, his compositions may equal anything written in western music in the twentieth century.\u201d\n\nHe died in Mexico on January 5, 1979, and his wife, Sue Graham Mingus, scattered his ashes in the Ganges River in India. Both New York City and Washington, D.C. honored him posthumously with a \u201cCharles Mingus Day.\u201d\n\nAfter his death, the National Endowment for the Arts provided grants for a Mingus foundation created by Sue Mingus called \u201cLet My Children Hear Music\u201d which catalogued all of Mingus\u2019 works. The microfilms of these works were then given to the Music Division of the New York Public Library where they are currently available for study and scholarship \u2013 a first for jazz. Sue Mingus has founded three working repertory bands called the Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Orchestra, and the Mingus Big Band, which continue to perform his music. Biographies of Charles Mingus include Mingus by Brian Priestley, Mingus/Mingus by Janet Coleman and Al Young, Myself When I Am Real by Gene Santoro, and Tonight at Noon, a memoir by Sue Mingus.\n\nMingus\u2019 masterwork, \u201cEpitaph,\u201d a composition which is more than 4000 measures long and which requires two hours to perform, was discovered during the cataloguing process. With the help of a grant from the Ford Foundation, the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by Gunther Schuller, in a concert produced by Sue Mingus at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989, ten years after Mingus\u2019 death.\n\nThe New Yorker wrote that \u201cEpitaph\u201d represents the first advance in jazz composition since Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cBlack, Brown, and Beige,\u201d which was written in 1943. The New York Times said it ranked with the \u201cmost memorable jazz events of the decade.\u201d Convinced that it would never be performed in his lifetime, Mingus called his work \u201cEpitaph,\u201d declaring that he wrote it \u201cfor my tombstone.\u201d\n\nThe Library of Congress purchased the Charles Mingus Collection, a major acquisition, in 1993; this included autographed manuscripts, photographs, literary manuscripts, correspondence, and tape recordings of interviews, broadcasts, recording sessions, and Mingus composing at the piano.\n\nSue Mingus has published a number of educational books through Hal Leonard Publishing, including Charles Mingus: More Than a Fake Book, Charles Mingus: More Than a Play-Along, Charles Mingus: Easy Piano Solos, many big band charts\u2014 including the Simply Mingus set of big band music charts\u2013 and a Mingus guitar book.\n\nReprinted in part from More than a Fake Book \u00a9 1991 Jazz Workshop, Inc.\n\nLinks to Additional Biographical and Historical Information on the Web\n\nLibrary of Congress\nAn index to the holdings of the Charles Mingus Collection, Music Division of the Library of Congress.\nhttp://www.loc.gov/performingarts/encyclopedia/collections/mingus.html", "otherInfo": "Jazz Standard proudly presents our tenth annual Mingus High School Competition 1979).

Her last release, Spark, won Walker the praise not only of Katy Perry, who tweeted her song \"Mars,\" but also of Billy Corgan. The Smashing Pumpkins frontman actually contacted her to tell her how much he loved her version of \"Galapogos.\" \"I was blown away,\" admits Walker. \"Billy Corgan was one of my teen idols. So it's cool to get that recognition from this guy who wrote [the] songs that shaped a lot of my teenage moments.\" Spark was also championed by Jason Bentley of KCRW-FM, a station that has supported Walker's music from the beginning. Some significant things happened to Walker during the three year period between Spark and Strange Bird. One is that she moved from Denver to the quaint mountain town of Crested Butte, Colorado. The other big change is that Walker, who was raised as an evangelical Christian, broke free from organized religion. These two events are connected, though they may not appear to be at first glance. \"Nature is my religion,\" explains the introspective singer. \"[And] you can't get any closer to nature [than Crested Butte]. There are mountains everywhere, and rivers\u2026 I can see the beauty before me, know that I am a small part of this infinite universe and feel tiny and powerful all in the same [moment].\" Highlights of Strange Bird range from the ballad \"Nothing Lasts Forever\" to more upbeat, nocturnal fare like \"Skywalker\" and \"Lightning\" to the haunting album closer, \"Deja Vu.\" All these songs are given grandly atmospheric backdrops by L.A.-based producer Malina, whose previous credits include a stint with Nine Inch Nails. The two met through Walker's brother. \"I told my brother that I needed a mad scientist,\" she remembers. \"He didn't mention [Malina] right away but a couple of minutes later, he was like, 'Oh! I know just the guy.' And he was right.\" Perhaps the best example of their collaboration is Strange Bird's autobiographical title track. \"It's about me as a little girl and how shy I was,\" says Walker. \"I didn't like singing in public; I always sang by myself\u2026 Everybody thought I was weird. A strange bird!\" If that was the case for Walker as a little girl, it certainly isn't the case now. This self-proclaimed 'strange bird' has been on quite a journey since she flew her Indiana nest a decade ago and moved to Philadelphia to be the singer for electronica trio Daughter Darling. Since then, she has released three solo albums: her acclaimed 2007 debut Urban Angel, the following year's With You and the aforementioned Spark; she has played venues ranging from The Fox Theatre in Boulder and The Fillmore in San Francisco to Joe's Pub and the Bowery Ballroom in New York City; she's seen her songs pop up repeatedly on both the big and small screens; and she's acquired many fans along the way. Not all these fans are as famous as Billy Corgan but that hardly matters. \"It\u2019s incredible to receive emails from people telling me a certain song moved them,\" says Walker. \"I've had so many fans tell me, 'This song got me through a really hard time in my life.' So many stories. It's powerful stuff.\"", "otherInfo": "An Evening of Romantic Comedy: A Book Release Show and Party"}, {"Address": "327 Bowery, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Tracy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7249907.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.991787, 40.725751], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Electronic, Electro House, Acoustic, Shoegaze, Folk", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Bowery Electric", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Queers of Noise present: LOVE STINKS!"}, {"Address": "2 W 64th St, New York, NY 10023", "Artist": "Mark Erelli", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9110365.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.980027, 40.771203], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Americana, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "New York Society for Ethical Culture", "moreBioInfo": "New England-based multi-instrumentalist Mark Erelli wears many hats--singer, songwriter, sideman, producer--but approaches each of these varied roles with a belief in the transformative power of paying attention.

Christina Holmes does so on her aptly titled third independent full-length album, The Beautiful Struggle [Cove House Records]. The New Jersey-born and Rhode Island-based singer, songwriter, and Cove House Records founder threads together stories of love and life across eleven alternative folk anthems united by her confessional lyricism and instrumental proficiency on guitar, bass, djembe, and piano.\nAs a result, she delivers her most personal, passionate, and powerful statement to date informed by true trials, tribulations, and triumphs.\n\u201cThe album is called The Beautiful Struggle, because I feel as though everybody lives a beautiful struggle,\u201d she states. \u201cThere are so many good things in life. There are so many bad things in life. You\u2019re just trying to find a happy balance. You know what you want. However, you might not be able to have it. Maybe it\u2019s just out of reach, so your struggle is reaching for it.\u201d\nThe music magnifies this universal journey. After keeping a childhood songwriting ambition a secret, she went from braving open mics to brightening the spirits of bedridden hospital patients alongside the charity Musicians On Call. Following a seminal \u201cAmateur Night\u201d gig at the Apollo, she dropped her 2013 debut, Peace, Love, & C. Holmes and canvased the country on a sold-out tour with Trevor Hall. 2017\u2019s Stand Up\u2014produced by Warren Huart [Colbie Caillat, James Blunt]\u2014would be the first official release through Cove House Records.\nIn the aftermath, she garnered the acclaim of Paste, Relix, and Jam in the Van and toured with everyone from Hall to Xavier Rudd and Nahko of Medicine for the People in addition to booking her own national headline run. As early as 2017, she started compiling ideas for what would become her 2019 offering.\nA true experience catalyzed the process as she mustered the courage to tell her then-girlfriend, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I met my wife, she had been previously with her husband,\u201d recalls Christina. \u201cI was going through my thing, but I knew I was in love with her the moment I saw her. Since she was married, I didn\u2019t really express my feelings. The struggle was I knew who I wanted to be with, yet I couldn\u2019t. All of these wrenches kept getting thrown into the mix. I admittedly threw some of those in myself. Finally, we got married last year. The album covers the whole period.\u201d\nShe holed up at Spitfire Studios in Los Angeles in order to put the trip down on tape. For the first time, she expanded her palette like never before. Previously shy about her instrumental diversity, she played everything from guitar to percussion herself, making a decision \u201cto let go of the last part of myself in my teenage bedroom and show who I am as a musician.\u201d\n\u201cEverybody Knows\u201d hinted at this impressive musicality, looping vocals on top of djembe. Meanwhile, the single \u201cRise\u201d pairs a bright guitar lead and organic percussion with her warm delivery. It culminates on the empowering chant, \u201cWe will rise up when we are called upon. We will rise up and we will just keep on.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a song I felt like I needed to hear\u2014and the world needed to hear,\u201d she elaborates. \u201cAt the end of the day, we must find common ground with each other. If we decide we can have a greater purpose of living and moving forward, we can work through the violence in the world together. We\u2019ve got to stop doing what we\u2019re doing, rise above, and create a better world for all of us. The song is meant to make you gravitate towards the rest of the stories in the album and hopefully understand me as an artist.\u201d\nThese \u201cstories of struggle\u201d comprise the entire body of work. The heartbreakingly potent \u201cAddictions\u201d examines its subject from multiple points-of-view (and -vice versa). The title track builds towards an undeniable chorus over a lively sonic backdrop. Meanwhile, \u201cTry\u201d inspired this unfiltered and unbridled candor at the beginning.\n\u201cI speak more clearly through song than when I\u2019m talking,\u201d she confesses. \u201c\u2018Try\u2019 was one of the first songs I knew would be on the album. It started as me by myself emptying out what I had to. It brought my soul more forward in a way I haven\u2019t. I lost all fear. It made me realize I\u2019m open to try. I don\u2019t ever have to be afraid when it comes to music.\u201d\nAs the album shows, Christina will be there for you on your struggle in the end.\n\u201cI hope people walk away with the strength to know they can keep walking,\u201d she leaves off. \u201cNo matter what life throws at you, you\u2019re going to make your way through.

The New York City band sounds like someone spinning a radio dial with such passionate intensity that all the stations blend together into a single, transcendent, almost spiritual force. It\u2019s disco to the beat of modern house; it\u2019s a Supremes cover of a Cardi B banger; it\u2019s Roland Kirk playing jazz through one saxophone, funk through another, and the most earwormy pop tune the 1970\u2019s could muster through a third. It\u2019s an experience\u2014one so effecting that with only a self-released 12\u201d single in circulation, 79.5 had been written up twice in The New Yorker on the merit of their live sets alone.\n\nStill, all this mixing and matching, this manic twirling of an FM dial, might seem like a bit of a mess: a recipe for ungrounded noodling and static. And perhaps it would be, were these disparate influences not anchored so solidly by the delicate crunch of singer and narcissist keyboardist Kate Mattison\u2019s Fender Rhodes. The Rhodes is the throbbing heart of 79.5, the melodic grit that gives its pristine vocals their edge. And like Mattison, it is the touchstone around which the band was built.\n\nThough the genesis of 79.5 was defined more by an organic growth than a singular event, the band could begin its origin story in 2012, the year Mattison renamed her band after an imaginary radio station, one that acted as a mercurial melting pot for genres as varied as house, soul, disco, jazz and new jack swing, all seasoned with an AM Gold crackle. Whenever, wherever 79.5 began, the band that has since coalesced around Mattison\u2019s Rhodes is comprised of individuals who have an inextricable connection between music and their paths through life.\n\n\u201cBoy Don\u2019t Be Afraid,\u201d the first single off of Predictions, showcases the sleek musicianship and palpable joy that course through entire record. Produced by Big Crown Records co-founder Leon Michels, Predictions is a timeless journey through a New York City dreamscape\u2014where spring never ends, the clubs never close, and new love is always right around the corner of the next city block. Mysterious, classy, and underscored with a simmering passion, the record captures the infectious mood of 79.5\u2019s live sets, transporting listeners directly to the front of the stage.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason radio stations as eclectic as 79.5 don\u2019t exist. People tend to gravitate towards a specific type of music in a given moment, one that syncs up with their emotional state or that satiates their particular taste. But somehow the blend of influences 79.5 has synthesized hits a sweet spot that feels at home in nearly any moment, any setting. Disc Jockeys across all wavelengths love to remind their listeners not to \u201cflip that dial,\u201d but tuned into 79.5, it\u2019s unlikely anyone would ever want to.", "otherInfo": "\" sounds like ESG meets Fleetwood Mac with Sade Saxophone for good measure.\""}, {"Address": "200 Varick St, New York, NY 10014", "Artist": "Angelica Vila", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-74.00478, 40.72826], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "SOB's", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Move Forward Music Presents Asiahn w/ Angelica Vila & Lexxy"}, {"Address": "1221 Old Northern Blvd, Roslyn, NY 11576", "Artist": "Natasha DiMarco", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9027859.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.652267, 40.801564], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Reggae, Soul, Funk, Folk, Classic Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "My Father's Place at The Roslyn Hotel", "moreBioInfo": "Natasha DiMarco is a vibrant and soulful voice on the scene.

The three-time GRAMMY\u00ae Award nominated singer and songwriter defies classification both personally and creatively. The Charleston-raised and Los Angeles-based songstress brings an empowered female perspective, positive mindset, and a whole lot of raw attitude to simmering throwback R&B with soul to spare. On her independent Love Train EP series [SinceThe80s], she presents a full picture of this boundary-breaking singular signature style powered by her fierce and fiery individuality.\n\n\u201cAsiahn is me in my true form,\u201d she exclaims. \u201cAsiahn is a feminist. Asiahn is a nerd. Asiahn loves anime. Asiahn loves to cook. I believe in equal rights for everyone in every aspect. I\u2019m always positive. I feel like my purpose is to help people live and love.

A highly sought-after writer, she penned anthems for the likes of Jennifer Lopez, Pitbull, Drake, Lil Wayne, and more. Countless fans experienced her voice on \u201cJust Another Day\u201d from Dr. Dre\u2019s gold-certified final recording Compton and in the #1 Academy\u00ae Award-nominated N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton. 2017 saw her receive widespread acceptance and praise as an artist on the first Love Train EP as songs like \u201cFaded\u201d and the title track generated millions of streams across platforms. However, she reveals her character further on 2019\u2019s Love Train II.\n\n\u201cLove Train encompasses what the entire project is about,\u201d she goes on. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the voice of love. I\u2019m taking a journey and inviting listeners along.\u201d\n\nRight out of the gate, the initial single \u201cNOLA\u201d clocked upwards of 1.6 million Spotify streams as she unveiled a powerful accompanying music video depicting the narrative of a same-sex couple. Standing for \u201cNo Love in Los Angeles,\u201d \u201cNOLA\u201d directly set the stage for the follow-up single \u201cLost In London,\u201d following one thread. Over echoes of sparse production, her delicate delivery dips between sensual peaks and valleys as she confidently recounts an emotionally charged tryst in intimate detail.\n\n\u201cSo, I go from no love in L.A. to getting lost in London,\u201d explains Asiahn. \u201cIt\u2019s the moment of a rebound. You meet someone new and feel completely different than what you had before. You forget everything, your heart mends, and you can get lost with this person. Of course, I\u2019m a lesbian, so I wanted to paint that picture of a woman.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, \u201cCuriosity\u201d details an encounter with \u201ca straight friend who had a crush on me,\u201d as she recalls. Anchored by a nocturnal beat and clever lyricism, Asiahn warns with a smile, \u201cIf you really want to do this out of curiosity, be prepared and put on your seatbelt.\u201d\n\nLove Train ushers both Asiahn and R&B forward at high speed. \u201cThere are two things I want you to see,\u201d she leaves off. \u201cFirst, I\u2019d love for people to walk away from this feeling optimistic about love again. That\u2019s how I end part II. I go from believing there\u2019s no love anywhere to meeting someone. It comes from knowing yourself and loving yourself first. Keep loving. Keep living.

The result of this decision is the band Vitriol, which soon involved Gianluca Pappalardo, Pierangelo Carvello and Alessandro Sanfilippo. These musicians contributed their professional influences to enrich the style of the new band, inspired by the modern progressive rock & metal genre and by the musical experiences of the 70\u2019s historical bands. V.i.t.r.i.o.l. is the acronym of one of the most famous mottos of Renaissance alchemy: \u201cVisita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem\u201d (Enter the bowels of the Earth and, through your purification, you will find the hidden stone). It is a metaphor representing the path of man inside his own Ego in order to finally find the philosophical Truth. In the same way, the main character of the story of their first EP, called Knowledge, has a quests for his beloved, Truth; he reaches the destination after a number of pitfalls and after meeting some allegorical characters (such as Faith and Insanity) he\u2019s also wrong-footed by the words of his beloved. The double meaning of the term \u201cvitriol\u201d (corrosive chemical element and acronym of the renaissance motto) can describe well the essence of the band, constantly hanging in the balance between its aggressive component and its introspective/reflective one. Once the first collected work of the band was distributed to media, it immediately generated lots of good reviews by the alternative rock and metal magazines in both paper and digital media: the EP received 15.5/16 in issue #59 of the prestigious Progression Magazine, the best score as \u201cindependent release\u201d and one of the best scores among 200 label\u2019s supported albums. It is considered the \"Best Demo of the Month\" in the November issue of Metal Maniac, one of the most important magazine in Italy, and received 8 out of 10 in a majority of the most famous international webzines, such as UsaProgressiveMusic, Rock Hard, Progressive Ears, MetalWave, Unprogged, TrueMetal, Metallo Italiano, Eutk, Nova Muzique as well as many others. Subsequently, the band caught the attention of the American label Melodic Revolution Records which has added Vitriol to their roster in 2010. During the same year Tommaso Semrov joined the band as guitarist and Vitriol started pre-producing their first full-length album \"Into The Silence I Sink\" which was released in November 2012. Recorded, mixed and mastered at Fear Studio in Ravenna and at the band's studio in Bologna, published by Melodic Revolution Records, it's a concept album revolving around the theme of Silence, metaphorically approached as \"deep absence of communication\". 10 songs, conducive to an analysis of the different causes of this absence of communication: the anonymity of the urban environment, the historical contraposition of Ideologies (Outward Silence, between person and person), differences between who we are and who we appear to be (Inner Silence, between the own appearance and essence). Concluding the album, the last song analyzes what must have been the most atrocious communicative Silence that has ever happened: a bewildered Christ asking \"My God, my God, why did you abandon me\"? \u201cInto The Silence I Sink\" was evaluated by the international press as one of the best albums of 2012. The American radio show Prog Metal Show put the album at the 8th place in the \"Top 50 progressive metal albums of the year\". The band promoted their work with two official videos, \"The Frozen Wind\" and \"Slowly She Dies\", and the \"Making of\" the album. In 2013-2014 Vitriol toured Europe across Italy, UK, Poland, Austria and in 2015-2016 performed as opener of Pain of Salvation, Evergrey, Soen, Kingcrow. At present they're working on their next album, with Gabriele Gozzi as new lead vocalist of the band.

Lights flash. Everyone is on alert. Emergency protocol in effect. It\u2019s a Code Red state of emergency. Soul music is in trouble and one of the greatest R&B singers of a generation is sounding the alarm. Whispered voices have been expressing their concern for some time. Industry insiders talk of a change in the musical direction at radio. Critics blame millenials. Millenials blame the music. Artists blame each other. And everyone blames the Internet. But that\u2019s not the whole story. Soul music is alive and well and \u201cpeople love it when introduced to it properly,\u201d R&B/Pop icon Monica explains. However, concerned about the future of the genre she loves so much, Monica returns with her seventh studio album appropriately titled Code Red. \u201cAs an artist and real genuine soul/R&B lover, I felt that it\u2019s a state of emergency for the music. Its important for this generation to know and understand how important the music was and is to the world and we are best when we can bridge the sound between the old and the new,\u201d Monica says. The Grammy Award winning singer knows this better than anyone. Monica will inarguably be remembered in music as one of the most iconic soul singers of a generation. Her enviable resume detailing extraordinary musical contributions that started professionally at the tenderfoot age of 12 when her first major label deal was signed. Monica\u2019s musical journey started in College Park, Ga., when she began performing with a traveling gospel choir, following in her mother\u2019s footsteps, an incredible church singer herself. While honing her craft competing in as many local talent shows she could find, Monica was discovered by hitmaker Dallas Austin, signed to Arista Records\u2019 distributed label, Rowdy Records and by thirteen became the youngest artist ever to score two back-to-back Billboard #1 chart-topping hit records with \u201cDon\u2019t Take it Personal\u201d (Just one of dem Days) and \u201cBefore you Walk Out of My Life.\u201d By the end of 1995, she had taken the world by storm with her unstoppable debut album, \u201cMiss Thang.\u201d Her next album, the 1998 record-breaker \u201cThe Boy Is Mine,\u201d was a crossover pop juggernaut as the result of her duet with Brandy; the Rodney Jerkins produced song of the same name. The single spent thirteen weeks at #1 on the coveted Billboard chart, earning Monica her first Grammy Award to add to her already growing collection of Billboard, American Music and Soul Train awards. \u201cThe Boy Is Mine\u201d album would feature two more Billboard #1 hits \u2013\u201cAngel of Mine\u201d and \u201cThe First Night\u201d\u2013 and would establish Monica as a bona-fide superstar and one of most successful artists of the entire decade. Over the next ten years Monica would release four more Billboard chart-toppingalbums \u201cAfter the Storm,\u201d\u201cThe Makings of Me,\u201d\u201cStill Standing,\u201d and \u201cNew Life.\u201d In all, she has sold more than 25 million albums worldwide and she holds the record as the first artist to top the U.S. Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart with No.1 songs over the span of three consecutive decades (1990s, 2000s and 2010s), which puts her in the elite company of history-making superstars such as Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, James Brown and Marvin Gaye, all sharing similar accomplishments. She\u2019s acted on stage and in feature films, contributed to the hit NBC show, \u201cThe Voice,\u201d and witnessed her life documented in the BET reality show, \u201cMonica: Still Standing.\u201d And in 2010, Billboard Magazine listed Monica at No. 24 on it\u2019s list of the Top 50 R&B and Hip Hop Artists of the past 25 years. So what\u2019s left to prove and why now? The answers are extraordinarily simple: Nothing and it was time. After a few years off from recording and touring, Monica felt that her family life had reached a point where it could sustain the rigors and demands of her career. \u201cMy family takes precedence over everything. Once I really got everybody comfortable \u2013 Kids in school, prepping for the days they had whether it be with sports or all the different activities that they love and my daughter was walking and talking, that\u2019s when I really started working on the album,\u201d Monica recalls. \u201cMy children didn\u2019t ask to be the children of an entertainer so never do I want them to feel secondary to it\u2026In the midst of me being a mom and a wife, there\u2019s so much more substance there when I do come back as an artist.\u201d Due in-stores and online later this year, Code Redis indeed a jubilant return to form for the iconic star. The lead single, produced by hitmaker Polow Da Don is an updated take on a Smokey Robinson and the Miracles classic (Much Better Off); \u201cJust Right For Me,\u201dfeaturing Lil\u2019 Wayne, serves as a perfect introduction to the album and is a bridge between Monica\u2019s love of classic soul music, 90\u2019s R&B and the sound of today. Another standout on the album is the uber-personal tune, \u201cI Miss Music.\u201d It is somewhat of a tribute to the memorable music of the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s and the rare artists that created it. \u201cI Miss Music,\u201d is an infectious record. It was an instantaneous attraction for Monica. \u201cI was born in the midst of the most incredible age of music. This song speaks to that era and reflects on how important the music was to me,\u201d Monica explains. When I mention Whitney\u2019s name in the song, I still get chills through my body. She wasn\u2019t only my mentor. She was my friend. This song is all about substance and feel and that\u2019s what means the most to me.\u201d \u201cThe song \u2018Hustler\u2019s Ambition,\u2019 featuring Akon, is one of my absolute favorite records that I have ever recorded,\u201d Monica details. The record captures the feeling of missing someone but keeping the emotional fire burning while he\u2019s away. Surely a parallel for Monica and her husband, NBA player Shannon Brown and their intense opposing work schedules. Missy Elliott returns to Monica\u2019s musical journey on the supremely matched title track, \u201cCode Red.\u201d The tempo driven, high energy, effervescent, and lyrically captivating record couldn\u2019t be a more unexpected yet perfect union for these music icons whom are also true friends. \u201cThis album is about my journey. As a person I\u2019m complete. I\u2019m a complete woman now. I\u2019m complete as a mom. I see my children happy, enjoying their lives, living and learning. I\u2019m complete as a wife. I understand who I am. I know my shortcomings and I accept those just as much as I accept my strengths. As an artist, I\u2019m a lot more seasoned and comfortable in my own skin. I understand there are artists that will do different things than me. They make take different paths in promoting and creating but there\u2019s only one Monica. Indeed since her dominant debut in 1995, there\u2019s always only been one Monica.

Three (3) songs from her second album reached number one (#1) status -- \u201cLet It Go\u201d (w/Missy Elliott and Lil Kim), \u201cI Remember\u201d and \u201cHeaven Sent.\u201d Her reality show \u201cThe Way It Is\u201d became the most-watched program in BET\u2019s history, and with season three having started yesterday, November 11th, Keyshia Cole is sure to make history again. Keyshia\u2019s third album, A Different Me \u2013 Executive Produced by Keyshia, Manager Manny Halley and Geffen Records Chairman Ron Fair is set for release on Tuesday, December 16, 2008. KEYSHIA COLE is the definitive soul singer to emerge in this decade, and she is in good company. Over the past seven decades, precious few R & B females have touched the hearts of America. From Billie Holiday to Sarah Vaughn, Dinah Washington, Nina Simone, Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Gladys Knight, Whitney Houston, and Mary J. Blige - Keyshia possesses the same innate quality of telling the truth through song like her predecessors. Her pain becomes your pain, her joy, your joy. Her first single, \u201cPlaya Cardz Right\u201d featuring Tupac (an early mentor of Cole\u2019s) has already garnered a top 15 chart position in its first three weeks. This single follows a host of seven (7) number one (#1) records that include \u201cI Should Have Cheated;\u201d \u201cLove,\u201d \u201cLet it Go,\u201d \u201cI Remember,\u201d \u201cHeaven Sent,\u201d \u201cLast Night\u201d (w/P. Diddy) and \u201cGive it Up to Me\u201d (w/Sean Paul.) All of the songs for A Different Me were written or co-written by Keyshia with production from award-winning producers such as Ron Fair, Polow Da Don, the Trackmasters, The Runners, Kwame and Neffu. Guest appearances include Kanye West, Nas, a duet with Monica, and a posthumous appearance from Tupac. Keyshia was nominated for two Grammy awards in 2007 for \u201cBest Contemporary R&B Album\u201d for \u201cJust Like You\u201d and \u201cBest Rap-Sung Collaboration\u201d for \u201cLet it Go\u201d (w/Missy Elliott and Lil\u2019 Kim). She has also received awards and or nominations from the American Music Awards, Music Choice Awards, NAACP Awards, BET Awards, Vibe Awards, and ASCAP Awards. Born in 1981 in Oakland, California, Keyshia didn\u2019t have it easy. The Cole\u2019s adopted her after her mother Frankie, an addict at the time, could no longer take care of her. Twenty plus years later, she is still trying to put all of the pieces of the puzzle we call life together \u2013 discovering long lost siblings, mending the relationship with her mother who was recently released from jail and supporting her sister, Neffe, and her four children. The road to riches wasn\u2019t easy for Keyshia and still isn\u2019t. Besides the release of a new album, new season of her BET reality show, touring and personal appearances, Keyshia is gearing up for the production of a movie based on her life.

The inspiring first single \u201cBrave\u201d shows off his accomplished, personal songwriting as one of seven songs on the album he co-wrote. And inspired choices of other\u2019s songs, from the Academy Award-winning \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d from the movie and Tony Award-honored spin-off Broadway musical Once to Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cI Believe\u201d through his continued explorations of the poetry of Spanish (\u201cUn Alma Mas,\u201d featuring Cuban-born trumpet great Arturo Sandoval) and Italian (\u201cE Ti Prometter\u00f2,\u201d a duet with Italian star Laura Pausini), spotlight his singular talents as a masterful interpreter. Working for the first time with producer Rob Cavallo (the Warner Bros. Records chairman whose production credits cover Green Day\u2019s many groundbreaking albums, Goo Goo Dolls, Fleetwood Mac and many others), Groban pushed himself to fully capture the spirit of his acclaimed concerts, fueled by his vibrant bond with legions of his fans, the famed Grobanites. \u201cThe album was really sparked by an energy I had on the road,\u201d he says. Any of the hundreds of thousands who saw his shows in support of 2010\u2018s Illuminations, in which his writing and ambition took full flower, knows what he\u2019s talking about. Those concerts were at turns playful and intimate \u2014 even in arena settings \u2014 and affectingly powerful, with equal measures of musical virtuosity and spirited, spontaneous personality. The latter has also brought him a rising career in movies and television, with an hilarious recurring guest role on The Office, a sparkling part in the hit Steve Carrell/Julianne Moore film Crazy, Stupid, Love and a as costar of the upcoming small-ensemble comedy Coffee Town. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is the energy, the dynamic I want for my next record, the feeling I\u2019m getting on stage,\u201d he says. When he and Cavallo had dinner after a show in Chicago to discuss the possibility of working together, it was clear right away that they had the same things in mind. \u201cWhen Rob came out to Chicago he basically shared the same adjectives with me that I had in my head,\u201d Groban says. \u201cI wanted this to be soulful, wanted it to be righteous and dynamic and inspirational and energetic. And mainly wanted to find the sweet spot of my singing voice again. I always find it on tour.\u201d To achieve this, Cavallo \u2014 the 1998 Grammy Awards producer of the year \u2014 devised a creative studio approach. Though as a producer he\u2019s best known for his rock work, he\u2019s had a greatly wide-ranging career and, he notes, was raised immersed in the classical world thanks to his opera-loving grandparents \u2014 Luciano Pavarotti was a family friend who would visit, drawn largely by his grandmother\u2019s cooking. The chance to bring all those worlds together in one project was a challenge he relished. Working at the famed Ocean Way Studios in Hollywood, he started with an all-star core band: drummers Matt Chamberlain and Abe Laboriel Jr., the latter having just come off the road anchoring Paul McCartney\u2019s band; bassist Chris Chaney came from Jane\u2019s Addiction; in-demand guitarist Tim Pierce joined with credits ranging from Madonna to Dave Matthews, and keyboard player Jamie Muhoberac has worked with the Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac, Seal, My Chemical Romance and many others. To this, the producer added the secret ingredient, a trio of the top orchestral session artists in L.A. in cellist Dane Little, violinist Charlie Bisharat and harp ace Gayle Levant. And then, to provide as fertile an environment as possible, he gave them and Groban a sense of complete freedom. \u201cWe tried this experiment,\u201d Cavallo says. \u201cWe got the best \u2014 the best guitarists, keyboards, bass, drummers, and then got the best harpist, cellist and violinist in L.A. and got them to play together so they would be sensitive to each other. We tested it out, didn\u2019t know if it would work. And it worked great! Everyone had to listen to each other and react and play accordingly. Josh was the leader. Everyone\u2019s chemistry came together at that time. Really made for passionate vocal takes. What you\u2019re really getting now is a very pure type of truth from Josh. Very pure.\u201d Arrangements were worked up collectively, \u201cThe rhythm section came in ready to rock,\u201d Groban says. \u201cThe orchestral guys came in controlled, and the nice balance was the that the rock guys brought out a real edge in the orchestral players and the orchestral players brought out a real sense of control and nuance to the way the rock guys would play. To see Abe Laboriel play with a harpist was great! And Gayle said that it hasn\u2019t been since the Sinatra days that they were able to improvise with a rhythm section. So when they said to me, \u2018Your mic is ready,\u2019 it made it inspiring for me to sing on top of that, add my element, the three worlds blending together.\u201d Most of what\u2019s on the album was from the first few takes of each song, with the spontaneous spirit intact. Even the full orchestra parts, added later, expanded directly from the music created by the three strings players in the initial sessions. And the vibe extended outside the studio. \u201cIt\u2019s a musical camaraderie, not just showing up for a gig,\u201d Groban says. \u201cThat all starts at the top with Rob. And it wasn\u2019t just the playing, but the joking around and the dinners \u2014 we all got to know each other so well. Sometimes that magic that happens when you\u2019re off the clock, so to speak, when you\u2019ve technically done your job but think you can do it better. Got that extra oomph from everybody.\u201d It went literally outside the studio in the case of \u201cHollow Talk,\u201d a song that originated with the Danish indie band Choir of Young Believers.\u201d It\u2019s a song of complex musical turns and intertwined emotions, building from an intimacy to a big, expansive sound with orchestra and bagpipe. Groban remarked in the studio that it brought out the vision of a lonely girl walking down the street \u2014 and engineer Allen Sides, inspired, took a microphone out onto Sunset Boulevard to record street noises. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing the cars go by and going, \u2018I don\u2019t know why this would work,\u2019 but it really does,\u201d Groban says. \u201cAnd it turned out awesome.\u201d Groban was inspired to push himself as a writer, expanding on the achievements on Illuminations, the first album to be centered on his own compositions. \u201cBrave\u201d saw him team with long-time collaborator Tawgs Salter and singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk. \u201cWhen Rob was saying, \u2018Let\u2019s widen the lane,\u2019 you still don\u2019t want to sound out of your element,\u201d Groban says. \u201c\u2018Brave\u2019 represents one of the higher energy songs, but never felt out of place to me. Never felt this was out of my world. It represents the kind of energy I had on stage. I would want the lights going crazy and the band rocking out and something that blows the hair back and moves me. This to me represents every adjective Rob and I thought of in that meeting in Chicago.\u201d The lyrics and melody for \u201cBelow the Line,\u201d co-written with Salter and Simon Wilcox, were formed on the day Groban participated in Life Below the Line, for which people subsist on $1.50 for a day in order to understand the levels of true poverty. \u201cIt was not fun,\u201d says the singer, whose own Find Your Light Foundation has focused on much-needed arts education programs. \u201cA can of beans was my food, half in the morning and half at night. Somehow a song came out of it. It\u2019s not necessarily the full message of the song. The vibe is, \u2018We\u2019re not helping ourselves until we\u2019re helping others.\u2019\u201d Another regular collaborator, Lester Mendez (who also produced two songs on the album), teamed with Groban on \u201cFalse Alarms\u201d and, along with Salter and Italian lyricist Marco Marinangeli, \u201cE Ti Prometter\u00f2.\u201d For a second Italian song, \u201cSincera\u201d he reunited with acclaimed producer-composer Walter Afansieff (who produced the song) and Marinangeli. Such personal bonds and connections abound throughout the album. Groban and Irish singer-songwriter Glen Hansard, co-writer of \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d and co-creator of both the movie and musical Once, have built a friendship \u2014 the musical even includes a winking joke at Groban\u2019s expense and the singer introduced its segment at the Tony Awards show. Laura Pausini, Groban says, \u201cwas the first global superstar I ever met,\u201d an encounter that happened when he was just 17 and attending the MIDEM conference in the south of France. A friendship grew and both kept hoping there would be an opportunity to collaborate, which finally came with \u201cE Ti Prometter\u00f2.\u201d A few years back, Groban found himself sitting next to one of his heroes, iconic writer Jimmy Webb, on what turned out to be a harrowingly storm-tossed New York flight. Here, he steps up to tackle Webb\u2019s \u201cThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress,\u201d a song of complicated emotions that has tantalized with past interpretations by such stars as Judy Collins and Linda Ronstadt. And the haunting traditional Irish song \u201cShe Moved Through the Fair\u201d came to him while \u201chaving my late-night glass of wine and trawling YouTube\u201d via a live solo version by English folk-rock legend Richard Thompson, another long-time Groban favorite. \u201cHaving grown up on Irish music, I thought, \u2018Let\u2019s give it a try,\u2019\u201d he says of the song, which has also been recorded by artists including Van Morrison and Sinead O\u2019Connor. To give it the right tone, Levant switched to Celtic harp and Groban brought in another old friend, Eric Rigler, virtuoso on the Irish Uilleann pipes. \u201cAfter writing sessions, trying to be clever, it\u2019s nice to be reminded by songs like this that just sit in a place that\u2019s right.\u201d And to tie it all up, the album ends with the Stevie Wonder classic. \u201cTalking about the light and dark and trials and tribulations of love, no one writes about that better than Stevie Wonder,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about how imperfect we can be, how many lessons we can learn. \u2018Even though I messed up in the past and have done things wrong, the next time love comes my way, I\u2019m not going to let go.\u201d Groban\u2019s voice brings a truly personal stamp to the song, with the band and full orchestra joined by a full gospel choir. And the end of the song again captures the spirit that fueled the whole of the All That Echoes sessions, with Groban drumming (!) and singing a \u201cbig, stupid finish, unabashedly saying, \u2018There it is!\u2019\u201d \u201cTo me,\u201d he says, \u201cafter all the messages we put on the record, there was no better way to start than \u2018Brave\u2019 and no better way to finish off than this.\u201d New album - Stages Available Now: http://smarturl.it/a3z3eg", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "61 Atlantic St, Stamford, CT 06901", "Artist": "Marisela", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9620502.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.539753, 41.054535], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Palace Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "319 Frost St, Brooklyn, NY", "Artist": "Ceremony", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9179923.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.938692, 40.719277], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: punk, hardcore, heavy metal, Metal", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Steel", "moreBioInfo": "'In The Spirit World Now' is out NOW on Relapse Records!

As early as 2017, she started compiling ideas for what would become her 2019 offering.\nA true experience catalyzed the process as she mustered the courage to tell her then-girlfriend, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I met my wife, she had been previously with her husband,\u201d recalls Christina. \u201cI was going through my thing, but I knew I was in love with her the moment I saw her. Since she was married, I didn\u2019t really express my feelings. The struggle was I knew who I wanted to be with, yet I couldn\u2019t. All of these wrenches kept getting thrown into the mix. I admittedly threw some of those in myself. Finally, we got married last year. The album covers the whole period.\u201d\nShe holed up at Spitfire Studios in Los Angeles in order to put the trip down on tape. For the first time, she expanded her palette like never before. Previously shy about her instrumental diversity, she played everything from guitar to percussion herself, making a decision \u201cto let go of the last part of myself in my teenage bedroom and show who I am as a musician.\u201d\n\u201cEverybody Knows\u201d hinted at this impressive musicality, looping vocals on top of djembe. Meanwhile, the single \u201cRise\u201d pairs a bright guitar lead and organic percussion with her warm delivery. It culminates on the empowering chant, \u201cWe will rise up when we are called upon. We will rise up and we will just keep on.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a song I felt like I needed to hear\u2014and the world needed to hear,\u201d she elaborates. \u201cAt the end of the day, we must find common ground with each other. If we decide we can have a greater purpose of living and moving forward, we can work through the violence in the world together. We\u2019ve got to stop doing what we\u2019re doing, rise above, and create a better world for all of us. The song is meant to make you gravitate towards the rest of the stories in the album and hopefully understand me as an artist.\u201d\nThese \u201cstories of struggle\u201d comprise the entire body of work. The heartbreakingly potent \u201cAddictions\u201d examines its subject from multiple points-of-view (and -vice versa). The title track builds towards an undeniable chorus over a lively sonic backdrop. Meanwhile, \u201cTry\u201d inspired this unfiltered and unbridled candor at the beginning.\n\u201cI speak more clearly through song than when I\u2019m talking,\u201d she confesses. \u201c\u2018Try\u2019 was one of the first songs I knew would be on the album. It started as me by myself emptying out what I had to. It brought my soul more forward in a way I haven\u2019t. I lost all fear. It made me realize I\u2019m open to try. I don\u2019t ever have to be afraid when it comes to music.\u201d\nAs the album shows, Christina will be there for you on your struggle in the end.\n\u201cI hope people walk away with the strength to know they can keep walking,\u201d she leaves off. \u201cNo matter what life throws at you, you\u2019re going to make your way through. I hope you feel good when you hear it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "149 Westchester Ave, Port Chester, NY 10573", "Artist": "Jesse Malin", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9253808.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.66549, 41.00139], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative Rock, Alternative, Americana", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Capitol Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "From collaborations with Bruce Springsteen and Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day, to his early writing in D Generation, Jesse Malin fuses evocative lyrics with music that cross genres.

Combining cinematic soul, Afro\u2013funk, deep disco, and an irrepressible groove, Ikebe Shakedown has forged a style all its own. Each song is anchored in the deep-pocketed pulse of its four-man rhythm section (Barnaby Alter, drums; Dave Bourla, percussion; Vince Chiarito, bass; Robin Schmidt, guitar) and driven by one of the tightest horn trios on the East Coast (Mike Buckley, tenor/baritone sax; Jason Colby, trumpet; Nadav Nirenberg, trombone), with tunes ranging from dance-floor burners to lush, captivating scores.\n\nThe band first came on the scene with 2009\u2019s debut EP, Hard Steppin\u2019, from Colemine Records. Praised by WNYC\u2019s Soundcheck as \u201cthe perfect soundtrack for the unwritten Tarantino movie of your imagination,\u201d the five\u2013song release led to tours up and down both U.S. coasts and paved the way for Ikebe Shakedown\u2019s first full-length LP on Ubiquity Records. Recorded at Killion Sound in L.A. with Orgone\u2019s Sergio Rios and Dunham Studios in Brooklyn with noted producer Tom Brenneck, this self-titled album, released in 2011, featured 14 blistering tracks that Okayplayer called, \u201can adventurous trip through time\u201dand \u201cone of the best releases of the year.\u201d Having toured the record throughout the U.S. and Canada, Ikebe Shakedown returned to the studio in 2014 for their follow up album for Ubiquity, Stone by Stone. Recorded at Daptone Studios, the 10-song set let the band become more adventurous than ever before, weaving psychedelic textures and raw soul into powerful compositions, or as Wax Poetics called it, \u201ca greasy and sometimes trippy funk world.\u201d\n\nNow, after hitting major jazz festivals, opening on extended runs for stars like Lee Fields, and with the band\u2019s members simultaneously touring with acts like Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings, Charles Bradley and His Extraordinaires, and the Monophonics, Ikebe Shakedown is poised for their next big release in 2017. The new album, The Way Home, is due out October 20th on Colemine Records. It shows how the band\u2019s style has continued to evolve, with material that transports listeners beyond their living rooms into dance parties and spaces for introspection. Building on the success that has led to musical features in series such as Eastbound and Down, movies like Our Brand is Crisis, and commercials for brands including Mini Cooper, Vans\u2019 Off the Wall, and Surfline, the songs are at once richly familiar and incredibly fresh, paying homage to classic influences while pushing a brand new sound. Defying genre or classification, this album proves Ikebe Shakedown is helping define the next bold and soulful wave in instrumental music.", "otherInfo": "Harlem Gospel Travelers\nIkebe Shakedown\nDJ Drew Redmond"}, {"Address": "235 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Lisa Fischer", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7858434.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.987088, 40.759536], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Rnb-soul, R&b/soul, Soul", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Sony Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Ms. Lisa Fischer is stepping into the spotlight at last. After four decades of singing background for icons like the Rolling Stones, Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, and Nine Inch Nails, Lisa is finally offering her own humble, heartfelt song, accompanied by her inventive new band Grand Baton. The past 18 months have been a whirlwind, with performances at the Newport and Monterey Jazz Festivals, at the Hollywood Bowl, and in major cities all over the world. The unexpected success of the Oscar-winning documentary Twenty Feet from Stardom (2013) altered the course of Lisa's musical journey. The film told her story, complete with clips of her 1991 Grammy-winning R&B hit \"How Can I Ease The Pain,\" live footage of her legendary duets with Mick Jagger on \"Gimme Shelter,\" and glowing testimonials from famous colleagues like Sting, Patti Austin, and Chris Botti. It showcased her virtuosity and vulnerability, opened a window on her sometimes lonely life on the road, earned her a second Grammy award, and left audiences eager to see and hear more. Lisa set out on her first tour with no recordings or video to help book and promote shows, headlining first in small clubs, moving quickly to festivals and concert halls. Journalists, music business insiders, and supporters jumped in to spread the word. \"Her glamorous-girl-next-door quality makes fans all over the world think she's their own secret discovery.\" (Broadway World) \"A sublime experience,\" \"phenomenal times infinity,\" \"mind blowing,\" \"an intangible souvenir that will remain in our hearts and minds forever.\" (Facebook followers) \"Transcendental!\"(The Huffington Post) \"She brought down the house in the single best show I\u2019ve seen in the many years I\u2019ve visited Birdland.\" (The New York Times) \"You know you're in the presence of greatness when the hair on the back of your neck stands up. On her own stage, [Fischer] exuded supreme confidence. The display of vocal magic was mesmerizing . . . quiet and subtle until the mighty shout was unleashed . . . .\" (The Edmonton Sun) \"[A] wondrous instrument that can seamlessly blend classical, jazz, soul, gospel, rock and folk.\" (Minneapolis Star Tribune). Lisa has found ideal co-conspirators in Grand Baton. The band's organic fusion of African, Middle Eastern, and Caribbean rhythms, psychedelic soul, and progressive rock awakens and ignites Lisa's flexibility and freedom of expression. \"Collectively they bring amazing musicianship, hearts and souls and most importantly a sense of playfulness,\" she says. \"It's a dream to be sonically surrounded with this kind of sensitivity and care.\" The band has helped her realize her lifelong desire to make music that heals but still rocks the house. In performance, she draws from an eclectic palette of influences, whether putting her stamp on Led Zeppelin and Little Willie John or recasting rock anthems from her tours with the Stones and Tina Turner. While Lisa's range is legendary, her greatest gift is the ability to connect, to reach the hearts of her listeners. Raised in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, Lisa emerged from New York's fervent studio scene in the early-1980s and quickly became session singer royalty. She paid her dues as a member of the Marvelettes before legendary vocalist Luther Vandross invited her to sing background with his touring band. He became her mentor and friend, nurturing her talent over a 20-year period until his untimely passing in 2005. During Lisa's two decades working with Luther, her voice also powered albums by a constellation of music legends including Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan, Bobby McFerrin, George Benson, Diana Ross, Laurie Anderson, Teddy Pendergrass, Dionne Warwick, Grover Washington, Billy Ocean, Melba Moore, Al Jarreau, Patti LaBelle, and other major recording artists. Lisa joined the Rolling Stones on tour for the first time for their 1989 Steel Wheels tour; she has graced their stage for 26 years. When the spotlight catches Lisa singing with Mick Jagger she is a quintessential rock and roll goddess, soaring above the band's earthy groove. \"It's always a high point in the show for me,\" says Mick. Keith Richards commends Lisa's \"amazing power, energy, and projection.\" In 1991, in the midst of touring with both the Stones and Luther Vandross, Lisa recorded a solo album, So Intense, for Elektra Records. \"I used members of my session singing community on the CD, so I felt surrounded by love,\" she says. \"The most difficult thing was finding the right music. It was also the most exciting thing.\" The album featured Lisa's songwriting collaborations with producer Narada Michael Walden on both the Top 10 R&B hit \"Save Me\" and the number one and Grammy-winning R&B single \"How Can I Ease the Pain.\" Lisa also won the Grammy for \"Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female,\" an honor she shared with Patti LaBelle, whose award-winning project Burnin' also featured Lisa on background vocals. Though she continued to record for soundtracks and various studio projects, Lisa's career revolved around supporting other artists. Then, in 2011, the late Gil Friesen and director Morgan Neville approached Lisa when they began interviewing singers for Twenty Feet from Stardom, a feature-length documentary celebrating the contributions of background vocalists. Alongside vocal trailblazers like Darlene Love and Merry Clayton, Lisa candidly discussed the delicate balance between life and career, success and challenges, as well as the nuance of singing with other vocalists. \"Ms. Fischer has become the unexpected star of Mr. Neville's film,\" said the New York Times. \"She's the empress of that world,\" music legend Patti Austin declared in the film. \"That's a powerhouse voice. I think of her as a star,\" said Sting. Between her down-to-earth persona in interview footage, her vocal mastery in archival clips, and her multi-tracked performance of Samuel Barber's \"Sure on This Shining Night,\" Lisa moved viewers with her voice, her soft-spoken charm, and her thought-provoking insights. \"This movie is going to make Lisa Fischer a star,\" said music industry pundit Bob Lefsetz. \"And she deserves it, because she's just that damn good. Whether fronting her own band or supporting other artists, Lisa's passion for music in all its forms leads her to constant growth and experimentation with different styles. She recorded the title track for Billy Childs' all-star tribute to Laura Nyro, Map to the Treasure (2014), collaborated with YoYo Ma and Gregory Porter, and co-created music with J.C. Maillard for the Alonzo King LINES Ballet. \"It's an exciting new chapter for an artist who had early career success but eschewed the trappings of celebrity in favor of the satisfaction of making honest music every night,\" Broadway World observes. With spiritual truth-telling as her compass and loving kindness as her guide, Ms. Lisa Fischer is on a creative journey, destination unknown. \"Inspiration is all around,\" said Lisa in a recent interview with New York's Daily News. \"My heart is wide open and I\u2019m in love with the thought of singing to anyone who wishes to listen.\" \" I just want to sing.\"", "otherInfo": "Lisa Fischer in concert is addictive. Every performance is so enriching, so exciting, so transcendent that you want more. With remarkable vocal range and vocabulary, Fischer can sing soul, jazz, rock, gospel, pop, folk and classical with equal facility and authority. She often mixes styles in the same song, sometimes in the same vocal line. Her approach tends to be intimate, artful and almost meditative, accompanied by her interpretive dancing, but she also can cut loose and funk with fierceness and rock with abandon."}, {"Address": "153 Library Ln, Mamaroneck, NY 10543", "Artist": "The Special Consensus", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.73412, 40.94915], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Emelin Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "620 Atlantic Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "J.S.

Viv\u00ed toda mi infancia, y hasta los 17 a\u00f1os, en la ciudad donde nac\u00ed. All\u00ed hice pre-escolar en el Jard\u00edn Infantil \u201cEl Renacuajo\u201d, primaria en el Liceo V. A. L.

Las canciones me vienen del alma, y no conozco otra manera de escribir, y quisiera pensar que cuando alguien oye alguna de mis canciones, en un disco, en la radio, o en un concierto, es all\u00ed, al alma, el lugar al cual llegar\u00e1. Y escribo de amor, en todas sus formas, incluido el desamor, su forma m\u00e1s cruel. Mi equipaje para llegar a \u00e9ste \u201cCruce de Caminos\u201d lo componen 2 discos, anteriores, muchos amores y varias traiciones, una visita al infierno, y un auto-descubrimiento de lo que soy. En 2003 sali\u00f3 al mercado \u201cSolo hasta hoy\u201d, con \u201cNo mires atr\u00e1s\u201d y \u201cUna y otra vez\u201d como banderas, y en el 2006 sali\u00f3 \u201cSentidos\u201d, donde fueron \u201cAcabado\u201d y \u201cTus Regalos\u201d las canciones m\u00e1s importantes, comercialmente hablando. \u00c9stos dos cap\u00edtulos musicales me han brindado varios de los momentos m\u00e1s emocionantes de mi vida, siendo el m\u00e1s importante la respuesta de la gente frente a mis canciones, pero tambi\u00e9n me permiti\u00f3 conocer a varios de mis \u00eddolos, y compartir escenario y canciones con ellos, artistas como Alejandro Sanz, Pablo Milan\u00e9s, Miguel Bos\u00e9, Fito P\u00e1ez y Franco de Vita, han salpicado e inspirado con su arte lo que hago, y he tenido la fortuna de abrir sus shows, y en algunos casos cantar hombro a hombro en el escenario. Ahora estamos frente a \u00e9ste \u201cCruce de Caminos\u201d, desde que escrib\u00ed la primera de las 30 canciones que compuse para \u00e9ste \u00e1lbum hasta ahora han pasado 23 meses, muchos \u00e1ngeles, y 2 viajes a Espa\u00f1a, y ha sido un camino maravilloso. Espero que las canciones que seleccionamos les gusten, en palabras de Nacho Ma\u00f1\u00f3, el productor musical de \u00e9ste disco, y mi hermano del alma, \u201ces un disco sincero, personal y sincero, algo cada vez m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de encontrar en \u00e9ste negocio\u201d. \u201cCREO EN SECRETOS, Y EN EL ARTE COMO FORMA DE VIDA, CREO EN QUE TODO SE DEVUELVE, EN EL MISTERIO Y LA AVENTURA. CREO EN EL AMOR COMBUSTIBLE\u2026 ...CREO EN TI Y EN MI. CREO EN TU Y YO. ESTOY EN MI LUGAR SI TU CREES QUE SI. CREO EN NUESTRO AMOR, SI ES SOLO POR HOY. PUEDO BATALLAR SI TU CREES EN MI\u201d.

Wielding a unique blend of modern-day pop sensibility and sizzling musicianship, Skonberg aims for a sense of allure on the new collection. She credits producer Matt Pierson with helping her create music that is both curious and exotic, playing with tension and storytelling. Elite jazz chops, artfully mixed with worldly rhythms and contemporary songwriting, result in a sophisticated pop sound closely resembling that of Michael Bubl\u00e9, Diana Krall, and Harry Connick Jr. Bria\u2019s original tunes include the tango \u201cCurious Game,\u201d the bluesy instrumental \u201cDown in the Deep,\u201d and the Brazilian-flavored \u201cHow Can It Be\u201d - a reflection of the sampling era. Noted as a Millennial \u201cShaking Up the Jazz World,\u201d according to Vanity Fair, Skonberg is a self-described \u201csmall town girl\u201d from Chilliwack, British Columbia. She left for Vancouver straight out of high school and earned a degree in Jazz Trumpet Performance from Capilano University. But even as she absorbed the deep knowledge and disciplined work habits needed for a jazz career, she was also hustling hard to book her two bands. While in university she juggled working every weekend, traveling to festivals and shows, plus cramming in schoolwork - all while on the road. When not traveling for her own gigs, she was building up her stage-show chops with Dal Richards, Vancouver\u2019s King of Swing. Playing at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver capped off this exciting period, with Bria featured at the Paralympics opening ceremony. In 2012 Bria released So Is The Day (Random Act Records); her first album on a US-based label. That collection showcased a developing flair for original songs with just the right amount of standards mixed in, and also featured a duet with the legendary John Pizzarelli, So Is The Day received rave reviews from critics, drawing comparisons to Norah Jones in The New York Daily News. In 2015, a year after her second album, Into Your Own, was released, Skonberg received the Jazz At Lincoln Center Swing! Award. To date, Bria has performed at some 100 festivals worldwide. She is the co-founder of the New York Hot Jazz Camp and New York Hot Jazz Festival. Further accolades include Best Vocal and Best Trumpet awards from Hot House Jazz Magazine (2014-15), Outstanding Jazz Artist at the New York Bistro Awards (2014), a DownBeat Rising Star (2013-15), and a nominee for Jazz Journalists' Association Up and Coming Artist (2013). \u201cI love the idea of being a global ambassador\u2026spreading joy, relating the human experience, and putting good into the world to counteract the negative.

Morris's musical taste was developed through her parents' record collection, a library heavy on late-60s and early-70s soul and funk. During her childhood Morris's main companion was her karaoke machine, which she also used for the sake of recording. While enrolled in college in Tampa, FL, she became so involved in performing with bands that she decided to leave behind her studies and take on music full time. She took up the guitar, as well as songwriting, and eventually involved herself with a band, Pinktricity, which moved to New York in 2003 and split shortly thereafter. Morris took to recording songs on her own, and self-released a pair of EPs: This Won't Hurt a Bit (2007) and Milk and Cookies Never Lie (2008). Her first proper recording, a self-titled EP (2010), was recorded with producer and multi-instrumentalist Jeremy Page (of That Handsome Devil). After touring with legendary guitarist Dennis Coffey and releasing a series of singles which included \"Concrete Waves,\" whose b-side was remixed by DJ Premier, Morris released the album Banshee (2012) on Wax Poetics. In 2013, Morris returned with the covers album Mockingbird. Both Banshee and Mockingbird received critical acclaim and a cult following, with several film + tv placements. The title track \"Banshee\" was used prominently in the Showtime hit series Ray Donovan, while her cover of Pink Floyd's \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" found itself in the trailer for major motion picture Dead Man Down. In between extensive international touring and promotion for Banshee throughout 2013 and 2014, Morris worked on a small side project band with friends Scarlett Johansson, Julia Haltigan and Holly Miranda, releasing one single called \"Candy.\" After taking some time to write and record her follow up EP titled Babble, Kendra Morris will return with its release scheduled for late spring of 2016.

Desde 1993 cuando residi\u00f3 por tiempo en los Estados Unidos y sin ning\u00fan tipo de conocimiento ni habilidades para tocar la guitarra, acept\u00f3 el reto de ser el cantante principal de una agrupaci\u00f3n bachatera. \u201cSin sufrimiento no hay progreso\u201d indica Mart\u00ednez, seguro de que esta asociaci\u00f3n con Univision Records va a representar un paso muy importante en su carrera y lo llevar\u00e1 al sitio con el que siempre ha so\u00f1ado: \u201cEstar en el coraz\u00f3n de todos mis bachateros en el mundo entero\u201d. Aunque hoy ya no es el muchacho aquel que en 1998 lanz\u00f3 profesionalmente su primera producci\u00f3n, \u201cTodo se paga\u201d, para Mart\u00ednez el contacto con el p\u00fablico y la calidad musical que presenta en el escenario siguen siendo sus motivaciones y por ellas trabaja cada d\u00eda intensamente. Ese disco le trajo muchas satisfacciones pues le signific\u00f3 no s\u00f3lo un premio como \u201cRevelaci\u00f3n del A\u00f1o\u201d en los Premios ACE en Nueva York, sino tambi\u00e9n un \u201cPremio Estrella\u201d en la misma categor\u00eda y un Disco de Oro por las altas ventas\u2013 algo ins\u00f3lito para un bachatero. Al a\u00f1o siguiente en 1999 sale al mercado su segundo material \u201cDirecto al coraz\u00f3n\u201d, del que destacaron melod\u00edas como: \u201cEsta Navidad\u201d, \u201cTu sabes bien\u201d y \u201cAmada m\u00eda\u201d. Dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez sorprende gratamente a sus seguidores con su tercera producci\u00f3n: \u201cTres palabras\u201d del que se recuerdan cortes como: \u201cMaestra\u201d, \u201cLa vida es un carnaval\u201d, \u201cBella y sin alma\u201d y \u201cTriste Navidad\u201d. Y en el 2003, Mart\u00ednez demuestra y reafirma nuevamente por qu\u00e9 es considerado por la cr\u00edtica como uno de los mejores bachateros del momento con \u201cAs\u00ed te amo\u201d, una exquisita producci\u00f3n que cont\u00f3 con la mano m\u00e1gica en la producci\u00f3n del talentoso maestro Rando Camasta.

He began his musical journey at the age 12, playing saxophone, flute and drums, and eventually, exclusively drums. He played mostly jazz all through his teens. After earning a BA in History from Wagner College in 1973, and after studying with Jack DeJohnette, Bob Moses and Steve Haas he moved to NYC in 1975 to pursue his musical career. From 1975 to 1984 Baratta played gigs in and around NYC and other locales. Some of his bandmates and associations were with John Stubblefield, Joe Ford, Frank Strozier, Hal Galper, Mike Richmond, Saheb Sarbib, Dennis Irwin, Vernon Reid, Billy Bang, Jack Wilkens, Ryo Kawasaki, Jessica Hagedorn and the Gangster Choir, Guilherme Franco, Pe De Boi, Cyro Baptista, and a very memorable one day hit with Hank Mobley and then Johnny Hartman.\n\nIn 1984, Baratta decided to dramatically alter paths, and pursued a career in movie production. \"Money was tight, the gigs were hard to come by, and I was getting married and wanted to raise a family. It was just time for a very tough decision that had to be made. I looked back many times and terribly missed the joy in playing and the camaraderie with the musicians. It was a total about face, but I have no regrets, except missing the live performance.\"\n\nSince working on his his film, Desperately Seeking Susan in 1984, Baratta has worked on over 50 movies, first as a Location Manager, then Unit Production Manager, and for the past 15 years as a Co-Producer and Executive Producer. A small sampling of his films is Martin Scorsese\u2019s soon-to-be-released The Irishman, Dr.Strange, The Wolf of Wall Street, five Spiderman movies,Too Big To Fail, Taking Pelham 123, Across the Universe, Donnie Brasco, Working Girl, and Big. Currently he is Executive Producing Romeo, a film staring Joaquin Phoenix. For a full listing of Baratta's film credits, visit IMDb: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0053102\n\nDuring the past 33 years of movie making it never prevented Baratta from regularly listening to and attending music at most all the clubs in NYC and festivals elsewhere. As best he could, he tried to maintain relationships with his past bandmates and stay up on the jazz scene. However, with the exception of the occasional one nite gig every few years, Baratta essentially remained on the sidelines when it came to performing. Then a very fortuitous event occurred.\n\nAn opportunity presented itself in the fall of 2016 that changed everything. He decided to return to his roots and main love and began performing music again, while continuing to produce films. From December 2016 to the present he has played with Eric Alexander, Vincent Herring, Walter Blanding, Marcus Printup, Bruce Harris, Gerald Cannon, Bill O\u2019Connell, Emmett Cohen, Jeb Patton, Steve Ash, Chris Pattishal, Mike LeDonne, Ray Gallon, Danny Nimmer, Jerry Weldon, Rogerio Bocatto, Paul Bollenback, Dave Stryker, Mike Goetz, Essiet Essiet, Yoshi Waki, and many others. From Baratta\u2019s lips, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m in heaven. I just want to keep it going. A light has gone off in my head and the music seems clearer and fresher than ever.\u201d\n\nBaratta currently resides in Tenafly, N.J.

We make music that may move you to take over the world, or maybe it will make you just MOVE. We blend complicated instrumentals seamlessly with our thought provoking lyrics. Combined with a stage show that electrifies, our performances are meant to bring back the age of big rock stage shows that leave your ears ringing, your neck strained, and your heart wanting more.

Raven began creating a sound which was rooted in British hard rock, with progressive rock tendencies, and a willingness to take musical chances. The band's highly-energized live show and interaction between band members developed an image and style of play-the-band, described as \"athletic\". They began wearing guards, helmets, and plates from various sports (hockey, baseball, etc...), and incorporating them into the playing of their instruments (for instance, elbow pads and hockey masks were used to strike cymbals for a unique performance angle). They also opened for punk bands the Stranglers and the Motors. Early years Eventually, the band signed with Neat Records, the legendary, low-budget metal label of the North. They released Rock Until You Drop in 1981, and Wiped Out in 1982, making an impressive showing on the UK charts at the time. Sufficient noise was made for the American market to take notice and New Jersey's Megaforce Records signed them, issuing their next recording in the States as All for One in 1983. The band came stateside in 1983, and toured extensively with Megaforce bands Metallica and Anthrax, both of whom would gain a place of prominence in the growing thrash metal movement.[citation needed] Commercial success Manager/Megaforce founder Johnny Zazula believed that Raven was major-label material, and kept them touring constantly until the big labels noticed. The infamous Live at the Inferno recording, released in 1984, was a product of one of those tours. Atlantic Records signed Raven to a worldwide contract after a minor bidding war (major label contracts would follow for Metallica and Anthrax in the following year). The band moved its permanent base from Newcastle to New York. Stay Hard was released in 1985, and proved a minor hit on the strength of single/video \"On and On\". The Atlantic years proved to be less than stellar for the band. A drastic shift in a more commercial direction came at the label's behest, with many die-hard fans being alienated by the slick, lightweight production of The Pack Is Back. However, the band recorded two more studio albums and the Mad EP before leaving Atlantic. After the tour for Life's a Bitch, Rob \"Wacko\" Hunter left the band in late 1987 to spend more time with his new wife and family. He would later pursue a career in audio production and engineering, eventually working with jazz greats Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick, Jr.. Later years Virginian Joe Hasselvander (ex-Pentagram) joined as drummer in late 1987, and the band dropped the outlandish image for a more conventional denim-and-leather look for their 1988 release Nothing Exceeds Like Excess. After, the advent of grunge and the dissolution of their record label Combat Records led the band to concentrate on continental Europe and Japan, where they retained more of a following. Recent events The band recorded and toured until 2001, when a wall collapsed on guitarist Mark Gallagher, crushing his legs. Raven went on hiatus for nearly 5 years, from 2001\u20132006, while the guitarist rehabilitated, though Raven never officially disbanded. Raven came back on th elive front playing European festivals in 2005/2006 and started work on the album \"Walk Through Fire\"which was released on 2010 to both critical & fan acclaim. The band consolidated on this success playing in Europe, Japan, and South America. In 2015 the band released \"Extermination\" and recieved even better reviews & acclaim...the band did a 43 date US tour in 2014 & a 40 date Euro tour in 2015 ...currently the band plan Euro festivals & a tour for 2017 & to start work on a new album in the fall. In 2009, the band Released \"Walk Through Fire\" Through King Records in Japan. In 2010 the band signed with Metal Blade in the US and SPV in Europe.

His passionate performances are punctuated by a crisp acoustic guitar and soaring tenor vocals. This is best shown in his 2018 EP \u201cBreathe,\u201d a four song project consisting only of acoustic guitar, bass and vocals. And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.\n\nKyle takes in the world, processes it and turns it into song with his own special touch. He has a unique take on things, a view of the world others may not necessarily notice. He continues to grow as an artist, sharing his story and messages of love and peace.\n\nAbove all, though, it\u2019s still about the music.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "10-93 Jackson Ave, Long Island City, NY 11101", "Artist": "Paul Bennett Comedy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9772713.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.951643, 40.743236], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy, Standup Comedy", "Time": "1:00 PM", "Venue": "The Creek and The Cave", "moreBioInfo": "NYC Dad Comedian", "otherInfo": "A stand up comedy show for families!

When members from each group were drafted, the remaining members, under the guidance of their English teacher Beverly Hamilton, joined forces and changed the name to \"The Stylistics\". After working locally for a few years, the group was approached by Bill Perry, who asked if they\u2019d be interested in recording. Their first song, \"You're a Big Girl Now\" was recorded at Virtue Recording Studio in Philadelphia. The song was written by their guitarist at the time, Robert \"Doc\" Douglas and Road Manager, Marty Bryant. The song was soon picked up in the tri-state area, and before long, it became a The #1 hit in Philadelphia and other cities.\nInterested in promoting the record nationally, Bill Perry contacted Avco Records and made a deal. After the success of \"You're A Big Girl Now\", Avco wanted to follow up with an album release. Hit veteran producer Tom Bell was contacted and was hired to produce the group's first album titled \"The Stylistics\", and from that album came \"Stop, Look, Listen to your Heart\", \"You Are Everything\" and \"Betcha By Golly Wow\". The success of this album was phenomenal. The ball continued to roll with the release of their second album titled \"Round Two\". The Stylistics were becoming known as the Philly group with the sweet love songs.\n\nHerbert Murrell and Airrion Love are the remaining original members of The Stylistics. Friends since junior high school, Herb and Airrion have managed to keep their institution of 70's music alive. It was thought to be the end of The Stylistics following the departure of their original lead singer, but as in life, THE SHOW MUST GO ON. Their new lead singer, Grammy Award winning recording artist, Barrington \u201cBo\u201d Henderson, began his professional career with groups such as The Dramatics and Lakeside. Later in his career, Bo Henderson became lead singer of the world-renowned group, The Temptations, and was featured on their album Phoenix Rising, which went on to become almost double platinum. He was also a vocalist on the album Ear-Resistible, and helped win The Temptations a Grammy Award. The Stylistics are honored to welcome Barrington \u201cBo\u201d Henderson to the group, and look forward to taking their musical journey to new heights.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "15 Vandam St, New York, NY 10013", "Artist": "Chronicle", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8464875.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00995, 40.72446], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Southern Gospel", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Huron Club At Soho Playhouse", "moreBioInfo": "We started out as friends, and now make up the group \"CHRONICLE\".

Thile had set himself a formidable musical challenge and, as befits this enthusiastically risk-embracing artist, he was more than up to the task. In addition to traveling, planning, rehearsing, and performing on the fifteen episodes of APHC\u2019s 2016\u201317 season, Thile managed each week to create a funny, topical, and at times quite poignant new song he would play with a rotating cast of APHC band-mates and guest stars. These were not throwaway radio bits, but smart, fully realized compositions. They served the needs of the show but were just as timely and engaging on their own.\n\nIn July 2017, Thile went into New York City\u2019s Reservoir Studios with producer and longtime friend Thomas Bartlett and that\u2019s when these songs gained an even deeper resonance. As they listened through the APHC versions, Thile and Bartlett realized that, taken together, these songs could form an album-length narrative. Part of the story Thile found was autobiographical. Thanks for Listening represents perhaps the most direct and personal material Thile has ever recorded. It reflects the changes to his own peripatetic life as he assumes a new role as APHC host and, behind the scenes, as a new dad\u2014while continuing to play with his band Punch Brothers and collaborate with such artists as Brad Mehldau, Edgar Meyer, and Yo-Yo Ma. We learn what delights him (like the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series,) and what alarms him (the polarized state of our nation post-election). But Thile also tells a broader tale\u2014satirically, wistfully, frankly\u2014 about the divisions and disconnects plaguing America today, whether it\u2019s on social media or at the Thanksgiving table. The overarching theme, Thile realized, was about the art of listening\u2014the joys of it, the current difficulties of it, and the necessity of hearing what others have to say, not just the overwhelming desire to be heard.\n\nListening, or the lack thereof, figures prominently on several tracks: \u201cFeedback Loop\u201d lampoons the way social media filters out all but those one agrees with, while \u201cModern Friendship\u201d rues the way old pals can drift apart\u2014and suggests that maybe sharing a well-made night cap could help solve that. \u201cStanley Ann\u201d is a graceful imagining of what Barack Obama might have said to his late mom as he departed the White House in January. The deceptively cheerful \u201cFalsetto,\u201d on the other hand, is an all-too-kind speculation on how the current occupant of the White House might gracelessly scold an activist entertainer\u2014managing to insult the singer\u2019s \u201cgirly falsetto\u201d in the process.\n\n\u201cMy initial working title was Get It out on the Radio\u201d (the name of the song he performs at the end of each APHC episode). But the album pivoted away from the show and toward the listeners\u2014and not just to the listeners of Prairie Home but to anyone who listens to things. They are my heroes\u2014people who listen. I find myself all too often on the other side of the conversation, talking about what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s hard to maintain focus or give something enough attention to appreciate it. We\u2019re in a place where listening is a precious commodity. That\u2019s the theme that I noticed rising up, greater than \u2018here is what was happening last week\u2019 or \u2018here is the place we were.\u2019 It\u2019s a celebration of people who haven\u2019t switched off, despite being given every reason to do so.\u201d\n\nThe arrangements have an intimate, dream-like quality to them; the songs feel like reveries, not statements. Thile\u2019s voice is at times double- or triple-tracked, cossetted by subtle echo. He delivers vocal takes that are by turns wry and soulful, frequently deploying a lovely falsetto in an especially evocative way, more Beach Boys than bluegrass. The chorus of \u201cThank You, New York,\u201d performed with singer Gaby Moreno, is a vocal stand-out, a nose-thumbing good riddance to the turbulent year that was 2016 (and a nod to the resilience of New York City and its occupants). Thile\u2019s mandolin playing remains front and center\u2014and it the sole instrument on \u201cBalboa\u201d \u2014but it is often bolstered by Bartlett\u2019s subtle, slightly mysterious, layering of keyboards and electronics.\n\n\u201cI was deeply desirous of a record that sounded like it was coming from your own head. That\u2019s where we veered away from a more archival studio approach\u2014where you go in, perform the songs, and record exactly how those performances sounded,\u201d Thile says. \u201cThe recordings on Thank You for Listening are more fanciful in construction.\n\n\u201cOftentimes I would be at the big room of Reservoir Studios making maps of these songs with whatever stringed instruments seemed appropriate and singing scratch vocals. Then Thomas would take them into his little room and start experimenting on them. And I would start the next map,\u201d he continues. \u201cI would get my pass by having written the song and having created a keep-able demo of the song and then Thomas would get his pass without me looking over his shoulder, telling him \u2018that\u2019s not how it goes.\u2019 Which I\u2019m unable to not do if I\u2019m in the room. It was like an editor editing a novel.\u201d\n\nLike Thile, multi-instrumentalist Bartlett is a musical polymath, comfortable in diverse collaborative situations. He often sits in with the National; he plays piano in the Irish Music group The Gloaming; and he occasionally performs on his own under the Doveman moniker. Rather than enlisting a full APHC-style band in the studio, the pair conceived the project largely as a musical dialogue between them\u2014a listening session of their own, if you will.\n\nThile manned all the stringed instruments, save for bass (from Alan Hampton) and viola (from Nadia Sirota, on the title track). Ted Poor\u2014like Hampton, a member of Andrew Bird\u2019s touring band\u2014played drums on five tracks. Bartlett provided, in Thile\u2019s words, \u201cwhatever sounds weren\u2019t accounted for.\u201d Thile also invited three guest singers to the sessions, all of whom had performed multiple times on APHC: Sarah Jarosz, Gaby Mereno, and Aoife O\u2019 Donovan. He says, \u201cAll three had made really meaningful contributions to how the songs ended up expressing themselves. That goes for all the musicians who played on this last APHC season. They all made such meaningful contributions to these songs. I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d\n\nThe original \u201cSong of the Week\u201d versions can be easily accessed via YouTube, now that all the APHC shows are live-streamed and subsequently archived. The performances are full of personality and humor, as Thile, a dependably energetic live performer, interacts with a roster of players that include various Punch Brothers, brilliant guitarist Julian Lage, and Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins of Nickel Creek. Contrasting these versions with the new studio recordings, one can appreciate the sort of magical transformation that took place at Reservoir Studios, one that was more about inspiration than analysis.\n\nThe process effected a transformation on Thile too: \u201cBefore hosting Prairie Home, I would listen to music much the way an athlete trains. Listening was like hitting the gym, like a pitcher strengthening his rotator cuff. I was listening to improve specific aspects of my musicianship or nourish it in specific ways. The hosting has brought me back into being a music lover, just listening with the idea of enjoying the three to five minutes of a performance, not worrying about whether it\u2019s rendering my sense of counterpoint more sophisticated or increasing my knowledge of how sonata form works or giving me more arrows in my improvisational quiver.\u201d He continues, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u2018do I like this? Is my life better since listening to this song?\u2019 That\u2019s what I care about now.\n\n\u201cI think that development led me to ask Thomas to produce Thanks for Listening,\u201d Thile concludes. \u201cHe and I have stayed up late drinking Amaro and listening to records. I often hold vast amounts of myself back to analyze things and Thomas would consistently play me things that would disarm that side of me. I was yearning to make a set of music that maybe hits more of those marks, to have some of that rub off on me. I hope I succeeded with Thanks for Listening.\u201d\n\n\u2014Michael Hill", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "123 W 43rd St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Indigo Girls", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6147284.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.984563, 40.756023], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Folk", "Time": "5:45 PM", "Venue": "The Town Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Indigo Girls recording career includes fourteen studio records, three live records and three greatest hits compilations: - seven gold records - four reaching platinum - one reaching double platinum -cumulative sales in excess of 12 million records - seven Grammy nominations, one win Tour History Spanning 25 Years: - from Little 5 Points Pub to multiple nights at Chastain Park in Atlanta - Knitting Factory to Central Park to Madison Square Garden in New York City - Slims to Shoreline Ampitheatre in San Francisco - Borderline to Royal Albert Hall in London - Boulder Theatre to Red Rocks in Denver - Double Door to Ravinia in Chicago - Austin City Limits, Newport Folk Festival, New Orleans Jazz Fest, Bumbershoot, Glastonbury Festival, Bridge School Benefits with Neil Young Twenty years after they began releasing records as the Indigo Girls, Amy Ray and Emily Saliers have politely declined the opportunity to slow down with age.

In 2012, he performed eight sell-out shows at The Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway. Lewis was born in Washington D.C. and raised in Silver Spring, MD. Colicky as a baby, it seems he was destined to be angry and easily irritated. His mother, a teacher, and his father, a mechanical engineer, instilled in both Lewis and his younger brother Ron the importance of education and the necessity to question authority; lessons which have influenced Lewis throughout his private and professional life. When Lewis was 12, his father took him to his first play and he quickly fell in love with the theatre. This ultimately led Lewis to pursue a career in drama. Degrees followed from the University of North Carolina and Yale Drama School, with a stint in Colorado owning a theatre with a group of friends in the interim. During his tenure at UNC, Lewis first ventured into stand-up, performing at Cat\u2019s Cradle in Chapel Hill. Stand-up continued to be a steady presence as he pursued his career in theatre. Lewis eventually settled in New York City and became the playwright-in-residence at the West Bank Caf\u00e9\u2019s Downstairs Theatre Bar. Lewis oversaw the development of more than 1,000 plays, including works by West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin, American Beauty writer Alan Ball as well as his own original works. In addition to overseeing the works on stage, Lewis emceed every show. As the West Bank grew, so did Lewis\u2019 skill as a stand-up and eventually, the fulfilment of performing stand-up outweighed that of working in the theater. Having found his public voice, Lewis left the West Bank in the late 80\u2019s to pursue stand-up full time. In 1996, his friend Lizz Winstead tapped him to create a weekly segment for a show she was producing on Comedy Central called The Daily Show. The segment, a three minute rant about whatever was bothering him at the moment, evolved into Back in Black. It became one of the most popular and longest running segments on the show and also created a long and successful relationship with the network. Since then, Lewis has taped four specials for the Comedy Central Presents series, co-created Last Laugh with Lewis Black, presided over Lewis Black\u2019s The Root of All Evil, and continues to perform Back in Black on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. His popular appearances on Comedy Central helped to win him Best Male Stand-Up at the American Comedy Awards in 2001. Increased exposure from The Daily Show eventually generated a record deal with Stand Up! Records. His first CD, The White Album, was released in 2000 to much critical acclaim. Lewis followed with eight more, six under the Comedy Central Records label. He has been graced with 5 Grammy nominations and two wins for his work. The first nomination came in 2006 for Luther Burbank Performing Arts Center Blues, the second in 2009 for Anticipation. In 2007 he won the Grammy for Best Comedy Album for The Carnegie Hall Performance and in 2011, his second for Stark Raving Black. His most recent release, In God We Rust (Comedy Central Records) was nominated for a Grammy. He\u2019s filmed two specials for HBO, Black On Broadway and Red, White and Screwed. The latter was nominated for an Emmy in 2007. He had a regular feature for two seasons on Inside the NFL (for which he earned a Sports Emmy) and in 2006 was honored to be asked to participate in Comic Relief. In 2009 Lewis filmed his first feature length concert film, Stark Raving Black at the Fillmore Theatre in Detroit. The film had a limited run in theaters across the US and Canada in the summer of 2010. At the end of the theater run, premium movie channel EpixHD picked up the film for its channel along with the accompanying documentary Basic Black. Both are still aired regularly and can be found in the EpixHD on demand queue. 2011 found him producing his second full length concert, In God We Rust, which also still airs on EpixHD. A much sought after guest for several late-night television shows, he\u2019s been seen on Larry King Live, Piers Morgan Tonight, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, The Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O\u2019 Brian and the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. He\u2019s also had numerous appearances on CNN and MSNBC and has occasionally announced the weather with Al Roker. In the midst of a rigorous touring schedule, regular TV appearances and movie roles, Lewis has written three best selling books, Nothing\u2019s Sacred (Simon and Schuster, 2005), Me of Little Faith (Riverhead Books, 2008) and I\u2019m Dreaming of a Black Christmas (Riverhead Books, 2010). All garnered critical praise as well commercial success and spent numerous weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. As a playwright Lewis has penned over 40 plays, many of which have been produced around the country. The Deal, a dark comedy about business, was made into a short film in 1998 and picked up by the Sundance Channel. In 2011, his play One Slight Hitch was produced at the Williamstown Theatre Festival and then again in 2012 at both the ACT Theatre in Seattle and The George Street Theatre in New Brunswick. In 2006, Lewis had a break out year as an actor. He co-starred with Robin Williams in Barry Levinson\u2019s Man of the Year (Universal Pictures), appeared as \u201cthe fake dean of a fake college\u201d in Steve Pink\u2019s Accepted (Universal Pictures) and as the harried airport manager in Paul Feig\u2019s Unaccompanied Minors (Warner Brothers). He also lent his voice to the role of \u201cJimmy\u201d in Bob Sagat\u2019s parody, Farce of the Penguins (Thinkfilm). In addition to his professional pursuits, Lewis is dedicated to a number of charitable organizations. As a long time mentor with the 52nd Street Project, Lewis was roasted in Charred Black 2007 which drew the largest fundraising numbers in the Project\u2019s history. He\u2019s a member of their Advisory Board, is Co-Chair of their Capital Campaign and in 2000, the Ron Black Memorial Scholarship Fund was created in memory of his late brother. Lewis is also committed to raising funds for the Rusty Magee Clinic for Families and Health. He\u2019s a strong supporter of both the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and Autism Speaks and was honored by The Brady Center for his commitment to ending gun violence. In 2012, he was honored by the ACLU of Georgia with their National Civil Liberties Award. At the Williamstown Theatre Festival, he established the William Foeller Fellowship, having taught and performed at the festival for more than a decade. Lewis also supports our military personnel and has performed in 3 tours with the USO where he visited several Middle East and European military bases with Robin Williams, Lance Armstrong, Kid Rock, Miss America Rachel Smith and Kellie Pickler. Today Lewis maintains residences in both Manhattan and Chapel Hill, NC. Still loyal to his alma mater, he\u2019s worked with UNC students to create the Carolina Comedy Festival, a yearly festival on the UNC campus that not only highlights performances, but also provides workshops and lectures for budding comics, writers and performers. With his involvement at UNC, Lewis continues a life-long commitment to education and the arts. In his leisure time, Lewis likes to play golf, even though golf hates him.

With 10 tracks and fifty one minutes long, their 19th full length album is the ultimate combination of sickening brutality and addictive melody. It was yet another incredible album cover design by Travis Smith that sparked the idea of what to name this next album. With 5 of the iconic Overkill winged skulls brooding powerfully around the table seemingly prepared for battle, \u00bbThe Wings Of War\u00ab simply rolled off the tongue.\n\nWith the fresh addition of seasoned drummer Jason Bittner (ex-Shadows Fall, Flotsam And Jetsam, Stigmata), OVERKILL is experiencing a new chemistry this time around, truly giving the record a unique feel. The writing was funneled through its familiar foundation, but now had a fresh influence and energy that inspired the entire band. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had an identity crisis,\u201d says frontman Bobby Blitz, \u201cbut we still like raising an eyebrow from time to time!\u201d Morphing into the modern day and taking advantage of the convenience of technological advances, this old school group of guys utilize technology for its instantaneous qualities that help fuel their momentum, and prevent the build up of stagnant ideas.\n\nAlthough Bassist DD Verni and guitarist Dave Linsk have their own recording set up, OVERKILL goes out of house for their drum recording to longtime friend Joey De Maio of Shorefire Studios in Long Branch New Jersey, and for their vocals to Johnny Rod of Rockland County New York. The the real guitar work gets accomplished at DD\u2019s studio, Blitz absorbs the sounds and fills in the guts with melodies, phonetics, dirty-sweet lyrics, and the songs develop organically.\n\nAlbum opener \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d is OVERKILL kicking the door in with a hard and loud tune that\u2019s rooted in some of the best angst that thrash possesses. Memories retained from this song are memories similar to the classic 80\u2019s vibe but with a new-age mechanical feel that thoroughly updates it. This was also the first song recorded with newcomer Jason Bittner.\n\nThe album\u2019s second single \u201cHead Of A Pin\u201d is a lyrical journey about disappointment and trust. Musically, the song comes across as \u201cBlack Sabbath on meth\u201d proclaims Blitz. It intertwines riffs and vocal melodies that pick it up into a real pounder and create something truly special.\n\n\u00bbThe Wings Of War\u00ab also holds something to look forward to for east coast metal heads with a track entitled \u201cWelcome To The Garden State.\u201d Bobby Blitz explains: \u201cIt\u2019s all about us. It\u2019s the way we grew up as kids, it\u2019s a certain attitude about the area, it\u2019s responding to \u201cwe don\u2019t do that where we\u2019re from\u201d with: \u201cwell guess what, you\u2019re not where you\u2019re from! You\u2019re here, now!\u201d The song sums up the New Jersey attitude with over 4 minutes of thrashy, punky, honest vibration, and defines OVERKILL, as well.\n\nWith at least the next six months already blocked off for a South American tour, followed by a U.S. tour, OVERKILL are on overdrive as usual with no signs of coming to a halt. This most recent cycle has a different feel; an old formula that evolved with new life and new breath and that after all these years, still generates an exquisite power.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "158 Ludlow Street, New York City, NY 10002", "Artist": "Who Is Skitzo", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.987746, 40.72104], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Piano's NYC", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "who is Skitzo is performing live at Piano's NYC on February 15th, 2020, so get your tickets now.

Now, the Brooklyn-born soul legend returns with his 5th album, BlackSUMMERS\u2019night, the long-awaited second installment of his trailblazing trilogy, a powerful reminder that great music really is about more than moving the twitter needle. Maxwell\u2019s reentry into the pop orbit straddles but never strains the fertile groundwork he\u2019s already laid as an R&B/soul pioneer. His seminal 1996 debut album, Maxwell\u2019s Urban Hang Suite, which the New York Times credited for \u2018turning away gangsta\u2019 machismo to reclaim the utopian spirit of 70s soul\u2026\u2019has been enthusiastically re-celebrated recently in an avalanche of commemorative articles marking the 20th anniversary of the genre spawning debut. His last album, 2009\u2019s #1 debuting, Grammy-winning BLACKsummers\u2019night and its signature single \u201cPretty Wings,\u201d (which owned the top spot on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles Chart for 4 and a half months) tamped down Chapter 1 of the sensual, pathfinding trilogy. The album landed on most critics\u2019 Year\u2019s Best lists and snared 2 Grammys, with Rolling Stone praising it as an \u2018album about love, not sex, for grown-ups who know the difference.\u2019 The ambitious follow-up reaffirms Maxwell\u2019s commitment to further the musical crossroads, even as he acknowledges his own reluctance to willingly let go of his own creations: \u201cI knew the new album was good, that it was done \u2013 but they still had to tear it from my hands to get it out,\u201d he says. Most revealingly, he admits to arriving at a \u2018good place\u2019 at 43 years of age, equipped with a keener sense of proportion about the seductive mystique he has come to represent. \u201cI think what messes up a lot of pop artists after they\u2019ve been down the road a bit is that the record becomes much more about their personal drama instead of the music. I\u2019m not going to disrespect anyone\u2019s hustle, but I\u2019m not interested in being a celebrity. Today, you have people purposely marketing their personal life into their music. With me, you\u2019re looking at a mom and pop store,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI need that spark that drives the music, but within that life I always want to create something that affects people emotionally and spiritually. At the end of the day that\u2019s what enables me to become secondary to the experience of the music.\u201d With sonic aspirations and priorities intact, and gathering many of the contributors on board for his previous albums, Maxwell says the \u2018operative\u2019 driving theme on the new album is \u2018summer.\u2019 The first single, the stunning \u201cLake By The Ocean\u201d kick-crosses diced-up drum grooves to the singer\u2019s undulating sensuality. His legendary vocal nuances are even richer now, commanding our attention with less on blackSUMMERS\u2019night, seductively shifting intonation and meaning as he reaches for more than just a reprise on the sequel; a master fully in charge of his instrument. It\u2019s all there on songs such as the album\u2019s boogie blast of an opener, \u201cAll The Ways Love Can Feel,\u201d and the intensely brewed confessional \u201cThe Fall\u201d; on the hopeful \u201cFingers Crossed,\u201d and bright funk of \u201cIII,\u201d where he furtively name-checks Michelle Obama. The free-floating blues-driven \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cListen Hear\u201d are also standouts, two songs that Maxwell says simply \u201cflowed through\u201d him in one take. He credits vigorous recording sessions with his longtime co-producer Hod David as bringing shape to the album. \u201cThe times change and the stakes get bigger, but when you\u2019ve worked with the same guy since you were 17 there\u2019s no faking it,\u201d he jokes. He once famously told Rolling Stone after the release of his debut that everyone he\u2019s ever admired possessed a public vulnerability \u2013 \u2018where the sensitivity is right there for you,\u2019 confessing, even then, that it\u2019s not always easy to come by \u2013 that \u2018sacrificing side,\u2019 as he coined it. It is here where the boundary crossing, inspirational Maxwell has always been the most prescientand approachable; open 24/7 to his long-held notion that the music is in the atmosphere, and that his best work has always channeled him. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what taking your time is really about,\u201d he ponders nearly 20 years later. \u201cBeing available. Ready.\u201d Nailing it on the riveting \u201cLost\u201d on the initial try - singing the song for the very first time - is ample evidence of being in tune to life\u2019s full effects. He likens the song in spirit, at least, to BLACKsummers\u2019night touchstone single \u201cPretty Wings\u201d \u2013 \u201cif \u201c\u2018Pretty Wings\u2019 ended up having children and going on,\u201d he laughs, marveling at how the former song is now played at weddings. \u201cThat song as intended is about breaking up and letting someone go and people now celebrate it at the most important gathering of their lives. But that\u2019s OK with me too,\u201d he says. Maxwell cites another nod to the inaugural album of the trilogy, \u201cFingers Crossed.\u201d \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s straight-up \u201cFistful Of Tears\u201d Part 2 \u2013 that feeling of wanting someone to feel good about being involved with you. But I want all my songs to have a life of their own. To be interpreted how people hear and feel them in the normal course of their lives.\u201d That unmediated connection to his audience has always been the lynchpin of Maxwell\u2019s career. Known for stoking libidinal fires long after his records and concerts subside, the LA Times once shrewdly observed he\u2019s also \u2018stayed true to his own internal clock, timing his (musical) pleas as they might unfold in real time,\u2019 rejecting the impulse to falsely heighten any moment. His 1996 debut masterpiece, Maxwell\u2019s Urban Hang Suite, was the rarest of gems, new and cognizant of the soul-standard bearers who came before. Groundbreaking permutations came in the form of iconic singles such as \u201cTil The Cops Come Knockin\u2019,\u201d and \u201cAscension (Don\u2019t Ever Wonder),\u201d among others. The then-23-year-old achieved universal praise and double platinum status for his debut, garnering a Grammy nomination. Maxwell\u2019s MTV; Unplugged came next, cementing his \u2018auteur\u2019 reputation and attracting universal acclaim for his diverse choice of material, including covers of indie breakthrough artists\u2019 Kate Bush and Nine Inch Nails. He went on to acclaimed platinum-plus successes with 1998\u2019s Embrya, and 2001\u2019s Now, enjoying sold-out tours and an ever-expanding loyal audience more than willing to grow with him. And they never mind the \u2018wait,\u2019 which has only deepened the mutual appreciation between Maxwell and his fans. His tight, communal bond with his listeners fuels blackSUMMERS\u2019night, revealing new surprises and aching links to a musical canon that peels back the curtain on love and heartbreak like only Maxwell can. When asked if there\u2019s any final litmus-test he conducts personally before letting his able team snatch the new songs from his clutches, Maxwell smiles. \u201cThe music has to \u2018bump.\u2019 I\u2019m always asking \u2013 is the music bumping enough. And it really has to work in the car. If it\u2019s not bumping in the car, it\u2019s not coming out.\u201d In an age of immediacy the idea of waiting sounds hopelessly outdated.

After years of dishonest living\u2014consumed by drugs, alcohol, and addiction\u2014such sincerity is jarring from the 30-year-old Chicago-based musician. Liberated from a self-destructive past and born anew in sobriety, Francis has captured an inspired collection of songs steeped in New Orleans rhythms and Chicago blues. His music evokes a bygone era of R&B\u2019s heyday while simultaneously forging a new path on the musical landscape. Ohio-based Karma Chief Records (a subsidiary of rising soul label Colemine Records) will release two songs, \u201cThese Are The Days\u201d and \u201cChanges, Pt. 1,\u201d in early 2019 with the full LP to follow in summer 2019.\n\nThere is a deep connection between Francis\u2019s childhood\u2014his obsession with boogie woogie piano, his father\u2019s gift of a dusty Dr. John LP\u2014and the songs he\u2019s created. The result is an astonishing collection of material without parallel in the contemporary funk and soul scene. The influences are unmistakable: the vocal stylings of Allen Toussaint and Leon Russell; the second line rhythms of The Meters and Dr. John; the barroom rock \u2018n\u2019 roll of The Rolling Stones; the gospel soul of Billy Preston; the roots music of The Band. Francis pays tribute to the masters but has his own story to tell: \u201cIt\u2019s the life I\u2019ve lived so far.\u201d\n\nAnd what a life it\u2019s been. Born Neal Francis O\u2019Hara, the piano prodigy found himself touring Europe by the age of 18 with Muddy Waters\u2019 son and backing up other prominent blues artists coast-to-coast. In 2012, Francis joined popular instrumental funk band The Heard. With Francis at the creative helm, The Heard transformed into a national act, touring with boogaloo progenitors The New Mastersounds and chart toppers The Revivalists and appearing at Jazz Fest and Bear Creek. As The Heard\u2019s star rose, however, Francis sunk deeper into addiction. Once a promising sideman, by 2015 he had been fired from his band, evicted from his apartment, and was perilously close to self-destruction. \u201cWhen you get close to death like that you can feel it,\u201d Francis recalls. An alcohol-induced seizure that year led to a broken femur, dislocated arm, and, finally, the realization that he needed to get clean.\n\nThe journey from a hospital bed to launching his solo career was neither predictable nor straightforward. There were musical fits and starts, relapses, and broken relationships. Yet the overwhelming passion driving Francis in this second act has been an overabundance of creative energy. \u201cDrinking held my music in a half-cocked slingshot. I was always so consumed by drugs and alcohol that I didn\u2019t have the time, money, or creative energy to do it. Sobriety let it loose.\u201d\n\nDetermined to realize the songs swirling in his head, Francis assembled a crack team of musicians, calling on bassist Mike Starr (The Heard) and drummer PJ Howard (The Revivalists, The Heard). He linked up with producer and analog-obsessive Sergio Rios (Orgone, Cee Lo Green, Alicia Keys) and self-funded a trip to Killion Sound in Los Angeles to record the initial batch of material. \u201cI learned to trust my instincts in that room,\u201d says Francis. Buoyed by classic horn arrangements and Rios\u2019 fierce guitar work, the resulting tracks illuminate a lifetime spent studying the masters of soul music.\n\nFrom the RMI electra-piano riff that kicks off \u201cShe\u2019s A Winner\u201d to the screaming organ swells of \u201cThis Time,\u201d Francis and company let it all hang out. This is fun music, dance music. Yet verse after verse and chorus after chorus, Francis wrestles with his past in a straightforward manner: \u201cIt\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I\u2019m not home/ I\u2019m surrounded by people, but I\u2019m really alone.\u201d Like Toussaint and Russell before him he\u2019s married the upbeat rhythms of New Orleans R&B with the lyrical approach of a confessional singer/songwriter. The refrain on \u201cThis Time\u201d serves as a foxhole prayer for a better future: \u201cLet me get it this time/I won\u2019t let you down/Let me get it this time/I won\u2019t fool around.\u201d\n\n2018 has been a busy year. In February Francis finished recording basic tracks for the yet-to-be named debut album in Los Angeles and spent the following months doing overdubs in Chicago with engineer Mike Novak (who also recorded demos for the project). After playing his first show in November, Francis was signed by Paradigm Talent Agency. He is now preparing to tour relentlessly to promote his own music. \u201cI\u2019m doing this to fulfill a drive within myself, but also to pay tribute to the gifts I\u2019ve been given. And it comes from a place of immense gratitude. I\u2019ve been given so much in my life, especially in the last two years, that this feels like a bonus.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "80-12 51st Avenue, Elmhurst, NY 11373", "Artist": "Automb", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9191144.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.883302, 40.737368], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Black Metal, Death Metal, Blackened Death Metal, Extreme Metal", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Blackthorn 51", "moreBioInfo": "Automb is a female-fronted black metal band that features bone-crushing blast beats, soul wrenching growls, punishing rhythms, and epic atmospheric leads.\n\nFOR FANS OF: Belphegor, Dissection, Behemoth, Emperor, Watain and Mayhem.\n\nTheir debut album \u2018Esoterica\u2019 features Serge Streltsov of NECROPHAGIA, and session work from Scott Fuller of MORBID ANGEL as well as vocalist/bassist/keyboardist Danielle Evans.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Noah Aronson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6648981.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Jewish Folk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Havdallah Experience with Rabbi David Ingber at Limmud NY - New York City, NY", "moreBioInfo": "Noah Aronson is a graduate of Berklee College of Music and has been working as a musician for the majority of his professional life.

Since forming in 1999, the trio of guitarist Eric Krasno, drummer Alan Evans and keyboardist Neal Evans has carried the torch for the soul-jazz organ trio\u2014that venerable, funky institution pioneered by the likes of Jimmy Smith, Brother Jack McDuff and Groove Holmes in the late \u201960s. Rest assured, when the Evans brothers first brought Kraz by their Woodstock studio, there was plenty of old vinyl spread out on the floor. In their 13 years together, Soulive has followed the muse in the direction of hip-hop, R&B, blues and rock, collaborating with the likes of Chaka Khan, Dave Matthews, Talib Kweli, John Scofield, Derek Trucks, Maceo Parker, Susan Tedeschi, Robert Randolph, Joshua Redman, Kenny Garrett, Fred Wesley, The Roots, Ivan Neville and so many others, even going so far as to record a full album of covers by The Beatles (Rubber Soulive). But, no matter how they push the limits of the organ trio, they always come back to their bread and butter: blistering solos and grooves that don\u2019t quit. Their latest, a four-track EP entitled, SPARK, deserves a place on your record shelf right between Booker T. and a bottle of some damn good single-malt. Recorded over a day and a half with saxophonist/flautist Karl Denson (The Greyboy Allstars, Karl Denson\u2019s Tiny Universe), the record captures the smoky vibe of early-\u201970s-era CTI Records releases by the likes of Freddie Hubbard, Grover Washington Jr. and George Benson. It\u2019s the stuff Denson grew up on. \u201cI\u2019m older than the Soulive guys,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I heard those records being sampled back in the late 80s, early 90s, popping up in clubs when I was over in Europe touring with Lenny Kravitz, that\u2019s what really prepared me for this whole thing we\u2019ve been doing for the last 20 years. It was a natural progression for me to finally do something in the CTI vein.\u201d Each tune was ultimately just a vehicle for the musicians\u2019 playing, so, sticking to this formula, the quartet used very few overdubs. \u201cBack in that era,\u201d Krasno explains, \u201cyou bought a piece of vinyl and it had two tracks on either side. The grooves were kind of dark but really open and each musician got a chance to breathe.\u201d Denson continues: \u201cSPARK is really about the playing, less about the tunes. It\u2019s the four of us collectively getting back to more of a jazzier thing than we\u2019d done in recent memory.\u201d The first side opens with Yusef Lateef\u2019s sultry Nubian Lady, featuring Denson on flute. It was a mutual love for Lateef that brought the quartet together to begin with\u2014Kraz having studied with the legend and Denson having idolized his records. The laid-back tempo lets the group simmer on the theme until Kraz decides to slice the whole thing open with some Middle Eastern fretwork, leaving Karl to pick up the pieces. Denson describes the sound as \u201cSomething a little more chilled out but funky at the same time.\u201d Povo is a perfect evocation of the era, first recorded by Freddie Hubbard on CTI in 1972, featuring some of Kraz\u2019s most sinewy lines and a caterwauling climax on tenor from Denson. When the two lay out, the Evans brothers remind the listener why an organ and a drum kit have always been plenty good for funky jazz. \u201cWe\u2019ve always loved James Brown and music that\u2019s going to make you groove,\u201d says Krasno. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much more vocabulary from jazz that you can put in it.\u201d Art Farmer would have agreed. The band\u2019s rendition of his 1972 tune Soulsides slips plenty of ideas into the deep pocket, putting Neal Evans out front on piano. Spark, the only original song on the record, was written in homage to legendary soul-jazz guitarist Melvin Sparks, who passed away only days before Soulive entered the studio. Known for his fleet fingers and deft sense of the blues, Sparks made his name backing organists like McDuff and Dr. Lonnie Smith. Krasno grew up listening to Sparks play at a regular gig in New Canaan, CT, and credits the guitarist with inspiring many of his own sensibilities. When Denson asked Sparks to open for the Greyboy Allstars\u2019 first East Coast tour in 1994, it revived his career. \u201cWe totally got along and had a great time over the years,\u201d says Denson. Sparks joined Karl Denson\u2019s Tiny Universe to record Dance Lesson No. 2 in 2001 and \u201cjust annihilated it. He was a great cat and a total musical mentor.\u201d So, it was with sadness that the four musicians collectively penned the tune and with reverence that they perform the slinky strut, while dedicating the EP to his memory. Denson eulogizes on both flute and tenor while Krasno\u2019s tone impeccably channels the musician he calls, \u201cone of the great guitarists of our time and the coolest dude I knew.\u201d http://soulive.com http://facebook.com/soulive http://twitter.com/soulive Keeping the future of funk in good hands with brothers Neal & Alan Evans alongside Eric Krasno.

Raised in Washington DC, his music career took flight after moving to Brooklyn, NY. In 15 years of touring, he has built a devout following, performing at sold out theatres and ballrooms across the country. Over time, Cope\u2019s music has become the soundtrack to the lives of those who have embraced it and he continues to inspire audiences through what can only be described as a deep personal connection.\n\nHis first album in seven years, Heroin and Helicopters tackles Cope\u2019s personal struggles with institutional religion, political manipulation, hollowness in the entertainment world, and spiritual enlightenment. It\u2019s named after an encounter with rock \u2018n\u2019 roll icon Santana: one evening at the Fillmore in San Francisco, Santana told him to \u201cstay away from the two H\u2019s\u201d - heroin and helicopters - both things having very fatal results with people in music. Cope saw meaning in the comment, reflected in the current epidemic of addictions that plague our world, not just to substances but to conflict, handheld devices, social media, and the lure of not having to work hard to get places fast.

After his debut performance at his mom\u2019s neighborhood restaurant, he played small gigs around his hometown of Washington, DC, finding his voice and realizing he loved being on stage. Though his love was writing and performing, he attended Berklee College of Music for film scoring (inspired by John Williams) and bass. After graduating, Owen released his first full-length album, Twelve Stories, which was well-received by his growing fan base. Owen quickly began working on new music, releasing his single, \u201cNo Such Thing,\u201d which won the American Songwriter Magazine Lyric Contest. While working on his next release, Owen got a call from the producers of NBC\u2019s The Voice, inviting him to audition for coaches Adam Levine, Christina Aguilera, Pharrell Williams, and Blake Shelton. Receiving the coveted \u201cFour Chair Turn,\u201d Owen ultimately chose to work with Adam Levine. Under Levine\u2019s mentorship, Owen performed his way to the live shows and earned the distinction of being the first Voice contestant ever to play bass on the show. On The Voice, Owen had the opportunity to perform in many styles, which truly reflects his sensibilities as an artist. Although inspired by a variety of genres including folk, pop, and rock, and from artists across the charts, such as Green Day, Paul Simon, Ed Sheeran, and Johnny Cash, the thread that ties his music together and makes it authentically his own is his pairing of personal lyrics with melodies that love to get stuck in your head. Like a soundtrack to real life, Owen\u2019s songs give words to moments that resonate with so many, while remaining honest and vulnerable. Following his experience on The Voice, Owen moved to Nashville, TN, a haven for all genres and home to some of the industry\u2019s best writers and musicians - some of whom Owen has had the pleasure of writing and performing with. Two songs Owen wrote with CMT\u2019s Nashville star, Charles Esten, have been released as part of Esten\u2019s widely followed \u201cEvery Single Friday\u201d series. Owen has also performed multiple times at the iconic Bluebird Caf\u00e9, by himself and on rounds with artists and writers such Gordon Kennedy (Change the World, Eric Clapton). Shortly after the move to Nashville, Owen released his most recent EP, \u201cLove on Your Side,\u201d named for the edgy folk/pop title track.

Raised in Washington DC, his music career took flight after moving to Brooklyn, NY. In 15 years of touring, he has built a devout following, performing at sold out theatres and ballrooms across the country. Over time, Cope\u2019s music has become the soundtrack to the lives of those who have embraced it and he continues to inspire audiences through what can only be described as a deep personal connection.\n\nHis first album in seven years, Heroin and Helicopters tackles Cope\u2019s personal struggles with institutional religion, political manipulation, hollowness in the entertainment world, and spiritual enlightenment. It\u2019s named after an encounter with rock \u2018n\u2019 roll icon Santana: one evening at the Fillmore in San Francisco, Santana told him to \u201cstay away from the two H\u2019s\u201d - heroin and helicopters - both things having very fatal results with people in music. Cope saw meaning in the comment, reflected in the current epidemic of addictions that plague our world, not just to substances but to conflict, handheld devices, social media, and the lure of not having to work hard to get places fast. He observed a thread being woven, where mass production has trumped quality goods and shortcuts in life have become commonplace, enticing people to step over others for self-enrichment. Where entitlement and greed have become the norm as empathy and awareness of the human condition become an afterthought, the common man has lost his powerful voice to corporations.

This mysterious capacity for creativity and rejuvenation under the sea symbolically presents itself again and again in the songs of Dead Reckoning, the take-no- prisoners debut Wicked Cool Records album by Soraia being released October 13. \u201cDead Reckoning is a nautical term meaning that you know where you are in the ocean based not on your location on a map but on where you've already been,\u201d says Soraia singer ZouZou Mansour. \u201cI may not know exactly where I'm headed, but these lyrics are all about who I am today \u2014 the good, bad and ugly.\u201d Tracing threads beginning with the \u201960s soul of Stax and Motown, borrowing flickers of luminescence from rock icons such as Patti Smith and Joan Jett as well as Iggy Pop and The Cramps, through kindred spirits of the \u201990s and beyond like PJ Harvey and The Kills, the primal sounds of this Philadelphia- based four-piece provide a formidable match for a set of mostly autobiographical songs that lead listeners through the depths of desperate situations and guide them out the other side to redemption. \u201cMusic had already saved me from several suicide attempts by the time I was 15, when the lyrics to songs spoke to me and revealed I wasn\u2019t alone in my suffering,\u201d ZouZou reveals. \u201cI knew by that age I was going to do music for a living. \u201cI lived a long time feeling a victim of things: life, people, situations. Powerless. I finally realized I needed connection. That\u2019s where empowerment comes in. My story is about bringing myself back to who I was always meant to be, which required commitment and action. It took action to change my life. And when I committed to and believed in that action, I asked for help where I needed it and continue to check myself and stay humble.\u201d After escaping some harrowing situations and getting sober, the pursuit of ZouZou\u2019s musical dreams began crystallizing in the band Soraia. \u201cSoraia is actually my birth name,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we want it to be how the band is known, because it\u2019s another name for the constellation Pleiades, and generally is taken to mean bright, guiding force or star. Our magic and energy emulate that idea, so it is no longer just the name but a group and the hope and purpose behind what we do. The idea is to give light.\u201d Surrounding ZouZou with boundless talent are bassist and frequent co-writer Travis Smith (\u201cresilient, passionate, with a gift for writing the catchiest riffs I\u2019ve heard from anyone, ever\u201d), guitarist and musical director Mike Reisman (\u201cplays like someone with three times his experience and keeps us centered\u201d) and drummer Brianna Sig (\u201cplays with reckless abandon and precision\u201d). \u201cWhat makes the sound of Soraia,\u201d says ZouZou, \u201cis we all are huge fans of the same legendary artists and bring these strong influences to the table: Travis\u2019 love of The Misfits and garage rock of the \u201960s versus my love of melody and pop, along with influences such as Queen and Led Zeppelin.\u201d The band made waves with their punked up cover of The Kinks\u2019 \u201c(I\u2019m Not) Like Everybody Else,\u201d which hit #1 on rock radio in South America in 2013. Their last independently released album In The Valley Of Love And Guns featured five songs the band co-wrote with Jon Bon Jovi. By this point, the energy emanating from the Soraia constellation had already reached the eyes and ears of renowned tastemaker Steven Van Zandt (The E Street Band, The Sopranos), the Wicked Cool mastermind who has eagerly bestowed Coolest Song In The World honors on five of their tracks since 2013, including his #1 pick of 2016, \u201cElectrocutioner.\u201d They\u2019ve consistently earned heavy rotation on Steven\u2019s weekly syndicated radio show and SiriusXM channel Little Steven\u2019s Underground Garage. Dead Reckoning\u2019s leadoff track \u201cQuicksand\u201d already enjoyed Coolest Song honors in mid-summer 2017. Longtime Rolling Stone editor David Fricke has also attested to his fandom, testifying, \u201cSearing guitars, burning soul and true CBGB grit: Soraia are the rock you need, in your face right now.\u201d The group made the trek up the New Jersey Turnpike in early 2017 to record Dead Reckoning at Van Zandt\u2019s Renegade Nation Studios in downtown New York City. Steven personally produced two of the tracks, one that he wrote for them (\u201cWhy\u201d) and the other an obscure Prince cover, \u201cWow.\u201d The band co- produced the rest of the record with the guidance of Geoff Sanoff [Fountains Of Wayne, Dashboard Confessional].

Born on a military base in Nogales, Arizona in 1922 and raised in Watts, California, his earliest musical influences came from the church\u2013 choir and group singing\u2013 and from \u201chearing Duke Ellington over the radio when [he] was eight years old.\u201d He studied double bass and composition in a formal way (five years with H. Rheinshagen, principal bassist of the New York Philharmonic, and compositional techniques with the legendary Lloyd Reese) while absorbing vernacular music from the great jazz masters, first-hand. His early professional experience, in the 40\u2019s, found him touring with bands like Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory and Lionel Hampton.\n\nEventually he settled in New York where he played and recorded with the leading musicians of the 1950\u2019s\u2013 Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Art Tatum and Duke Ellington himself. One of the few bassists to do so, Mingus quickly developed as a leader of musicians. He was also an accomplished pianist who could have made a career playing that instrument. By the mid-50\u2019s he had formed his own publishing and recording companies to protect and document his growing repertoire of original music. He also founded the \u201cJazz Workshop,\u201d a group which enabled young composers to have their new works performed in concert and on recordings.\n\nMingus soon found himself at the forefront of the avant-garde. His recordings bear witness to the extraordinarily creative body of work that followed. They include: Pithecanthropus Erectus, The Clown, Tijuana Moods, Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Ah Um, The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, Cumbia and Jazz Fusion, Let My Children Hear Music. He recorded over a hundred albums and wrote over three hundred scores.\nAlthough he wrote his first concert piece, \u201cHalf-Mast Inhibition,\u201d when he was seventeen years old, it was not recorded until twenty years later by a 22-piece orchestra with Gunther Schuller conducting. It was the presentation of \u201cRevelations\u201d which combined jazz and classical idioms, at the 1955 Brandeis Festival of the Creative Arts, that established him as one of the foremost jazz composers of his day.\n\nIn 1971 Mingus was awarded the Slee Chair of Music and spent a semester teaching composition at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In the same year his autobiography, Beneath the Underdog, was published by Knopf. In 1972 it appeared in a Bantam paperback and was reissued after his death, in 1980, by Viking/Penguin and again by Pantheon Books, in 1991. In 1972 he also re-signed with Columbia Records. His music was performed frequently by ballet companies, and Alvin Ailey choreographed an hour program called \u201cThe Mingus Dances\u201d during a 1972 collaboration with the Robert Joffrey Ballet Company.\n\nHe toured extensively throughout Europe, Japan, Canada, South America and the United States until the end of 1977 when he was diagnosed as having a rare nerve disease, Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis. He was confined to a wheelchair, and although he was no longer able to write music on paper or compose at the piano, his last works were sung into a tape recorder.\n\nFrom the 1960\u2019s until his death in 1979 at age 56, Mingus remained in the forefront of American music. When asked to comment on his accomplishments, Mingus said that his abilities as a bassist were the result of hard work but that his talent for composition came from God.\n\nMingus received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Smithsonian Institute, and the Guggenheim Foundation (two grants). He also received an honorary degree from Brandeis and an award from Yale University. At a memorial following Mingus\u2019 death, Steve Schlesinger of the Guggenheim Foundation commented that Mingus was one of the few artists who received two grants and added: \u201cI look forward to the day when we can transcend labels like jazz and acknowledge Charles Mingus as the major American composer that he is.\u201d The New Yorker wrote: \u201cFor sheer melodic and rhythmic and structural originality, his compositions may equal anything written in western music in the twentieth century.\u201d\n\nHe died in Mexico on January 5, 1979, and his wife, Sue Graham Mingus, scattered his ashes in the Ganges River in India. Both New York City and Washington, D.C. honored him posthumously with a \u201cCharles Mingus Day.\u201d\n\nAfter his death, the National Endowment for the Arts provided grants for a Mingus foundation created by Sue Mingus called \u201cLet My Children Hear Music\u201d which catalogued all of Mingus\u2019 works. The microfilms of these works were then given to the Music Division of the New York Public Library where they are currently available for study and scholarship \u2013 a first for jazz. Sue Mingus has founded three working repertory bands called the Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Orchestra, and the Mingus Big Band, which continue to perform his music. Biographies of Charles Mingus include Mingus by Brian Priestley, Mingus/Mingus by Janet Coleman and Al Young, Myself When I Am Real by Gene Santoro, and Tonight at Noon, a memoir by Sue Mingus.\n\nMingus\u2019 masterwork, \u201cEpitaph,\u201d a composition which is more than 4000 measures long and which requires two hours to perform, was discovered during the cataloguing process. With the help of a grant from the Ford Foundation, the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by Gunther Schuller, in a concert produced by Sue Mingus at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989, ten years after Mingus\u2019 death.\n\nThe New Yorker wrote that \u201cEpitaph\u201d represents the first advance in jazz composition since Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cBlack, Brown, and Beige,\u201d which was written in 1943. The New York Times said it ranked with the \u201cmost memorable jazz events of the decade.\u201d Convinced that it would never be performed in his lifetime, Mingus called his work \u201cEpitaph,\u201d declaring that he wrote it \u201cfor my tombstone.\u201d\n\nThe Library of Congress purchased the Charles Mingus Collection, a major acquisition, in 1993; this included autographed manuscripts, photographs, literary manuscripts, correspondence, and tape recordings of interviews, broadcasts, recording sessions, and Mingus composing at the piano.\n\nSue Mingus has published a number of educational books through Hal Leonard Publishing, including Charles Mingus: More Than a Fake Book, Charles Mingus: More Than a Play-Along, Charles Mingus: Easy Piano Solos, many big band charts\u2014 including the Simply Mingus set of big band music charts\u2013 and a Mingus guitar book.\n\nReprinted in part from More than a Fake Book \u00a9 1991 Jazz Workshop, Inc.\n\nLinks to Additional Biographical and Historical Information on the Web\n\nLibrary of Congress\nAn index to the holdings of the Charles Mingus Collection, Music Division of the Library of Congress.\nhttp://www.loc.gov/performingarts/encyclopedia/collections/mingus.html", "otherInfo": "Jazz Standard proudly presents our tenth annual Mingus High School Competition 1979).

Eric released his first record at Age 16 for Elektra records to an amazing response from the media and music fans around the globe. Guitar World Magazine\u2019s Reader\u2019s Poll named Eric as \u201cBest New Talent,\u201d in 1991. After recording a second record for Elektra, all three brothers teamed up for The Gales Bros. \u201cLeft Hand Brand\u201d which was recorded for the House of Blues label in 1996. Through the years, it would not be unusual to look out in the audience and see artists like Carlos Santana, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, B. B. King, and Eric Clapton, looking on with interest as Eric took his God-given talent and worked crowd after crowd into a frenzy. The new Millennium presented new opportunities for Eric and he was signed to a deal with Nightbird Records which was affiliated with the Hendrix family and distributed through MCA/Universal. Under this deal, Eric recorded the critically acclaimed record \u201cThat\u2019s What I Am\u201d in 2001 and hit the road, mesmerizing fans around the world with his uncanny connection to his guitar. In 2006 Eric recorded the critically acclaimed CD \u201cCrystal Vision\u201d for Blues Bureau and set the stage for his incredible Blues Bureau follow-up, \u201cThe Psychedelic Underground.\u201d in 2007. Eric followed sharply in 2008 with \"The Story of my Life\" and in 2010 hit a new stride altogether with the incredibly successful album \"Relentless\". That album combined with his latest studio album \"Transformation\" released in 2011 set the stage for his upcoming Double Live Album/DVD due in October of 2012. As both an African-American left-handed guitarist of extraordinary ability and an expressive vocalist, it is natural for people to compare Eric to Hendrix but Eric has developed a unique hybrid blues/rock sound that also draws upon influences as diverse as Albert King and Eric Johnson.

Eric\u2019s brother Eugene Gales played bass in the Eric Gales Band and his brother Little Jimmy King had a thriving career as a blues artist before his untimely death. Eric released his first record at Age 16 for Elektra records to an amazing response from the media and music fans around the globe. Guitar World Magazine\u2019s Reader\u2019s Poll named Eric as \u201cBest New Talent,\u201d in 1991. After recording a second record for Elektra, all three brothers teamed up for The Gales Bros. \u201cLeft Hand Brand\u201d which was recorded for the House of Blues label in 1996. Through the years, it would not be unusual to look out in the audience and see artists like Carlos Santana, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, B. B. King, and Eric Clapton, looking on with interest as Eric took his God-given talent and worked crowd after crowd into a frenzy. The new Millennium presented new opportunities for Eric and he was signed to a deal with Nightbird Records which was affiliated with the Hendrix family and distributed through MCA/Universal. Under this deal, Eric recorded the critically acclaimed record \u201cThat\u2019s What I Am\u201d in 2001 and hit the road, mesmerizing fans around the world with his uncanny connection to his guitar. In 2006 Eric recorded the critically acclaimed CD \u201cCrystal Vision\u201d for Blues Bureau and set the stage for his incredible Blues Bureau follow-up, \u201cThe Psychedelic Underground.\u201d in 2007. Eric followed sharply in 2008 with \"The Story of my Life\" and in 2010 hit a new stride altogether with the incredibly successful album \"Relentless\". That album combined with his latest studio album \"Transformation\" released in 2011 set the stage for his upcoming Double Live Album/DVD due in October of 2012. As both an African-American left-handed guitarist of extraordinary ability and an expressive vocalist, it is natural for people to compare Eric to Hendrix but Eric has developed a unique hybrid blues/rock sound that also draws upon influences as diverse as Albert King and Eric Johnson.

This multi-cultural upbringing sparked in Patrizio an early passion for languages, and by the age of 17 he already spoke fluent Italian, German, English, French and Spanish. It seemed obvious for both Patrizio and his parents for him to become an interpreter, and after graduation from school he went on to study Slavic languages at University and today he can add fluent Polish to his language tool kit. But whilst his aptitude for languages is admirable, a much greater gift, apparent even from the age of 4, was emerging - his gift to be able to sing and entertain people. While Patrizio\u2019s parents would record old vinyl records onto cassettes to be played in their restaurant, the three or four year old Patrizio would sing along enthusiastically whilst playing with his toys. At the age of eight Patrizio received his first guitar which further encouraged his interest in entertaining his family and friends in the \u201cBuanne home\u201d. At the age of eleven, Patrizio had the first of his many appearances in talent contests. With the conviction at such an early age to, ultimately, become a singer and actor he ended up winning all the competitions he ever participated in. Several small musical productions and gigs, with his self-formed rock and roll band, and as a solo performer then followed. Six years later, when Patrizio was seventeen, a music industry manager who had heard Patrizio sing proposed a performance at the occasion of the \u201cPapal visit\u201d in Wroclaw, Poland. The song, which was half in Italian, half in polish, had been written for the opening mass, and with 85.000 people in attendance Patrizio\u2019s sudden popularity with the polish public led to his first local record deal. But tragically, it was also to be the year that his father died from virulent cancer, and the subsequent grief became such that Patrizio almost lost his own life to a perforated ulcer. \u201cIt was music and the goal to make my family proud that kept me alive and made me strong\u201d Patrizio. At nineteen, Patrizio graduated from school in Vienna and moved back to Italy for good. He attended a university in Rome to study languages, whilst looking out for opportunities in the entertainment industry. Patrizio quickly became popular through various talent competitions, and was requested to be a guest and entertainer on various Italian television shows such as \u201cMomenti di Gloria\u201d, \u201cDomenica In\u201d and \u201cLibero\u201d. This success lead to Patrizio being offered a contract to work as an entertainer for the production company that produced shows for the Italian Broadcasting Corporation, RAI and Mediaset. Patrizio\u2019s real ambition, however, was to become an international recording artist and from 1999 onwards he invested his own money into shaping ideas and concepts with which to approach record companies and international concert promoters. Various trips and tours were undertaken, as well as independently distributed CD\u2019s and DVD\u2019s \u2013 all of which without having a manager. In 2004 Patrizio approached a producer who had the right resources to realize his concept and idea of recording with an orchestra comprising a collection of romantic and fun songs from the Italian songbook. The very songs that Patrizio was brought up listening to and dedicated to his late father. That way Patrizio also wanted to explain on the other hand that Italian music is not just opera or classical, but hat there are countless tunes that are originally Italian, and became international standards over the years. With a finished produced album under his belt he auditioned for several record companies and was finally signed by a major record company in the UK for a world wide release. His international debut album entitled, \u201cThe Italian\u201d , was finished at the Abbey Road Studios (made famous by The Beatles) in London, accompanied by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. After its first release in February 2005, it reached the top ten on the pop charts in the United Kingdom, where it attained golden status after only 1 week. Following international promotion, the album was certified as platinum in South Africa, as well as across Asia, New Zealand, some European countries and even reached triple platinum status in Australia. Following \u201cThe Italian\u201d \u2019s international release, Patrizio performed two sets of sell-out tour dates in 2006 with a six week tour of major theatres and concert venues in Australia, Asia, South Africa and Europe. His live concert DVD certified platinum sales and was broadcasted on the American public television network PBS breaking records at PBS stations across the United States which lead to his first US tour playing venues with a capacity of 2000-3500 people across the nation. Patrizio\u2019s second album \u201cForever Begins Tonight\u201d, in many ways a \u201cvolume 2 \u201d of his debut album, reached #53 in the US. The album included an Italian version of \"Angels\"(entitled \u201cUn angelo\u201d) originally recorded by British singer Robbie Williams, which became Patrizio\u2019s first radio hit in the United States. In October 2006 Patrizio was invited by the NIAF (National Italian American Foundation)to perform at the prestigious gala in Washington, D.C, for US President George W. Bush. In less than two years, his debut album \u201cThe Italian\u201d and \u201cForever begins tonight\u201d had captured the hearts of fans of timeless Italian songs worldwide to the extent that over a million albums were sold, and all this without Patrizio having an international radio hit or professional music management. With this significant success under his belt and huge demand in the US, Patrizio decided that in order to take his career to the next level, he would need to spend time in the US not only touring, but to seek representation from a serious player within the music establishment. Having spent the following one and half years living and performing exclusively in the US, Patrizio finally found that person in 2008, one of North America\u2019s biggest and most long-standing Managers. Patrizio had finally found not only the person with the belief, passion and enthusiasm to guide him through his next chapter but a business partner with the right reputation and know how to break into the US market. This next phase included securing a new global recording contract and the recording of Patrizio\u2019s 3rd album, under the helm of veteran music producers such as, Humberto Gatica, a man who felt in love with Patrizio's voice and understood his vision from the very first day, and Brian Rawlings who is responsible for countless hits in the last 20years, recognized Patrizio's potentials and was enthusiastic to write for Patrizio's new release . This new fresh team has ever since collaborated on researching more tunes of the Italian songbook, that have become Patrizio's trade mark, but that also feature this time Patrizio\u00b4s own contemporary and timeless interpretation of International and American standards, alongside some stunning new compositions for an eponymous titled CD. Simply named \u201cPATRIZIO\u201d. Its first release in Australia, New Zealand, Asia and South Africa, responded not only with Platinum awards but with an immediate tour schedule for Austral-Asia in May 2010, US release and tour 2011-and a preparation for his German speaking album in 2012. Currently touring worldwide and recording now also in other languages. But what quality separates Patrizio from other great artists? Is it the natural grace of his voice, the \u201crugged\u201d good looks, or the confident, casual, respectful attention that he gives to his audience? Or is it just the basic trust he evokes in people?

Most clear in my memory, even amid the party that a live music backstage scene can tend to be, Will was the happiest guy in the place \u2013 clearly exactly where he wanted to be, and loving every second. This was a contagious vibe from the outset, one that Will had no trouble channeling into music that rings in the heart of the listener, and a live show as inspiring as it is entertaining. Between two acclaimed and successful albums, 2012\u2019s Rose Queen and 2015\u2019s Ringling Road, and what now clocks in at a near-decade's worth of dogged road work, William Clark Green has established himself as one of the most important voices of his genre - a voice that now pipes up again on his anticipated new album, Hebert Island.\n\nTexas is a big place, complete with fully distinct sub-territories - we reserve the right to bust into several states, should that become strategically expedient - and our traveling musical artists tend to become experts on the rich mosaic that makes up Texas' cultural geography. Will has found himself onstage in a growing portion of her 254 counties, and has called several his home; as he puts it, \"I kinda spend six years everywhere\". Childhood northeast in Tyler, high school years in College Station, college years at Texas Tech in Lubbock, early music career years in the north-central hamlet of Eastland, and lately his most urban digs so far, in Fort Worth - but deep down, Will's Cajun roots call to him incessantly, and thus southeast Texas is never far from his mind. The new album is named for Will's retreat at Hebert Island (say \"AY-Bear\", though you'll occasionally hear \"HEE-Bert\") near Beaumont, and refers to the hilltop upon which his camphouse sits - not an actual island, but a potential one, should the occasional flood come to pass; high ground is valuable in this landscape. Will considers himself a \"half-ass coon-ass\" - a distantly-descended Cajun, but one who holds a deep appreciation for that history and that way of life. \"It's a real place\", Will insists, with the feeling that only such a beloved space can foster - his family has owned it since 1869, in the early years of Reconstruction, and is where they established one of the state's first rice farming operations. It's a place that echoes through time for William Clark Green, connecting his family's past and tradition to who he is as an artist, and as a man, today.\n\nIt's been over three years since Ringling Road. \"I'm not gonna force songs,\" Will sighs. \"We could have finished the record a long time ago, but we didn't like the mixes - we're the bosses, and we don't have to listen to ourselves.\" The pressures and deadlines of the professional recording artist are nothing new, and while he certainly notices that pressure, Will recognizes it to be a good problem to have. \"I remember when no one gave a shit, so yeah, it's incredible to have that want-to. So far, every record I've come out with has been my best record - I wrote my ass off for this one. I wanted to make sure it beat Ringling Road, and I'm not bragging on myself - I just knew it was going to take effort.\"\n\nThat effort has paid off; Hebert Island is a stellar new batch of songs from a guy who has gone to great lengths to keep his energy focused, through all distraction, on quality songcraft. \"My favorite songwriter is Guy Clark - the songwriter's songwriter. It's what I've always cared about the most...the craft of songs is really where it's at for me. I think good songs are undeniable.\" Mostly recorded at Nashville\u2019s Sound Emporium with Benjy Davis at the board, the new album also features players who have been backing Will for near the full ride, including guitarist Steven Marcus and bassist Cameron Moreland. \u201cGoner\u201d stands as a shimmering, no-hard-feelings take on the moment of breakup, the protagonist of the quasi-travelogue \u201cStay\u201d understands that it doesn\u2019t matter where you are, as long as you\u2019re close to love, and the ballad \u201cShe Loves Horses\u201d exemplifies both the warmth and strength that\u2019s developed in Will\u2019s songwriting and the performance power of his players.\n\nWill's desired contribution to the world is songs that change lives for the better, and he realizes that he's conduit as much as creator for that change. And in spite of - or, perhaps, because of - the demands and pressures of the life he's chosen, and the position of leadership he's earned through a decade of determination, William Clark Green is a guy who takes none of this for granted. \"Our path is guided by something that's greater than me, I believe that. We can be very proud of what we've accomplished; we've done it the right way...I feel very proud of what we've done, and I'm thankful every day for where we're at.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1260 Ave of the Americas, New York, NY 10020", "Artist": "El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9620528.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.980032, 40.760109], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Latin, Salsa", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Radio City Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Artist Line-up Subject to Change"}, {"Address": "1601 Irving St, Rahway, NJ 07065", "Artist": "Ice-T", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/205711.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.276824, 40.610546], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Hip-hop, Rap, Hip Hop, Gangsta Rap", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Union County Performing Arts Center", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1221 6th Ave, New York City, NY 10020", "Artist": "DJ LATIN PRINCE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8917741.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98135, 40.75877], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Open Format DJ", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "PITBULL'S GLOBALIZATION on SIRIUS XM CH 13 ", "moreBioInfo": "The Latin Prince Beginning.\nDJ Latin Prince\u2019s musical career began in 1990s,\nmixing and providing music at local parties, weddings,\nas well as schools.

Lead singers Brandon and Brian have written the bulk of the groups material. They have also written for Usher, Nivea and Toni Braxton.

But at the age of 14, Jake Shimabukuro realized that he was doing something a little different with the four-stringed instrument \u2013 OK, a lot different.\n\nShimabukuro\u2019s wholly unique approach to the ukulele started early. As a youngster growing up in Honolulu, Hawaii, Shimabukuro started playing the instrument at the age of four, learning the basics from his mother, Carol, and then developing his craft further by studying the likes of musical masters such as Eddie Kamae, Ohta-San and Peter Moon. As he matured, Shimabukuro also found inspiration from guitar players, drummers, pianists, and singers. Even athletes helped fuel the intensity of his artistic fire.\n\nIn 2005, Shimabukuro\u2019s touring career really came to life with a video on YouTube. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what YouTube was at the time, so I was totally surprised when people started telling me they\u2019d seen a video of me playing \u2018While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBefore I got a chance to check it out myself, the video had gone viral and a lot of music industry folks seemed to know about it. It was crazy!\u201d Shimabukuro\u2019s deeply beautiful and original take on George Harrison\u2019s love ballad, one which captured colors and moods never associated with the ukulele before, opened the floodgates \u2013 now legions of new music lovers had to hear this instrumental marvel \u2013 and the 2006 release of Gently Weeps (produced by Mac McAnally), which mixed his own originals with equally adventurous versions of \u201cAve Maria\u201d and \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d was an unqualified success.\n\nShimabukuro\u2019s records have topped the Billboard World Music Charts on numerous occasions, and as a live performer he has become one of the hottest tickets around. He\u2019s played with world-renowned orchestras and at prestigious venues such as the Hollywood Bowl, Lincoln Center and the Sydney Opera House, and has dazzled audiences at music festivals including Bonnaroo, SXSW, the Playboy Jazz Festival and Fuji Rock Festival. He even performed for that rarest of audiences: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Not too shabby for a humble young man from Hawaii and his trusty ukulele.\n\nEven with the constant demands on his time \u2013 Shimabukuro tours roughly half the year and makes frequent appearances on media outlets such as The Today Show, Good Morning America, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Night with Conan O\u2019Brien, A Prairie Home Companion and NPR\u2019s Morning Edition \u2013 Shimabukuro\u2019s album output hasn\u2019t slowed. In 2016, he recorded the all-original Nashville Sessions at Music City\u2019s famed Ronnie\u2019s Place studio with producer R.S. Field (Steve Earle, Webb Wilder) and the ace rhythm section of bassist Nolan Verner and drummer Evan Hutchings. And now he\u2019s returned to the same city and studio \u2013 and with the same gang, too (augmented by guitarist Dave Preston) \u2013 for his newest record, The Greatest Day, which will be released on August 31, 2018.\n\n\u201cI had such a great time working with R.S. Field on Nashville Sessions,\u201d Shimabukuro explains, \u201cand I knew I wanted to continue working with him on The Greatest Day. On the last record, it was pretty much the sound of a live trio, which sounded fresh, raw and organic. We were basically writing and improvising in the studio. Now we\u2019ve expanded to a quartet, which has added more colors and variety to the overall production. Once we recorded the live takes, we experimented with overdubs, and added horns, strings and keys, and other funky sounds. There are even some vocals on a few cuts.\u201d\n\nThe 12 tracks that comprise The Greatest Day feature some of Shimabukuro\u2019s most imaginative and adventuresome playing yet. Half of the album is devoted to originals, on which the instrumentalist reaches new heights of compositional distinction. And on the covers, Shimabukuro\u2019s prodigious skills allow him to achieve the impossible, transcending his material \u2013 no mean feat considering some of the classics and standards he\u2019s tackling.\n\nAmong the self-penned tunes, there\u2019s the blissed-out title track, so effervescent and airy that it transports the listener into the clouds. Shimabukuro wrote the song the night before going into the studio. Shimabukuro, Verner and Hutchings recorded their parts first. Later, Dave Preston added a joyous, Edge-like guitar riff that really finished the tune. \u201cIt came together so quickly,\u201d Shimabukuro says, \u201cand when I heard the final mix, I just thought, \u2018Wow, this has been the greatest day!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPangram\u201d has already turned heads in concert. Titled after a sentence that uses all the letters in the alphabet (\u201clike \u2018the quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog\u2019\u201d), it\u2019s based on a chromatic scale that utilizes all the notes in the Western music scale. But even non-musicologists will ride happily along its rivers of cascading melodies and its pumping, rock-soul rhythms.\n\nAnother treasure is \u201cStraight A\u2019s,\u201d a carefree and vibrant ride guaranteed to lift spirits, on which Shimabukuro\u2019s soulful soloing recalls one of his influences, Carlos Santana. The song was inspired by the A string on the ukulele. \u201cI wanted to write something where the \u2018A\u2019 note could ring out through the entire song.\u201d\n\n\u201cMahalo John Wayne\u201d is a flat-out stunner, a delicate melody that transforms into a grand-scale cinematic symphony. Discussing its origins, Shimabukuro explains that his father\u2019s favorite actor is John Wayne (\u201cHe named me Jake after one of the Duke\u2019s characters, in the movie \u2018Big Jake\u2019\u201d), and that the two of them would often watch Westerns together. \u201cThose are some great memories of mine,\u201d he says, \u201cso, I\u2019m saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to John Wayne for my name in this song. In Hawaiian, \u2018mahalo\u2019 means \u2018thank you.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs always, Shimabukuro\u2019s playing has a wonderful quality to it \u2013 there\u2019s an innocence, as if each phrase feels new to him. This sense of discovery is abundant on his astonishing reinterpretations of songs such as the Beatles\u2019 \u201cEleanor Rigby,\u201d now re-imagined as a driving and insistent ballad, brimming with furious jazz chords and a spirited back-and-forth between Shimabukuro and dobro legend Jerry Douglas. \u201cIt was such an honor to have Jerry guest on the record,\u201d Shimabukuro says. \u201cHe was only going to play on one tune, but we had such a great time that he stayed and played on two more tracks. I hope we can do more together one day.\u201d\n\nThe two go toe to toe on Jimi Hendrix\u2019s freak-flag classic \u201cIf 6 Was 9,\u201d spiraling off into a spacey, jazz-rock odyssey that manages to be reverential to the original while simultaneously distinguishing itself as a bold new tour de force. Shimabukuro\u2019s wild wah-wah lines form transfixing sheets of sound, and he even pulls off a neat trick, varying some of his melodies to recall another Hendrix standard, \u201cLittle Wing.\u201d \u201cI wanted to throw in something unexpected, because that\u2019s what I felt like Hendrix would do.\u201d\n\nThe Zombies\u2019 psychedelic rock nugget \u201cTime of the Season\u201d was one Shimabukuro often heard in his house growing up, and on The Greatest Day he trips into nostalgia with an elegant rendition that features some of his smoothest, Wes Montgomery-like phrases. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to play this one for my parents,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as they heard it, they were like, \u2018Oh, wow! You covered the Zombies!\u2019 They thought that was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nThe Greatest Day concludes on a stately note, with a sparse yet exquisite reading of Leonard Cohen\u2019s iconic hymn \u201cHallelujah.\u201d Each line that Shimabukuro plays seeps into one\u2019s heart and soul, proving that music is indeed the universal balm. \u201cI had recorded it before, but after Cohen passed I wanted to re-record it \u2013 I felt a new emotional response to it. It seemed like the perfect way to end the album.\u201d\n\nOnly he didn\u2019t end it there: Shimabukuro was particularly excited about his playing on a recent round of dates with bassist Nolan Verner and guitarist Dave Preston. The addition of a guitarist allowed him to solo more expressively than ever before. The digital edition of The Greatest Day includes a beautiful live version of \u201cBlue Roses Falling\u201d that features Shimabukuro dueting with cellist Meena Cho as well as a concert recording of \u201cKawika\u201d (originally made famous by the Sunday Manoa).\n\nThe CD and vinyl versions of the album include both tracks along with three more cuts including immersive takes on \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d and Shimabukuro\u2019s own \u201cDragon,\u201d. There\u2019s even a slinky, ultra-funky interpretation of Bill Withers\u2019 hit single \u201cUse Me\u201d that sees Preston showing off his soulful vocal chops. They were recorded live with no overdubs at various venues by engineer Brett Lind and mixed by Jack Clarke (who engineered Nashville Sessions and The Greatest Day).\n\nShimabukuro has already been performing some of the material from The Greatest Day live, and he\u2019ll soon work more songs into his set. In mid-July, he embarks on an extensive tour of the U.S and a fall tour of Japan. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to play the new songs in my shows,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking this record was one of the highlights I\u2019ve had in the studio. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the sounds and arrangements. But most of all, we had a ton of fun making it.\u201d\n\nAlong with his tremendous professional achievements, Shimabukuro\u2019s personal life is filled with riches: He\u2019s a loving husband and proud father of two boys. While balancing career with family, he also remains firmly rooted in his commitment to community, frequently performing at schools in Hawaii and overseas, urging youngsters to find their passion and live drug-free.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "250 Bedford Park Blvd W, Bronx, NY 10468", "Artist": "Hector Acosta (El Torito)", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.893176, 40.87489], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Lehman Center for the Performing Arts", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Hector Acosta, one of the Dominican Republic\u2019s most well-known Bachata and Merengue artists, plays at Lehman Center in the Bronx for the first time to grace us with hits such as Me Voy, Sin Perdon, and Tu Veneno."}, {"Address": "620 Atlantic Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "En Vogue", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8615304.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.975985, 40.683074], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: R&B, Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Barclays Center", "moreBioInfo": "Timeless!

Alan Paul, Cheryl Bentyne, all of whom are conscious of maintaining the integrity and artistry left by founding member Tim Hauser who passed away in 2014.\n\nThe Manhattan Transfer was born when Tim Hauser was paying his bills by driving a New York City cab while aspiring to form a harmony vocal quartet that could authentically embrace varied musical styles, and still create something wholly unique in the field of American popular song. Through driving a taxi, he met the next members of the legendary group \u2014 Laurel Mass\u00e9 and Janis Siegel. Alan Paul, who was appearing in the Broadway cast of \u201cGrease\u201d at the time, was recommended as the additional male voice and the four became The Manhattan Transfer on October 1, 1972. Cheryl Bentyne joined The Manhattan Transfer in 1979, replacing Laurel.\n\nIn 1974 the group began performing regularly throughout New York City at Trude Heller\u2019s, Mercer Arts Center, Max\u2019s Kansas City, Club 82, and other cabaret venues. By the end of the year they were the number one live attraction in New York City. They were signed to Atlantic Records and released their self-titled debut in 1975. The second single, a remake of the gospel classic \u201cOperator,\u201d gave the group their first national hit.\n\n1979\u2032s Extensions earned The Transfer another smash with \u201cTwilight Zone/Twilight Tone.\u201d The vocal remake of the classic \u201cBirdland\u201d became recognized as the group\u2019s anthem and earned them their first two Grammy Awards. In 1981, they became the first group ever to win Grammy Awards in both Pop and Jazz categories in the same year \u2013 Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for \u201cBoy From New York City\u201d and Best Jazz Performance Duo or Group for \u201cUntil I Met You (Corner Pocket). The 12 Grammy nominations they received for Vocalese in 1985 made it second to Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller as the most nominated album in one year ever.\n\nThey are responsible for 19 singles and 29 albums over their stellar career and their music has been featured in major feature films and television shows. The group has also recorded with an impressive roster of artists including Tony Bennett, Bette Midler, Smokey Robinson, Laura Nyro, Phil Collins, B.B.

Aunque hoy ya no es el muchacho aquel que en 1998 lanz\u00f3 profesionalmente su primera producci\u00f3n, \u201cTodo se paga\u201d, para Mart\u00ednez el contacto con el p\u00fablico y la calidad musical que presenta en el escenario siguen siendo sus motivaciones y por ellas trabaja cada d\u00eda intensamente. Ese disco le trajo muchas satisfacciones pues le signific\u00f3 no s\u00f3lo un premio como \u201cRevelaci\u00f3n del A\u00f1o\u201d en los Premios ACE en Nueva York, sino tambi\u00e9n un \u201cPremio Estrella\u201d en la misma categor\u00eda y un Disco de Oro por las altas ventas\u2013 algo ins\u00f3lito para un bachatero. Al a\u00f1o siguiente en 1999 sale al mercado su segundo material \u201cDirecto al coraz\u00f3n\u201d, del que destacaron melod\u00edas como: \u201cEsta Navidad\u201d, \u201cTu sabes bien\u201d y \u201cAmada m\u00eda\u201d.

Y en el 2003, Mart\u00ednez demuestra y reafirma nuevamente por qu\u00e9 es considerado por la cr\u00edtica como uno de los mejores bachateros del momento con \u201cAs\u00ed te amo\u201d, una exquisita producci\u00f3n que cont\u00f3 con la mano m\u00e1gica en la producci\u00f3n del talentoso maestro Rando Camasta.

Whether performing with his own quartet or supporting Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett on tour, Newman\u2019s expert trumpeteering and effervescent stage presence reignited a big band scene in New York City, and has since enticed a new generation of jazz fans across the globe. The Verve Recording artist continues to reign at his weekly residency in New York, as well as appear on television programs and in special performances across the United States and Europe.\nNewman is known for his impeccable horn playing and rendition of romantic favorites. But what sets him apart is his ability to command a room not only with his musical talent, but as a bandleader who makes each person in the audience feel as if they are a part of his performance. His fusion of music playing and easy going banter captures the vivacity of great bandleaders of the past. This exuberance is evident on Newman\u2019s 2016 debut album, Eyes on the City, which pays tribute to his musical journey in New York.\nAlong with his Quartet, fellow musicians from Cincinnati\u2019s College-Conservatory of Music, Newman has allured audiences during his residencies at some of New York\u2019s most iconic venues. His first foray into creating an old school big band night was at the elegant Duane Park for \u201cAfter Dark,\u201d a jazz and burlesque revue on the downtown scene in Tribeca. \u201cAfter Dark\u201d lead to a weekly residency at the legendary Oak Room at The Plaza Hotel, a venue steeped in history which was frequented by the likes of Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli and countless others over its one hundred year history. Newman and his Quartet played each Wednesday to a mixed crowd seeking a slice of history, welcoming Lady Gaga as a surprise guest, until the venue closed in 2011. Currently, Newman performs every Tuesday and Thursday, as bandleader in a residency at Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel, and select Friday nights at NYC\u2019s legendary Rainbow Room with his orchestra. Brian also routinely appears for special live performances with a diverse array of musical acts, which have included Tony Bennett, Jose Feliciano, Stevie Wonder, Mark Murphy, Dierks Bentley, Willie Nile, Molly Ringwald, David Loeb, Steve Wynn\u2019s Orchestra, Ray Benson\u2019s Asleep at the Wheel and Tommy London.\nNewman\u2019s personal style, which meshes classic suits, vintage tattoos and rock-n-roll, has attracted commercial brands such as Jack Daniel\u2019s, Marc Jacobs and Tiffany & Co., who have collaborated with Newman for special events and performances. The Jack Daniel\u2019s partnership in 2012, which launched the brand\u2019s Sinatra Select premium Tennessee Whiskey, brought Newman alongside Frank Sinatra Jr. himself, in a performance in Cannes, France.\nBrian married burlesque star, Angie Pontani of the World Famous Pontani Sisters in February 2013, with whom he most notably performs in connection with Pontani\u2019s New York Burlesque Festival and Burlesque-a-Pades shows.

Como consta na Revista Roadie Crew de fevereiro de 2010, \" a musica do grupo prima por velocidade, peso e t\u00e9cnica.\" Em janeiro de 2010,a RATTLE ficou entre as 10 bandas mais votadas no site Ibahia, da Rede Bahia, afiliada da Rede Globo, numa seletiva para se apresentar no evento 'Festival de Ver\u00e3o'.

You'd have a hard time trying to guess it too.\n\nOn the surface, he exudes a romantic youthfulness \u2014 fresh faced and ready to entertain the world with his impeccable piano/vocal prowess. Look a little deeper, and it's clear that this New York City local has the 'old soul' songwriting sensibilities of some of the greatest performers of our time. Lauded as 'the Nat King Cole for a new generation' by Time Out magazine, David displays a rich level of emotion and musicality that seldom appears in today's musical landscape.\n\nOriginally born in Rochester, New York, David Raleigh moved to Seattle at the age of four where he began honing his newfound musical abilities. He grew up on a stable diet of classic soul and gospel music, was named a child prodigy in the 'Who's Who Book of Music', and received a scholarship to attend Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan. While still in his teens, a zealous young David was \u201cdiscovered\u201d and signed to cut his first record, aptly titled 'Totally Psyched'. His gospel-flavoured album showcased his stirring vocal abilities and, as a result, sent him packing on tour with Amy Grant, Sweet Comfort and The Archers.\n\nUpon basing himself in New York City, David became a winner on the hit television show 'Star Search' and released his highly acclaimed second album, 'Never Alone'. His music then found its way to the screen, appearing in Disney/ABC's 'Alchemy' (Tom Cavenagh, Sarah Chalke) and in the German cult classic 'Kleine Heie', where he starred as himself. His songs also took him all across America, performing in numerous football stadiums and arenas to welcome home troops from the Gulf War.\n\nBy this stage, David's unmistakable sound positioned him as a mainstay in New York City's music scene, regularly performing at the Bitter End, Don't Tell Mama's, Joe\u2019s Pub, the Friar's Club, Arci's Place and the Metropolitan Room. He also obtained exclusive extended engagements at Stringfellow's, the Supper Club, Tatou, the Waldorf Astoria, the Ritz Carlton and the Hotel Pierre. Inspired by the atmosphere of such venues, David's own vision for a late night fine dining restaurant opened in Greenwich Village to outstanding reviews. While short lived, \u2018Club Raleigh at the Oaks\u2019 successfully showcased his sense of design and musicality to the delight of critics, further thrusting him into the New York spotlight.\n\nDavid Raleigh\u2019s most recent outing 'Beginning Again' (2010), produced by Australian singer/songwriter Nathan Leigh Jones, caught the attention of fans both old and new with its slick piano-pop edge. the album's lead single 'I Do!' struck the right chord both online and on music television, joining VH1's general playlist and spending 10 consecutive weeks in Logo (MTV)'s top ten. the album was toured throughout Europe, Asia and Australia, culminating in the fulfilment of a life long dream \u2014 performing at the iconic Sydney Opera House. His eagerly awaited forthcoming release, further extending his soulful crossover into radio-friendly pop, is currently slated for late 2013.\n\nWhile many artists would dream of a successful career in any one genre, David Raleigh is combining the best of both worlds. Highly regarded in traditional cabaret circles, yet flirting heavily with contemporary hit radio, David Raleigh's heartfelt music continues to cross musical boundaries and transport the listener to the passionate era of his youth.\n\nSo, what era was that exactly? Nice try. He's not telling.\n\n\u2022 David Raleigh's latest album 'Beginning Again' is available now on iTunes.", "otherInfo": "David Raleigh goes back to his roots with \"Gospel - Songs My Mother Taught Me\u201d, Sunday, February 16th at Pangea.\nDavid will be singing uplifting, feel good, gospel and pop songs that will take you back to your childhood Sundays spent in church - even if you never attended church on Sundays!\nCome enjoy some good food and fellowship - the drink\u2019s ain\u2019t bad either!\n1pm - doors open at noon.\n$20 online www.pangeanyc.com or $25 cash at the door.\n\nPhoto: Kathy Luu"}, {"Address": "67 Waterwitch Ave, Highlands, NJ 07732", "Artist": "Anyone's-Guess", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.993688, 40.404524], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 PM", "Venue": "Water Witch Coffee", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "235 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Harlem Gospel Choir", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9296682.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.987088, 40.759536], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Christian-gospel, Gospel, Christian/gospel", "Time": "1:30 PM", "Venue": "Sony Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Choir brings their experience of Harlem and the Black Church to Times Square in a foot stomping, hand clapping show for fans from around the world.

Since the band's beginning, Poison has achieved massive success- releasing eight studio albums, four live albums, and selling over 30 million records worldwide and 16.5 million records in the U.S. alone.\n\nThe band has charted 10 singles in the Top 40 on Billboard's Hot 100 including the number-one single, \"Every Rose Has It's Thorn.\" Twenty-five years after their debut, Poison is still recording music and performing together.\n\nBret Michaels' solo career has been equally successful: his most recent solo album, \"Custom Built,\" released in July of 2010, topped the charts, reaching #1 on Billboard's Hard Rock list. His current solo tour, \"Get Your Rock On\" is selling out arenas across the country and his forthcoming solo album of the same name will be released this summer.\n\nMichaels has achieved stunning success in the realm of reality TV as well. His \"Rock of Love\" television series is one of the most successful in VH1's history. VH1 and Bret Michaels teamed up again for his family-oriented 2010 docu-series \"Bret Michaels: Life As I Know It.\" He went head to head with some of the brightest minds in business on Donald Trump's NBC hit, \"Celebrity Apprentice\" and went on to \"Trump\" the competition with his Trop-A-Rocka Snapple drink.\n\nMichaels' Trop-a-Rocka Diet Snapple proved to be a fan-favorite- so much so that fans rallied to continue its distribution. He is thrilled to be continuing his partnership with Snapple, remarking, \"When I created my Diet Snapple Trop-A-Rocka Tea, I made it my mission to design the best-tasting diet drink on earth \u2013 made from the best stuff on earth. Creating Diet Snapple Trop-A-Rocka Tea and donating $250,000 to Diabetes research was just the beginning. I'm thrilled that Snapple will be making Trop-A-Rocka a part of its permanent offering.\"\n\nPhilanthropy remains an important facet of Michaels' career. A lifelong diabetic, he partnered with the American Diabetes Association in 2010, acting as a spokesperson and sponsor. Beyond his role as spokesperson Michaels has gone on to help Ford raise an additional $400,000 for diabetes research at the Barrett-Jackson auto auction this past February as well as donating numerous items for auction for Diabetes related events.\n\nMichaels' charitable outreach extends far beyond diabetes, however. Rocking out and giving back go hand in hand for Michaels, who supports a diverse array of charities and causes. In March 2011, he performed at Muhammad Ali's Celebrity Fight Night in support of the Muhammad Ali Foundation, which gives to those suffering from Parkinson's disease. Michaels was so touched by the event and the cause that he donated $20,000 of his own money to the Muhammad Ali Foundation to help heal those afflicted by Parkinson's. Michaels took on the role of fundraiser as well, raising more than $200,000 for the Barrow Brain Tumor Foundation, with a star-studded dinner in his own home. He is also a supporter of the Camelot Therapeutic ranch and sponsors a horse with his family. The ranch provides services at no charge to adults and children with disabilities.\n\nMichaels continues to stretch himself and challenge himself to take on new projects in music, business, and beyond. He recently partnered with legendary guitar company, Dean Guitars, to design his first ever signature Bret Michaels series. Michaels calls Dean Guitars \"the only guitars that can keep up with me, holding up tour after tour.\" He is also actively involved in the world of extreme sports. He created and awarded the first annual Bret Michaels Rock Hard, Ride Hard Award for supercross - a cash prize for the toughest and most tenacious supercross rider of the season - on May 7, 2011. The award will be given out again in 2012.\n\nMichaels has teamed with PetSmart for the \"Pet's Rock\" collection, which will debut in 2012. \"As a dedicated pet owners myself, this is a natural partnership for me, and I can\u2019t wait to unveil the collection,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cI know my own pets rock, and I wanted to design a line of pet products every bit as fun and cool as they are.\"\n\nAlso in 2012, Michaels is teaming up with Reader's Digest for their We Hear You America campaign - the popular national, grassroots initiative that serves as a catalyst to empower Americans to help their local communities by casting votes at ReadersDigest.com on behalf of their hometowns. Bret Michaels is the perfect partner for this campaign because he brings his experiences as a survivor, a rocker, a father, a philanthropist, and an American who has traveled this great land by tour bus from coast-to-coast. \"As a musician and an artist, I wanted to get involved in the We Hear You America campaign because it's not only about inspiring people to improve their lives and their communities, but about giving everyone a voice,\" says Michaels. \"It starts with all of you. Go to ReadersDigest.com every day to vote for your hometown. Your votes, joined with others in your community, could get your hometown funds and promotional support from the We Hear You America campaign.\"\n\nBret Michaels may have been in spotlight for decades, but he is certainly showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe official web site: http://www.bretmichaels.com\n\n###\n\nMAKE A DIFFERENCE", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "95 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "The Mega Yeah", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6639052.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988383, 40.721329], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Arlene's Grocery", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Joe Talcum, Michael Guggino, Toby Goodshank, Cristy Road, Mega Yeah, KAKI at Arlene's Grocery!"}, {"Address": "217 E Houston St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Ransom Pier", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8898463.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.986751, 40.722165], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Indie Rock", "Time": "5:30 PM", "Venue": "Mercury Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "The music of Long Island\u2019s Ransom Pier is built around the singularly evocative voice of lead vocalist Hayley Harrington and a rich catalog of songs drawing from the great American tradition of Bob Dylan, John Prine, and the Grateful Dead.

Her arrangements are thoughtful and complex, and her sumptuous powerhouse of a voice will leave you awed at the 5\u20192 framed young Indian woman.\n\nThe Dreamer, produced by Neha and mastered by award-winning engineer Mark Donahue, is the singer-songwriter\u2019s debut album, arriving as a delicate and fresh surprise, chock-full of lasting impressions. Neha (pronounced NEY-ha) penned eleven of the twelve tunes on her album, demonstrating her prowess as an artful songwriter.\n\nA gifted singer, composer & pianist, Neha\u2019s style can be characterized as a smorgasbord of musical personalities. She cites influences such as Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Otis Redding, Donny Hathaway, Sam Cooke, Dinah Washington, and Carmen MacRae, to name a few. While definitely rooted in jazz, elements of folk, blues, pop and her mother's classical indian musical background also permeate.\n\nA graduate of Northwestern University with a degree in Economics, Neha spent four years post-college working for the tech giant, Google, Inc in the Bay Area. She penned some of her first tracks from her cubicle, and spent much of her free time hitting the jam sessions and songwriting open mics in San Francisco before quitting to pursue her Masters degree at the prestigious New England Conservatory of Music.\n\nSince graduating from NEC in May of 2012, Neha been actively engaged in the Boston performance scene, performing at prestigious venues like Scullers Jazz Club, Lizard Lounge, and Club Passim. In New York, her performance credits include headlining at the famous off-Broadway show \"Sleep No More,\" and being regulars at venues such as The Rockwood Music Hall, Jazz at the Kitano Room, and Caffe Vivaldi. Most recently, Neha came off a mini tour performing the world premiere of \"Project Gilgamesh\" in Cleveland, Ohio written by multi-talented contemporary violinist and composer Daniel Bernard Roumain.\n\nAn account of all things reverie, The Dreamer openly explores Neha\u2019s deepest personal thoughts and wants. Songs like \u201cThe Dreamer,\u201d and \u201cWay Back Then\u201d explore her desire to go against cultural and social expectations of her, while songs \"The Darkness\" and \"Whole\" give us an intimate understanding of who Neha is as a person. Other songs like \"The Willow Tree,\" and \"The French Man\" play on her innocence and penchant for day dreaming, delivered through charming lyrics and wispy vocal lines.\n\n\nBacked-up by her exceptionally talented six bandmates whom she met at NEC (Connor Baker - drums, Evan Allen - piano, Dorsey Bass - bass, Bobby Spellman - Trumpet, Katie Seiler - vocals, Rachel Panitch - violin and vocals), The Dreamer is a tenderly crafted record, a definitive smorgasbord of Neha\u2019s life experiences. Rooted in her love affair with jazz, folk, blues, and her mother\u2019s long standing classical Indian musical training, the record results in a gorgeously personal and open account of Neha's life and deepest vulnerabilities, painted in piercing melodies and whimsically crafted arrangements.\n\n\"Music is as necessary to me as food or air\" says the first generation Indian-American singer-songwriter. \"Leaving the life I led in San Francisco [at Google] and starting all over was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but definitely the most gratifying as well. I spent so much of my life dancing around [creativity], wishing I could be part of that community of creating music and art, but never had the courage to follow through. Finally I just realized I owed it to myself to really go for it, head first. Everyone should have the chance to pursue what they've always envisioned for themselves.\"\n\nNeha currently resides in Brooklyn, NY where she teaches on the faculty at the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music in Park Slope and at the Jalopy Theater and Music School in Red Hook.

Simple, down home, charming, country-boys with immeasurable talent that was destined to take them straight to the top. The band was signed by A&R wizard Jason Flom to Capitol records and their first single, \u201cAddicted\u201d did just that, reaching number one on several charts and the follow-up singles \u201c18 Days\u201d and \u201cDrowning\u201d helped sell over 750,000 copies of their debut album. They toured heavily in support of this album, playing with Buckcherry and Avenged Sevenfold, and later on Nickelback, in arenas across North America. Night after night, the boys would go back to the bus with their ears ringing from 15,000 fans screaming their lyrics.\n\nKnowing that they would need something great to follow up with, the boys set out to write their sophomore album on Capitol, \u201cMiss America.\u201d Topping the Active Rock and Hard Rock charts yet again with \u201cSex is Good\u201d and \u201cStupid Girl\u201d solidified Saving Abel\u2019s place both on the radio and live. Setting out on their own tour this time, Saving Abel headlined theaters around the country for almost 2 years non-stop. They toured with several artists and made a lot of friends along the way, but always kept their focus on the fans, and their eyes toward the future.\n\nJason Flom left Capitol and the band did as well. The band signed to a new major label and the band didn\u2019t want to fall into a rut of making the third album sound like the first two, Saving Abel returned to their Mississippi origin, adding a depth and soul that could only come from their country roots. Using banjos, mandolins, and a healthy helping of moonshine, Saving Abel went into the studio with a mission to stick with \u201cwhat they know best,\u201d and wrote an emotional, soulful record that was still rooted in rock-n-roll, but highlighted their classic country roots. Listening to \u201cBringing Down The Giant\u201d was as reminiscent of Hank Williams as it was of Elvis Presley. In hindsight the album was probably a little self-indulgent and while songs like \u201cConstantly\u201d and \u201cPictures of Elvis\u201d highlighted their softer side and amazing song writing ability, the label and band had creative differences over what to release as a first single and the label won, the result being a mildly successful rollout and the label all but abandoned the band, leaving them in the unusual predicament of not knowing what to do next.\n\nThe next steps were difficult and profound but in the end proved liberating on numerous levels. First the band parted ways with their label and publishing company, those splits were followed by a split with their management, business management and booking agent. The band then hired former Creed, Sevendust, and Paramore manager and Silent Majority Group / ADA label president Jeff Hanson. Hanson brought in new lead singer Scotty Austin and new drummer Steven Pulley, a new booking agent, fan relations manager, business manager, merch company, and radio promotion team and finally enlisted a new producer, former 12 Stones guitarist and songwriter Justin Rimer. \u201cBringing in new faces wasn\u2019t done because we were unhappy with the previous team\u2019s performance, I just felt like we should surround ourselves with people who wouldn\u2019t be disappointed if we didn\u2019t have a gold or platinum record. Those are benchmarks that are much more difficult to achieve than they were 5 years ago and are honestly unrealistic expectations for anyone.\u201d Says Hanson. Hanson then helped the band form their own label in order to move forward on their own terms. The new label was named Tennessippi Whiskey Records based on the fact that the all of the members of the band are from Tennessee and Mississippi and are known for their moderate but very public Jack Daniels consumption Ditching the tour bus and getting back in a van in order to afford the recording of a new record on off days from their perpetual tour, along with a renewed focus on their live performances and spending time in person and on the internet with their fans, the band saw a resurgence in fan attendance at shows and the number of people following the band on their social media sites.\n\nWith the addition of new members Scotty Austin and Steven Pulley to the existing core of Saving Abel Jason Null, Scott Bartlett, and Eric Taylor, the result of this new lineup and independent attitude of the band has been amazing. \u201cThere is so much excitement being generated on a nightly basis by the fans based on their love of Scotty Austin, it makes it seem like it is 2008 again and we are about to blow up again, and I can\u2019t believe this level of excitement exists all over again\u201d says founding member and guitarist Jason Null. Null also goes on to say\u2026 \u201cScotty has an autistic child, and seeing the sacrifices he makes every day to make a life for his son makes it a lot easier for me to get back in a van and play smaller venues without complaining after I spent years in arenas on a bus, him being here really has changed the way all of us view what we do.\u201d Scotty Austin\u2026 \u201cI spent years playing cover gigs, singing 4 hours a night, this is literally a dream come true for me. Playing every night to fans that came to hear and sing along to songs that these guys and I wrote, I could never get tired of it. It also gives me a small platform to try to draw awareness to Autism, if nothing more comes of this than to make my son\u2019s life just a tiny bit better, it will have been worth it. I can\u2019t thank these guys enough for giving me this chance.\u201d Steven Pulley\u2026 \u201cScotty and I literally quit our day jobs the day we were called about being in this band. We were blown away that a nationally recognized band like Saving Abel, who could have gotten any players in America to replace their leaving members, would actually prefer to have a couple of guys like us mainly because we were guys from a small town (Jackson, TN) with big dreams. We basically left home, went on the road, and loved every minute since. Knowing what\u2019s coming on this record, we are definitely living a dream.\u201d\n\nThe new songs from their forthcoming album Blood Stained Revolution mirror the new energy and attitude of the band. The songs themselves are mostly uptempo and upbeat and pay homage to all of the bands we love, Guns and Roses, Tool, and The Allman Brothers. The album is absolutely a continuation of founding member Jason Null\u2019s mainstream southern rock hit writing abilities but with an amazing added energy similar to that of Mick Jagger or Scott Weiland being provided by Scotty Austin. The band is also eager to note that the new album is the first album on which all of the band members were able to participate in the creative process. On the first three albums the creative process was partially controlled by outside factors but on this album it seemed as though the floodgates were open because there were no limitations or interferences and everyone in the band was asked to contribute the ideas that had been percolating among the members for years that they hadn\u2019t always been able to share. Jeff Hanson says\u2026 \u201c I am a huge southern rock fan and Scott Bartlett\u2019s solo album and the Trash the Brand album, Scotty Austin and Steven Pulley\u2019s previous band together, are two of my favorite albums, so having them contribute to the song writing on this album has made a huge difference and in my mind sets it apart from previous Saving Abel records. The fact that there were no time constraints this time and the record was basically written on the road seems to have allowed the band to write when they wanted to as opposed to writing when they had to. It\u2019s fun not forced.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming release will be released on November 11, the date was aptly chosen because by the band because it is Veteran\u2019s Day. Individually and collectively Saving Abel and its members have always been incredible supporters of the amazing men and women in the US Armed Forces. \u201c18 Days,\u201d \u201cDrowning\", and \u201cMiss America\u201d were all written and dedicated to the US Military. Since 2009, Saving Abel has had the honor of being invited and traveling to play for the troops in some of the most remote and dangerous places in the world. \u2026Iraq, Qatar, Cuba, Japan, and India just to name a few. No matter where they are or what they are doing, no matter if it\u2019s 5 minutes to show time, the boys in Saving Abel will ALWAYS stop what they are doing to acknowledge and thank a Soldier, Sailor, Airman or Marine. Scott Bartlett states \u201c It\u2019s amazing that we now feel unencumbered by the confines of the traditional music business to the point that we can release our album on a date of our choosing, We were actually told that we were crazy to be releasing a new record in the 4th quarter, but it is actually a statement for us, to release this album on our own terms, when we want and how we want. At the end of the day all that matters is our music and our fans and what time of year it is isn\u2019t really a part of that equation. We\u2019re celebrating Veteran\u2019s Day with a new record and that\u2019s awesome!\u201d\n\nSaving Abel has no plans to slow down and has dates booked into 2015 and further. The band is still in the van and is starting a \u201cPledge Music\u201d campaign to try to auction off some unique and special VIP experiences in order to be able to get back in a bus again. With the pre sale of the new album, the band will be offering additional add on packages that include fishing and BBQs with the band, guitar lessons, and to allowing fans to perform on their next record.\u201d It\u2019s all about finding that balance between enjoying your fans, family and friends and having a business that allows you to play music for a living, if we can go fishing and have meals with our fans and it helps us be able to stay on the road, we\u2019re all for that, hopefully we can do this forever\u201d says bassist Eric Taylor.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Bassam Shawl", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.988348, 40.735421], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Upstairs at The Stand", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Brown Mirror Comedy!"}, {"Address": "146 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Yaasss", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.963479, 40.7101], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Baby's All Right", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "~++~"}, {"Address": "115 S Wellwood Ave., Lindenhurst, NY 11757", "Artist": "love is in the air", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.37247, 40.68581], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "South Shore Theatre Experience", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "13 Main St, Tarrytown, NY 10591", "Artist": "Simo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8860131.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.858812, 41.076675], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Jam Bands, Jam Rock, Blues, Blues-Rock, Roots Rock, Psychedelic Rock, Jazz, Funk, Acid Rock, Traditional Blues, Soul, Soul-Blues, R&B, Guitar Virtuoso, Shoegaze", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Tarrytown Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "On his new and first solo record, the soon to be released, OFF AT 11, Crows Feet recording artist and Chicago native now Nashvillian, JD SIMO wants you to know that, \u201cA Totem is a spirit being, sacred object or symbol that serves as the center of one\u2019s beliefs.\u201d The gifted artist offers this in a psychedelic, free-flowing, dynamic soundscape that exemplifies just that\u2026 His Totem.\nAcid rock, traditional blues, folk, soul, free form jazz, and the never ceasing desire to improvise pulses from this collection in a mind bending, kaleidoscope of sound, energy and vibe. NPR said, \u201cNashville blues trio SIMO sounds as if it comes to us straight from 1968.\u201d And Rolling Stone lauded, \u201cJ. D. Simo spins soulful psychedelic blues rock with an improvisational bent reminiscent of the Grateful Dead and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Though he\u2019s been performing in bands since his teenage years, [he] has begun to get national attention\u2026.\u201d\n\nWith influences as diverse as the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Captain Beefheart, Miles Davis and the Allman Brothers to blues guitarists such as Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins and BB King, this young artist, is taking the listener on a musical journey using LOVE as the guideposts. He explains, \u201cThere\u2019s an underlying theme of LOVE that permeates the album. Both outward love but also inner and self love. These days, everything is so heavy, but I just want to point out some joy, love and deep passion; in this world, we all share that spirit. TOTEM does that.\u201d\n\nThe recording of this rocking, blues driven, electric tour de force, was recorded over a three day period in the summer of 2018, \u201cOur next summer of LOVE\u201d, says JD Simo. Recording during a brief break in touring including JD\u2019s first shows as a newly cultivated member of Phil Lesh and Friends, JD and his band recorded these musically dense and inspiring tracks in a \u201cgroovy space\u201d to lay down something authentic, filled with fun and NO edits, NO tricks. \u201cJust honesty and a tape machine\u201d he continues.\n\nProduced by JD in association with his co-manager Michael Caplan, and due to be released this year, TOTEM consists of 8 tracks that are laid out on the record like a musical journey through gifted guitar playing and singing, incredible rhythm section arrangements and lyrics that convey that \u201call the feels\u201d momentum.\n\nSongs titles: Off at 11, Temptation, Sweet Little Angel and others could have been released in the height of the 60\u2019s but have a modern musical approach that are clues to the immense talent of JD Simo and his band.\n\nWith his band, SIMO, JD and cohorts have gained a solid fan following from touring and opening for bands such as Blackberry Smoke, The Gregg Allman band, Warren Haynes, Tommy Emmanuel and others. They have played Bonarroo, Warren Hayne\u2019s Christmas Jam and Mountain Jam since the formation of the band in 2010.\n\n\u201cThe experience with SIMO set the stage and pushed me forward to record TOTEM\u201d I loved the process, the playing and the struggle to make this record a reality. I hope everyone feels the LOVE.\u201d JD said.\nSIMO debuted at number 4 on the Billboard Blues chart in January 2016.He has been noticed by No Depression, Rolling Stone, Guitar Player, Relix, Guitar World and NPR among others. The band was featured on NPR's World Cafe which was broadcast nationally after the initial broadcast in late January on Philadelphia's WXPN.

Their performances combine ingenious musicianship and complex funk and jazz arrangements with soulful melodies that are simple enough for anyone to enjoy. In Big Easy tradition, dueling baselines from Tony Hall and Nick Daniels III set off one of the dirtiest rhythm sections on the planet, while Ivan Neville lights up the Hammond B3 keys and cousin Ian Neville\u2019s funky guitar riffs send the groove into overdrive. The band recently welcomed their newest member, Alvin Ford Jr. to the quintet, a New Orleans born and raised powerhouse drummer.

A clear contender for \u201cBreakthrough Band\u201d at Metal Hammer\u2019s 2013 Golden Gods Awards and frequent tourmates of Meshuggah, Dream Theater, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Animals As Leaders and other ultra-shred-happy friends and contemporaries from across the spectrum of loud rock, Periphery have earned their reputation onstage and off through a combination of undeniable chops and upbeat charisma.

Born in an era where cookie-cutter musical constructs and fame-driven scene pretenders dominated the album and touring landscape, Periphery immediately rose to the fore with their dedication to unique artistry, musicianship and melody. The band steadfastly refuses to submit to the humorlessness that often plagues metal, particularly metal bands whose players possess such massive skill. They\u2019ve put serious focus on their music, enabling them to share a laugh in presentation. \u201cIcarus Lives!,\u201d \u201cMake Total Destroy,\u201d \u201cScarlet\u201d and like-minded Periphery jams have racked up millions of YouTube views and digital downloads, inspired massive amounts of air-guitar and air-drumming in clubs and theatres around the world and driven attention to the band\u2019s instant genre-classic pair of full-length albums. Periphery and Periphery II: This Time It\u2019s Personal galvanized a new generation of heavy music fans, many of whom have been as likely to scramble for guitar tabs to decode the inscrutable polyrhythms as they are to bruise themselves in the moshpit. Initially the brainchild of producer, solo artist and Guitar World cover star Misha Mansoor, the Washington D.C. based musical collective has since grown into a wild beast that belonging to their fiercely dedicated group of fans as much as to the band. Mansoor is joined by fellow axe wizards Jake Bowen and Mark Holcomb; viciously proficient bass slinger and production minded maestro Adam \u201cNolly\u201d Getgood; monstrous SickDrummer.com staple Matt Halpern; and Spencer Sotelo, who singularly manages to make heads or tails of Periphery\u2019s mindboggling music, inviting newcomers into the band\u2019s world via counter-intuitively catchy vocals. The broader populace is joining the party, too. Periphery debuted at #2 on Billboard\u2019s \u201cHeatseekers\u201d chart, with the follow-up album breaking into Billboard\u2019s Top 50 just two years later. Periphery II: This Time It\u2019s Personal introduced Holcomb and Getgood to the world at large and boasted guest appearances from Dream Theater co-founder John Petrucci, English guitar virtuoso and YouTube star Guthrie Govan (The Aristocrats, ex-Asia) and labelmate Wes Hauch (The Faceless). Like \u201cThe Big 4\u201d of Thrash, the Floridian death metal merchants, early Metalcore pioneers, mathcore inventors and deathcore standard bearers, Periphery\u2019s influence is so pervasive that they are often identified as the singularly most important band in the \u201cdjent\u201d subgenre. The group has taken this distinction in humorous stride (see \u201cDjent Reznor\u201d; \u201cLeague of Extraordinary Djentlemen\u201d; etc.), but to saddle them with one particular genre description would be a great disservice to all Periphery has to offer. Boundary pushing experimentalism, nuanced mathematical cacophony and complex grooves that are alternately engaging and innovative are just the tip of the iceberg for the six-piece monstrosity, who are truly only now getting started. We are Periphery.

Born on a military base in Nogales, Arizona in 1922 and raised in Watts, California, his earliest musical influences came from the church\u2013 choir and group singing\u2013 and from \u201chearing Duke Ellington over the radio when [he] was eight years old.\u201d He studied double bass and composition in a formal way (five years with H. Rheinshagen, principal bassist of the New York Philharmonic, and compositional techniques with the legendary Lloyd Reese) while absorbing vernacular music from the great jazz masters, first-hand. His early professional experience, in the 40\u2019s, found him touring with bands like Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory and Lionel Hampton.\n\nEventually he settled in New York where he played and recorded with the leading musicians of the 1950\u2019s\u2013 Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Art Tatum and Duke Ellington himself. One of the few bassists to do so, Mingus quickly developed as a leader of musicians. He was also an accomplished pianist who could have made a career playing that instrument. By the mid-50\u2019s he had formed his own publishing and recording companies to protect and document his growing repertoire of original music. He also founded the \u201cJazz Workshop,\u201d a group which enabled young composers to have their new works performed in concert and on recordings.\n\nMingus soon found himself at the forefront of the avant-garde. His recordings bear witness to the extraordinarily creative body of work that followed. They include: Pithecanthropus Erectus, The Clown, Tijuana Moods, Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Ah Um, The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, Cumbia and Jazz Fusion, Let My Children Hear Music. He recorded over a hundred albums and wrote over three hundred scores.\nAlthough he wrote his first concert piece, \u201cHalf-Mast Inhibition,\u201d when he was seventeen years old, it was not recorded until twenty years later by a 22-piece orchestra with Gunther Schuller conducting. It was the presentation of \u201cRevelations\u201d which combined jazz and classical idioms, at the 1955 Brandeis Festival of the Creative Arts, that established him as one of the foremost jazz composers of his day.\n\nIn 1971 Mingus was awarded the Slee Chair of Music and spent a semester teaching composition at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In the same year his autobiography, Beneath the Underdog, was published by Knopf. In 1972 it appeared in a Bantam paperback and was reissued after his death, in 1980, by Viking/Penguin and again by Pantheon Books, in 1991. In 1972 he also re-signed with Columbia Records. His music was performed frequently by ballet companies, and Alvin Ailey choreographed an hour program called \u201cThe Mingus Dances\u201d during a 1972 collaboration with the Robert Joffrey Ballet Company.\n\nHe toured extensively throughout Europe, Japan, Canada, South America and the United States until the end of 1977 when he was diagnosed as having a rare nerve disease, Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis. He was confined to a wheelchair, and although he was no longer able to write music on paper or compose at the piano, his last works were sung into a tape recorder.\n\nFrom the 1960\u2019s until his death in 1979 at age 56, Mingus remained in the forefront of American music. When asked to comment on his accomplishments, Mingus said that his abilities as a bassist were the result of hard work but that his talent for composition came from God.\n\nMingus received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Smithsonian Institute, and the Guggenheim Foundation (two grants). He also received an honorary degree from Brandeis and an award from Yale University. At a memorial following Mingus\u2019 death, Steve Schlesinger of the Guggenheim Foundation commented that Mingus was one of the few artists who received two grants and added: \u201cI look forward to the day when we can transcend labels like jazz and acknowledge Charles Mingus as the major American composer that he is.\u201d The New Yorker wrote: \u201cFor sheer melodic and rhythmic and structural originality, his compositions may equal anything written in western music in the twentieth century.\u201d\n\nHe died in Mexico on January 5, 1979, and his wife, Sue Graham Mingus, scattered his ashes in the Ganges River in India. Both New York City and Washington, D.C. honored him posthumously with a \u201cCharles Mingus Day.\u201d\n\nAfter his death, the National Endowment for the Arts provided grants for a Mingus foundation created by Sue Mingus called \u201cLet My Children Hear Music\u201d which catalogued all of Mingus\u2019 works. The microfilms of these works were then given to the Music Division of the New York Public Library where they are currently available for study and scholarship \u2013 a first for jazz. Sue Mingus has founded three working repertory bands called the Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Orchestra, and the Mingus Big Band, which continue to perform his music. Biographies of Charles Mingus include Mingus by Brian Priestley, Mingus/Mingus by Janet Coleman and Al Young, Myself When I Am Real by Gene Santoro, and Tonight at Noon, a memoir by Sue Mingus.\n\nMingus\u2019 masterwork, \u201cEpitaph,\u201d a composition which is more than 4000 measures long and which requires two hours to perform, was discovered during the cataloguing process. With the help of a grant from the Ford Foundation, the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by Gunther Schuller, in a concert produced by Sue Mingus at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989, ten years after Mingus\u2019 death.\n\nThe New Yorker wrote that \u201cEpitaph\u201d represents the first advance in jazz composition since Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cBlack, Brown, and Beige,\u201d which was written in 1943. The New York Times said it ranked with the \u201cmost memorable jazz events of the decade.\u201d Convinced that it would never be performed in his lifetime, Mingus called his work \u201cEpitaph,\u201d declaring that he wrote it \u201cfor my tombstone.\u201d\n\nThe Library of Congress purchased the Charles Mingus Collection, a major acquisition, in 1993; this included autographed manuscripts, photographs, literary manuscripts, correspondence, and tape recordings of interviews, broadcasts, recording sessions, and Mingus composing at the piano.\n\nSue Mingus has published a number of educational books through Hal Leonard Publishing, including Charles Mingus: More Than a Fake Book, Charles Mingus: More Than a Play-Along, Charles Mingus: Easy Piano Solos, many big band charts\u2014 including the Simply Mingus set of big band music charts\u2013 and a Mingus guitar book.\n\nReprinted in part from More than a Fake Book \u00a9 1991 Jazz Workshop, Inc.\n\nLinks to Additional Biographical and Historical Information on the Web\n\nLibrary of Congress\nAn index to the holdings of the Charles Mingus Collection, Music Division of the Library of Congress.\nhttp://www.loc.gov/performingarts/encyclopedia/collections/mingus.html", "otherInfo": "Jazz Standard proudly presents our tenth annual Mingus High School Competition 1979).

Her instantly recognizable voice\u2014capable of being sultry, assertive and roaring\u2014delivers every song with unparalleled honesty and passion. Her wide-open vision of contemporary Americana roots and soul music showcases the evolution of a passionate artist with an up-to-the-minute musical and lyrical approach. With her new Alligator Records album, AMERICA'S CHILD, Copeland confidently announces an electrifying new chapter in her constantly evolving story. Produced by Americana Instrumentalist Of The Year winner Will Kimbrough (who also plays guitar on the album) and recorded in Nashville, AMERICA'S CHILD is a courageous and fiery statement of purpose, a major step forward for the singer whose musical consciousness continues to expand as her star continues to rise.\n\nAMERICA'S CHILD is by far Copeland\u2019s most compelling work yet, with music swelling beyond blues and into spirited Americana, with elements of rock, soul, and country. From AMERICA'S CHILD\u2019s anthemic opening track, Ain\u2019t Got Time For Hate, to the closing lullaby, the traditional Go To Sleepy Little Baby, Shemekia sings with passion and insight about the chaos and uncertainty in the world while still finding joy all around her.\n\nWith guests including John Prine, Rhiannon Giddens, Mary Gauthier, Emmylou Harris, Steve Cropper, J.D. Wilkes, Al Perkins and members of the Time Jumpers, AMERICA'S CHILD bursts with Copeland\u2019s bravado and embraces with her tenderness. Gauthier and songwriter/executive producer John Hahn wrote two striking songs for the project. Smoked Ham And Peaches is a search for truth and tranquility in America, featuring Giddens on African banjo. Americans celebrates our collective diversity in all its forms and colors. American music legend Prine joins Shemekia for a stirring duet on his own Great Rain. Guitar great Cropper adds his scorching playing to the ballad Promised Myself, written by Shemekia\u2019s father, the late bluesman Johnny Clyde Copeland. And her version of I\u2019m Not Like Everybody Else transforms the Kinks song into a blues-fueled declaration of independence.\n\nUpon the birth of her son Johnny Lee Copeland-Schultz in 2016, Shemekia, with fresh eyes, began to take an even deeper look at the state of the world. Of the new album, she says, \u201cAfter having a child, I started thinking about the world I brought him into, how it actually is and how I wished it was and all the things he will have to go through. And to live in this world today, you have to have a strong foundation like I did to make it through. So that\u2019s what 'AMERICA'S CHILD' means to me. I\u2019m truly grateful to all the artists that joined me on this record\u2014it wasn\u2019t about the genre for anyone, it was about the music and mutual love and respect.\u201d\n\nWhen Shemekia broke on the scene at age 18 in 1998 with her groundbreaking Alligator Records debut CD Turn The Heat Up, she instantly became a blues and R&B force to be reckoned with. News outlets from The New York Times to CNN praised Copeland\u2019s talent, larger-than-life personality, and true star power. With each subsequent release, Copeland\u2019s music has continued to grow. From her debut through 2005\u2019s The Soul Truth, Shemekia earned eight Blues Music Awards, a host of Living Blues Awards (including the prestigious 2010 Blues Artist Of The Year) and more accolades from fans, critics and fellow musicians. 2000\u2019s Wicked received a Grammy nomination. Two highly successful releases on Telarc (including 2012\u2019s Grammy-nominated 33 1/3) cemented her reputation as a singer who, according to NPR\u2019s All Things Considered, \u201cembodies the blues with her powerful vocal chops and fearless look at social issues.\u201d\n\nCopeland returned to Alligator Records in 2015 with the Grammy-nominated Outskirts Of Love. She won the 2017 Living Blues Readers\u2019 Award for Blues Artist Of The Year (Female), the same distinction she won the year before. She also took home the 2016 Blues Music Award (BMA) for Contemporary Blues Female Artist Of The Year. Outskirts Of Love won the BMA for Best Blues Album Of The Year. MOJO said Copeland was \u201cspectacular, stirring, sanctified and sassy.\u201d\n\nShemekia Copeland has performed thousands of gigs at clubs, festivals and concert halls all over the world and has appeared on national television, NPR, and in newspapers, films and magazines. She\u2019s sung with Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt, Keith Richards, Carlos Santana, James Cotton and many others. She opened for The Rolling Stones and entertained U.S. troops in Iraq and Kuwait. Jeff Beck calls her \u201camazing.\u201d Santana says, \u201cShe\u2019s incandescent...a diamond.\u201d In 2012, she performed with B.B. King, Mick Jagger, Buddy Guy, Trombone Shorty, Gary Clark, Jr. and others at the White House for President and Mrs. Obama.\n\nNow, with AMERICA'S CHILD, Shemekia Copeland is standing on the cusp of her greatest success. Her intensely empowering, American music is as insightful as it is fun. NPR Music says, \u201cShe brings a perfect balance of authority and understatement to each song.\u201d No Depression adds, \u201cWhen Shemekia Copeland opens her mouth, everybody pays attention. She pierces your soul. This is how you do it, and nobody does it better than Shemekia Copeland.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Blackbird Presents and The Capitol Theatre Present\nThe Thrill is Gone: A Tribute to B.B. King\nft.

Throughout his prolific career as part of three of the greatest live groups in rock history \u2013 Allman Brothers Band, Gov\u2019t Mule and the Dead \u2013 his virtuosic artistry has led to thousands of unforgettable performances and millions of album and track sales. Despite all of the ground that Haynes has covered on his musical journey, the impressive thing is that he still has many miles to explore. On his newest solo album Ashes and Dust, he puts forth one of his most gorgeous, musically rich and personal albums to date. It is endlessly exciting to see one of the most brilliant minds in modern music shine an entirely new light on the depths of his creativity.\n\n\n\nAshes and Dust, only the third studio album Haynes has ever released under his own name, is a masterful work of art and a particularly important statement for Haynes. The songs are immediately and clearly different from his usual style \u2013 encompassing beautiful acoustic arrangements, a rootsy/Americana soundscape and honeyed vocals that cut straight through to the soul. Although many of these songs are brand new, some of the tunes that make up this album have been dear to Warren for years. In some cases he has been carrying them around for 20 or 30 years, waiting for the right time to record them.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing songs all my life from a more folky, singer-songwriter, even Celtic direction,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while, I\u2019ve been compiling songs that didn\u2019t necessarily fit in with Gov\u2019t Mule or the Allman Brothers or even my last solo album. So this record was really a chance to bring a lot of that music to fruition. It\u2019s really given me the opportunity to take a lot of songs I love, that didn\u2019t have a home, and build a home for them.\u201d\n\n\n\nGiven his life-long commitment to experimentation and eclecticism, though, it should come as no surprise that the album reveals yet another new side of his musical personality. Knowing that he wanted to pursue a more folk-based approach on this project, he brought in the New Jersey-based Americana band Railroad Earth as collaborators.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have a cool chemistry with those guys\u2014they add their own personality to the songs, but they\u2019re really great at interpreting, as well,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other casually for several years, and then at Del-Fest a few years ago, we winged a few songs together and it went really well. A little later, when I was opening the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY, they joined me for part of the set. We did that with a little more rehearsal, more preparation, and it was a great experience. At that point, I started thinking that maybe I should make my next record with these guys.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven with a clear sense of his goals for the album, Haynes and Railroad Earth still needed to explore various avenues and possibilities. They recorded more than 30 songs, often trying entirely different arrangements for each take or even recording late at night and not listening to playbacks until they reconvened the next day.\n\n\n\nFans of jam-band powerhouse Gov\u2019t Mule or the most recent soul-charged incarnation of the Warren Haynes Band\u2014or listeners who know Haynes through his 25-year affiliation with the Allman Brothers Band or his work with various extensions of the Grateful Dead family\u2014may be surprised to hear him working in a more song-based context. Several of the tracks on Ashes and Dust, like \u201cCompany Man\u201d and \u201cCoal Tattoo,\u201d are links to the folk tradition of narrative writing.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love story songs,\u201d Haynes says. \u201cI was very influenced by the whole concept of writing songs that tell a story. When I first got bitten by the singer-songwriter bug, when I was 14, it was due to those people who transported you to another place and another time with their songs\u201d\n\n\n\nWhich is not to say that Ashes and Dust leaves his instrumental adventures behind; several songs such as \u201cBlue Maiden\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cStranded in Self-Pity\u201d open out into more extended musical journeys. \u201cIn the studio, you\u2019re always looking for the balance between structure and focus and improvisation, opening up the music to chance\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut too much of either can keep the music from being as rewarding or as effective as it can be. Luckily my audience loves things to be stretched out. They love to hear the performance aspect. It was nice to take a few dirt roads, musically speaking, and go to some places none of us were expecting.\u201d\n\n\n\nHaynes shares that this album also brought out some new dimensions for him as a guitarist. \u201cMy playing here is quite different from what I\u2019ve done in recent projects. It\u2019s showcasing a side of my musicality that\u2019s unlike, in some cases, anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says, noting that he played a hollow-body D\u2019Angelico instrument (\u201ckind of a jazz guitar\u201d) for many of the sessions. \u201cI like to adapt to my surroundings\u2014to the music itself and to the musicians, trying to choose a musical voice that fits into the overall picture a certain way. I played a lot more slide guitar than I\u2019ve played in a long time and a lot of acoustic guitar, things that were more directed to weaving themselves into the fabric of this music.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the songs, \u201cSpots of Time\u201d (the lyrics of which include the phrase that gives the album its title), may be familiar to ardent Haynes-watchers. The song was written by Haynes and Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers have been playing it on stage in recent years. He had hoped that the song would be included if the Allmans made another studio album, but after the legendary band retired in 2014, he decided to record it himself\u2014but not before inviting Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and percussionist Marc Quinones to join him in the studio.\n\n\n\nOn \u201cGold Dust Woman,\u201d Grace Potter adds her unique vocal timbre. Sparking a fast friendship and instant chemistry several years ago, Haynes and Potter have performed this song together many times on stage and this endeavor seemed like the perfect opportunity to document it in the studio. That chemistry, along with Railroad Earth\u2019s unique instrumental interpretation, plays out here in fine form on the sole duet on the album.\n\n\n\nThe presence of these world-class musicians and artists, along with that of Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin and famed harmonica player Mickey Raphael (who each make an appearance here on \u201cWanderlust\u201d) is yet another reason why Ashes and Dust stands as such a personal, ambitious document of Warren Haynes\u2019 history. With songs that reach back to his initial fascination with music and others that go right up to the present day, it\u2019s a look behind his first-rate playing and into his enduring creative spirit.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese songs were each very important to me when they were written, especially since some of them go so far back,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all visual memories and experiences of certain time periods that I tried to capture in song. They really represent a collection of memories in my life.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "702 Union St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Jean Grae", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6391198.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.980048, 40.676115], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Union Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Never Seen It with Kyle Ayers"}, {"Address": "1027 Flatbush Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11226", "Artist": "Melii", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9491216.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.95724, 40.64599], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Kings Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Artists are subject to change."}, {"Address": "1221 Old Northern Blvd, Roslyn, NY 11576", "Artist": "Jesse Kinch", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8641569.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.652267, 40.801564], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Rockn Roll", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "My Father's Place at The Roslyn Hotel", "moreBioInfo": "Having made his name as the winner of Rising Star in the US, where the inimitable Ke$ha hailed him a 'f*cking rock God, 24 year old Jesse Kinch launched his retro rock driven debut album 'I'm Not Like Everybody Else' (Curb Records) last year, which showcased a stunning vocal and a sound that is both nostalgic and contemporary.

It's this idea of making do with the scraps, of resurrection and ascension, and of whatever the current situation is, it can get better through love.\u201d\n\nThough Porter had an acclaimed role in the original 1999 Broadway cast of It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues \u2014 and staged his own Nat King Cole & Me musical in 2004 \u2014 it was inevitable that he'd became known for his songs. That was made abundantly clear when both of Porter's indie albums \u2014 2010's Water and 2012's Be Good \u2014 received Grammy nominations, paving the way for his world-beating 2013 Blue Note debut, Liquid Spirit, which won the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album. He hasn't let down his legion of fans since, whether collaborating with Disclosure on \"Holding On,\" scoring another Grammy for Take Me to the Alley (2016), or telling his life story through Cole's songbook. Like others, Porter is still surprised by his runaway success, but he has a theory: \"I was soothed by my voice as a child and I think that's the same thing others get from it. I'm trying to heal myself with these songs.\"\n\nAnd that's the thing about love that All Rise keeps circling. Even when it's painful, confusing, out of reach, or under attack, love is ultimately curative. Once again, Porter cuts through the noise of genres and the mess of life to reach us all where we live: the heart.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E 16th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Sean Patton", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7226363.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988348, 40.735421], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Indie, Acoustic, Singer/songwriter, Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand", "moreBioInfo": "Follow me on Twitter at twitter.com/mrseanpatton COMIX comixny.com", "otherInfo": "Sean Patton, Corinne Fisher, Derek Gaines, & More!"}, {"Address": "702 Union St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Kyle Ayers", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7786034.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.980048, 40.676115], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Union Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Kyle Ayers is a comedian, writer, actor, and all of that sort, living in New York City, by way of his hometown near Kansas City, Missouri.

I got the word back that the label thought maybe it was a good idea to put two CDs out\u2014one of them the slow stuff, more for listening, and the other, like B.B. King said, if you want to boogie-woogie all night long.\u201d The result has a title both simple and clever: Rhythm & Blues, the first double-album set of his storied career. But more than five decades into a life as one of the world\u2019s leading bluesmen, Buddy Guy is used to new surprises, challenges, and accolades. At age 76, he\u2019s a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, a major influence on rock titans like Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, a pioneer of Chicago\u2019s fabled West Side sound, and a living link to that city\u2019s halcyon days of electric blues. He has received 6 Grammy Awards, 28 Blues Music Awards (the most any artist has received), the Billboard magazine Century Award for distinguished artistic achievement, and the Presidential National Medal of Arts. Rolling Stone ranked him in the top 25 of its \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.\" The last year, in fact, has proven to be one of Guy\u2019s most remarkable ever. He was awarded the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime contribution to American culture; earlier in the year, at a performance at the White House, he even persuaded President Obama to join him on a chorus of \u201cSweet Home Chicago.\u201d Also in 2012, he published his long-awaited memoir, When I Left Home, and released Live at Legends, which has been nominated for Best New Recording in the Living Blues Awards. Meanwhile, Guy keeps looking to the future of the blues through his ongoing work with his 14-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Quinn Sullivan. Now the story continues with Rhythm & Blues, 21 tracks which feature contributions from a stellar and wide-ranging set of guests, including Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Brad Whitford of Aerosmith and rising guitar wizard Gary Clark, Jr. \u201cIf you watch a ballgame, it seems like those guys are angry at one another, but when they finish playing, they go out and have drinks together,\u201d says Guy. \u201cMusicians were doing that before anybody\u2014we don't have rivals as far as who can outplay who, but we have so much fun letting other people think that's what it is. So it\u2019s really a blessing to have all of these guys on here.\u201d He had a specific inspiration for a duet with his friend Kid Rock, realizing that \u201cMessin\u2019 with the Kid\u201d\u2014a 1960 hit for Guy\u2019s long-time partner Junior Wells\u2014was a perfect fit lyrically and musically. \u201cI was surprised he hadn't gotten there himself,\u201d says Guy. \u201cI saw him at the White House and I thought, \u2018I ain't gonna tell him, 'cause he might go and do it himself, I'm going to wait until I can do it!\u201d I threw it at him and he jumped the fence\u2014he did a hell of a job with it.\u201d Probably the most unexpected guest on Rhythm & Blues (which was produced by Guy\u2019s frequent collaborator Tom Hambridge, and recorded at Nashville\u2019s Blackbird Studios) is country superstar Keith Urban, who joins Guy on an emotional ballad called \u201cOne Day Away.\u201d Guy maintains that he was well aware of Urban\u2019s instrumental prowess before they teamed up. \u201cI listen to everything, regardless of what type of music it\u2019s branded,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I hear a guitar that makes me pat my feet, and try to not go to sleep 'cause I\u2019m afraid I might miss something, it's all right with me. Any guy who can think about playing music is a friend of mine, and the door is always open.\u201d One song in particular jumped out at Guy, a funky travelogue called \u201cMeet Me In Chicago\u201d written by slide guitar maestro Robert Randolph. \u201cI really fell in love with that one,\u201d he says. \u201cI been in Chicago 56 years\u2014that sounds just like me. It's not really blues, but it's a good beat, so I wanted to see if I could do something with it.\u201d Though Buddy Guy will forever be associated with Chicago, his story actually begins in Louisiana. One of five children, he was born in 1936 to a sharecropper\u2019s family and raised on a plantation near the small town of Lettsworth, located some 140 miles northwest of New Orleans. Buddy was just seven years old when he fashioned his first makeshift \u201cguitar\u201d\u2014a two-string contraption attached to a piece of wood and secured with his mother\u2019s hairpins. On the new album, he recounts these days on such deeply personal songs as \u201cI Came Up Hard\u201d and \u201cMy Mama Loved Me.\u201d In 1957, he took his guitar to Chicago, where he would permanently alter the direction of the instrument, first on numerous sessions for Chess Records playing alongside Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Muddy Waters, and the rest of the label\u2019s legendary roster, and then on recordings of his own. His incendiary style\u2014still in evidence all over Rhythm & Blues\u2014left its mark on guitarists from Jimmy Page to John Mayer. \u201cHe was for me what Elvis was probably like for other people,\u201d said Eric Clapton at Guy\u2019s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2005. \u201cMy course was set, and he was my pilot.\u201d These many years later, Buddy Guy is a genuine American treasure, and one of the final surviving connections to an historic era in the country\u2019s musical evolution. And still, as one glorious track on Rhythm & Blues puts it, he claims that \u201cAll That Makes Me Happy is the Blues.\u201d \u201cI worry a lot about the legacy of Muddy, Wolf, and all the guys who created this stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cI want people to remember them. It's like the Ford car\u2014Henry Ford invented the Ford car, and regardless how much technology they got on them now, you still have that little sign that says \u2018Ford\u2019 on the front. \u201cOne of the last things Muddy Waters told me\u2014when I found out how ill he was, I gave him a call and said, \u2018I'm on my way to your house.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Don't come out here, I'm doing all right. Just keep the damn blues alive.\u2019 They all told me that if they left here before I did, then everything was going to be on my shoulders. So as long as I'm here, I'm going to do whatever I can to keep it alive.\u201d Welcome to the official Facebook page of Chicago's very own Blues legend!

Labels like Schematic in Miami, Interdimensional Transmissions from Detroit & Viewlexx out of The Hague set the foundation for Daze. Daniel Gomez adopted his Daze moniker early on at his mother\u2019s suggestion. Practicing on a set-up she bought him, Daze was spinning at weddings by age 14, funneling his earnings into vinyl to play raves on the side. That eventually led to producing his first tracks in 2004 on a cracked version of Fruity Loops and later that year, he jumpstarted a electro / techno white label called Omniamm. Daze\u2019s risk-taking & punk approach is at the core of everything he does and it\u2019s a big part of the ethos of his current label, Omnidisc. \"We're not searching for chart topping hits. We\u2019re more interested in curating a catalog of music you\u2019ll remember when you walk out the door. We seek out tracks that are as raw as possible & welcome imperfections. We love the charm of an unpolished record\u201d, says Daze. It\u2019s also this freeform & experimental approach together with an element of surprise that sets him apart from the pack as both a DJ & Producer. As a DJ, he prefers to express his versatility across long sets. He is known to cut & weave from Electro to Techno into Italo Disco, into a record by Yazoo deliberately intended to provoke a reaction. \u201cI once played a Paula Abdul record at Berghain\u2026 basically, it\u2019s like it or leave it,\u201d says Daze. As a producer, his output ranges from releases on Kompakt\u2019s Speicher series, to remixes on Phantasy, Comeme, Monkeytown & more\u2026 but he also reaches far beyond techno & has created original runway soundtracks for award winning American streetwear designer John Elliott & the Australian brand Song for the Mute. \"I\u2019m obsessed with the detailed manipulation of audio. It\u2019s at the core of how I make music & I constantly feel the need to involve myself with projects that challenge & allow me to think out of the box... whether it\u2019s creating a single recognizable noise for the new MacBook, or an advert for a fashion campaign blending original music with sound design,\u201d says Daze. Danny Daze\u2019s radical approach to preserving music\u2019s integrity while breaking its boundaries may seem volatile, but it\u2019s not random. \u201cI\u2019ve always gone against the grain & it\u2019s important for everything I do to feel authentic. There isn't much difference between Daniel Gomez and Danny Daze.\u201d www.soundcloud.com/dannydaze", "otherInfo": "Life and Death: Acid Pauli, Danny Faze, DJ Tennis, DJ Three, Krystal Klear, MoMA Ready, \u00d6ona Dahl, Palms Trax, Perel, Vivian Koch"}, {"Address": "140 Stewart Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Oona Dahl", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9811899.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.926398, 40.710569], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Avant Gardner", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Life and Death: Acid Pauli, Danny Faze, DJ Tennis, DJ Three, Krystal Klear, MoMA Ready, \u00d6ona Dahl, Palms Trax, Perel, Vivian Koch"}, {"Address": "116 E 16th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Sherrod Small", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.988348, 40.735421], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Cool Kids Sundays with Sherrod Small & Cipha Sounds!"}, {"Address": "1626 Broadway, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "Adam Newman", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6035751.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.984131, 40.760952], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Comedians, Comedy, Comedy Central, Stand Up, Stand-up Comedy", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Carolines On Broadway", "moreBioInfo": "Adam Newman is a New Hampshire-born, Georgia-schooled, ex-Brooklyn-based, now LA-based comedian who has performed stand-up on the Late Show with David Letterman, John Oliver's New York Stand-Up Show, Gotham Comedy Live, Comedy Central's The Half Hour, and most recently a one hour special called Fuzzies currently streaming on Amazon.

Just as comfortable on stage as he is behind the turntables, Cipha has carved out a distinct voice in music and comedy over the past 15 years.\n\nCipha got his first break interning for Wildman Steve and DJ Riz of the Flip Squad. His tireless work ethic and perceptive DJ skills earned him opening slots at legendary NYC nightspots like the Tunnel and the Palladium. Soon after that, Cipha found himself spinning for Lil Kim, Mos Def and Jay-Z on national tours, and rocking private parties & album release galas for superstars like P. Diddy, Eminem and Mariah Carey. Most importantly, Cipha learned how to break new records, helping turn once-unknowns like Sean Paul, 50 Cent, Pitbull, Rick Ross, Rihanna into superstars, and maintain a healthy sense of humor on the mic.\n\nCipha\u2019s ear for talent and club-honed musical instincts also made him a natural A&R executive, a position he has held with labels ranging from Rawkus and Tommy Boy to the Neptunes\u2019 Star Trak imprint with Pharrell Williams, and Roc-A-Fella with Jay-Z. In 2003, he took an even bigger leap into the music industry and began hosting \u201cSucker Free\u201d and \u201cTRL\u201d on MTV. He has also set a goal to take over the Improv comedy world. After being a student at the UCB theatre for over two years, Cipha now has a weekly sold out \u201cTake It Personal: Hip Hop Improv Show, where a different Hip Hop celebrity tells a true life story and Cipha & his team of improvisers perform a complete live comedy show based on those stories.
