Dreamy guitars cast an enchanting spell over the audiences, the resulting sound could quite easily be heard in a David Lynch movie. They left behind them the grey and cold winter; spring came and, with it, two voices and two instruments: A keyboard, with an incisive sonority, marked by occasional rebellion; and a guitar that varies between restlessness and crystalline softness, resulting in melodies that surround us in an intimate nostalgia.\nOn Our Own (2018), their latest EP recorded by Rui Antunes, is out now and available on all usual platforms.

Her father, the late Luis Russell, was a native of Panama who moved to New Orleans and then New York City, becoming a pioneering pianist/composer/bandleader, and Louis Armstrong's long-time musical director. Her mother, Carline Ray, an outstanding bassist and vocalist, has performed with Mary Lou Williams and International Sweethearts of Rhythm. Considering her roots and family pedigree, it\u2019s no surprise that Catherine Russell is a one-of-a-kind singer and musician. Cat is in demand as a backing singer and multi-instrumentalist, having performed and recorded with artists including Steely Dan, Levon Helm, David Bowie, Cyndi Lauper, Paul Simon, Jackson Browne, Michael Feinstein, Carrie Smith, and Rosanne Cash.\n\nOf her debut album \"Cat\", (World Village/Harmonia Mundi), she made critic and Sinatra biographer, Will Friedwald's top 10 list who stated \"She is a fresh and original voice. The most exciting debut album I've heard in a long time.\" \"It's a delight to hear the real thing in Catherine Russell\", wrote the dean of jazz writers, Nat Hentoff, in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nCatherine Russell's second album on World Village, \"Sentimental Streak\", was released in 2008 to universal acclaim, hitting the Billboard and I-Tunes Jazz Charts, and JazzWeek and Living Blues Radio Charts. Cat was a guest on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" and NPR's \"Fresh Air\". She won the prestigious German Record Critics' Award in the Jazz category and Living Blues magazine's 2008 critics' poll as \"Artist Deserving More Attention.\" L'Acadamie du Jazz in France chose \"Sentimental Streak\" as finaliste for Prix du Jazz Vocal 2008, while Grammy Award winning writer and jazz critic Francis Davis picked \"Sentimental Streak\" as Vocal Album of the Year in the 2008 Village Voice Jazz Critics Poll.\n\nSince the release of her albums, Catherine Russell has performed on three continents. She's been the surprise hit at major events including the Chicago Blues Festival, Montreal Jazz Festival, Bern Jazz Festival, Rochester International Jazz Festival, Tanglewood Jazz Festival, Lotus World Music Festival, I Love Jazz Festival in Brazil, Panama Jazz Festival, and at premier venues like The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Scullers Jazz Club in Boston, The Dakota in Minneapolis, and Yoshi's in San Francisco. All Music Guide says, \"Russell emerged as a retro old school vocalist for the ages.\"\n\nCatherine Russell's \"Inside This Heart of Mine\" is a personal selection of gems from the 1920s through the Present; vital interpretations, bursting with soul and humor. Deepening the approach of her previous recordings -- an off-the-beaten-path song selection, sparkling small group acoustic swing, and a stunning vocal approach -- with \"Inside This Heart Of Mine\", vocalist Catherine Russell joins the ranks of the greatest interpreters and performers of American Popular Song.\n\nStrictly Romancin', released in 2012, is a paean to natural attractions; to a lover, an art form, and to one\u2019s family heritage. Our faithful heroine explores love\u2019s foibles, failures, and bliss, from amorous to humorous, embodying the lost art of song savvy, inhabiting the lyric, and allowing each melody to shine. On this 14 song collection, this ever soulful jazz/blues vocalist takes us on a journey; from Harlem dance hall, to Parisian Caf\u00e9, to Store Front Church, to New Orleans Gin Joint, to Uptown Cabaret, blurring distinctions between the carnal and the eternal, in a musical tour de force. Strictly Romancin' was awarded Prix du Jazz Vocal (Vocal Album of The Year) by the Jazz Academy in France, Grand Prix du Hot Club de France, and a Bistro Award for Outstanding Recording, after reaching #1 on multiple Jazz Charts (JazzWeek, I-Tunes, Amazon), and #6 on Billboard. She also received a Nightlife Award as Outstanding Jazz Performer.\n\nIn 2012, Catherine Russell won a Grammy Award for her appearance as a featured artist on the soundtrack album for the HBO TV series Boardwalk Empire.\n\nCatherine's 5th album, \"Bring It Back\", will be released in February 2014 on the Jazz Village label, a new imprint from Harmonia Mundi.\n\nCatherine Russell is that rarest of entities \u2013 a genuine jazz and blues singer \u2013 who can sing virtually anything. Her voice is full blown feminity incarnate; a dusky, stalwart and soulful instrument that radiates interpretive power yet remains touchingly vulnerable. She launches fearlessly into each tune, getting inside the melody and capturing every emotion.", "otherInfo": "Join us for Valentines Day week at Birdland with Catherine Russell and Her Septet!"}, {"Address": "315 West 44th St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Evan Arntzen", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9205995.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.989689, 40.759], "Date": "Tue Feb 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-11", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Trad Jazz, Swing, New Orleans Jazz", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Birdland", "moreBioInfo": "Possessing a powerful tone on both clarinet and saxophone, as well as a charismatic singing voice, Evan Arntzen is a natural born musician steeped in the history of jazz.

Organized by post-bop pianist Marc Cary, The Harlem Sessions (originating at Gin Fizz and now based at Smoke Jazz Club) invites musicians, poets, artists, philosophers and dancers to build and explore a new common repertoire with original ensemble arrangements. A key player in galvanizing this fresh and dynamic sense of cultural awareness, drummer/composer Curtis Nowosad was on hand anchoring the groove every week during the gathering\u2019s first years \u2013 and he\u2019s still part of the action today.\n\nHaving made his home in Harlem since 2013 when he was working on his masters at the Manhattan School of Music, the 31-year-old Canadian native emerges as a powerful musical force for social justice on a groundbreaking self-titled jazz and blues-driven collection that illuminates past and present American history while creating some profound history of its own.\n\nWhile it may seem curious to some that Curtis would self-title his third overall album, it\u2019s reflective of a desire to share his deeper core identity. He imparts his truth and the issues that have long mattered to him via five impactful originals and edgy, intensely rendered versions of three thematically related pieces: Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s \u201cHome is Where the Hatred Is,\u201d Skip James\u2019 \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Co-produced with Cary, it\u2019s also the drummer\u2019s first collection to feature the explosive and intuitive chemistry of his NY-based ensemble that has held court in NYC everywhere from Smalls, Fat Cat and Rockwood Music Hall to The Jazz Standard and full week residencies at Dizzy\u2019s Club at Jazz at Lincoln Center.\n\nThe group includes Duane Eubanks (trumpet), Braxton Cook (alto sax), Andrew Renfroe (guitar), Jonathan Thomas (piano, Fender Rhodes, organ) and Luke Sellick (bass). Guests include Corey Wallace (trombone), Matthew Whitaker (organ) and vocalists Michael Mayo (whose beautiful wordless vocal brings a rich humanity to \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d and \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d) and Brianna Thomas, who brings the burning soul-blues angles and edges to \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Cary himself guests on Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer and synth.\n\nCurtis laid the foundation for this current release with two previous critically acclaimed collections, his debut The Skeptic & the Cynic (which spent two weeks at #1 on the Canadian Jazz charts and featured Grammy-nominated pianist Taylor Eigsti) and the WCMA-winning and JUNO-nominated Dialectics (Cellar Live), which made DownBeat Magazine\u2019s \u201cBest of 2015\u201d list, reached #3 on the CMJ jazz charts and spent ten weeks on the JazzWeek charts. The Skeptic & the Cynic was comprised mostly of cover songs by Michael Jackson, Bob Marley, Joni Mitchell, Pink Floyd, Black Star and 2Pac, along with two originals. Recorded in Winnipeg in 2014 after Curtis\u2019 first year at Manhattan School of Music, Dialectics featured mostly original music along with arrangements of compositions by Thelonious Monk, Wayne Shorter and the jazz standard \u201cI Remember You.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recorded my first two albums in my hometown of Winnipeg,\u201d Curtis says, \u201cwith a band made up of my former teachers from the University of Manitoba. Those works were geared towards my growth as a musician and gaining a deeper knowledge of jazz. Stylistically, the new one is definitely a departure from those, yet is a much better reflection of who I am and the themes and issues that matter to me. It\u2019s more important to me than just, \u2018here are some new songs.\u2019 These social issues were always simmering in my mind, and I was very vocal about them among the people I know and love, but it took a while before I was able to convey my feelings musically.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ve lived a lot of life between the release of Dialectics and now,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019ve gained a great deal of life and musical experience and been through a lot, so it felt appropriate to self-title the album. The music is very personal to me. I have gained a lot of insight living in Harlem for the past 5 1/2 years, and as a European-descended practitioner of Black American Music, I feel it is my duty to approach this music and these themes in a respectful, earnest and serious manner. I also feel that as I have made the transition from being an \u2018outsider looking in\u2019 (being from Canada) to an \u2018insider looking out,\u2019 so to speak, I have a unique perspective that I have chosen to express with this album.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding the world from Curtis\u2019 perspective will no doubt prompt listeners not only to enjoy some of the most inventive, hard-hitting jazz they\u2019ve heard in a long time, but also to start Googling and brushing up on their social history. Four of his five originals are devoted to activists who gave their lives or livelihoods to the struggle for a better planet.\n\nThe dreamy and mystical, then percussively busier and bustling \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d is dedicated to the Standing Rock Sioux and all other indigenous people in the U.S., Canada and worldwide who are fighting for their rights to exist without encroachment. Ranging from lilting and simmering gospel to fiery bebop to an electric piano, organ and affected saxophone jam, \u201cNever Forget What They Did to Fred Hampton\u201d reflects both the forward thinking, socially conscious vision and the violent chaos that beset the Black Panther movement. Curtis composed the track on the anniversary of the FBI\u2019s assassination of Hampton, one of the movement\u2019s young, charismatic leaders who was head of the Chicago Chapter of the Party when he was gunned down in December 1969, at the age of 21. \u201cHis murder must be remembered and understood as we celebrate his message and vision of a brighter future for African Americans and all people devoted to justice and solidarity,\u201d the drummer says.\n\nThe emotional, deeply soulful ballad \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d is dedicated to Brazilian politician Marielle Franco, who was the leading voice in her country against police brutality and corruption before her assassination in March 2018. \u201cBlues 4 Colin K\u201d is a lively, high energy blues romp with a hypnotic soul transporting melody designed to shed light on former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who like Muhammad Ali fifty years before him, was robbed of his best years of competing for taking a stand (via taking a knee during the national anthem) against injustice and the oppression of Black people. Curtis balances the heavy themes with a personal statement of a different kind, the romantic and whimsical \u201cWaltz 4 Meg,\u201d dedicated to his wife Megan, whom he has known for over half his life.\n\nCurtis, who started playing drums at 12 and picked up piano at 16, grew up in Winnipeg, the son of a piano teacher mother and saxophonist father. While he grew up hearing jazz around the house, Curtis opted instead for bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Yet his mindset shifted quickly from hard rock to jazz when he heard Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers, particularly their 1963 album Caravan. \u201cI liked John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman and started learning with records I checked out of the public library,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was something about Blakey being a thunderous drummer and bandleader that tapped into my spirit and made me realize I wanted to be that kind of musician as well. Why jazz? Its sense of freedom just spoke to me, and I think that\u2019s what attracts a lot of people. There are no limits. I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to interact with a lot of New York musicians when I was in high school and college, and that played a large part as well.\u201d\n\nEstablishing himself on the NY jazz scene, Curtis has played in the bands of Philip Harper, Craig Harris, rising star saxophonist Braxton Cook and renowned pianist Marc Cary (who both make major contributions to the album) while headlining major jazz festivals in Canada and several in the U.S. He has also performed with four NEA Jazz Masters: Candido Camero, Dave Liebman, Jimmy Owens and Kenny Barron. A recipient of several awards and scholarships, in 2014 Nowosad performed at the Bimhuis in Amsterdam as a winner of the Keep an Eye Jazz Award. He was twice selected to participate in Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC and also attended the Banff Jazz Workshop.\n\nCurtis is an alumnus of the University of Manitoba, where he studied with Terreon Gully and Quincy Davis, and holds a master\u2019s degree from Manhattan School of Music, where he was a student of John Riley, and performed with the multi-Grammy nominated MSM Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra, under the direction of Bobby Sanabria. He currently serves on MSM\u2019s Precollege jazz faculty and is an endorser of Canopus Drums.\n\n\u201cFrom a purely musical standpoint, this album was creatively fulfilling because it was the first time that I had handled all of the audio editing myself, which was quite a task because there are so many layers, from horns to vocals to electronic sounds,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cIt was a challenge to figure out how to bring the right people into unique configurations for each song so that we could best bring their artistry to life, and we were still adding guests a week before the recording session. It was going to be a purely instrumental project until Marc and I talked about adding vocals \u2013 which led us to bring the incomparable Michael Mayo and Brianna Thomas on board.\n\n\u201cThematically, my feeling is that if we never deal with history we will never know how to grow and move forward as a society\u201d he adds. \u201cOne of the problems in the U.S, Canada and many other countries is that we don\u2019t do nearly enough to understand that history and take the necessary steps toward dismantling systems of oppression. Jazz has always inherently reflected the times it\u2019s created in, but often when it\u2019s institutionalized in colleges and university programs, we tend to focus on jazz history alone as opposed to the American and world history it emerges from. I hope this project will inspire listeners to read up on the different icons I was inspired to write about, and open their eyes and ears to not only what was going on in previous generations but also today. By better understanding those important connections, we can collectively begin to question all the societal structures around us.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Mickey Utley Band", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8488718.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Norwegian Cruise Lines - Bliss", "moreBioInfo": "Mickey Utley Band", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "EG Vines", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9198242.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Roots Rock, Americana, Soul, Folk Rock", "Time": "4:30 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Having burst onto Nashville\u2019s bustling Americana scene with his debut EP in 2018, E.G. Vines is preparing for the release of his first full-length album as a solo artist. Produced by Jordan Lehning (Kacey Musgraves, Robert Ellis, Rayland Baxter), Family Business is a deep dive into Vines\u2019 broad-ranging roots rock sound paired with lyrics that relate themselves to the human condition. As its title suggests, at its core lies a focus on what makes us, as a collective society, family. With lead single \"The Salesman\" already in rotation at regional taste-maker Lightning 100, Vines is poised to break out on a national scale.\n\nThe skyrocketing riffs of \u201cThe Victim\u201d kick the album off in style, complete with high-rising instrumental breaks and Vines\u2019 own soaring across the track vocally. It gives listeners something expressive and personal to start out on while touching on today\u2019s social climate. Vines recalls, \u201cI started writing \u2018The Victim\u2019 when I was at the beach with my family thinking back on the progression of my life. It talks about victim mentality\u2014if you feel like a victim, you\u2019re going to be a victim. There is a way to break out of that and hopefully we learn to see it.\"\n\n\n\u201cThe Hate Remains\u201d sees the roots rocker delving deeper into history than he perhaps ever has as a writer. Accompanied by gentle guitar tones and the subtly sweet warble of his friend Charlie Whitten's whistle, Vines recalls his time attending the University of Alabama. Reflecting over its troubled past, he sinks into the still lingering scars of the civil rights era and slavery. \u201cIt\u2019s me going back after not having been there for a while and looking at how everything has changed physically with the campus, but there\u2019s still underlying problems,\u201d he states.\n\nInspired by America\u2019s gun violence epidemic, Vines ruminates over his desensitization towards news of mass shootings throughout the melancholy Americana of \u201cFeel Again\u201d. Mournful pedal steel sweeps throughout the song as Vines doles out its passionate and all-too-honest message. He flips the blues grit dial to 11 in \u201cBlood In The Streets\u201d, a favorite of his live shows and one that he was especially excited to record in the studio. \u201cThat was a fun one to record,\u201d Vines recalls. \u201cIt really came to life in the studio with the group. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s rock, it\u2019s loose.\u201d Closing track \u201cPoor Man, Rich Man\u201d sees Vines leaning into a heaping helping of gospel-tinged soul to contrast very different upbringings. As he sinks further into the song\u2019s swampy groove, Vines ultimately settles on a message of love, expressing, \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel right / then try to hold each other tight.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Jonesboro, Arkansas, Vines first cut his teeth as the frontman to an alternative rock band in high school. Since then, he\u2019s become a respected name amongst the greats of Nashville\u2019s expansive roots rock cabal. First moving to Music City in 2009, Vines quickly became a hot commodity for his work with The Bandoliers, a respected facet of the blues and Southern rock scene in the mid-2010s. The band released their last album in 2015, at which point Vines acted on the urge to go solo.\n\nDropping his debut EP, Conversation\u2014produced by Eddie Spear (Brandi Carlile, The Delta Saints)\u2014in 2018, the rocker gave listeners their first taste of a more thoughtful, nuanced side to his songwriting. It was a much longer process than he was used to, with Spear acting as a songwriting mentor more so than a traditional producer, scrapping Vines\u2019 initial batch of tunes and pushing him to hone his craft before releasing new material. The finished product was worth the wait, and showcased Vines\u2019 newfound, stirringly eclectic Americana sound.\n\nAll in all, Family Business is an album about family, but not solely the nuclear sense. Vines has a knack for injecting his thoughts on hot button issues and well-crafted life anecdotes into his music as any bonafide roots rocker should, but his vision is wider in scope. In communicating his ideas on love, loss, and life, he instantly creates a connection with listeners that feels universally relatable and utterly personal. To this end, he aims to make us\u2014one and all, as humankind\u2014feel like family.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "240 W 35th St, New York, NY 10001", "Artist": "Anyone's-Guess", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.991777, 40.752246], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Jack Doyle's", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Rewired For Autism\nCocktails for a cause!"}, {"Address": "111 E 48th St, New York, NY 10017", "Artist": "The Cafe Society", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8283629.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.973666, 40.755508], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Swing, Blues, Jazz Blues, Jazz Instrument", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "The Parlour", "moreBioInfo": "In the 1940s, there was one integrated jazz club in New York City where all the greats played: Caf\u00e9 Society in the West Village.\n\nToday, The Caf\u00e9 Society is a group of jazz musicians in Brooklyn, NY, led by bassist Jim Greene, saxophonist Justin Flynn, and vocalist Emily Wade Adams.

Sadly, I attempted violin as a young child and was brutally bad. My parents had some how had me listening to classical music at that time which probably explains the violin attempt. Then a miracle happened\u2026First, the Beatles arrived so, bye bye classical & then my aunt who was buying a new piano (the wealthier end of the family) offered me her old one. I\u2019m 8 1/2 so I was still agreeable to anything so I promised to take lessons and really work at it.\n\nI lied\u2026After a year and a half I quit\u2026..until I discovered Elton John. That was it! I was determined to be a musician. In the late 70\u2019s I joined a fairly succesful 50\u2019s/60\u2019s band called Slick. I played 6 nights a week and worked full time at a department store as a stock man (person in this politically correct universe). Exhaustion wasn\u2019t considered. I went to gigs with a thermos of tea and lemon since I was always sick. This lasted until the early 80\u2019s. I joined a band called Loose Change which (under my direction) played anything from the 1960\u2019s- whatever was current. That lasted 12 years. Many years of putting my ears in harms way and breathing in way to much bar smoke told me it was time to quit. This was somewhere around 1993/94 (I don\u2019t remember). The next time I played live was in 2004 at my local block party. That\u2019s what I needed to get the itch to play again but, I was working in retail at Sam Ash Music and simply had no time to gig. In 2007 I was offered a better job which offered me a 9-5 existence. The economy turned sour and earning extra cash became a priority. And then it happened\u2026.I walked into a local Italian restaurant called Vera\u2019s Trattoria to pick up a pizza and lo and behold (fancy words ehh?) a piano player was pumping out Jazz licks. Can you imagine? Live music! I decided to approach the owner to see if I could score a gig. He decided to try me the following week. I was hired as a permanent fixture on Saturday nights. Thus The Richie G Review was born. \u201cA one man band Piano/vocals using backing tracks and a voice harmonizer to create a full band sound. My current song list represents over seventy artists including Elton John, Billy Joel , James Taylor, The Beatles and hits from the 1960\u2019s thru today. Over 500 tunes and counting\u2013 Booking email onemanbandrichieg@gmail.com .\u201d I played at Vera\u2019s for 14 months and then a new owner took over. He decided that entertainment was unnecessary. I got to work recording a CD of covers and creating business cards. The hard work paid off! I\u2019m a permanent Wednesday night fixture at the Woodcliff lake Hilton as well as sprinkling in various weekend gigs.\n\nRidgewood Street Fair 2013-2014\n\n\n\n392561_413258562028352_398683286819213_1318553_160572558_nRIDGEWOOD\n\n\n\nChapter 2- Ginger Martini was Born Right around St Patty\u2019s Day of 2012, I was performing at the Elm Street Grill in Oakland NJ. I was approached by my soon to be partner Wendy Kelly. I was on the floor wiring up my equipment as she, asked me questions about what I do (kind of music, etc). I was excited believing that I was going to be hired for a private party. During the break, she handed me her card.It turned out she was interested in joining me. I wasn\u2019t looking but, I agreed to see what she sounded like at my rehearsal space (haha my basement). Three songs later I was convinced. We sounded great together. A week later, we had 50 plus songs ready for prime time. She joined me at The Paris Inn in Wayne NJ. Ever since we perform around 50% of my gigs together and get an incredible response. Wendy started a seasoned veteran of the Broadway, Standard, and Country Genres. She has since dragged me into her country word as I dragged her into my pop/rock world.

Collective Soul helped shape and define alternative rock with lots of guitars and attitude.\n\nCollective Soul was formed in the small town of Stockbridge, Ga., in the early 1990\u2019s. The group consists of principal songwriter and frontman Ed Roland (lead vocals/keyboards/guitars), Dean Roland (rhythm guitarist), Will Turpin (bassist), Johnny Rabb (drummer) and Jesse Triplett (lead guitarist).\n\nThe band\u2019s debut album Hints Allegations and Things Left Unsaid was originally released in 1993 on Atlanta indie label Rising Storm. The album was a collection of Ed Roland\u2019s demos that spread like fire through the college circuit and the popularity of the album locally spurred Atlantic to pick it up for a major-label release. \u201cShine\u201d quickly became the rock anthem played across the country on radio and on MTV and set the band up for an arena tour with Aerosmith.\n\nTheir self-titled second album was a triple platinum juggernaut and would define their sound with guitar driven songs and passionate vocals. The album produced five Top Ten hits and two of the singles\u2013\u201cDecember\u201d and \u201cThe World I Know\u201d\u2013charted on the Top 40, which spoke to the band\u2019s crossover appeal.\n\nIn 1997, the band went back into the studio to produce their third album Disciplined Breakdown. The album earned Collective Soul a spot on the charts at #16, and produced hit singles \u201cPrecious Declaration,\u201d which was #1 four weeks; and \u201cListen,\u201d #1 for five weeks), which also charted on the Billboard Hot 100, at #65 and #72, respectively.\n\nCritically acclaimed Dosage was released in 1999 and produced the hit singles \u201cRun\u201d and \u201cHeavy,\u201d which would take Billboard\u2019s top spot for a record 15 weeks.\n\nCollective Soul\u2019s fifth album, Blender, was released in 2000 and, according to Rolling Stone, \u201csimply shreds with unapologetic classic-rock energy.\u201d The album went gold and produced smash hits including \u201cWhy, Part 2,\u201d \u201cVent,\u201d and duet with Elton John \u201cPerfect Day.\u201d\n\nThe band released a greatest hits collection in 2001 entitled 7even Year Itch: Greatest Hits 1994-2001. Following that album, Collective Soul recognized the music industry was evolving and was one of the first bands to create their own label to have more independence and control over their sound. And, in 2004, that label El Music Group released the dynamic album Youth. From the Ground Up (2005) and Home (2006) were also released under the El Music Group label, along with a DVD featuring their live concert with the Atlanta City Youth Orchestra.\n\nIn 2007, the band teamed with Target to be the exclusive retailer for the band\u2019s next album Afterwords, from Roadrunner Records. This arrangement was one of the first such exclusive album release deals to be made by a band with a sole retailer. The album was loved by fans and opened at #25 on the Billboard Comprehensive Albums Chart and was #5 on the Billboard Top Internet Albums Chart.\n\nIn 2008, Collective Soul found themselves on the soundtrack for the film Twilight with \u201cTremble for My Beloved\u201d from Dosage. Following the film\u2019s success, the song\u2019s exposure earned Collective Soul new popularity and connected with a younger audience.\n\nCollective Soul released their self-titled eighth studio album in 2009. The single \u201cStaring Down\u201d charted at #18 on Billboard\u2018s Adult Top 40. The album debuted at #24 on the Billboard 200 and the single \u201cYou\u201d also charted on the Billboard Adult Top 40.\n\nCollective Soul\u2019s music has often been covered by well-known artists. In 2001, Dolly Parton won a Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance with her cover version of \u201cShine\u201d. In further recognition of their artistic achievement, Collective Soul was inducted into The Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 2009. Additionally, as the principal songwriter for the group, Roland was individually inducted as a songwriter in 2014.\n\nThe platinum-selling rock band is readying for the Fall 2015 release of their long-awaited ninth album, See What You Started by Continuing, followed by a tour to celebrate the band\u2019s 21st birthday. Ed Roland says the band took some time off, came back energized about what they are and always have been: a rock band. \u201cThis is the best and most rocking album we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s one of those, \u2018just sit back and rock\u2019 records.\u201d\n\nCollective Soul continues to rock quite simply for the love of music. The band that helped sonically define alternative rock is more focused and energized than ever. And as Ed Roland puts it, fans can continue to expect \u201clots of guitars and a fun attitude from the southern gentlemen of rock and roll.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Trae Sheehan", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8972689.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Folk, Folk Rock, Singer, Songwriter, Acoustic", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Born in the heart of Appalachia, twenty-two year old Trae Sheehan grew up surrounded by music and family in his home state of West Virginia.

The album was born from a commitment to write a song per week for 52 weeks. Through this discipline of writing and seeking to find God's beauty and hope in the joy and the pain, PJ stepped into his stride. \"Set Me Free\" is a prayerful realization that God desires to set our hearts free from our hurt and difficulty while \"It Is You\" reminds us that Christ is the true desire of our hearts.\n\n\n\nGrace Beyond Strength, which was released in June 2012, landed him a spot as an iTunes New & Noteworthy Featured Artist.

Don\u2019t get me wrong I love a solid heartbreak tune, but I had never written anything else.\" admits Brent Cowles, as he described the impetus for \"High to Low\", his brand new single available October 18th.\n\n\"I wanted to make people dance and smile\" he continued. So Brent locked himself in an LA studio with producer and songwriter Lewis Pesacov, of Fool's Gold fame, and they put together the funky foundations for \"High To Low.\u201d Brent and Lewis built the song around the bass-line. The result is exuberant, good time rock n roll. Says Brent, \"It\u2019s a song about dancing like everyone is watching, and you don\u2019t give a damn.\"\n\nBlurring the lines between boisterous rock, R&B, and contemplative folk, Brent\u2019s infectious voice and knack for melody seem to swing effortlessly from quavering intimacy to a soulful roar as they soar atop his exuberant, explosive arrangements.\n\nGrowing up, Cowles first discovered the power of his voice singing hymns at his father\u2019s church in Colorado Springs. Having a pastor for a parent meant heavy involvement in religious life, but Cowles never quite seemed to fit in. At 16 he fell in love with secular music; at 17 he recorded his first proper demos in a friend\u2019s basement; at 18 he was married; at 19 he was divorced. Meanwhile, what began as a solo musical project blossomed into the critically acclaimed band You Me & Apollo, which quickly took over his life. The Denver Post raved that the group created \u201csome of the most exciting original music in Colorado,\u201d while Westword proclaimed that their live show was a \u201cclinic in roots rock mixed with old-school swing and blues,\u201d and Seattle NPR station KEXP hailed \u201cCowles\u2019 Otis Redding and Sam Cooke inspired vocals.\u201d The band released two albums and toured nationally before they called it quits and amicably went their separate ways.\n\nThe parting was a necessary but difficult one for Cowles. In the ensuing months and years, he would find himself alone more than ever before, at one point living out of his Chevy Tahoe just to make ends meet. But rather than break him, the experience only strengthened his resolve. \"High to Low\u201d gives the listener a real sense of Brent\u2019s current mood.

Michael Simone, the songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist behind the band, has immersed himself in music since he was a teenager, and his varied passions and interests\u2014from Prince to Led Zeppelin, The Cure to Waylon Jennings, and Jeff Buckley to The Smiths, everything has culminated to produce a record that sounds like \u201870s alt-rock while maintaining a timeless story of heartbreak and trying to find one\u2019s place in the world. Even before Ocean Carolina, Simone was part of several successful bands and projects\u2014including playing guitar and bass for Mercury / Polygram recording artist The Veldt, fronting Seems So Bright, and selling roughly 250,000 units as an electronic producer under the moniker of Lovesky\u2014but all of his connections seemed to have been building towards this band. Featuring Tony Leone (Chris Robinson Brotherhood / Levon Helm / Phil Lesh), Jon Graboff (formerly of Ryan Adams and the Cardinals and pedal steel player for Willie Nelson, Noel Gallagher, and others), guitarist Dave Wanamaker (Expanding Man / Loveless) and Simone\u2019s life-long friend Alex Cox, Ocean Carolina features many accomplished studio and stage musicians. Using all of the techniques he\u2019s learned from his career\u2014from production, keyboards, synth, rhythm, guitar, and earnest songwriting\u2014Simone began the recording process for Maudlin Days, a record that has more in common with \u201870s alt-rock or Southern rock than anything else. The songs are sincere and honest, but they also capture the energy and spark of Ocean Carolina\u2019s live performances. \u201cFor the first time, I just wanted to be the guy who showed up in the studio with my guitar and played and sang my songs with a band and capture that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were lucky enough to get Jon Graboff involved as a producer and second guitar\u2026and we knocked out the entire thing in eleven days. Jon was adamant on making sure we stuck to the tradition of making albums the way they used to be made,\u201d Simone says. Michael\u2019s passion for music and songwriting shine through and combine to create a unique voice. \u201cIt was a whirlwind, and looking back, I can\u2019t believe we actually pulled it off,\u201d he says, but even this is a familiar tale: few musicians relax and trust their ability and process. Maudlin Days is an exercise in giving up control and allowing the music to be what it\u2019s meant to become. The single, \u201cIf It Burns out Bright,\u201d immediately mimics the energy and drive of something exploding. It\u2019s catchy and upbeat, and the direct, sweet lyrics help to contrast the inherent risk of violence in the title: \u201cEverything will be all right, darling blue / Even if it burns out bright, I have you.\u201d The combination of comforting phrases and vocals contrasted with catchy music is at once memorable and soothing. Even when discussing eternity and the end of time, Simone\u2019s songs are accessible and thoughtful. Other tracks like \u201cWords\u201d showcase the energy of their compressed recording time: though the actual rhythm is slower, the song doesn\u2019t lose any forward momentum: it kicks off with a wailing guitar part, and maintains that tension throughout. Simone\u2019s low, warm voice sings, \u201cSo I push the needle in the red / All the evil things I said arrive / Can I find the freedom in the wheel? / Got no words but I can make this right,\u201d and the listener is carried along with him, looking towards a better future. Each song seems to tell part of a story about looking at heartbreak and people\u2019s human failings. However, they all dare the narrator\u2014and the listener\u2014to triumph in spite of the pain, and to grow stronger, if not back together. Maudlin Days will be released on June 30, 2015.

And it\u2019s also country-funk.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve matured as musicians and as a band,\u201d says Kelby, whose lap steel lays down the bass line for The Cadillac Three and is largely responsible for the trio\u2019s one-of-a-kind vibe. \u201cOur sound is second nature to us and that only comes from playing together for as long as we have.\u201d\n\nAveraging 140 shows a year, The Cadillac Three are perpetually burning up the highway, Traveling 40 out of 52 weeks. It\u2019s grueling, committed work, but Jaren, Neil and Kelby wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Nor would the band\u2019s fans, who make pilgrimages to see The Cadillac Three and will often catch an entire weekend\u2019s worth of gigs. To reward that devotion, the group was adamant about giving their fans as many songs as they could on COUNTRY FUZZ.\n\nThe 16 tracks on the record touch on all eras of the band\u2019s history, from the swampy stomp of their 2012 self-titled debut and the power chords of 2016\u2019s BURY ME IN MY BOOTS to the polish of 2017\u2019s LEGACY.\n\nThe trio wrote much of COUNTRY FUZZ, which they also produced, with their live show in mind. \u201dAs many shows as we play, we still switch our sets up every night. We really try to do something different, and now we have 16 new songs that we can add in,\u201d says Neil.\n\nWith its serpentine lick and Jaren\u2019s thick-as-syrup delivery, \u201cSlow Rollin\u201d echoes the band\u2019s most-played live song, the fan favorite \u201cTennessee Mojo.\u201d The group wrote \u201cSlow Rollin\u201d on the bus before a show in Las Vegas, with Jaren plugging in and rattling the back lounge. \u201cI had the amp in the back of the bus, and when you turn it to 11, it\u2019s loud as fuck,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI wrote that riff and was like, \u2018How the hell didn\u2019t we write \u2018Slow Rollin\u2019 yet?\u2019 It\u2019s such an obvious TC3 song.\u201d\n\nSo is \u201cHard Out Here for a Country Boy,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek list of all the things that good ol\u2019 boys deal with on a daily basis while trying to live \u201cthat slow life in a real fast world.\u201d Chris Janson sings a verse and adds harmonica, while the band\u2019s recent tourmate Travis Tritt lends his unmistakable voice to the commanding choruses.\n\n\u201cHeat\u201d is equally hard-hitting. A fiery salute to a lady who\u2019s as combustible as \u201cin a bar fight with gasoline,\u201d it slinks along on Neil\u2019s rhythmic beat before exploding in a noisy breakdown that blends Kelby\u2019s steel with Jaren\u2019s guitar. Even so, Neil calls it more of a vocal song.\u201dIt\u2019s a chance for Jaren to show off his voice and the way that it\u2019s matured,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile the band still sing about cold beer, hell-raising and Saturday nights, the idea of maturity underscores all of COUNTRY FUZZ. The Cadillac Three have never been as cohesive a unit as they are here, with all three musicians seemingly sharing the same musically tattooed brain. When Kelby adds subtle slide in the stunning closer \u201cAfter Last Call\u201d to accentuate Jaren\u2019s delivery, Neil instinctively knows to pull back and give the notes room to breathe. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been pretty good at that,\u201d says Jaren. \u201cBut we\u2019re all focusing more on our instruments. I care more about playing guitar now than I ever have, and I\u2019ve been honing that. And Kelby is figuring out different ways to make his lap steel work in the songs, especially with the funkier stuff.\u201d\n\nThat new funky direction is readily apparent in the devil disco of \u201cThe Jam\u201d and on the swerving \u201cBlue El Camino,\u201d two tracks on COUNTRY FUZZ that point to the future of The Cadillac Three. \u201cWhen we started playing \u201cThe Jam\u201d at soundcheck, I used the lap steel to build a bass line and glue together Jaren\u2019s funky guitar,\u201d says Kelby. \u201cIt\u2019s a cool new sound for us\u201d\n\n\u201cThe funkier aspects of this record is where we\u2019re wanting to go, but with big ol\u2019 country hooks,\u201d adds Jaren, \u201cbecause that is what we\u2019re addicted to from growing up in Nashville. We love country songwriting and huge hooks.\u201d\n\nStill, The Cadillac Three refuse to be categorized. Listen to the song \u201cLabels,\u201d a brilliant, succinct slice of songwriting from Neil with Corey Crowder and Luke Dick, that asks, \u201cI wonder what you see when you look at me?\u201d It\u2019s a pulsing anthem, with Jaren repeating, \u201cNobody wants to be labeled,\u201d and stands as one of the band\u2019s most incisive songs.\n\nAlong with the heavy-funk explorations, Country Fuzz marks a first for the group: \u201cBack Home\u201d is the only song the group has ever recorded that at least one of its members didn\u2019t write. Co-written by Craig Wiseman, James McNair and Chris Tompkins, the tune is a straight-ahead blast of country-rock nostalgia and proved irresistible to The Cadillac Three.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine anyone doing \u201cBack Home\u201d more than I could us doing it,\u201d says Neil. \u201cThat\u2019s the true test of what is or isn\u2019t a Cadillac Three song.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe story was so good and the syncopation of the lyrics flowed so well that I knew we could make it work,'\u201c says Jaren. \u201cThat song is a hit, but it\u2019s still very much us.\u201d\n\nWithout a doubt, The Cadillac Three know exactly who they are \u2014 and they say the same is true of their fans. It\u2019s all one big community that\u2019s summed up by Country Fuzz. The trio is even launching a clothing line under the Country Fuzz name.\n\n\u201cThe Cadillac Three are at a place now where we\u2019re not scared to take chances and see what we can actually become,\u201d says Jaren.\n\n\u201cThe path we\u2019re on is the natural way we do things, making each album and idea bigger than the last one,\u201d Kelby says. \u201cIt's like a pitstop on a motorcycle ride, where you stop here, grab a beer, look around, learn from it, and then keep riding.\u201d\n\nAnd COUNTRY FUZZ provides the soundtrack for that ride.\n\n\u201cThis album has a little bit of everything, and you can see where we started and where we\u2019re going,\u201d Jaren says. \u201cThe Cadillac Three is evolving in a badass new way.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "146 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Ariana and the Rose", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9148127.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.963479, 40.7101], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Alt Synth Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Baby's All Right", "moreBioInfo": "An artist who embraces an audio-visual approach to creativity, Ariana and the Rose writes, sings and performs a coming of age story.

Master classes and lessons in the U.S. and Europe included work with jazz and classical pianists such as Richard Goode, Brad Mehldau, Robert McDonald, and Sonia Rubinsky.\n\nIn December 2009. Yaniv came to New York to study with pianist Pavlina Dokovska and in the fall of 2010, he moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas to study with pianist Jura Margulis in the piano performance program at the University of Arkansas.

Organized by post-bop pianist Marc Cary, The Harlem Sessions (originating at Gin Fizz and now based at Smoke Jazz Club) invites musicians, poets, artists, philosophers and dancers to build and explore a new common repertoire with original ensemble arrangements. A key player in galvanizing this fresh and dynamic sense of cultural awareness, drummer/composer Curtis Nowosad was on hand anchoring the groove every week during the gathering\u2019s first years \u2013 and he\u2019s still part of the action today.\n\nHaving made his home in Harlem since 2013 when he was working on his masters at the Manhattan School of Music, the 31-year-old Canadian native emerges as a powerful musical force for social justice on a groundbreaking self-titled jazz and blues-driven collection that illuminates past and present American history while creating some profound history of its own.\n\nWhile it may seem curious to some that Curtis would self-title his third overall album, it\u2019s reflective of a desire to share his deeper core identity. He imparts his truth and the issues that have long mattered to him via five impactful originals and edgy, intensely rendered versions of three thematically related pieces: Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s \u201cHome is Where the Hatred Is,\u201d Skip James\u2019 \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Co-produced with Cary, it\u2019s also the drummer\u2019s first collection to feature the explosive and intuitive chemistry of his NY-based ensemble that has held court in NYC everywhere from Smalls, Fat Cat and Rockwood Music Hall to The Jazz Standard and full week residencies at Dizzy\u2019s Club at Jazz at Lincoln Center.\n\nThe group includes Duane Eubanks (trumpet), Braxton Cook (alto sax), Andrew Renfroe (guitar), Jonathan Thomas (piano, Fender Rhodes, organ) and Luke Sellick (bass). Guests include Corey Wallace (trombone), Matthew Whitaker (organ) and vocalists Michael Mayo (whose beautiful wordless vocal brings a rich humanity to \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d and \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d) and Brianna Thomas, who brings the burning soul-blues angles and edges to \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Cary himself guests on Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer and synth.\n\nCurtis laid the foundation for this current release with two previous critically acclaimed collections, his debut The Skeptic & the Cynic (which spent two weeks at #1 on the Canadian Jazz charts and featured Grammy-nominated pianist Taylor Eigsti) and the WCMA-winning and JUNO-nominated Dialectics (Cellar Live), which made DownBeat Magazine\u2019s \u201cBest of 2015\u201d list, reached #3 on the CMJ jazz charts and spent ten weeks on the JazzWeek charts. The Skeptic & the Cynic was comprised mostly of cover songs by Michael Jackson, Bob Marley, Joni Mitchell, Pink Floyd, Black Star and 2Pac, along with two originals. Recorded in Winnipeg in 2014 after Curtis\u2019 first year at Manhattan School of Music, Dialectics featured mostly original music along with arrangements of compositions by Thelonious Monk, Wayne Shorter and the jazz standard \u201cI Remember You.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recorded my first two albums in my hometown of Winnipeg,\u201d Curtis says, \u201cwith a band made up of my former teachers from the University of Manitoba. Those works were geared towards my growth as a musician and gaining a deeper knowledge of jazz. Stylistically, the new one is definitely a departure from those, yet is a much better reflection of who I am and the themes and issues that matter to me. It\u2019s more important to me than just, \u2018here are some new songs.\u2019 These social issues were always simmering in my mind, and I was very vocal about them among the people I know and love, but it took a while before I was able to convey my feelings musically.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ve lived a lot of life between the release of Dialectics and now,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019ve gained a great deal of life and musical experience and been through a lot, so it felt appropriate to self-title the album. The music is very personal to me. I have gained a lot of insight living in Harlem for the past 5 1/2 years, and as a European-descended practitioner of Black American Music, I feel it is my duty to approach this music and these themes in a respectful, earnest and serious manner. I also feel that as I have made the transition from being an \u2018outsider looking in\u2019 (being from Canada) to an \u2018insider looking out,\u2019 so to speak, I have a unique perspective that I have chosen to express with this album.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding the world from Curtis\u2019 perspective will no doubt prompt listeners not only to enjoy some of the most inventive, hard-hitting jazz they\u2019ve heard in a long time, but also to start Googling and brushing up on their social history. Four of his five originals are devoted to activists who gave their lives or livelihoods to the struggle for a better planet.\n\nThe dreamy and mystical, then percussively busier and bustling \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d is dedicated to the Standing Rock Sioux and all other indigenous people in the U.S., Canada and worldwide who are fighting for their rights to exist without encroachment. Ranging from lilting and simmering gospel to fiery bebop to an electric piano, organ and affected saxophone jam, \u201cNever Forget What They Did to Fred Hampton\u201d reflects both the forward thinking, socially conscious vision and the violent chaos that beset the Black Panther movement. Curtis composed the track on the anniversary of the FBI\u2019s assassination of Hampton, one of the movement\u2019s young, charismatic leaders who was head of the Chicago Chapter of the Party when he was gunned down in December 1969, at the age of 21. \u201cHis murder must be remembered and understood as we celebrate his message and vision of a brighter future for African Americans and all people devoted to justice and solidarity,\u201d the drummer says.\n\nThe emotional, deeply soulful ballad \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d is dedicated to Brazilian politician Marielle Franco, who was the leading voice in her country against police brutality and corruption before her assassination in March 2018. \u201cBlues 4 Colin K\u201d is a lively, high energy blues romp with a hypnotic soul transporting melody designed to shed light on former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who like Muhammad Ali fifty years before him, was robbed of his best years of competing for taking a stand (via taking a knee during the national anthem) against injustice and the oppression of Black people. Curtis balances the heavy themes with a personal statement of a different kind, the romantic and whimsical \u201cWaltz 4 Meg,\u201d dedicated to his wife Megan, whom he has known for over half his life.\n\nCurtis, who started playing drums at 12 and picked up piano at 16, grew up in Winnipeg, the son of a piano teacher mother and saxophonist father. While he grew up hearing jazz around the house, Curtis opted instead for bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Yet his mindset shifted quickly from hard rock to jazz when he heard Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers, particularly their 1963 album Caravan. \u201cI liked John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman and started learning with records I checked out of the public library,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was something about Blakey being a thunderous drummer and bandleader that tapped into my spirit and made me realize I wanted to be that kind of musician as well. Why jazz? Its sense of freedom just spoke to me, and I think that\u2019s what attracts a lot of people. There are no limits. I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to interact with a lot of New York musicians when I was in high school and college, and that played a large part as well.\u201d\n\nEstablishing himself on the NY jazz scene, Curtis has played in the bands of Philip Harper, Craig Harris, rising star saxophonist Braxton Cook and renowned pianist Marc Cary (who both make major contributions to the album) while headlining major jazz festivals in Canada and several in the U.S. He has also performed with four NEA Jazz Masters: Candido Camero, Dave Liebman, Jimmy Owens and Kenny Barron. A recipient of several awards and scholarships, in 2014 Nowosad performed at the Bimhuis in Amsterdam as a winner of the Keep an Eye Jazz Award. He was twice selected to participate in Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC and also attended the Banff Jazz Workshop.\n\nCurtis is an alumnus of the University of Manitoba, where he studied with Terreon Gully and Quincy Davis, and holds a master\u2019s degree from Manhattan School of Music, where he was a student of John Riley, and performed with the multi-Grammy nominated MSM Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra, under the direction of Bobby Sanabria. He currently serves on MSM\u2019s Precollege jazz faculty and is an endorser of Canopus Drums.\n\n\u201cFrom a purely musical standpoint, this album was creatively fulfilling because it was the first time that I had handled all of the audio editing myself, which was quite a task because there are so many layers, from horns to vocals to electronic sounds,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cIt was a challenge to figure out how to bring the right people into unique configurations for each song so that we could best bring their artistry to life, and we were still adding guests a week before the recording session. It was going to be a purely instrumental project until Marc and I talked about adding vocals \u2013 which led us to bring the incomparable Michael Mayo and Brianna Thomas on board.\n\n\u201cThematically, my feeling is that if we never deal with history we will never know how to grow and move forward as a society\u201d he adds. \u201cOne of the problems in the U.S, Canada and many other countries is that we don\u2019t do nearly enough to understand that history and take the necessary steps toward dismantling systems of oppression. Jazz has always inherently reflected the times it\u2019s created in, but often when it\u2019s institutionalized in colleges and university programs, we tend to focus on jazz history alone as opposed to the American and world history it emerges from. I hope this project will inspire listeners to read up on the different icons I was inspired to write about, and open their eyes and ears to not only what was going on in previous generations but also today. By better understanding those important connections, we can collectively begin to question all the societal structures around us.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "234 Starr St, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Kamilah", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.922471, 40.705626], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Turk's Inn", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\u2022\u2022\u2022"}, {"Address": "127 E 23rd St, New York, NY 11226", "Artist": "Pepper", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9088364.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.984987, 40.739781], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Kona Dub ROCK, Reggae, rock, ska, reggae rock, dub, alternative", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Gramercy Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "We are a 3 piece band from Kailua-Kona, HI.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "26 Anne St., New York City, NY 10038", "Artist": "april reign", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8058824.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00818, 40.71108], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Recreation at The Moxy", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "125 MacDougal St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Bel\u00e9n Cusi", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9563971.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.000148, 40.730557], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Latin Soul", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Groove", "moreBioInfo": "Bel\u00e9n Cusi is an indie Argentine-American singer-songwriter.\n\nBorn to Argentine parents, she was raised in San Antonio, TX, where she studied classical piano from a young age.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\n\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\n\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\n\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers.

Guitar turns (Rob Ferreira) strike with an atmospheric feel that\u2019s high energy instead of ambient, a rare quality that\u2019s previously emerged in bands like Nine Inch Nails and U2.

Since 1991, the group has enthralled listeners with a singular sound that fearlessly crisscrosses genres. The trio\u2019s questing spirit drives it to explore the intersections between rock, jazz, classical, and world music. It even throws in the occasional surf or spaghetti Western tune for good measure.\n\nComprised of Bert Lams, Hideyo Moriya and Paul Richards, the group has established a unique, personal connection with audiences. In addition to dazzling musicianship and interplay, The California Guitar Trio's (CGT) shows are full of captivating stories and humor that enable concertgoers to feel like they're part of the music, not just spectators. In fact, the group\u2019s goal is to transcend their instruments, so people focus on the music first, and its considerable technical prowess a distant second.\n\nCGT's 16 albums, streamed over 65 million times on Pandora, offer diverse snapshots of the group\u2019s mercurial muse. The trio\u2019s most recent release Komorebi showcases its acoustic side, with beautiful lush originals and innovative cover arrangements of Beatles, Beach Boys and more. Other highlights include Masterworks and album of classical works, with expansive takes on Bach, Beethoven, Arvo P\u00e4rt, and Schubert. Andromeda, which combines their many influences into a visionary album of original material; CG3+2, an exploration of kinetic rock territory in collaboration with bassist Tony Levin and drummer Pat Mastelotto; and Echoes, which reimagines timeless material by artists such as Mike Oldfield, Penguin Caf\u00e9 Orchestra, Pink Floyd, and Queen.\n\nThe trio\u2019s output has made a major global impact, having served as the soundtrack for Olympics coverage, and programs on CNN, CBS, NBC, and ESPN. They have fans in high places too: Nasa used their music to wake the crew aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour.\n\nCGT's lineup is truly the sum of its distinct parts: A Utah native now residing in Los Angeles, Paul Richards immersed himself in rock, blues, jazz, and folk during his early days and while attending The University of Utah\u2019s jazz guitar program. Bert Lams, originally from Belgium, graduated from the prestigious Royal Conservatory of Music in Brussels, specializing in classical guitar. Tokyo-born Hideyo Moriya began his guitar journey with surf music and British rock, before relocating to Boston to study at Berklee.\n\nAll three felt the call to push themselves to the limit by enrolling in Robert Fripp\u2019s challenging Guitar Craft courses, where they first met in 1987. They went on to tour together as part of Fripp\u2019s League of Crafty Guitarists, before forming the California Guitar Trio in Los Angeles four years later.\n\nRecently, the trio expanded its collaborative possibilities by working within a six-guitar format with the Montreal Guitar Trio. During these groundbreaking, highly-entertaining shows, the acts perform inventive arrangements of each other\u2019s repertoire, and new music for guitar sextet.\n\n26 years and 1,800+ gigs later, the CGT remains intensely committed to explore, evolve and communicate a wide-ranging musical worldview.\n\n- By Anil Prasad", "otherInfo": "CGT show"}, {"Address": "15 Vandam St, New York, NY 10013", "Artist": "Chronicles", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6302171.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.0047, 40.72656], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Progressive Metal, Metal", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Huron Club At Soho Playhouse", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Feuding tailors, a cocaine-addicted rabbi and a Jewish woman who joins a fundamentalist Christian sect are just a few of the sometimes poignant, often humorous stories told through music in singer-songwriter Daniel Cainer's Jewish Chronicles.

With its dynamic sense of tension and cinematic mastery of mood, TAUK\u2019s all-instrumental blend of progressive rock, hip-hop, and jazz proves to be the perfect backdrop for such explorations, giving way to an album that\u2019s both powerfully hypnotic and intensely thought-provoking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all very much interested in A.I., and this idea of machines getting out of the hands of the people trying to control them,\u201d notes TAUK guitarist Matt Jalbert, whose bandmates include bassist Charlie Dolan, keyboardist Alric \u201cA.C.\u201d Carter, and drummer Isaac Teel. \u201cThis album felt like a good setting to tell that kind of story, but in a way where we could have fun with it and let the listener escape into a whole other world.\u201d\n\nEqually inspired by classic sci-fi like Blade Runner and more recent films like Ex Machina, Shapeshifter II: Outbreak embeds that narrative into TAUK\u2019s most sonically adventurous, emotionally expansive work to date. A continuation of their early-2018 EP Shapeshifter I: Construct, the new album picks up its predecessor\u2019s narrative thread with \u201cPrelude\u201d: a fantastically unsettling intro track whose frenetic keyboard work and chilling vocal samples set the tone for what\u2019s to come. \u201cThe idea is that in the EP you\u2019re seeing the construction of this being, and in the album you\u2019re seeing it break out and become something that you can\u2019t ignore anymore,\u201d Carter explains.\n\nFrom there, TAUK charge forward with the driving rhythms of \u201cRecreational Outrage\u201d (a track laced with the ominous throb of a robotic heartbeat), the futuristic soundscape and heady grooves of \u201cCMF 9000,\u201d the gauzy reverie and glorious chaos of \u201cCheckmate,\u201d and the bright melodies and soulful guitar sprawl of \u201cConvoy.\u201d One of the album\u2019s most mesmerizing moments, \u201cLet It Ride\u201d builds a brilliant tapestry from its luminous keyboard tones, kinetic guitar work, and kaleidoscopic rhythms. And on \u201cUpside Down,\u201d TAUK close out Shapeshifter II: Outbreak with a thrillingly epic burst of unfettered experimentalism.\n\nFree-flowing yet elaborately composed, Shapeshifter II: Outbreak came to life in collaboration with TAUK\u2019s longtime cohort Robert Carranza\u2014a Grammy Award-winning producer/mixer/engineer also known for his work The Mars Volta, Ozomatli, Marilyn Manson, and Taj Mahal. In a departure from their previous releases (including 2016\u2019s Sir Nebula), the band shunned the typical studio environment and holed up for weeks in a long-abandoned, century-old home that Teel describes as \u201cthe Jumanji house meets Addams Family meets Amityville Horror.\u201d Located in their homeland of Long Island, the house turned out to be the ideal spot for their makeshift studio, allowing for a creativity-enhancing seclusion. \u201cOverall the whole process was incredibly organic\u2014there were no constrictions as far as time or space, nothing ever felt forced,\u201d says Dolan. \u201cThere was a greater feeling of possibility, and it ended up being a really liberating experience for all of us.\u201d Jalbert adds: \u201cThe location definitely added to the vibe of everything we were going for. It was like we set up a laboratory in the middle of nowhere and shut off the rest of the world, which really helped get us into a specific headspace.\u201d\n\nTrue to its thematic terrain, Shapeshifter II: Outbreak endlessly blurs the boundaries between organic and electronic, with TAUK broadening their sonic palette to include a vast spectrum of synth sounds and programmed effects (such as those exquisitely eerie vocal samples heard in \u201cPrelude\u201d). And in sculpting the album\u2019s intricate arrangements, TAUK called on such esteemed musicians as The Naughty Horns, Ghost-Note\u2019s Nate Werth (a percussionist who\u2019s also played with David Crosby, Q-Tip, and Snarky Puppy), and Juan Alderete (longtime bassist for Racer X and The Mars Volta).\n\nThroughout Shapeshifter II: Outbreak, TAUK reveal the potent chemistry they discovered in childhood, when longtime friends Dolan, Jalbert, and Carter formed their first band in seventh grade. After playing together in various projects, the trio brought Teel into the fold in 2012, cementing the final lineup. Since then, TAUK have shared stages with acts like Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Widespread Panic, and Lettuce, appeared at festivals like Electric Forest and Bonnaroo, and earned acclaim from major outlets like the Washington Post (who praised TAUK for \u201ccreating a hard-charging, often melodic fusion that\u2014thanks to a penchant for improv\u2014offers limitless possibilities\u201d). As Teel points out, the band\u2019s incessant touring over the years has significantly strengthened their musical connection. \u201cThe four of us as individuals are all very animated souls in our own right,\u201d he says. \u201cWe each have our ideas and our perspectives, and when it all comes together, it creates this collective statement that takes on a life of its own.\u201d\n\nIn creating Shapeshifter II: Outbreak, TAUK made that statement more deliberate and impactful than ever before. But while several upcoming videos and the vibrant artwork of illustrator Raul Urias add a new dimension to the album\u2019s concept, the band purposely maintained a certain open-endedness in its execution. \u201cPeople tell us all kinds of stories about what our songs mean to them, and it\u2019s always cool to see how wide the gamut of those stories is,\u201d says Carter. \u201cWhat the song means to me might not be the same as what it means to you, but that\u2019s one of the great things about this whole experience. There\u2019s room for everyone to develop whatever narrative they want.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "34 W Main St, Somerville, NJ 08876", "Artist": "Kevin Hill", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7110508.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.612764, 40.568607], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Funk, Rnb-soul, Rock, R&b/soul, Soul, Jazz", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Village Brewing Company", "moreBioInfo": "A Summit Records recording artist, Kevin Hill is an active performer, educator and composer in the NY metropolitan area.

Pepper and Abbey Road eras and beyond.\n\nBased in the Los Angeles area, the band has toured extensively since its founding in 1997 -- performing at hundreds of venues throughout the U.S. and in many countries across the globe, including Japan, Malaysia, France, Hong Kong, The United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Mexico, and Brazil -- where they've skillfully recreated the Beatles' music multiple thousands of times, yet always with a freshness and excitement that audiences love.\n\nWhat makes The Fab Four unique among Beatles tribute bands is the not-so-simple fact that the four band members play all their own music live. This is just one more factor that gives their performances an energy and immediacy that backing tracks and sequencers can\u2019t.\n\nConsidering the complexity of the Beatles\u2019 later work and the fact that it was never intended to be performed live, what The Fab Four do onstage is phenomenal. Without a \u201cfifth Beatle\u201d anywhere in sight to make their job easier, these four highly accomplished musicians recreate all the sounds of an incredibly diverse catalog of Beatles favorites 100 percent live and in real time -- and their technical precision, musical artistry, and onstage chemistry make every concert a stunning performance!\n\nAudiences will appreciate their dynamic stage presence and the almost boundless energy that keeps them moving around the stage practically non-stop throughout the night, as they systematically move through the different Beatles eras, changing costumes between sets to represent the early Beatlemania years, the Sgt. Pepper/psychedelic era, and the Abbey Road period and beyond, with many shows also including a Shea Stadium set.\n\nThe band typically changes costumes twice, for a total of three period-perfect looks: the identical black chesterfield suits worn by the original lads during their Ed Sullivan Show debut, the colorful satin Sgt. Pepper uniforms and regalia worn by the Beatles during their psychedelic era, and the totally divergent clothing styles that marked the later Beatles and post-Beatles years. Select shows also feature the beige safari-style jackets and black trousers that have come to be known as the Beatles' Shea Stadium suits.\n\nThe band also periodically plays specialty shows for various Beatles-related anniversaries, such as shows that feature an entire Beatles album, played from start to finish, along with additional selections from the rest of the Beatles' extensive catalog. True to the material and era they cover, each of these shows brings in additional, highly authentic costumes from the period.\n\nThe Fab Four truly are The Ultimate Tribute to The Beatles -- the most accurate representation of the originals you'll find this side of the 1960s!", "otherInfo": "Emmy Award-winning Beatles tribute band The Fab Four is a highly polished tribute act that has been wowing audiences across the U.S. and around the world with its dynamic portrayal of the Beatles for over two decades.

Oh, and give your music away. Which isn\u2019t to say he won\u2019t be selling his debut full-length offering, Messenger ( Released 2/16/2010 on Lightning Rod). But free is how he came to make it, more or less.\n\nIt worked like this, for Joe Pug anyhow: The day before his senior year as a playwright student at the University of North Carolina, he sat down for a cup of coffee and had the clearest thought of his life: I am profoundly unhappy here. Then came the second clearest.\n\nPug packed up his belongings and pointed his car towards Chicago. Working as a carpenter by day, the 23 year-old Pug spent nights playing the guitar he hadn\u2019t picked up since his teenage years. Using ideas originally slated for a play he was writing called \u201cAustin Fish,\u201d Pug began creating the sublime lyrical arrangements that would become the Nation of Heat EP.\n\nThe songs were recorded fast and fervently at a Chicago studio where a friend snuck him in to late night slots other musicians had canceled. He was short on money, but his bare-boned sincerity didn\u2019t require much more than a microphone and it dripped off of each note he sang.\n\nThe early rumblings of critical praise for the EP were confirmed when his first headlining gig sold out Chicago\u2019s storied Schubas Tavern in 2008. As word spread, Pug struck upon an idea that would later prove to be one of the most significant in his young career. He offered his existing fans unlimited copies of a free 2-song sampler CD to pass along to their friends. He sent the CDs out at his own expense, even covering the postage. Inside each package was a personal note thanking the fan for helping to spread the word. The response was overwhelming, and to date he has sent out over 15,000 CDs to 50 states and 14 different countries. Without access to radio, Pug managed to turn his fans into his very own broadcast system. The offer still stands, and to this day it\u2019s featured prominently on www.joepugmusic.com.\n\n\u201cLook, in the end, I just trust my fans, and the nature of people in general. I need to pay my bills like anyone else does. But I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to ask someone to pay $15 when they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting. So in a way by sending out these CDs, I\u2019m wagering that they\u2019ll like my music, and that if they do they\u2019ll come to shows, buy CDs, and help me spread the word even further. And so far I\u2019ve been proven right. Without question, the more sampler CDs I send out, the more music I sell.\u201d\n\nNation of Heat took on a life of its own, passing from friend to friend and iPod to iPod. The crowds swelled and the media took notice. Tours with Steve Earle, M. Ward, and Josh Ritter followed, as did invitations to Lollapalooza and the Newport Folk Festival. He crisscrossed the country incessantly, traveling mostly alone in his 1995 Plymouth Voyager with no stereo or air conditioning. As the tours went on, he became closely linked to the burgeoning indie-folk scene that was coalescing loosely around Pug and his young contemporaries in bands such as The Low Anthem, Langhorne Slim, and Horse Feathers.\n\nAfter over 200 shows, Pug took a brief respite to record his full-length debut. If Nation of Heat heralded the arrival of a talent to watch, Messenger assigns Pug a deserved spot among the finest songwriters of his generation. From the opening notes of the title track that leads off the record, it\u2019s clear that the artist has no intention of retreating to the comfortable or the familiar. While the scathing war indictment \u201cBury Me Far (From My Uniform)\u201d and the sparse, poetic \u201cUnsophisticated Heart\u201d illustrate that Pug is still a master of the guy-and-guitar song, it\u2019s the supporting cast Pug brought on board that truly brings out the record\u2019s subtle beauty.\n\nFrom the haunting, ethereal pedal steel guitar that sneaks delicately under \u201cThe Sharpest Crown\u201d to the barrelhouse rhythm section that propels \u201cThe Door Is Always Open\u201d, it\u2019s clear that Pug is as comfortable exploring this new territory as he is solo. \u201cThe first record, it was a breeze,\u201d he says. \u201cDidn\u2019t even know we were making it, just me and a guitar\u2026the songs completely unadorned. This one, it\u2019s like that thing where there\u2019s an explosion and you realize how many options there are in the world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Joe Pug"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "The Restless Age", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8839192.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Wed Feb 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-12", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Pop, Americana", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "The Restless Age is a collaboration - a harmony of Will Bryant, Lee Falco and Brandon Morrison.

Depending on the hour of the day he's a cultural icon, a rock god, an entrepreneur, a TV star, a father, the face of the American Diabetes Association, a supercross enthusiast, solo artist, Poison frontman, and a generous donor to a myriad of charitable causes.\n\nMichaels first rose to fame as the frontman of Poison. As one of rock's most iconic and enduring bands, Poison defined the fast, gritty, and glamorous rock 'n' roll scene. Since the band's beginning, Poison has achieved massive success- releasing eight studio albums, four live albums, and selling over 30 million records worldwide and 16.5 million records in the U.S. alone.\n\nThe band has charted 10 singles in the Top 40 on Billboard's Hot 100 including the number-one single, \"Every Rose Has It's Thorn.\" Twenty-five years after their debut, Poison is still recording music and performing together.\n\nBret Michaels' solo career has been equally successful: his most recent solo album, \"Custom Built,\" released in July of 2010, topped the charts, reaching #1 on Billboard's Hard Rock list. His current solo tour, \"Get Your Rock On\" is selling out arenas across the country and his forthcoming solo album of the same name will be released this summer.\n\nMichaels has achieved stunning success in the realm of reality TV as well. His \"Rock of Love\" television series is one of the most successful in VH1's history. VH1 and Bret Michaels teamed up again for his family-oriented 2010 docu-series \"Bret Michaels: Life As I Know It.\" He went head to head with some of the brightest minds in business on Donald Trump's NBC hit, \"Celebrity Apprentice\" and went on to \"Trump\" the competition with his Trop-A-Rocka Snapple drink.\n\nMichaels' Trop-a-Rocka Diet Snapple proved to be a fan-favorite- so much so that fans rallied to continue its distribution. He is thrilled to be continuing his partnership with Snapple, remarking, \"When I created my Diet Snapple Trop-A-Rocka Tea, I made it my mission to design the best-tasting diet drink on earth \u2013 made from the best stuff on earth. Creating Diet Snapple Trop-A-Rocka Tea and donating $250,000 to Diabetes research was just the beginning. I'm thrilled that Snapple will be making Trop-A-Rocka a part of its permanent offering.\"\n\nPhilanthropy remains an important facet of Michaels' career. A lifelong diabetic, he partnered with the American Diabetes Association in 2010, acting as a spokesperson and sponsor. Beyond his role as spokesperson Michaels has gone on to help Ford raise an additional $400,000 for diabetes research at the Barrett-Jackson auto auction this past February as well as donating numerous items for auction for Diabetes related events.\n\nMichaels' charitable outreach extends far beyond diabetes, however. Rocking out and giving back go hand in hand for Michaels, who supports a diverse array of charities and causes. In March 2011, he performed at Muhammad Ali's Celebrity Fight Night in support of the Muhammad Ali Foundation, which gives to those suffering from Parkinson's disease. Michaels was so touched by the event and the cause that he donated $20,000 of his own money to the Muhammad Ali Foundation to help heal those afflicted by Parkinson's. Michaels took on the role of fundraiser as well, raising more than $200,000 for the Barrow Brain Tumor Foundation, with a star-studded dinner in his own home. He is also a supporter of the Camelot Therapeutic ranch and sponsors a horse with his family. The ranch provides services at no charge to adults and children with disabilities.\n\nMichaels continues to stretch himself and challenge himself to take on new projects in music, business, and beyond. He recently partnered with legendary guitar company, Dean Guitars, to design his first ever signature Bret Michaels series. Michaels calls Dean Guitars \"the only guitars that can keep up with me, holding up tour after tour.\" He is also actively involved in the world of extreme sports. He created and awarded the first annual Bret Michaels Rock Hard, Ride Hard Award for supercross - a cash prize for the toughest and most tenacious supercross rider of the season - on May 7, 2011. The award will be given out again in 2012.\n\nMichaels has teamed with PetSmart for the \"Pet's Rock\" collection, which will debut in 2012. \"As a dedicated pet owners myself, this is a natural partnership for me, and I can\u2019t wait to unveil the collection,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cI know my own pets rock, and I wanted to design a line of pet products every bit as fun and cool as they are.\"\n\nAlso in 2012, Michaels is teaming up with Reader's Digest for their We Hear You America campaign - the popular national, grassroots initiative that serves as a catalyst to empower Americans to help their local communities by casting votes at ReadersDigest.com on behalf of their hometowns. Bret Michaels is the perfect partner for this campaign because he brings his experiences as a survivor, a rocker, a father, a philanthropist, and an American who has traveled this great land by tour bus from coast-to-coast. \"As a musician and an artist, I wanted to get involved in the We Hear You America campaign because it's not only about inspiring people to improve their lives and their communities, but about giving everyone a voice,\" says Michaels. \"It starts with all of you. Go to ReadersDigest.com every day to vote for your hometown. Your votes, joined with others in your community, could get your hometown funds and promotional support from the We Hear You America campaign.\"\n\nBret Michaels may have been in spotlight for decades, but he is certainly showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe official web site: http://www.bretmichaels.com\n\n###\n\nMAKE A DIFFERENCE", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "233 West St, New York, NY 10013", "Artist": "Drew Emmitt", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6066513.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.012344, 40.721325], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Bluegrass, Rock, Country", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "City Vineyard", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cLord you know I\u2019ve been so many places/At least I know I have a longer view\u201d, sings Leftover Salmon lead singer and mandolin player Drew Emmitt over a rollicking mandolin lick on the title track of his third solo effort, Long Road. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the road since the 80\u2019s \u2013 can you believe that?

Hallelujah. Following a decade of success with Leftover Salmon, Emmitt released his first solo effort, Freedom Ride, in 2002 drawing on the talent of peers John Cowan, Peter Rowan, Sam Bush, Ronnie McCoury, Vassar Clements, Stuart Duncan and Randy Scruggs. Critics and fans loved the collaboration and Emmitt relished the chance to record with some of the giants with whom he\u2019d shared festival stages. \u201cIt's amazing,\u201d he said, \u201cit's like walking in a dream\u2026 Standing on stage next to Sam (Bush) is pretty indescribable.\u201d In 2005 he followed up with Across The Bridge, an equally impressive effort showcasing Emmitt\u2019s bluegrass chops and songwriting talents as a straight-ahead bluegrass man.

The band combines the complexity and insight of The Silver Jews with the immediacy, economy, and seaside sensibilities of The Ramones and the softly intricate rhythms of the Caribbean music heard at every bodega in town. Basketball player-poet Johnny Dydo fronts the band, his baritone visions exploding through his grunge-princess regalia leaving fans and passers-by collecting and contemplating shards of pink hair, coded dreams, and bits of seashells whose songs can only be imagined in some integrity long ago crushed by the surf or swept away by the Atlantic. Johnny's persona embodies the apparent contradictions that define the band... masculine and feminine, funny and a little scary, brilliant surface and depths so remote they would be unobservable if not for the clarity and specificity of the plan according to which they are constructed.\nThe Johns have toured extensively in Europe and played at the Egersund Visefestival in Norway and the Down by the River Festival in Berlin.

Even though the duo comprised of Doctur Dot and Johnny Venus are more than capable of pulling off such feats, they are here to instill something simpler. Something bigger. Something that you, the listener, the fan, the artist, the critic may not even realize that you need yet:\n\nFreedom to be yourself.\n\nThat freedom is what attracted the duo to each other when they were students at Southwest Atlanta\u2019s storied Benjamin E. Mays High School. Roaming the same hallways that produced all four members of Goodie Mob decades before them, Earthgang first met each other during an emergency evacuation. After seeing that they had similar tastes in music ranging from Madonna to Madlib, their relationship blossomed from casual conversations about rap to forming a group of their own. But before they even recorded their first project together, they already found themselves hitting the road as they each enrolled at prestigious HBCU Hampton University in Virginia. Though both of them attended the college on academic scholarships with Dot majoring in Psychology and Venus studying to be an architect, they found themselves using the campus as their recording studio.\n\nThe work paid off as Earthgang\u2019s first two projects, 2010\u2019s The Better Party and 2011\u2019s Mad Men landed them shows on both ends of the country at the Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival and Stanford University\u2019s Blackfest. Their follow-up mixtape Good News, backed by energetic live shows, boosted their profile in Atlanta\u2019s congested indie rap scene, but it was their ambitious 2012 debut album Shallow Graves For Toys that captured nationwide attention and peaked at #11 on the Billboard Emerging Artists chart. The wide-ranging project displayed their ability to create with acoustic folk singers like Marian Mereba as well as chest-thumping declarations with producers 808 Mafia (Gucci Mane, Waka Flocka Flame) with Noisey calling it \u201cone of the most well thought-out releases of the year.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur projects are more conceptual than just making songs,\u201d insists Doctur Dot, whose handle is based off his childhood nickname \u201cDoc,\u201d which he earned for always seeming to have answers for everything. \u201cWe are making ourselves vulnerable to the world through our music. Most people don\u2019t allow themselves to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe set out to make the best music that feels the best to us,\u201d adds Johnny Venus, whose name derives from his astrological sign Libra, but challenges the common perception of the symbol by making it asexual. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural synergy for us. We don\u2019t just try to make explosions happen.\u201d\n\nEarthgang\u2019s most recent offering Torba did just that as they showcased their versatility alongside the likes of both Mac Miller and OG Maco over production that ranged from hazy to urgent. That release, coupled with successful tours opening for Ab Soul and Fashawn, Earthgang took another step towards becoming one of the most unique voices in Hip Hop today. Their upcoming album Strays With Rabies (released through their Spillage Village imprint) aims to put their evolving songwriting skills at the forefront after already proving their rap skills to be far above average.\n\nWith a lyrical spectrum that has graduated from \u201choping your mama lose her temper\u201d on Mad Men to \u201cseeing the whole world with my eyes closed\u201d on Torba, Earthgang is rapidly growing into a musical force that will liberate listeners from all walks of life.

With a love of music and skateboarding, Lindell formed a few punky garage bands early on while his musical horizons expanded. He listened to the deep blues of Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Jimmy Reed and Albert King before drifting toward the R&B sounds of The Impressions, Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway, soaking up the soul and learning how to craft a song. After performing at bars on the West Coast with a few short-lived bands, Eric formed his own group in 1993. He quickly gained a loyal Northern California audience thanks to countless performances and many late-night jam sessions. Established stars like Charlie Musselwhite and Tom Waits attended his shows, as did overflow crowds of music fans.\n\nWith music on his mind, Lindell headed to New Orleans in 1999, where he quickly discovered the pulsating and dynamic roots scene. He gravitated toward the West Bank dive bars of Gretna and Algiers, where he befriended many older area musicians who helped him get regular work as a performer. Some of New Orleans' finest players, including keyboardist Ivan Neville and drummers Harold Brown (War), Stanton Moore (Galactic) and Johnny Vidacovich (Professor Longhair, Astral Project) often joined him on stage. Galactic bassist Rob Mercurio began sitting in as well, and word of Lindell's immense talents quickly spread around the city. Stars like Branford Marsalis, The Neville Brothers and John Scofield began showing up at his gigs and embracing this fresh California kid's funky music. According to Lindell, \"It's a great feeling to be recognized for your music in New Orleans.\" Since 2003, in addition to his own gigs, Lindell regularly joins forces with Ivan Neville, Moore and Mercurio (when time and schedules permit) and they perform to overflow crowds as Dragon Smoke.\n\n2006's Change In The Weather delighted and surprised music fans hungry for a truly original artist. Lindell's deceptively simple sounding songs, laid back grooves and hook-laden melodies were fueled by guests including Brown, Neville and Moore. Critics across the country went wild, with reviews and features in Relix, OffBeat, Guitar Player, Down Beat, The New Yorker, The New York Press and many other national and regional publications. Singer And Musician magazine put Eric on the cover and many newspaper entertainment sections did the same.\n\n2007's Low On Cash, Rich In Love and 2009's Gulf Coast Highway pushed Lindell farther into the spotlight. Appearances on Late Night With Conan O'Brien and National Public Radio's Mountain Stage solidified his stature as an artist who simply could not be ignored. Many of his songs have appeared in films and television shows, including Boston Legal and Treme. He has collaborated and shared stages with blues and rock luminaries, including John Fogerty, Luther Dickinson and Anson Funderburgh.\n\nWith Revolution In Your Heart, Lindell was more than ready to come home to Alligator. \"The timing is perfect. I'm so excited to get back to focusing on what I do and have such a great team behind me,\" he says. Upon release of the album, Lindell and his band will tour heavily, reuniting with old friends and, as always, earning new fans at every stop. AllMusic declares Lindell a singular talent, saying, \"He plays soulful, funk-drenched, tight and focused grooves. He is a quadruple threat as a solid songwriter, impressive guitarist, affecting singer and harmonica blower. This is music that's deceptively difficult to create. Lindell makes it seem not just easy, but natural.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Montclair, Montclair, NJ 07042", "Artist": "Adam Najemian - Musician", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8977165.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.221544, 40.816008], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, Folk Music, Guitar And Voice, Slide Blues, Slide Guitar Slinger", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "MC Hotel", "moreBioInfo": "Adam Najemian is a guitarist and singer, specializing in blues music.

La respuesta es \u00e9l mismo, un artista que no tiene miedo a la hora de arriesgar y tomar decisiones importantes para poder vivir de lo que le gusta, la m\u00fasica.\n\nEste joven artista nacido el 28 de junio de 1986 en la ciudad de Chivilcoy, se enamor\u00f3 del rock y de la guitarra a los 8 a\u00f1os al ver un show de los Rolling Stones en Argentina. La figura de Keith Richards lo marc\u00f3 y lo llev\u00f3 a emprender un camino que sigue hasta el d\u00eda de hoy.\n\nA temprana edad, llev\u00f3 el estudio y el conocimiento de la guitarra a tal nivel que llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n de grandes personalidades del instrumento como Diego Mizrahi, que le dio un lugar en su escuela para que diera clases.\n\nPero la vida de conservatorio y de escuela no era todo para Juan, que con apetito de nuevas experiencias se lanz\u00f3 a la ruta con como dice \u00e9l \u201c3 viejos lobos del rock\u201d para poder comenzar no solo a vivir el otro lado de esta profesi\u00f3n sino para poder sentir lo que era trabajar con la m\u00fasica por primera vez. Todos los fines de semana sal\u00eda de gira por el interior del pa\u00eds con el \u00fanico objetivo de tocar y tocar.\n\nTerminada la secundaria, Juan tuvo que tomar su primera gran decisi\u00f3n: querer estudiar m\u00fasica. En sus palabras comenta \u201cNo vengo de una familia de m\u00fasicos, para nada. No puedo decir que cuando era chico escuchaba practicar a mi pap\u00e1 o a mi mam\u00e1 cantar canciones. No, no s\u00e9 lo que es eso. Por este motivo, la discusi\u00f3n con ellos sobre mi futuro, fue dif\u00edcil\u201d. Pero Juan pudo hacer entenderles a sus padres que la m\u00fasica es todo para \u00e9l, y as\u00ed aplic\u00f3 para la ITMC, una escuela terciaria de m\u00fasica ubicada en Saavedra, Buenos Aires, en donde obtuvo una beca completa por un a\u00f1o.\n\nSalir a tocar y al mismo tiempo estudiar, lo llev\u00f3 a conocer mucha gente y a tener diversas experiencia que lo llevaron a entender lo que era tocar para la gente, y para su propio ego. \u201cEntend\u00ed que un m\u00fasico arriba del escenario se tiene que entregar al 100% o por lo menos yo lo creo as\u00ed\u201d, afirma.\n\nPero como todos saben, la vida del m\u00fasico es dif\u00edcil, y mucho m\u00e1s en Argentina. Por eso, por un tiempo Juan debi\u00f3 recurrir a la herencia laboral familiar, trabajar en un banco. Durante 7 largos a\u00f1os debi\u00f3 cumplir un horario pero sin dejar atr\u00e1s su pasi\u00f3n. Mientras contaba plata detr\u00e1s de un mostrador, Juan se dio el lujo de pasar por diversas experiencias musicales, desde bandas de country y western, hasta proyectos de reggae y rock. Ha tocado en lugares m\u00edticos como el Gran Rex, abriendo para bandas como SOJA y\n\nGroundation, junto a Calican Groove, y en el Luna Park teloneando a Ivete Sangalo. Adem\u00e1s, junto a Aitor Gra\u00f1a, le abrieron el show a Manu Chao en el Estadio de Ferro.\n\nLejos de perder la motivaci\u00f3n, comenz\u00f3 a estudiar nuevamente guitarra con Pino Marrone y canto con Susana Rossi. \u201cCon ellos aprend\u00ed a ver mi instrumento y la m\u00fasica desde otra perspectiva. Mas como un pintor que como un m\u00fasico que solo toca por tocar\u201d.\n\nCon mayor confianza, lleg\u00f3 el momento en donde sus primeras composiciones empezaron a aparecer por la necesidad de sacar todo lo que ten\u00eda adentro. Y se hicieron realidad con su proyecto junto a Dami\u00e1n Chavez llamado Moos, con el cu\u00e1l grabaron su primer disco con la producci\u00f3n del gran Tweety Gonz\u00e1lez. Pero al no poder plasmar del todo su m\u00fasica, decidi\u00f3 armar un tri\u00f3 junto a Aitor Gra\u00f1a en bater\u00eda y Yulie Ruth en bajo para grabar \u201cIdas y Vueltas\u201d y \u201cBlow the Truth\u201d, sus dos primeros temas como solista.\n\nPero se avecinaba otra gran decisi\u00f3n en la historia de Juan. Tras meses de venir pensando en esto, decidi\u00f3 agarrar el tim\u00f3n y dar un giro de 360\u00b0 grados en su vida, renunciar al banco e irse a probar suerte a la ciudad de Nueva York. Al principio era solo por 20 d\u00edas que hoy se han convertido en un tiempo indefinido.

La respuesta es \u00e9l mismo, un artista que no tiene miedo a la hora de arriesgar y tomar decisiones importantes para poder vivir de lo que le gusta, la m\u00fasica.\n\nEste joven artista nacido el 28 de junio de 1986 en la ciudad de Chivilcoy, se enamor\u00f3 del rock y de la guitarra a los 8 a\u00f1os al ver un show de los Rolling Stones en Argentina. La figura de Keith Richards lo marc\u00f3 y lo llev\u00f3 a emprender un camino que sigue hasta el d\u00eda de hoy.\n\nA temprana edad, llev\u00f3 el estudio y el conocimiento de la guitarra a tal nivel que llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n de grandes personalidades del instrumento como Diego Mizrahi, que le dio un lugar en su escuela para que diera clases.\n\nPero la vida de conservatorio y de escuela no era todo para Juan, que con apetito de nuevas experiencias se lanz\u00f3 a la ruta con como dice \u00e9l \u201c3 viejos lobos del rock\u201d para poder comenzar no solo a vivir el otro lado de esta profesi\u00f3n sino para poder sentir lo que era trabajar con la m\u00fasica por primera vez. Todos los fines de semana sal\u00eda de gira por el interior del pa\u00eds con el \u00fanico objetivo de tocar y tocar.\n\nTerminada la secundaria, Juan tuvo que tomar su primera gran decisi\u00f3n: querer estudiar m\u00fasica. En sus palabras comenta \u201cNo vengo de una familia de m\u00fasicos, para nada. No puedo decir que cuando era chico escuchaba practicar a mi pap\u00e1 o a mi mam\u00e1 cantar canciones. No, no s\u00e9 lo que es eso. Por este motivo, la discusi\u00f3n con ellos sobre mi futuro, fue dif\u00edcil\u201d. Pero Juan pudo hacer entenderles a sus padres que la m\u00fasica es todo para \u00e9l, y as\u00ed aplic\u00f3 para la ITMC, una escuela terciaria de m\u00fasica ubicada en Saavedra, Buenos Aires, en donde obtuvo una beca completa por un a\u00f1o.\n\nSalir a tocar y al mismo tiempo estudiar, lo llev\u00f3 a conocer mucha gente y a tener diversas experiencia que lo llevaron a entender lo que era tocar para la gente, y para su propio ego. \u201cEntend\u00ed que un m\u00fasico arriba del escenario se tiene que entregar al 100% o por lo menos yo lo creo as\u00ed\u201d, afirma.\n\nPero como todos saben, la vida del m\u00fasico es dif\u00edcil, y mucho m\u00e1s en Argentina. Por eso, por un tiempo Juan debi\u00f3 recurrir a la herencia laboral familiar, trabajar en un banco. Durante 7 largos a\u00f1os debi\u00f3 cumplir un horario pero sin dejar atr\u00e1s su pasi\u00f3n. Mientras contaba plata detr\u00e1s de un mostrador, Juan se dio el lujo de pasar por diversas experiencias musicales, desde bandas de country y western, hasta proyectos de reggae y rock. Ha tocado en lugares m\u00edticos como el Gran Rex, abriendo para bandas como SOJA y\n\nGroundation, junto a Calican Groove, y en el Luna Park teloneando a Ivete Sangalo. Adem\u00e1s, junto a Aitor Gra\u00f1a, le abrieron el show a Manu Chao en el Estadio de Ferro.\n\nLejos de perder la motivaci\u00f3n, comenz\u00f3 a estudiar nuevamente guitarra con Pino Marrone y canto con Susana Rossi. \u201cCon ellos aprend\u00ed a ver mi instrumento y la m\u00fasica desde otra perspectiva. Mas como un pintor que como un m\u00fasico que solo toca por tocar\u201d.\n\nCon mayor confianza, lleg\u00f3 el momento en donde sus primeras composiciones empezaron a aparecer por la necesidad de sacar todo lo que ten\u00eda adentro. Y se hicieron realidad con su proyecto junto a Dami\u00e1n Chavez llamado Moos, con el cu\u00e1l grabaron su primer disco con la producci\u00f3n del gran Tweety Gonz\u00e1lez. Pero al no poder plasmar del todo su m\u00fasica, decidi\u00f3 armar un tri\u00f3 junto a Aitor Gra\u00f1a en bater\u00eda y Yulie Ruth en bajo para grabar \u201cIdas y Vueltas\u201d y \u201cBlow the Truth\u201d, sus dos primeros temas como solista.\n\nPero se avecinaba otra gran decisi\u00f3n en la historia de Juan. Tras meses de venir pensando en esto, decidi\u00f3 agarrar el tim\u00f3n y dar un giro de 360\u00b0 grados en su vida, renunciar al banco e irse a probar suerte a la ciudad de Nueva York. Al principio era solo por 20 d\u00edas que hoy se han convertido en un tiempo indefinido.

Listeners are crying out for something true\u2013\u2013some meaty songs that\u2019ll give us some comfort, even as they cut closer to the bone.\n\n\n\nEveryone is finally ready for the gritty, thundering country Jason Boland and the Stragglers have sharpened over almost 20 years\u2019 worth of selling out roomy venues and commanding stages across the nation. And new album Squelch provides the ideal vehicle.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make something that we're proud of,\u201d lead songwriter and vocalist Boland says. \u201cIf any more people want to take notice of it, they\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince coming together in Stillwater, Oklahoma, Boland and his tightknit crew have sold more than half a million albums independently and earned a devoted following that\u2019s swelled far beyond the band\u2019s red dirt roots. At a Stragglers show, oil patch roughnecks, hippies, college kids, and intelligentsia all sway side-by-side like a traveling reincarnation of Austin\u2019s Armadillo World Headquarters in its cosmic cowboy, Willie Nelson heyday.\n\n\n\nWhile the Stragglers draw from rock and folk, make no mistake: they traffic in unfiltered, unfettered honky-tonk, raw and lean. Equal parts subtle, meditative, and snarling, and often wickedly funny, Squelch is a deeply rooted exercise in exhuming beauty by trading smoke and mirrors for what\u2019s real.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe pay homage, but we don't want to copy or be a throwback act,\u201d Boland says. \u201cAll you can do is try to take the music that inspires you and take it further. And make it personal.\u201d If he has felt any pressure to make his \u201cpersonal\u201d what others have in mind, it doesn\u2019t show. Boland has never constructed an identity or sound for mass or even niche consumption. He is who he is, and he\u2019s all in.\n\n\n\nRecorded at Orb Recording Studios in Austin and mixed at Sonic Ranch in El Paso, Squelch was produced by Jim Ward (At the Drive-In, Sparta, Sleepercar) and marks the band\u2019s eighth time in the studio. Like two previous Stragglers\u2019 albums, debut Pearl Snaps and 2013\u2019s critically acclaimed Dark and Dirty Mile, Squelch was recorded and mixed directly to tape. \u201cIt's one thing when you can say, \u2018Okay, now, engineer, you do your magic,\u2019\u201d Boland says. \u201cThere is no magic when you record and mix to tape. It is what it is. I think it\u2019s a fuller, richer sound. And it\u2019s just more honest.\u201d\n\n\n\nOpener \u201cBreak 19\u201d thumps brazenly, reveling in bassist Grant Tracy\u2019s heart-pounding walks and punctuated by Nick Worley\u2019s whirling fiddle, Brad Rice\u2019s locomotive drumming, and newest Straggler Cody Angel\u2019s achy pedal steel. There\u2019s not a throwaway line to be found, as Boland\u2019s deep baritone rumbles through a sly takedown of modern media and absolute certainty after copping to trying it all the wrong way first and realizing \u201cthe more I see, the less I claim to know.\u201d It\u2019s a fitting introduction to The Stragglers\u2019 signature blend of social consciousness, self-awareness, and swing.\n\n\n\n\u201cI Guess It\u2019s Alright\u201d is classic Boland wordplay layered over a breakneck shot of adrenaline. A rollicking sendup of society\u2019s uneven tolerance for bad behavior, the track roars that for those with power, life is open season and consequences are nil. \u201cI guess it\u2019s alright to be an asshole if you\u2019re good,\u201d he pounds over growling guitar. \u201cFat and Merry\u201d bristles with snark, taking aim at quintessentially American hustle, from suburban flight and gentrification, to waste and nonstop consumption. It\u2019s got to be the only song ever to bemoan \u201ccoffee shops and escalades where escalades and cocaine could be found\u201d with a world-weary fiddle echo. \u201cNobody wants to come off as judgmental, but you have to make judgments,\u201d Boland says. \u201cWith your tongue in your cheek is a nice way to do it. None of us are above reproach. We\u2019re all just having a good day or a bad day, same as everybody else.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFirst to Know\u201d is a love song for adults. \u201cIf my voice sounds scared and frozen, it\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid and cold / And when I am you\u2019ll always be the first to know,\u201d Boland sings, both as an ode to the one who knows him best and a plea for understanding. It\u2019s also a reminder that sometimes, what you see really is what you get, and while that may occasionally disappoint, ultimately, it\u2019s cause for trust and hope.\n\n\n\nAversion to artifice permeates Squelch in just about every way, from the recording process to the album\u2019s themes to Boland himself. \u201cLose Early\u201d is a sauntering rendition of dust to dust and a skewering of the lie that you have to sell your soul to eat, while \u201cDo You Love Me Any Less\u201d questions whether or not absence hinders affection. Written by original Stragglers fiddler Dana Hazzard, haunting and heartbreaking \u201cChristmas in Huntsville\u201d is the only track Boland didn\u2019t pen. Images of Christmas at home flood the imprisoned narrator\u2019s mind as he heads to his holiday-timed execution for a murder he didn\u2019t commit. Closer \u201cFuck, Fight, and Rodeo\u201d kicks out the footlights in a two-minute, hell-in-a-hand-basket hoedown.\n\n\n\nAsked why he feels so compelled to focus on lost causes and society\u2019s ills, Boland explains, \u201cBecause we\u2019ve talked about the rest of it. It\u2019s almost out of obligation\u2013\u2013and it\u2019s an obligation that\u2019s more intense because of the fact that nobody else is talking about it\u2013\u2013some rock, rap, Americana, and folk does. But nobody is doing it the way we do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nBoland just exited his 30s, but he seems older, based on his experiences. He\u2019s lived through alcoholism, a should-have-killed-him car crash, a ruptured vocal chord, and other trials. He wears his hard-won wisdom easily, without ceremony or conceit, and has evolved naturally as a writer, becoming more and more comfortable with his knack for recognizing the universally significant\u2013\u2013even divine\u2013\u2013in the ordinary. \u201cHoly Relic Sale\u201d is a stunning example, and one of the songs that makes Boland most proud. \u201cMy wife\u2019s got a pair of lucky blue socks,\u201d he says. \u201cOne day, we just had an awesome day\u2013\u2013everything went right. We got home, and she pulled the socks out of the dresser and said, \u2018I thought I had these on all day.\u2019 It\u2019s the classic story of \u2018it\u2019s not the things.\u2019 The things are there to remind you to concentrate on the positive facts of life. The little relics that we have are going to wear out or get lost, but the light and the energy are within you.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn stage, Boland leads a raucous party. Off stage, he\u2019s mellow and warm, often wryly philosophical. But no matter where he is, he\u2019s always grateful. \u201cYou play the dimly lit honky tonks of the world and take the music to the people, several at a time,\u201d he says. \u201cSome shows are huge, some shows aren't. You take the good and the bad and you go down the road. And you think, \u2018Isn't that what everybody's going for?\u2019 Well no, it's not. But that's what we look back on and always smile about\u2013\u2013the shaky ground that we've always been on.

After being forced into a two year hiatus due to Lyme Disease, Sonali has come back stronger than ever and hit the ground running. Splitting most of her time between South Florida and NYC, Sonali has just finished a tour with Hollister and High School Nation, shared a bill with Nick Jonas and Zedd, and opened for the headliner, Pitbull, at Florida's acclaimed SunFest Music Festival. In addition to gracing the cover of South Florida's major publication Lifestyle Magazine, Sonali was also the subject of a documentary that aired on JUS Broadcasting, which highlighted her career and journey with Lyme. These notable accomplishments led her to become the 2019 Recipient of the Cultural Ambassador Award, presented by Miss Universe Sushmita Sen in California.\n\nStudying and making music ever since she was a young girl, Sonali\u2019s biggest plunge into the music world came when she was invited to attend the prestigious Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. There, she was afforded the pleasure of working with some of the best in the industry, studying under numerous GRAMMY award-winning professors and music industry veterans such as Questlove, Bob Power (D'Angelo, A Tribe Called Quest), Nick Sansano (Sonic Youth, Public Enemy), and Amund Bj\u00f6rklund (Train). While there, she would also attend guest lectures by Pharrell, Benny Blanco, Rob Thomas, and Stargate. During her college career, Sonali and her classmates collaborated to create a viral cover of Rihanna\u2019s \"Diamonds.\" After being featured on Buzzfeed and by Ryan Seacrest, the video garnered the attention of Rihanna herself, who invited the group to a show in Newark, where she personally congratulated them on their work.\n\nJust as Sonali graduated from NYU and was about to embark on her first tour, she was diagnosed with Chronic Lyme Disease. Instead of spending the next few years on the road and recording as she had planned, she was forced to devote most of her time to recovering and getting back on her feet. As much of a setback as it was, the unintentional break did allow her the time to be introspective and reconsider her career and sound. While at NYU, Sonali learned a great deal about music production, which had opened her eyes to the world of electronic music. Trading in the acoustic guitar for synths and drum machines, Sonali released her follow-up EP Runaway in summer 2019 with producers Eren Cannata and KOIL PreAmple.\n\nThrough this new sound, Sonali hopes to use her platform to help give another voice to Indian-Americans in the entertainment industry. \"My family is from India and that's been a huge part of my upbringing,\" Sonali shares. \"Growing up, I never had anyone on screen or in music that I could look up to in that sense, and I don't want that to be the case for kids today. Indians are finally starting to get a voice in the TV and Film world, and it's about time that spills over into the music industry!\"\n\nWith a new sound and reenergized passion, Sonali is ready to pick up where she left off.\n\nManager: Amit Nerurkar (face-less)\nContact: management@itsmesonali.com", "otherInfo": "Breaking Sound presents SONALI, Bohdi & Dandelot\n\nWe showcase the hottest emerging artists & bands in premium locations around the city. #BreakingSoundNYC\n\nFEATURING -- SONALI, Bohdi & Dandelot\n\n21+.

Her work is at once deeply personal and socially conscious, seriously funny and derisively tragic. Over five albums and a decade of recording, the Denver-born songwriter/guitarist/singer has tackled such topics as the death penalty, anorexia, shoplifting, reproduction, the French resistance movement, adolescence, and the Christian right. Did we mention love? Love found, love lost, love wished for and love taken away.\n\nWhile her songs cover a huge amount of ground, they all have benefit greatly from Jill's subtle intelligence and skillful light-handedness. No sloganeering flag-and-fist waving here, but rather story songs about human beings, real and imagined, which allow us to step back from the issue, be it personal or social, and relate to it as we would a close friend.\n\nTo see Jill live and in concert is a rare treat. It is on stage that she is most comfortable, most powerful, and where the delicacy and range of her work can be best appreciated. She entertains, amuses, provokes, and more often then not, takes her audiences on an emotional roller coaster, from comedy to pathos in a few bars of music.\n\nJill began playing guitar when she joined the Junior High School band. She never learned to read music, though, and faked her way through rehearsals and performances by playing by ear. As she began writing songs, it was very clear to Jill this was becoming more than a teenage hobby. Music was serious stuff. She played in a variety of funk and rock bands in Colorado, and eventually made her first, Todd Rundgren-produced, album for MCA, Things Here Are Different.\n\nBut success did not knock on her door until three years later, when Atlantic Records released her MTV staple and national top 20 hit, I Kissed A Girl. \"That song was a double-edged sword for me,\" Jill Says. \"It was perceived as a novelty hit, but on the other hand it was the first song with an overtly gay topic to be aired on Top 40 radio. I am quite proud of that.\" The self-titled album also yielded another hit song, Supermodel, included in the Clueless soundtrack.\n\nThe song also jumpstarted her live music career in a big way, and since then she's had the honor to induct Neil Diamond in the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, to share the stage with the likes of Neil Young (at his yearly Bridge School benefit concerts), fellow activists Billy Bragg & Steve Earle, and Waren Zevon. Quite the serious guitar player, she even toured the world as lead guitarist in Lloyd Cole's band a few years back.\n\nSince then, she has made four more critically acclaimed albums, Happy Town, Pink Pearl, Underdog Victorious, and 2009's California Years, which Jill released on her own record label, Pinko Records, after collecting over $85,000 from fans who funded the project.\n\nA veritable gypsy, Jill divides her time between a busy touring schedule and a variety of other projects. She has played the role of political troubadour for NPR stations across the country and for Air America Radio. She also served as songwriter/composer for the hit Nickelodeon network show Unfabulous during that show's three-season run. She composed the music for the off-Broadway show Prozak and the Platypus and co-starred in the Eric Schaeffer film Mind the Gap.\n\nIn the words of New York Times pop music critic Jon Pareles, \"Jill Sobule can claim her place among the stellar New York singer-songwriters of the last decade. Topical, funny and more than a little poignant ... grown-up music for an adolescent age.\"", "otherInfo": "Hosted by Randy Cohen, Person Place Thing is an interview show based on this idea: people are particularly engaging when they speak not directly about themselves but about something they care about.

Over the past several years, Butler\u2019s live shows have been a showcase of brilliant improvisation and beautiful electronic music. Groove-driven but given to richly textured sound design, rhythmically fractured but melodically sumptuous, Johnny Butler\u2019s music is a bridge between the past and the present, bringing the artist face-to-face with a creative legacy that spans decades. On Raise it Up, Butler seamlessly alternates between saxophone, looping, and samples, building a nearly infinite palate of planetary and interplanetary sonics merged into a Frankenstein\u2019s monster-ish list of styles and influences Looking back, his full-length debut Carousel (voted \u201cBest of 2013\u201d by Jazz Journalists Association) appears to be much more of a mission statement than a simple introduction- laying the foundation for a field on which a brand new sound would soon be born. While Carousel was an introspective, moody travelogue through the Brooklyn cityscape, it certainly hinted at Johnny Butler\u2019s inclination to expand beyond terrestrial means. \"After dabbling with resonances from John Coltrane and Miles Davis and enveloping his processed saxophone sound in cavernous reverb, Brooklyn-based Johnny Butler turns a polyphony of overdubbed horns (triggered by laptop) into Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis machine.\" \u2014\u2009DownBeat Magazine Johnny has played at Bonnaroo, Mountain Jam, Bear Creek, Gathering of the Vibes, Telluride Jazz, Voodoo Fest in New Orleans, helped write and record the tenor and baritone saxophone parts on Beyonce\u2018s album 4, played with tUnE-yArDs at Summer Stage in New York, Donald Fagen (Steely Dan) and Warren Haynes at a Midnight Ramble at Levon Helm\u2019s Studio, Govt Mule at the Beacon Theater in New York, Joe Lally (Fugazi), Strangefolk at StrangeCreek, La La Brooks of Phil Spector\u2019s Crystals, The Skeletons Big Band, worked with Grammy-award winner and former American Idol Judge Randy Jackson at Jim Henson Studios in Los Angeles, and has opened up for Stevie Wonder, The Avett Brothers, Dr. John, Fitz and the Tantrums, Counting Crows, moe., Soulive, Sharon Jones and Dap Kings, Trombone Shorty, and the Funky Meters.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\n\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\n\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\n\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers. While he may be considered as part of a new generation of \"multilingual\" musicians which have grown up studying classical, jazz and Latin American music, Edward is inventing a language that transcends any rigid genre.", "otherInfo": "Saxophonist Bobby Watson began his career with Art Blakey\u2019s Jazz Messengers, later becoming the musical director of the quintessential group.

Made from years of traveling the world and honing his craft and moving effortlessly through several musical genres without a single tune sounding the same. Seriously good songwriting that\u2019s augmented by what many are calling the best seven piece band in New York. All led by Chapell - Mephistopheles outfitted in a well-tailored white linen suit.\n\nGrowing up on the \u201cmean streets\u201d of Stamford, Connecticut, Alan Chapell was something of a musical wunderkind - playing piano and trumpet before the age of six. He recorded with the legendary Jimmy Ienner at age 15, and more recently with Talking Head Jerry Harrison. He\u2019s played to jam-packed houses around the world from Mumbai to Managua. It took Chapell a while to get here, but audiences across the U.S. are starting to take notice in a big way.\n\nChapell\u2019s band includes Lorenza Ponce on violin, Ann Klein on guitar, Ali Culotta on piano, Malcom Gold on bass and Rodney Howard on drums. Ponce plays a variety of delicious retro-synth lines which both play off of and play with Klein\u2019s guitar work. There are multiple moving parts that all go together a bit differently depending on the song (and Chapell\u2019s mood.)\n\nChapell\u2019s live show is a cacophony of juxtapositions. His set moves seamless from genre to genre and from topic to topic. From songs about love to songs about more heady topics such as gun violence and human rights. And finally, to a parody of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent Congressional testimony. With all that, Chapell somehow manages to keep things fun \u2013 not to mention you are guaranteed to leave the night with at least a few of Chapell\u2019s melodies stuck in your head.\n\nOn making music in 2019 Chapell now says, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m discovering myself as an artist in a way I never could have earlier in my life.

The album announces Regen as a formidable talent with the rarest of gifts - an original voice that speaks to the human condition with authority and hope. Regen\u2019s songs define our times, but are meant to last for all time.\n\nRegen knows a thing or two about navigating the unexpected. Coming of age in the 1980s, he nourished himself on a steady diet of MTV and synth pop. And while he could have spent his life in search of New Wave glory, he instead moved to New York City and became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of jazz piano great Kenny Barron, toured with artists like Little Jimmy Scott and Kyle Eastwood, and slowly carved-out a name for himself as a solo artist who defied easy categorization.\n\nLike Bruce Hornsby before him, Regen creates infectious melodies that often belie the music\u2019s harmonic sophistication. Like Randy Newman, he draws on the richness of the American musical vernacular, distilling an ocean into a creek the artist can call his own. It\u2019s on the axis of those seemingly diverse worlds that Jon Regen\u2019s sound is born. It's also on the axis of differing worlds that Higher Ground sprang to life.\n\nHaving experienced a new level of artistic success following his critically-acclaimed 2015 album Stop Time (produced by Mitchell Froom and featuring members of Elvis Costello\u2019s Imposters), Regen wasn\u2019t eager to rush into the studio for a follow-up. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t going to make a record of just any songs, produced just any way,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI never gave up the idea of recording again, but I knew I didn\u2019t want to make the same album I did last time. I wanted to be inspired.\u201d\n\nParenthood helped Regen meditate on several factors. \u201cI wondered if, in this new divided world \u2013 and in this era of instant internet fame, if music still resonated the way I remembered it could.\u201d\n\nWith no stream of roadwork planned (he was too busy being a full-time dad), Regen played local shows around New York City and dug into his work as the Editor of Keyboard Magazine. \u201cFor the first time in decades, I had a regular jazz gig,\u201d he says. \u201cI became reacquainted with the piano in a way I hadn\u2019t been able to while I was constantly touring. I also threw myself into my writing work, relishing the chance to explore the inspiration behind otherpeople\u2019s music.\u201d Then in September 2018, Jamiroquai\u2019s Matt Johnson invited Regen to the group\u2019s gig at the Forest Hills Tennis Center in Queens, New York.\n\nThe location proved remarkable: Regen\u2019s parents had lived on the same street during the 1960s. Possibly more remarkable was the gig itself: \u201cI saw 14,000 people dancing to funk music in the New York rain that night, and my faith in the healing power of music was instantly restored.\u201d\n\nWhen Regen and Johnson met at the afterparty, they hit it off instantly, despite being something of an unlikely pairing. \u201cMatt\u2019s a proper British synth whiz, and I\u2019m a gravely-voiced New York singer/songwriter. But I thought, \u2018Maybe there\u2019s something to this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe pair wrote the song \u201cWide Awake\u201d as a way of testing the waters - with Johnson in London and Regen at home in New York City. And despite the distance, the duo struck creative magic. \u201cIt was just this great marriage of Matt\u2019s studio wizardry and my songwriting and piano styles,\u201d Regen explains. \u201cFunnily enough, that song would never have been born had I not bought an old Roland Juno-60 synthesizer and started fooling around with it on top of my Steinway grand piano. But once I did, I knew I was onto something fresh. It was a sound that was new to me, so I chased it.\u201d\n\nJohnson says, \u201cWhen he sent me his idea, I was struck by the rich quality of his voice. As the track progressed, I learned that Jon could also play great jazz piano. For me, this album shows off all the best in Jon - great songs, great piano and a truly distinctive voice.\u201d\n\nBut a lingering question remained: Could the duo record an entire album without anyone ever playing in the same place at the same time? They were about to find out.\n\nFor Regen, making the album became a mission unto itself, regardless of the challenges the pair faced. \u201cI wrote lyrics while my son watched \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 and recorded piano and vocals in my apartment while he napped,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore we knew it, the project was materializing before our eyes.\u201d\n\nNo stranger to formidable companions, Regen enlisted an all-star cast that reads like the lineup of a supergroup; keyboardists Benmont Tench, Chuck Leavell, Ricky Peterson (David Sanborn, Fleetwood Mac) and Matt Rollings (Lyle Lovett, Willie Nelson,) signed-on, as did Duran Duran\u2019s Nick Rhodes.\n\n\u201cFor someone who used to air drum to Rio as a kid, hearing Nick\u2019s synth work on my music was positively surreal,\u201d Regen says. \u201cIn a lot of ways, this record is about the moment when your heroes become your peers.\u201d\n\nTench says that there was never a second thought about lending his talents to the album. \u201cNot only is Jon an annoyingly great piano player,\u201d the veteran keyboardist says, \u201che isn\u2019t sitting still in the songwriting department, either: this is a laudable leap forward in both style and expression.\u201d\n\nHaving scored a premiere rhythm section for his previous album, Regen was once again drawn to top players like bassists Larry Klein (Joni Mitchell) and Tim Lefebvre (David Bowie, Tedeschi Trucks Band), and drummers Keith Carlock (Steely Dan) and Jerry Marotta (Peter Gabriel). Previous Regen collaborators like guitarists Andy Summers (The Police) and George Marinelli (Bonnie Raitt) return here, as do cellist Julia Kent and Swiss harmonica ace Gr\u00e9goire Maret. And as impressive as the guest list on Higher Ground is, what\u2019s even more miraculous is that every musician played his or her parts in their respective hometowns. The entire album was recorded remotely, across different cities, oceans and countries.\n\nListening to Higher Ground, it\u2019s not hard to imagine what led musical luminaries to join in. The album strikes the perfect balance between gravity and levity, between deep introspection and knowing when to cast worries aside and get down to celebrating the moment.\n\nThe album opener \u201cWide Awake\u201d gives us a glimpse of the myriad of styles Regen pulls from. Funky, R&B grooves collide with jazz and pop flourishes, and lyrics that never overstate the tune\u2019s status as a love song. And the title track \u201cHigher Ground\u201d sounds like something culled from an earlier time and, perhaps, like John Hiatt\u2019s \u201cHave a Little Faith\u201d not just a song but a hymn to the heart. \u201cThat one is for my son,\u201d Regen remarks. \u201cThe lyric, \u2018I\u2019m a better man now, \u2018cause I stand on higher ground\u2019 is about him showing me what\u2019s really important in this world. The title became a mantra for the entire album, pushing me to elevate my singing, songwriting and piano playing at every turn.\u201d\n\nAs good as he is at walking in the alleyways of America\u2019s musical past, Regen moves himself into the contemporary via the socially-conscious \u201cWho Cares If Everybody Else Knows.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a lyric that all right-minded people can relate to,\u201d Johnson says, \u201cand I feel it\u2019s where I took Jon furthest from his comfort zone musically. The track sounds completely modern and Nick put in some really interesting sounds at the end to finish it off.\u201d\n\nOn other tracks, Regen\u2019s piano mastery is firmly on display. \u201cHole in My Heart\u201d features a dreamy, triple-tracked piano solo that channels the best of early Bowie and later Hornsby. The libidinous, New Orleans-inflected \u201cEvery Night\u201d recalls Dr. John at his swampiest. And \u201cEast Side Blues\u201d pits Regen\u2019s blues-drenched piano against the street noise of his native New York City, marrying humor with high musical art.\n\nOne song, \u201cThe Last to Go,\u201d bridges Regen\u2019s recent past with the music of his youth. \u201cBenmont played on that one and recorded the organ at Mitchell Froom\u2019s studio in Los Angeles,\u201d Regen explains. \u201cMitchell produced my last album, Stop Time, and played the first organ solo I ever heard, on Crowded House\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over.\u2019 And so the circle completes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Last to Go\u201d not only summarizes many of the album\u2019s themes, it\u2019s also unquestionably a new high in Regen\u2019s compositional output. \u201cIt was the last song I wrote for the album,\u201d he says. \u201cI was up late in New York City one night, thinking about the album and my approaching birthday \u2013 of where I have been, and where I still hope to go. I traced my life back through big events, and more personal earthquakes. And of course, with the world we live in now full of disinformation and vitriol, we all look for a guiding light. My wife is that for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter I wrote that song, I called Benmont to play organ on it. Because nobody can move air on a Hammond like Ben. He also had his daughter on the exact same day I had my son, and I had a feeling he feels about his wife the way I do about mine.\u201d\n\nThe balance between light and dark heard on the album is not lost on Regen. \u201cLooking back at the album now, I see it\u2019s full of both optimism and fear,\u201d he says. \u201cSongs like \u2018Wide Awake\u2019 and \u2018Higher Ground\u2019 speak to the power of love and family and the happiness they bring. But songs like \u2018Who Cares If Everybody Else Knows\u2019 and \u2018Before\u2019 are darker. They are me grappling with the madness of life as a new parent in 2019 \u2013 where no one seems to stand for anything besides greed and power. Those are tough sentiments to reconcile. In the end, I suppose life is about just that \u2013 how to explain the unexplainable.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "61 Atlantic St, Stamford, CT 06901", "Artist": "Ron White", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9619098.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.539753, 41.054535], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Palace Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "445 Albee Square W, Brooklyn, NY 11201", "Artist": "Liz Barrett", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8744485.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98736, 40.692], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy, Standup Comedy", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Dekalb Market Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Liz Barrett is a New-York based stand-up comedian and writer.

Not the types to shy away from a challenge, they took up an unusual, near-futuristic tactic.\n\nInstead of getting together to write and record, the Transatlantic five-piece set up an online hub for their homemade demos. They tasked each other with delivering a set number of songs per week \u2013 each of which the other band members could modify at will. \u201cI think we all knew the intensity of how good we wanted to make the record.\u201d says drummer Olly Peacock. Many months were committed to focusing these musical chain letters. Over 50 compositions whittled down and blended.\n\nThe resulting tight, 10-song long-player was perfected in two ten-day sessions in Charlottesville, VA with longtime friend Sam Farrar (Phantom Planet) whose role was strongly editorial \u201cUnlike other producers we've worked with, in Sam we had somebody who was familiar with our entire back catalog, and knew what it was that we were going after,\u201d says Tom Gray. \u201cHe could help us achieve our aims even better than we could ourselves.\u201d This return to a form of self-production seems to have allowed Gomez to incorporate the lush pop of recent records like How We Operate with the free-form feel of early, beloved Gomez albums like Bring it On.\n\nThis is a record in glorious Technicolor; the sound of a band enjoying themselves\u2026not alone though. The other musicians on the record include Luke Steele (Empire of the Sun, Sleepy Jackson) and Stuart Bogie (Antibalas, TV on the Radio, Iron and Wine). Whatever's On Your Mind shares a lineage with In Our Gun, thanks to both a preponderance of strings and horns (check out the brass on the opening track, \u201cOptions\u201d, the punctuation-abetted, groovy \u201cI Will Take You There,\u201d and the seasonal swells of the pre-chorus to \u201cX-Rays\u201d) and an electronic dance-aspect that always carries along with it some sort of guitar chunkiness. (\u201cSong In My Heart\u201d begins almost Gaga-esque before its keyboard lick is replicated by a strummed acoustic). At 38 minutes it's Gomez's shortest album to date, there is no fat on the disc.\n\nStill, it maintains Gomez's trademarks: Ben Ottewell's gritty vocals tear through the carefully arranged background harmonies of \u201cThe Place and The People,\u201d while bassist Paul \u201cBlackie\u201d Blackburn's overdriven bass gives a near-African beat to \u201cEqualize,\u201d and \u201cJust as Lost As You\u201d finds Ball yearning and introspective, while somehow still sounding hopefully positive, as the band explodes behind him in a memorable, throttling thrust. The title track alone should convince you that this is a band reaching further than they have before to achieve a balance in their work between musical exploration and lyrical content. The songwriting is adult, but the spirit is freewheeling.\n\nThe change of pace and influx of creativity has helped the band find themselves again. \"Sometimes we might have been a little trapped by our own muso-ness\" says Gray, \"but this album is liberating. It doesn't feel at all stuffy. It's a real joy.\" Whatever\u2019s On Your Mind finds Gomez driving forward on a beautifully lush and dynamic album. There is a fresh feeling of rebirth and awakening.

Liberio didn\u2019t always think that a career in music was possible, but he does now. After stints on The Voice Season 4, honing his craft on Vancouver-based cruise ships, and sharing the stage with Justin Bieber, this vocalist and multi-instrumentalist has created a sound of his own.\n\nAnd after playing over 300 shows in 2014 and continuing that streak into 2015, he\u2019s building a fanbase for his loop-based performances and unique style. Often performing a mix of originals and covers, Liberio looks beyond Top 40 and searches for songs both new and old that have the same feel. He also knows his strengths, and blends these songs to fit his aesthetic while maintaining the [core] of each song. An avid music listener, he enjoys blending genres and describes his music as \u201cAdele meets EDM with a hip hop beat\u201d.\n\nLiberio is now known for using a loop pedal and building a band around himself, but it wasn\u2019t always that way. After building a band for a gig but the players not working out long-term, he took inspiration from Ed Sheeran\u2019s approach to a live show. He bought a loop pedal and began learning how to integrate it into his gigs, often sharing with concert-goers how he builds his backing band: himself.\n\nTaking inspiration from a wide variety of musicians and songwriters has helped Liberio create his unique sound. Artists like Billy Joel, Whitney Houston, Chris Cornell, and Adam Levine have inspired him in different ways, and he\u2019s used that to write music that stands out.\n\nHe\u2019s currently working on an EP of originals, \u201cDichotomy\u201d, that he is producing himself. It will feature primarily new music, but also some older music that he\u2019s previously never produced. 2016 will also feature playing multiple shows a week, sometimes with a full band and sometimes continuing his loop-based solo show.\n\nJ. Liberio is the example of a singer/songwriter with the drive, passion, and work ethic it takes to be seen in a busy music landscape. \u201cDichotomy\u201d is described as \u201ca division or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different\u201d, which is how Liberio has created his music to stand out.\n\nConnect with him on Soundcloud, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Sara Schaefer", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9620799.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988348, 40.735421], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Upstairs at The Stand", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Too Many Cooks!"}, {"Address": "8 Park St, Montclair, NJ 07042", "Artist": "Falling Through The Center Of The Earth", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6314666.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.21896, 40.81543], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: Music", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Meatlocker", "moreBioInfo": "\"Interchange I\" out now on Itunes! \"The Science Of Perception\" now available everywhere! www.fallingthroughthecenteroftheearth.com follow us everywhere! @fttcoteband", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2021 Adam Clayton Powell Jr Blvd, New York, NY 10027", "Artist": "Taru Alexander", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9026337.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.949878, 40.806407], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "Genres: jazz", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Paris Blues", "moreBioInfo": "Taru Alexander is an American jazz drummer, born and raised in Brooklyn, New York.

Artists across the board have discovered Jacobs\u2019 musicianship and supple versatility, resulting in an impressive variety of formats in which he has played over the last few years. After a decade, five records, and 200 shows a year as principal songwriter and frontman for beloved Baltimore-based band The Bridge from 2001-2011, Jacobs wasted no time continuing to write music of his own and exploring different configurations for his craft. He released his debut solo album, Songs for Cats and Dogs, in 2012, and continued to perform relentlessly, both with his new band and as a solo artist. In doing so, he quickly garnered the admiration of a variety of predecessors and peers: rock legend Steve Winwood saw Jacobs perform in 2014 and soon invited him to open his national tour. The following year, Sturgill Simpson extended the same invitation. Never limited by genre, Jacobs and New Orleans heavyweight Ivan Neville recorded a collaborative album under the band name \u201cNeville Jacobs\u201d, which will be released in 2017. As an adapting, evolving, versatile musician who has survived on his own merit, Jacobs continues to win over audiences of many tastes, as he brings his characteristic authenticity and soul to every set.\n\nJacobs feels there are common threads across many genres of music, and he has harnessed over a decade of trans-genre exploration on his second solo album, Dust to Gold, released in 2016, from American Showplace Music. The album is a soul-stirring expression of the current chapter of his creative evolution, featuring twelve well-crafted songs that masterfully weave through the sweet and rugged landscape of soul, country, folk, blues, gospel, and rock and roll. Through every turn, one can easily feel Jacobs\u2019 reverence to his influences, but the result is an original, eclectic record with a sound that is authentically his. In a given moment, Jacobs\u2019 guitar playing is gritty, soulful, rich, and lyrical. It\u2019s subtle, yet adventurous. His voice is at once sweet and sultry, with a honeyed whiskey croon that delivers his thoughtful, expressive lyrics.\n\nI know that the well I seek is bound to be the deepest of all been ever told I know that to plant a seed is alchemy, we can watch the dust turn into gold\n\nSo sings the hypnotic refrain in \u201cTurn Into Gold\u201d, a meditative slide-guitar rocker where Jacobs sings about channeling the muse, or \u201ctapping the source\u201d, as he calls it. It\u2019s about the desire to be \u201cenraptured in the mystery, the unknown, the questions, the answers all at once,\u201d Jacobs describes. This is the place in which his songwriting occurs, and from where Jacobs\u2019 performances derive so much electricity. In discussing the song\u2019s inspiration, Jacobs reflects, \u201cif I\u2019m playing or singing and I\u2019m really connected to that source and I\u2019m really locked in and there\u2019s a room full of people experiencing that, the hope is then for them to get locked into their own thing, and it\u2019s this beautiful, ecstatic magic that happens. To me, this is that elusive goal that I chase every time I sit down to write a song or every time I get on stage to perform.\u201d\n\nOther songs on Dust to Gold paint Jacobs\u2019 desire to express the beauty and struggle of the human condition. In \u201cCold Carolina\u201d, Jacobs pleads softly and emotively about a despondent relationship, the feeling of displacement, and the seeking of redemption, of salvation. In \u201cLittle Dreamer\u201d, Jacobs, accompanied by his wife, Kat Jacobs, sings sweetly to their unborn child, whom he discovered was on the way only moments before leaving to start recording the album. \u201cIt\u2019s a blink of an eye, this life / tiny grains in sands of time / so tie your purposes on wings and fly to the heavens with the grace and courage of a thousand kings\u201d, he sings to the tiny, nascent being.\n\nThe opening track, \u201cThe Devil or Jesse James\u201d, is a rousing mixture of New Orleans rhythm, blues, and rock and roll with ethereal tendrils of psychedelic guitar reaching out across the soundscape; painting a tale of a man trying to change identities and run away from one\u2019s past. On the album, the full band includes a richly funky rhythm section, featuring Todd\n\nHerrington on bass, Dusty Ray Simmons on drums, as well as John Ginty on Hammond organ and keyboards, who has been a master side man for years, working with Robert Randolph and the Family Band, Jewel, Citizen Cope; and most currently tours with the Dixie Chicks.\n\nThough \u201cDust to Gold\u201d clearly showcases Jacobs\u2019 well-worn songwriting chops, he is an improviser at heart, and he brings the spirit of seeking and living in the moment to the stage each time. In every performance, he tries to push the envelope, exploring the depth of each song anew. Whether live or on the album, Jacobs\u2019 dynamic voice and guitar envelope the listener completely and instantly, transporting you into the rich, sultry folds of his soulful sound.\n\nCris Jacobs continues to nurture a devoted audience that knows that whatever the instrumentation or setting he plays, it will be richly authentic, and conveyed with an improviser\u2019s curious spirit and palpable presence. We can only expect further evolution from Jacobs, an artist constantly inspired by the search for \u201cthose beautiful, sad, inspiring, heartbreaking magical corners of life. The most rewarding, and terrifying part of trying to be an artist is the journey itself, the vulnerability and riskiness in seeking them out trying to express them. Sometimes you hit dead ends, and sometimes you strike pure gold.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Cris Jacobs - Rockwood Stage 2"}, {"Address": "116 E 16th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Jeff Leach", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.988348, 40.735421], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Jeff Leach, Ian Lara, Aaron Berg, & More!"}, {"Address": "167 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Richard Castle", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.988702, 40.72133], "Date": "Thu Feb 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Slipper Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "An elegant evening of booze, laffs, & boobs.

Since then he has recorded and released 2 albums, and is currently working on his 3rd. In March of 2014 Frank was named Skype / Microsofts Music Brand Ambassador which led him to participate on a panel at TED 2014 with fellow artist Amanda Palmer. Frank's distinctive voice and remarkable knack for expressing an endless gamut of emotions continue to garner him much deserved acclaim.

Over the last 25 years, the four time Grammy-nominated DJ and producer has been astounding audiences across the world with his fusions of house, hip-hop, Latin, jazz, funk & soul, reggae, alternative pop and broken beats. By releasing literally thousands of original tracks and hundreds of remixes, Kenny has earned a reputation as a living encyclopedia of beats as both a solo artist, and as one-half of the legendary house duo, Masters At Work. At an early age, Kenny began absorbing the hip-hop beats being played at local house and block parties in Sunset Park, Brooklyn where he grew up. He began his musical career as a buyer for a local record shop called WNR Music Center, where he broadened his musical knowledge and found his love of \u201cdiggin\u201d for records. To date, Kenny\u2019s collection totals over 50,000 records. In the late 80\u2019s, Mike Delgado, a good friend and partner of Kenny\u2019s, organized a series of parties under the alias Masters At Work which the two of them would play at. Brooklyn DJ/producer Todd Terry attended these parties, and soon after, Kenny would cut school to watch Todd work on beats and record with singers and rappers. The combination of working at the store, learning how records were produced, and being around creative people influenced Kenny to begin his own productions. He then met King Grand (Russell Cole) and the two formed a group called KAOS. In 1987, Kenny and Todd produced the group\u2019s album titled Courts In Session, which was released the next year on Gregg Fore\u2019s label Bad Boy Records. Over time, Kenny had built up the Masters At Work brand from its party-origins, and in 1987 the club hits \u201cAlright Alright\u201d and \u201cDum Dum Cry\u201d were released by Todd Terry under the Masters At Work name. In return for the releases, Todd introduced Kenny to \u201cLittle\u201d Louie Vega, another talented young Bronx DJ. In 1990, Kenny and Louie officially began a creative partnership, appropriately dubbed Masters At Work (MAW), and their sound quickly became a force in the clubs. They were soon sought after by artists and labels, and eventually remixed everyone from Michael Jackson and Luther Vandross, to Madonna and Daft Punk. With Louie influenced by salsa, house and freestyle and Kenny by hip-hop and reggae, the two went on to become labeled by many as the most revolutionary house production team of the 90\u2019s. In 1993, Kenny and Louie collaborated on a project called Nuyorican Soul, which was named after their heritage (Puerto Rican), residence (New York City), and style of music (Soul). During a MAW gig at the Southport Weekender festival in England, Kenny was inspired by the dancers in the jazz room and had an idea for a syncopated beat style of music, which he dubbed the \u201cbroken beat\u201d style. Nuyorican Soul released its first single \u201cThe Nervous Track\u201d on Nervous Records shortly after, which became the first broken beat record ever released. In this time frame, not only did Kenny collaborate with Louie on MAW projects, he also produced and remixed tracks in the hip-hop and reggae scene. \u201cGet Up (Clap Your Hands)\u201d and \u201cThe Madd Racket\u201d were huge club tracks, and he also produced the Unreleased Project which featured Shaggy on the Gunshot\u201d track. Kenny\u2019s breakthrough as a solo artist came in 1995. One night, disheartened by the music that was being released throughout the business, Kenny went home and pulled out a series of classic records, and after three days he\u2019d produced an entire album, The Bucketheads. This was a huge turning point for him, as one track on the album, \u201cThe Bomb (These Sounds Fall Into My Mind)\u201d broke through the European pop charts and became his first major solo hit. Under different aliases, Kenny went on to release numerous projects on influential labels like Strictly Rhythm, Freeze, Nervous, Henry Street Records and TNT. Starting in 2000, and over the next decade, Kenny also went on to create classic remixes for the likes of R. Kelly, Shirley Bassey, The Jackson 5, DJ Gregory, Aaliyah, Soul Fuzion, and Kanye West. Alongside being a DJ and producer, Kenny also holds the title of record label owner. Frank Mendez of Nu Groove Records gave him his first label Dopewax, so that he\u2019d have an outlet to release anything he wanted. Kenny kept the label going after Nu Groove closed its doors, and it\u2019s been a consistent outlet of house music to this day. Initially, the releases were primarily raw, tracky, beat records produced by Kenny. He then started going into the vocal side of things, and even released remixes of Kanye West and Jill Scott tracks on the label. Demos started to come in, and now Dopewax is open to other artists & producers along with Kenny\u2019s music. Kenny has another label, Kay-Dee Records, which focuses on re-recording and releasing rare and classic music: everything from funk, soul & breaks, to gospel and movie soundtracks. It was initially born out of a challenge from Scottish DJ legend Keb Darge, who wanted to come up with a funk version of MAW\u2019s \u201cThe Nervous Track\u201d. Keb came back a short while later with \u201cNervous\u201d by The New Mastersounds, which would be the first release on Kay-Dee. The idea for Kay-Dee then became to record new productions with classic recording techniques. Kenny sought out to find old masters and produce entirely new mixes of them. Not to remix, but to mix down the original and create new masters to give collectors and DJ\u2019s a completely new version. Kay-Dee Records is a true haven for those with a passion for rare \u201creal\u201d music, and a deep love for vinyl. Aside from his own artist projects, Kenny has been a producer for a slew of other artists. For nearly fifteen years, he has produced music for R&B singer Raheem De Vaughn. Kenny produced eleven tracks on Raheem\u2019s 2011 album Love & War Masterpeace, which was Grammy-nominated for Best R&B Album Of The Year. Featured artists of those tracks include Ludacris, Wale, Damian Marley, Jill Scott and Anthony Hamilton. Two of Kenny\u2019s latest projects include producing rapper Rasheed Chappell\u2019s Future Before Nostalgia album, and also putting together a 12-piece funk & soul band called The Fantastic Souls. Throughout his career, Kenny admits there were times when he wasn\u2019t inspired to create music because of what was dominating the new direction of sound. However, learning to listen without prejudice has allowed him to continue to discover new styles, artists and musicians, and keep his love for the music alive. Kenny stays inspired and motivated not by doing what he likes, but doing what he loves. This is what makes his music timeless. Look out for him on tour this summer in Ibiza and throughout the rest of the world, and for new upcoming releases on his Dopewax imprint.

Along the way, the stories she has collected of love, lust, passion, death, heartbreak, humorous moments and characters found their way into her melodic, fiery, sensual, dramatic compositions, which in turn found their way onto four albums, multiple singles, TV shows like \u201cDance Moms\u201d (8 songs and counting), NBC promos, a Sundance film (DARE), radio and advertisements.\n\nAnd whether she\u2019s playing the piano onstage at one of NYC\u2019s fabled clubs, singing or voicing commercials (Capitol One, Kohls, Homegoods, Maybelline, Snickers) or writing for other pop acts, those who know her expect her signature wit, humor and romance no matter which endeavor she\u2019s taking on.\n\nLook for Cassandra's soon-to-be-released EP, \"Onward\", in Summer 2016.\nRecently, Cassandra worked with John Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls and Mary Ramsey of 10,000 Maniacs to release \"Not So Different\", a song for Autism benefitting the Institute for Autism Research. You can find the song on itunes and Google Play listed under \"Not So Different\" by Ladies First feat. John Rzeznik. All proceeds go to Autism programs.\n\nCassandra\u2019s most recent album Just Being Myself, features the oft-licensed title track (NBC; Real Housewives of Miami; Kendra on Top; Big Women, Big Lives) and \u201cJe T\u2019aime\u201d, a sweepingly romantic collaboration with pop trumpeter Chris Botti, as well as an inventive cover of Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cBad Romance\u201d and 13 other originals. Prior to that, Cassandra\u2019s releases ranged from 2005\u2019s debut EP Hiding Underneath to a live double album recorded in Nashville, Live at Camp Nashville, plus singles like \u201cSwim\u201d (for Lifetime\u2019s hit show \u201cDance Moms\u201d).

Liberio didn\u2019t always think that a career in music was possible, but he does now. After stints on The Voice Season 4, honing his craft on Vancouver-based cruise ships, and sharing the stage with Justin Bieber, this vocalist and multi-instrumentalist has created a sound of his own.\n\nAnd after playing over 300 shows in 2014 and continuing that streak into 2015, he\u2019s building a fanbase for his loop-based performances and unique style. Often performing a mix of originals and covers, Liberio looks beyond Top 40 and searches for songs both new and old that have the same feel. He also knows his strengths, and blends these songs to fit his aesthetic while maintaining the [core] of each song. An avid music listener, he enjoys blending genres and describes his music as \u201cAdele meets EDM with a hip hop beat\u201d.\n\nLiberio is now known for using a loop pedal and building a band around himself, but it wasn\u2019t always that way. After building a band for a gig but the players not working out long-term, he took inspiration from Ed Sheeran\u2019s approach to a live show. He bought a loop pedal and began learning how to integrate it into his gigs, often sharing with concert-goers how he builds his backing band: himself.\n\nTaking inspiration from a wide variety of musicians and songwriters has helped Liberio create his unique sound. Artists like Billy Joel, Whitney Houston, Chris Cornell, and Adam Levine have inspired him in different ways, and he\u2019s used that to write music that stands out.\n\nHe\u2019s currently working on an EP of originals, \u201cDichotomy\u201d, that he is producing himself. It will feature primarily new music, but also some older music that he\u2019s previously never produced. 2016 will also feature playing multiple shows a week, sometimes with a full band and sometimes continuing his loop-based solo show.\n\nJ. Liberio is the example of a singer/songwriter with the drive, passion, and work ethic it takes to be seen in a busy music landscape. \u201cDichotomy\u201d is described as \u201ca division or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different\u201d, which is how Liberio has created his music to stand out.\n\nConnect with him on Soundcloud, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "315 West 44th St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Birdland Big Band", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.989689, 40.759], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:30 PM", "Venue": "Birdland", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Come kick start your weekend with The Birdland Big Band!

Produced by Sahaj Ticotin and Howard Benson, September Mourning revives the concept of rock star meets superhero. If Marilyn Manson and X-Men's Storm had a kid, it would be September Mourning, who also cites influences as varied as Motionless In White, Disturbed, and Muse.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor me, the project is a story, a theatrical art piece,\u201d September explains. \u201cMusic is the backbone, but for this to work, it has to include the imagery and the narrative all symbiotically linked into the whole. Music taps into your innermost being. There\u2019s something very intimate and personal about it.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe character of September Mourning is a human-reaper hybrid, who feels the need to give some human souls a second chance, and thus toys with Fate. To expound on this narrative, September is working with iconic comic book artist Marc Silvestri, who started out on the original X-Men comics and went on to form Top Cow Productions (Witchblade, The Darkness). Together, they are putting together the story of September Mourning in graphic form, to accompany, and enhance the musical message.\n\n\n\nHaving performed at large festivals like Rock on the Range and Download Festival and shared the stage with acts like Marilyn Manson and Avatar, September Mourning has already built up an impressive fan base, which she calls her \u201cChildren of Fate,\u201d constantly encouraging them to have \u201cthe courage to embrace their passion\u2026 to allow yourself to follow your heart and not be a slave to your fears. To know that the only boundaries that exist in our lives are the ones we allow.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeptember -\n\nbit.ly/SeptemberSM\n\nbit.ly/SeptemberInsta\n\n\n\nRiven -\n\nbit.ly/RivenSM\n\nbit.ly/RivenInsta\n\n\n\nWraith -\n\nbit.ly/WraithSM\n\nbit.ly/WraithInsta\n\n\n\nShadou -\n\nbit.ly/ShadouSM\n\nbit.ly/ShadouInsta\n\n\n\nRasper -\n\nbit.ly/RasperSM\n\nbit.ly/RasperInsta\n\n\n\nStitch -\n\nbit.ly/StitchSM\n\nbit.ly/StitchInsta", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "85 Ave A, New York, NY 10009", "Artist": "Drom", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.9843, 40.725256], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Metal", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Drom", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Drom may be New York's premiere venue for world music (Wall Street Journal), but this crackling hot East Village club also offers everything from jazz and rock to hip hop, soul, funk and EDM, and has a growing reputation for spotlighting exciting new talent.

Sadly, I attempted violin as a young child and was brutally bad. My parents had some how had me listening to classical music at that time which probably explains the violin attempt. Then a miracle happened\u2026First, the Beatles arrived so, bye bye classical & then my aunt who was buying a new piano (the wealthier end of the family) offered me her old one. I\u2019m 8 1/2 so I was still agreeable to anything so I promised to take lessons and really work at it.\n\nI lied\u2026After a year and a half I quit\u2026..until I discovered Elton John. That was it! I was determined to be a musician. In the late 70\u2019s I joined a fairly succesful 50\u2019s/60\u2019s band called Slick. I played 6 nights a week and worked full time at a department store as a stock man (person in this politically correct universe). Exhaustion wasn\u2019t considered. I went to gigs with a thermos of tea and lemon since I was always sick. This lasted until the early 80\u2019s. I joined a band called Loose Change which (under my direction) played anything from the 1960\u2019s- whatever was current. That lasted 12 years. Many years of putting my ears in harms way and breathing in way to much bar smoke told me it was time to quit. This was somewhere around 1993/94 (I don\u2019t remember). The next time I played live was in 2004 at my local block party. That\u2019s what I needed to get the itch to play again but, I was working in retail at Sam Ash Music and simply had no time to gig. In 2007 I was offered a better job which offered me a 9-5 existence. The economy turned sour and earning extra cash became a priority. And then it happened\u2026.I walked into a local Italian restaurant called Vera\u2019s Trattoria to pick up a pizza and lo and behold (fancy words ehh?) a piano player was pumping out Jazz licks. Can you imagine? Live music! I decided to approach the owner to see if I could score a gig. He decided to try me the following week. I was hired as a permanent fixture on Saturday nights. Thus The Richie G Review was born. \u201cA one man band Piano/vocals using backing tracks and a voice harmonizer to create a full band sound. My current song list represents over seventy artists including Elton John, Billy Joel , James Taylor, The Beatles and hits from the 1960\u2019s thru today. Over 500 tunes and counting\u2013 Booking email onemanbandrichieg@gmail.com .\u201d I played at Vera\u2019s for 14 months and then a new owner took over. He decided that entertainment was unnecessary. I got to work recording a CD of covers and creating business cards. The hard work paid off! I\u2019m a permanent Wednesday night fixture at the Woodcliff lake Hilton as well as sprinkling in various weekend gigs.\n\nRidgewood Street Fair 2013-2014\n\n\n\n392561_413258562028352_398683286819213_1318553_160572558_nRIDGEWOOD\n\n\n\nChapter 2- Ginger Martini was Born Right around St Patty\u2019s Day of 2012, I was performing at the Elm Street Grill in Oakland NJ. I was approached by my soon to be partner Wendy Kelly. I was on the floor wiring up my equipment as she, asked me questions about what I do (kind of music, etc). I was excited believing that I was going to be hired for a private party. During the break, she handed me her card.It turned out she was interested in joining me. I wasn\u2019t looking but, I agreed to see what she sounded like at my rehearsal space (haha my basement). Three songs later I was convinced. We sounded great together. A week later, we had 50 plus songs ready for prime time. She joined me at The Paris Inn in Wayne NJ. Ever since we perform around 50% of my gigs together and get an incredible response. Wendy started a seasoned veteran of the Broadway, Standard, and Country Genres. She has since dragged me into her country word as I dragged her into my pop/rock world.

Curtis\n\n\n\nreleased the album in 2015 just before hitting the road again for a North American tour.

Her arrangements are thoughtful and complex, and her sumptuous powerhouse of a voice will leave you awed at the 5\u20192 framed young Indian woman.\n\nThe Dreamer, produced by Neha and mastered by award-winning engineer Mark Donahue, is the singer-songwriter\u2019s debut album, arriving as a delicate and fresh surprise, chock-full of lasting impressions. Neha (pronounced NEY-ha) penned eleven of the twelve tunes on her album, demonstrating her prowess as an artful songwriter.\n\nA gifted singer, composer & pianist, Neha\u2019s style can be characterized as a smorgasbord of musical personalities. She cites influences such as Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Otis Redding, Donny Hathaway, Sam Cooke, Dinah Washington, and Carmen MacRae, to name a few. While definitely rooted in jazz, elements of folk, blues, pop and her mother's classical indian musical background also permeate.\n\nA graduate of Northwestern University with a degree in Economics, Neha spent four years post-college working for the tech giant, Google, Inc in the Bay Area. She penned some of her first tracks from her cubicle, and spent much of her free time hitting the jam sessions and songwriting open mics in San Francisco before quitting to pursue her Masters degree at the prestigious New England Conservatory of Music.\n\nSince graduating from NEC in May of 2012, Neha been actively engaged in the Boston performance scene, performing at prestigious venues like Scullers Jazz Club, Lizard Lounge, and Club Passim. In New York, her performance credits include headlining at the famous off-Broadway show \"Sleep No More,\" and being regulars at venues such as The Rockwood Music Hall, Jazz at the Kitano Room, and Caffe Vivaldi. Most recently, Neha came off a mini tour performing the world premiere of \"Project Gilgamesh\" in Cleveland, Ohio written by multi-talented contemporary violinist and composer Daniel Bernard Roumain.\n\nAn account of all things reverie, The Dreamer openly explores Neha\u2019s deepest personal thoughts and wants. Songs like \u201cThe Dreamer,\u201d and \u201cWay Back Then\u201d explore her desire to go against cultural and social expectations of her, while songs \"The Darkness\" and \"Whole\" give us an intimate understanding of who Neha is as a person. Other songs like \"The Willow Tree,\" and \"The French Man\" play on her innocence and penchant for day dreaming, delivered through charming lyrics and wispy vocal lines.\n\n\nBacked-up by her exceptionally talented six bandmates whom she met at NEC (Connor Baker - drums, Evan Allen - piano, Dorsey Bass - bass, Bobby Spellman - Trumpet, Katie Seiler - vocals, Rachel Panitch - violin and vocals), The Dreamer is a tenderly crafted record, a definitive smorgasbord of Neha\u2019s life experiences. Rooted in her love affair with jazz, folk, blues, and her mother\u2019s long standing classical Indian musical training, the record results in a gorgeously personal and open account of Neha's life and deepest vulnerabilities, painted in piercing melodies and whimsically crafted arrangements.\n\n\"Music is as necessary to me as food or air\" says the first generation Indian-American singer-songwriter. \"Leaving the life I led in San Francisco [at Google] and starting all over was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but definitely the most gratifying as well. I spent so much of my life dancing around [creativity], wishing I could be part of that community of creating music and art, but never had the courage to follow through. Finally I just realized I owed it to myself to really go for it, head first.

His passionate performances are punctuated by a crisp acoustic guitar and soaring tenor vocals. This is best shown in his 2018 EP \u201cBreathe,\u201d a four song project consisting only of acoustic guitar, bass and vocals. And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.\n\nKyle takes in the world, processes it and turns it into song with his own special touch. He has a unique take on things, a view of the world others may not necessarily notice. He continues to grow as an artist, sharing his story and messages of love and peace.\n\nAbove all, though, it\u2019s still about the music.", "otherInfo": "Special Valentines Day show w/Roni Caggiano"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Sherrod Small", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.988348, 40.735421], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Upstairs at The Stand", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Small World Valentine's Weekend Shows!"}, {"Address": "620 Van Houten Ave, Clifton, NJ 07013", "Artist": "Madame Mayhem", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8964637.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.147597, 40.857906], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Hard Rock, Alternative Metal", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Dingbatz", "moreBioInfo": "Manhattan-born singer-songwriter, Madame Mayhem\u2122, is a true rocker with an eclectic style in every aspect of life.

They include \u201cLes c\u0153urs tendres\u201d (The tender hearts), \u201cVoir un ami pleurer\u201d (To see a friend break down and cry), \u201cMr Tambourine Man\u201d and \u201cThis Wheel\u2019s on Fire.\u201d Placed alongside them will be some of Barb\u2019s own songs, written with a number of wonderful collaborators including Level 42\u2019s Mike Lindup.\n\nWhat you might know is that singer, performer and recording artist Barb Jungr is \u201dmesmerising\u201d (The New York Times), \u201dcasually virtuosic\u201d (The Guardian), an \u201dalchemist among jazz singers\u201d (Telegraph), possessing a voice which is \u201cshockingly expressive, with an astonishing palette of colours\u201d (Observer). Across her 40 year career she has been internationally acclaimed for combining immaculate vocal technique, impassioned performance, piercing insight and beautifully unexpected musical arrangements to reinterpret European and American popular songs in a manner which The New York Times described as \u201drevelatory\u201d.\n\n\nWhat you might not know is that as a live performer, Barb Jungr is always funny, and often hilarious. Like, intentionally. Cabaret Scenes described a performance in November 2016 as \u201cthe funniest hour of cabaret I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d from a \u201cworld-class raconteur.\u201d Originally emerging from the alternative cabaret scene of the 1970s and 80s, and cutting her teeth alongside the likes of Julian Clary, Alexei Sayle and Arnold Brown, her ability to deliver shows which are utterly alive, and spontaneously respond to the world in and outside the performance space, is second to none.\n\nIf you are only familiar with Barb\u2019s work from her albums, you simply have to see her perform live.

Known for her smooth, effortless sound, sensitive interpretations, satisfying swing, and unique approach to the American songbook, Audrey sings with a style that radiates her warm, generous personality. Jazztimes\u2019 Christopher Loudon writes, \u201c\u2026her voice is like pure sterling. Her phrasing is exquisite, her clarity and enunciation on par with the great Jo Stafford and her breath control\u2014a talent so often, and so wrongfully, overlooked\u2014rivals Sinatra\u2019s.\"\n\n\n\nAudrey\u2019s steady stream of appearances\u2014including recent performances at the Tanglewood Jazz Festival and New York\u2019s prestigious JVC Jazz Festival\u2014have made her more sought after than ever. Based in New York City, she regularly performs at numerous venues including 55 Bar, Bargemusic, Sweet Rhythm, Cleopatra\u2019s Needle, and The Kitano Hotel. She has become a familiar face at the Metropolitan Room and recently completed a five-month engagement at Bruno Jamais Restaurant and Club.\n\n\n\nAudrey received critical praise for her \u201cvocal prowess\u201d in her debut album, Here In My Arms, in which she worked with an extraordinary line-up of musicians: pianist John Cowherd, bassist Doug Weiss, drummer Gerald Cleaver, guitarist Chis Bergson, percussionist Daniel Sadownick, and David Mann on flute and saxophones. In 2009, Audrey produced her latest CD, Dream Awhile, which features many of the players that have worked with her in New York clubs throughout her career, including pianist Joe Barbato, bassist Joe Fitzgerald, guitarist Chris Bergson, and drummers Anthony Pinciotti and Todd Isler. The recording wowed critics, who lauded her thoughtful, charming, and uniquely personal interpretations of 11 lesser-known jazz standards.\n\n\n\nAudrey is a storyteller at heart, a performer who loves connecting with her audiences. She respects the power of lyrics, but is equally fascinated by how an artist can alter the mood, meaning and impact of a song through its arrangement. Audrey has an insatiable desire to learn, a vast repertoire, years of jazz piano studies, a well-developed ear for scat and improv, and a musically open mind. These elements combine to make Audrey a singer, bandleader and arranger who delights her audiences and fellow musicians. An avid researcher and broad listener, Audrey continuously adds to her distinctive musical vocabulary, and always surprises audiences with her delightfully original versions of jazz standards. Also inspired by the cabaret world, she enjoys sharing anecdotes between songs, offering an unusually friendly, intimate, and enlightening jazz atmosphere.\n\n\n\nAudrey started studying classical piano and cello as a young child, but deep down she alway wanted to be a singer. Audrey explored her love of jazz and popular song by spending hours absorbing the styles of Fred Astaire (she also studied tap) and singing along with the various Broadway musicals\u2014such as The Pajama Game and Guys and Dolls\u2014that comprised much of her father\u2019s record collection. Audrey finally began to explore her vocal skills while studying at Brown University, where she founded the school\u2019s first co-ed jazz a cappella group, The Higher Keys, for which she transcribed and arranged for the first time.\n\n\n\nAfter graduation, her love of music led to employment in the marketing and A&R departments of CBS Masterworks (now SONY Classical) and then as the Director of Marketing for Chesky Records. She earned an MBA at Columbia Business School and worked as an account executive for advertising giant Ogilvy & Mather. But eventually her deep love for jazz drew her back to singing.\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Audrey met Jon Raney (pianist and son of jazz great, Jimmy Raney). He encouraged her to pursue a career as a singer, and worked with her on a demo in 2000 alongside drummer Ronnie Zito (whose rhythmic skills drove the bands of Woody Herman and Bobby Darin) and bassist Jay Leonhart (a Judy Garland and Tony Bennett favorite). Audrey has also studied privately with vocal priestess Sheila Jordan, as well as Mark Murphy, Grammy nominee and four-time winner of the Downbeat Readers Poll for Male Jazz Singer of the Year. According to Murphy, Audrey \u201chas that rare quality of light infectious swing that lights up her tall willowy persona.\u201d\n\n\n\nAudrey\u2019s eclectic background and tireless curiosity continue to inform her understated, intelligent style. Inspired by numerous jazz greats including Joe Williams, Anita O'Day, and Bill Evans, she\u2019s also influenced by an array of musicians and styles, including pop diva Annie Lennox, Yoruban chant, the Brazilian jazz guitarist/composer Djavan, and the atonal explorations of classical composer Arnold Schoenberg.\n\n\n\nEver the explorer, Audrey continues to expand her musical and creative horizons. She is currently working on numerous projects, including a show of her original songs, a recording of early jazz tunes, and a tribute to legendary vocalist Anita O\u2019Day. Audrey is driven by a desire to give back and loves singing at senior and community centers throughout New York City. Interestingly, she feels that these performances are among her best and have changed her as a musician.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso driven by a desire to give back, Audrey regularly performs at senior and community centers throughout New York City, and acknowledges these programs have changed her as a musician and, interestingly, feels they have been among her best.", "otherInfo": "Please join us for a relaxed evening of love songs at Michiko Studios for Valentines Day.

Music wasn\u2019t always in the picture for us, but when we got a taste, we couldn\u2019t stop. Adam started playing solo shows and shortly after Karolina jumped in and a version of Radiant Reveries was birthed.

Can you tell me more about the journey you and the band have taken toward making music together?\n\nRadiant Reveries: We have been friends for years and years before falling in love and getting married seven years ago. Music wasn\u2019t always in the picture for us, but when we got a taste, we couldn\u2019t stop. Adam started playing solo shows and shortly after Karolina jumped in and a version of Radiant Reveries was birthed. We are fortunate to be moving forward with our current lineup of Chris Heinz (drums) and Graham Pence (bass). Also we\u2019ve been friends with each of the guys for years before playing together so it\u2019s definitely been a journey of friendship and of love and of serendipity. Feels like the stars aligned.\n\nQRO: What\u2019s next for you guys? I hear you\u2019ve been at work on something new.\n\nRR: Yes! We are currently recording our album with Don DiLego at Velvet Elk Studios. Our goal is to release the first single / video by June 2019.\n\n\n\n\"Founded on the premise of friendship and seeking truth, NYC-based psych/ tribal/ folk /rock band Radiant Reveries have been kicking ass and taking names in the city. Their latest single, \u201cEnough is Enough\u201d, is a killer commentary against unnecessary acts of violence. It debuts here, right now.\nHas there ever been a more gut-wrenching and beautiful testament to peace? Of course it\u2019s been decades since every song released was about giving peace a chance and standing up for our rights to be free. In today\u2019s political environment, it is \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 becoming increasingly necessary to discuss violence and its effects on the innocent.\n\nRadiant Reveries take their stand in the form of song. At times abrasive and sporadic, the point couldn\u2019t be more clear: \u201cEnough is Enough\u201d. This is their call to rise up against destructive thoughts and meaningless acts of terror and violence, and it\u2019s a real fire-inducer.\" - Impose Magazin\n\n\"Coming off an appearance at Northside Festival, Radiant Reveries are preparing to release their new album, Rise. Although the album will not be out until September, the band are premiering their new single right here on Surviving the Golden Age. \u201cShow Me the Way\u201d is a mixture of psychedelic rock and folk. With an almost tribal sound to it, this is the sound of tripping on acid in the desert.

Born on a military base in Nogales, Arizona in 1922 and raised in Watts, California, his earliest musical influences came from the church\u2013 choir and group singing\u2013 and from \u201chearing Duke Ellington over the radio when [he] was eight years old.\u201d He studied double bass and composition in a formal way (five years with H. Rheinshagen, principal bassist of the New York Philharmonic, and compositional techniques with the legendary Lloyd Reese) while absorbing vernacular music from the great jazz masters, first-hand. His early professional experience, in the 40\u2019s, found him touring with bands like Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory and Lionel Hampton.\n\nEventually he settled in New York where he played and recorded with the leading musicians of the 1950\u2019s\u2013 Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Art Tatum and Duke Ellington himself. One of the few bassists to do so, Mingus quickly developed as a leader of musicians. He was also an accomplished pianist who could have made a career playing that instrument. By the mid-50\u2019s he had formed his own publishing and recording companies to protect and document his growing repertoire of original music. He also founded the \u201cJazz Workshop,\u201d a group which enabled young composers to have their new works performed in concert and on recordings.\n\nMingus soon found himself at the forefront of the avant-garde. His recordings bear witness to the extraordinarily creative body of work that followed. They include: Pithecanthropus Erectus, The Clown, Tijuana Moods, Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Ah Um, The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, Cumbia and Jazz Fusion, Let My Children Hear Music. He recorded over a hundred albums and wrote over three hundred scores.\nAlthough he wrote his first concert piece, \u201cHalf-Mast Inhibition,\u201d when he was seventeen years old, it was not recorded until twenty years later by a 22-piece orchestra with Gunther Schuller conducting. It was the presentation of \u201cRevelations\u201d which combined jazz and classical idioms, at the 1955 Brandeis Festival of the Creative Arts, that established him as one of the foremost jazz composers of his day.\n\nIn 1971 Mingus was awarded the Slee Chair of Music and spent a semester teaching composition at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In the same year his autobiography, Beneath the Underdog, was published by Knopf. In 1972 it appeared in a Bantam paperback and was reissued after his death, in 1980, by Viking/Penguin and again by Pantheon Books, in 1991. In 1972 he also re-signed with Columbia Records. His music was performed frequently by ballet companies, and Alvin Ailey choreographed an hour program called \u201cThe Mingus Dances\u201d during a 1972 collaboration with the Robert Joffrey Ballet Company.\n\nHe toured extensively throughout Europe, Japan, Canada, South America and the United States until the end of 1977 when he was diagnosed as having a rare nerve disease, Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis. He was confined to a wheelchair, and although he was no longer able to write music on paper or compose at the piano, his last works were sung into a tape recorder.\n\nFrom the 1960\u2019s until his death in 1979 at age 56, Mingus remained in the forefront of American music. When asked to comment on his accomplishments, Mingus said that his abilities as a bassist were the result of hard work but that his talent for composition came from God.\n\nMingus received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Smithsonian Institute, and the Guggenheim Foundation (two grants). He also received an honorary degree from Brandeis and an award from Yale University. At a memorial following Mingus\u2019 death, Steve Schlesinger of the Guggenheim Foundation commented that Mingus was one of the few artists who received two grants and added: \u201cI look forward to the day when we can transcend labels like jazz and acknowledge Charles Mingus as the major American composer that he is.\u201d The New Yorker wrote: \u201cFor sheer melodic and rhythmic and structural originality, his compositions may equal anything written in western music in the twentieth century.\u201d\n\nHe died in Mexico on January 5, 1979, and his wife, Sue Graham Mingus, scattered his ashes in the Ganges River in India. Both New York City and Washington, D.C. honored him posthumously with a \u201cCharles Mingus Day.\u201d\n\nAfter his death, the National Endowment for the Arts provided grants for a Mingus foundation created by Sue Mingus called \u201cLet My Children Hear Music\u201d which catalogued all of Mingus\u2019 works. The microfilms of these works were then given to the Music Division of the New York Public Library where they are currently available for study and scholarship \u2013 a first for jazz. Sue Mingus has founded three working repertory bands called the Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Orchestra, and the Mingus Big Band, which continue to perform his music. Biographies of Charles Mingus include Mingus by Brian Priestley, Mingus/Mingus by Janet Coleman and Al Young, Myself When I Am Real by Gene Santoro, and Tonight at Noon, a memoir by Sue Mingus.\n\nMingus\u2019 masterwork, \u201cEpitaph,\u201d a composition which is more than 4000 measures long and which requires two hours to perform, was discovered during the cataloguing process. With the help of a grant from the Ford Foundation, the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by Gunther Schuller, in a concert produced by Sue Mingus at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989, ten years after Mingus\u2019 death.\n\nThe New Yorker wrote that \u201cEpitaph\u201d represents the first advance in jazz composition since Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cBlack, Brown, and Beige,\u201d which was written in 1943. The New York Times said it ranked with the \u201cmost memorable jazz events of the decade.\u201d Convinced that it would never be performed in his lifetime, Mingus called his work \u201cEpitaph,\u201d declaring that he wrote it \u201cfor my tombstone.\u201d\n\nThe Library of Congress purchased the Charles Mingus Collection, a major acquisition, in 1993; this included autographed manuscripts, photographs, literary manuscripts, correspondence, and tape recordings of interviews, broadcasts, recording sessions, and Mingus composing at the piano.\n\nSue Mingus has published a number of educational books through Hal Leonard Publishing, including Charles Mingus: More Than a Fake Book, Charles Mingus: More Than a Play-Along, Charles Mingus: Easy Piano Solos, many big band charts\u2014 including the Simply Mingus set of big band music charts\u2013 and a Mingus guitar book.\n\nReprinted in part from More than a Fake Book \u00a9 1991 Jazz Workshop, Inc.\n\nLinks to Additional Biographical and Historical Information on the Web\n\nLibrary of Congress\nAn index to the holdings of the Charles Mingus Collection, Music Division of the Library of Congress.\nhttp://www.loc.gov/performingarts/encyclopedia/collections/mingus.html", "otherInfo": "Jazz Standard proudly presents our tenth annual Mingus High School Competition 1979).

Connor tracked Mr. Goggin down at Trout Recording in Brooklyn and handed him dozens of demos. Goggin found some gems in the dozens of 4 track tunes, and it wasn't long before Connor and Goggin had recorded Plug In - Connor\u2019s debut solo effort (think Ben Folds hanging out with Billy Bragg listening to Guided by Voices). A big fat positive response, including an nod for Best Lyrics in American Songwriter Magazine, sent Connor on a whirlwind tour across the U.S and as far away as the Middle East.\n\nIn the years that followed, Connor released three more solo albums with Bryce Goggin producing, including the EP Blood like Fire (Songs for Syria) - a charity album about the war in Syria. 100% of the proceeds from this EP are allocated to educating Syrian refugee children via the Karam Foundation. Singles from the Songs for Syria EP received heavy rotation on TV and radio stations thoughought the entire Middle East. During 2013, Connor would get a call from a friend in Iraq or a relative in Saudi Arabia that his video was on TV. Connor has continued to advocate for awareness of the Syrian crisis with several video singles. Currently, his song Man of Peace is featured in the Oscar contending documentary Little Gandhi, about one of the Syrian Revolution's greatest peace activists Ghiyath Matar.\n\nIn June of 2015, a stranger pulled up to Dylan's house in Connecticut and left a large package on the front porch. When he got home later that day, Connor opened the heavy box to find a custom Martin acoustic guitar, and a note that said 'happy strumming.\" This mysterious gift provided the fuel that Dylan needed to put the finishing touches on a trove of unfinished songs. Connor had been composing fragments of material in places as mundane as his living room, and as exotic as Turkey, Cyprus, and Germany. In February 2016 , Connor headed into the studio with Bryce Goggin at the helm of course. They resurfaced in August of that year with a 10 song LP titled Spirit Glue. The title emanates from the friends and family here and here after who made the songs and recordings possible: the one hundred and twenty fans who funded the album through PledgeMusic; the former high school student who painted the cover portrait; the soul brother who directed and edited an accompanying music video for every song on the record; and the musicians who donated their talents to the tracks. Spirit Glue is now available on all digital platforms including iTunes, Amazon, GooglePlay, Spotify, etc.\nAND is available on vinyl through cdbaby.com and dylanconnor.com.\n\nMost recently, Dylan wrote the song \"Bring you Back\" for the feature film \"Adverse\" starring Mickey Rourke, Lou Diamond Phillips, and Sean Astin.", "otherInfo": "Solo gig.

Her last release, Spark, won Walker the praise not only of Katy Perry, who tweeted her song \"Mars,\" but also of Billy Corgan. The Smashing Pumpkins frontman actually contacted her to tell her how much he loved her version of \"Galapogos.\" \"I was blown away,\" admits Walker. \"Billy Corgan was one of my teen idols. So it's cool to get that recognition from this guy who wrote [the] songs that shaped a lot of my teenage moments.\" Spark was also championed by Jason Bentley of KCRW-FM, a station that has supported Walker's music from the beginning. Some significant things happened to Walker during the three year period between Spark and Strange Bird. One is that she moved from Denver to the quaint mountain town of Crested Butte, Colorado. The other big change is that Walker, who was raised as an evangelical Christian, broke free from organized religion. These two events are connected, though they may not appear to be at first glance. \"Nature is my religion,\" explains the introspective singer. \"[And] you can't get any closer to nature [than Crested Butte]. There are mountains everywhere, and rivers\u2026 I can see the beauty before me, know that I am a small part of this infinite universe and feel tiny and powerful all in the same [moment].\" Highlights of Strange Bird range from the ballad \"Nothing Lasts Forever\" to more upbeat, nocturnal fare like \"Skywalker\" and \"Lightning\" to the haunting album closer, \"Deja Vu.\" All these songs are given grandly atmospheric backdrops by L.A.-based producer Malina, whose previous credits include a stint with Nine Inch Nails. The two met through Walker's brother. \"I told my brother that I needed a mad scientist,\" she remembers. \"He didn't mention [Malina] right away but a couple of minutes later, he was like, 'Oh! I know just the guy.' And he was right.\" Perhaps the best example of their collaboration is Strange Bird's autobiographical title track. \"It's about me as a little girl and how shy I was,\" says Walker. \"I didn't like singing in public; I always sang by myself\u2026 Everybody thought I was weird. A strange bird!\" If that was the case for Walker as a little girl, it certainly isn't the case now. This self-proclaimed 'strange bird' has been on quite a journey since she flew her Indiana nest a decade ago and moved to Philadelphia to be the singer for electronica trio Daughter Darling. Since then, she has released three solo albums: her acclaimed 2007 debut Urban Angel, the following year's With You and the aforementioned Spark; she has played venues ranging from The Fox Theatre in Boulder and The Fillmore in San Francisco to Joe's Pub and the Bowery Ballroom in New York City; she's seen her songs pop up repeatedly on both the big and small screens; and she's acquired many fans along the way. Not all these fans are as famous as Billy Corgan but that hardly matters. \"It\u2019s incredible to receive emails from people telling me a certain song moved them,\" says Walker. \"I've had so many fans tell me, 'This song got me through a really hard time in my life.' So many stories. It's powerful stuff.\"", "otherInfo": "An Evening of Romantic Comedy: A Book Release Show and Party"}, {"Address": "370 New York Ave, Huntington, NY 11743", "Artist": "Luke Buck", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8311678.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.425768, 40.869652], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative Rock, Pop, Rock, Blues-Rock, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Spotlight NY Huntington", "moreBioInfo": "Luke Buck is a multi-instrumental singer/songwriter from the 'sticks' in northeastern Pennsylvania.

Lights flash. Everyone is on alert. Emergency protocol in effect. It\u2019s a Code Red state of emergency. Soul music is in trouble and one of the greatest R&B singers of a generation is sounding the alarm. Whispered voices have been expressing their concern for some time. Industry insiders talk of a change in the musical direction at radio. Critics blame millenials. Millenials blame the music. Artists blame each other. And everyone blames the Internet. But that\u2019s not the whole story. Soul music is alive and well and \u201cpeople love it when introduced to it properly,\u201d R&B/Pop icon Monica explains. However, concerned about the future of the genre she loves so much, Monica returns with her seventh studio album appropriately titled Code Red. \u201cAs an artist and real genuine soul/R&B lover, I felt that it\u2019s a state of emergency for the music. Its important for this generation to know and understand how important the music was and is to the world and we are best when we can bridge the sound between the old and the new,\u201d Monica says. The Grammy Award winning singer knows this better than anyone. Monica will inarguably be remembered in music as one of the most iconic soul singers of a generation. Her enviable resume detailing extraordinary musical contributions that started professionally at the tenderfoot age of 12 when her first major label deal was signed. Monica\u2019s musical journey started in College Park, Ga., when she began performing with a traveling gospel choir, following in her mother\u2019s footsteps, an incredible church singer herself. While honing her craft competing in as many local talent shows she could find, Monica was discovered by hitmaker Dallas Austin, signed to Arista Records\u2019 distributed label, Rowdy Records and by thirteen became the youngest artist ever to score two back-to-back Billboard #1 chart-topping hit records with \u201cDon\u2019t Take it Personal\u201d (Just one of dem Days) and \u201cBefore you Walk Out of My Life.\u201d By the end of 1995, she had taken the world by storm with her unstoppable debut album, \u201cMiss Thang.\u201d Her next album, the 1998 record-breaker \u201cThe Boy Is Mine,\u201d was a crossover pop juggernaut as the result of her duet with Brandy; the Rodney Jerkins produced song of the same name. The single spent thirteen weeks at #1 on the coveted Billboard chart, earning Monica her first Grammy Award to add to her already growing collection of Billboard, American Music and Soul Train awards. \u201cThe Boy Is Mine\u201d album would feature two more Billboard #1 hits \u2013\u201cAngel of Mine\u201d and \u201cThe First Night\u201d\u2013 and would establish Monica as a bona-fide superstar and one of most successful artists of the entire decade. Over the next ten years Monica would release four more Billboard chart-toppingalbums \u201cAfter the Storm,\u201d\u201cThe Makings of Me,\u201d\u201cStill Standing,\u201d and \u201cNew Life.\u201d In all, she has sold more than 25 million albums worldwide and she holds the record as the first artist to top the U.S. Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart with No.1 songs over the span of three consecutive decades (1990s, 2000s and 2010s), which puts her in the elite company of history-making superstars such as Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, James Brown and Marvin Gaye, all sharing similar accomplishments. She\u2019s acted on stage and in feature films, contributed to the hit NBC show, \u201cThe Voice,\u201d and witnessed her life documented in the BET reality show, \u201cMonica: Still Standing.\u201d And in 2010, Billboard Magazine listed Monica at No. 24 on it\u2019s list of the Top 50 R&B and Hip Hop Artists of the past 25 years. So what\u2019s left to prove and why now? The answers are extraordinarily simple: Nothing and it was time. After a few years off from recording and touring, Monica felt that her family life had reached a point where it could sustain the rigors and demands of her career. \u201cMy family takes precedence over everything. Once I really got everybody comfortable \u2013 Kids in school, prepping for the days they had whether it be with sports or all the different activities that they love and my daughter was walking and talking, that\u2019s when I really started working on the album,\u201d Monica recalls. \u201cMy children didn\u2019t ask to be the children of an entertainer so never do I want them to feel secondary to it\u2026In the midst of me being a mom and a wife, there\u2019s so much more substance there when I do come back as an artist.\u201d Due in-stores and online later this year, Code Redis indeed a jubilant return to form for the iconic star. The lead single, produced by hitmaker Polow Da Don is an updated take on a Smokey Robinson and the Miracles classic (Much Better Off); \u201cJust Right For Me,\u201dfeaturing Lil\u2019 Wayne, serves as a perfect introduction to the album and is a bridge between Monica\u2019s love of classic soul music, 90\u2019s R&B and the sound of today. Another standout on the album is the uber-personal tune, \u201cI Miss Music.\u201d It is somewhat of a tribute to the memorable music of the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s and the rare artists that created it. \u201cI Miss Music,\u201d is an infectious record. It was an instantaneous attraction for Monica. \u201cI was born in the midst of the most incredible age of music. This song speaks to that era and reflects on how important the music was to me,\u201d Monica explains. When I mention Whitney\u2019s name in the song, I still get chills through my body. She wasn\u2019t only my mentor. She was my friend. This song is all about substance and feel and that\u2019s what means the most to me.\u201d \u201cThe song \u2018Hustler\u2019s Ambition,\u2019 featuring Akon, is one of my absolute favorite records that I have ever recorded,\u201d Monica details. The record captures the feeling of missing someone but keeping the emotional fire burning while he\u2019s away. Surely a parallel for Monica and her husband, NBA player Shannon Brown and their intense opposing work schedules. Missy Elliott returns to Monica\u2019s musical journey on the supremely matched title track, \u201cCode Red.\u201d The tempo driven, high energy, effervescent, and lyrically captivating record couldn\u2019t be a more unexpected yet perfect union for these music icons whom are also true friends. \u201cThis album is about my journey. As a person I\u2019m complete. I\u2019m a complete woman now. I\u2019m complete as a mom. I see my children happy, enjoying their lives, living and learning. I\u2019m complete as a wife. I understand who I am. I know my shortcomings and I accept those just as much as I accept my strengths. As an artist, I\u2019m a lot more seasoned and comfortable in my own skin. I understand there are artists that will do different things than me. They make take different paths in promoting and creating but there\u2019s only one Monica. Indeed since her dominant debut in 1995, there\u2019s always only been one Monica.

The Village Voice called Obsolescence \u201ctirelessly inventive\u201d, eventually crowning ABYSMAL DAWN the #1 spot on their 10 Best Metal Albums year-end list. Early samples of ABYSMAL DAWN\u2019s Season of Mist debut demonstrate the trio\u2019s newfound power, ingenuity, and songcraft. Certainly, ABYSMAL DAWN\u2019s new opus picks up where Obsolescence left off, but it promises so much more.\n\nFormed in 2004, ABYSMAL DAWN quickly impressed on fan and band alike. The group\u2019s three-song demo landed ABYSMAL DAWN a contract with Arizona-based Crash Music. Within a year, the group were holed up with engineer John Haddad (Intronaut, Hirax) at Shiva Industries recording their debut, From Ashes. Released in 2006, From Ashes was praised for its tactful balance of brutality, melody, and atmosphere, earning heavy praise from media outlets. Blabbermouth gushed, calling it, \u201cirreproachably constructed.\u201d Follow-up album, Programmed to Consume, again engineered by Haddad, was released in 2008 following a higher profile deal with Relapse Records. Immediately, the press heralded Programmed to Consume\u2014\u201cthinking man\u2019s metal\u201d said AllMusic.\n\nAfter subsequent tours, the group wrote the successor to Programmed to Consume up through the recording sessions at Artisan Road Studios (with producer Mike Bear) and Trench Studios (again with Haddad). Titled Leveling the Plane of Existence, ABYSMAL DAWN\u2019s third album broke new ground with fan and press alike. Metalsucks called Leveling the Plane of Existence, \u201ccrushing modern death metal\u201d, while Pandora found it, \u201csavage\u201d. Clearly, ABYSMAL DAWN\u2019s bridging of death metal eras, songwriting prowess, and growing social buzz was eliciting the type of response for a band on their way up. Subsequent tours were successful in establishing ABYSMAL DAWN as one of America\u2019s leading death metal acts.\n\nLeveling the Plane of Existence was followed by Obsolescence three years later. ABYSMAL DAWN were dead set on perfecting their brand of death metal. So, they set out to write an all killer, no filler record. Producer Bear and engineer Haddad were brought onboard again to track Obsolescence. What had worked mercilessly (the production) on Leveling the Plane of Existence was in no need of change. The result of ABYSMAL DAWN running on all cylinders and their production team dialing in on the group\u2019s distinct sound resulted in a death metal powerhouse. Popmatters called it \u201cnuclear-powered\u201d and Teeth of the Divine opined it\u2019s a record that \u201cwants to cave your damn head in.\u201d Four albums in, ABYSMAL DAWN weren\u2019t just proficient in the finer arts of death, they were proven masters of it.\n\nAs a new age sets upon ABYSMAL DAWN\u2014the Angelenos are entering their 13th year\u2014there\u2019s no turning back. The group aren\u2019t interested in throttling down on their quality commitment to death metal and they\u2019re certainly not ready to let their legion of fans down by shifting gears into death metal-lite.

Christina Holmes does so on her aptly titled third independent full-length album, The Beautiful Struggle [Cove House Records]. The New Jersey-born and Rhode Island-based singer, songwriter, and Cove House Records founder threads together stories of love and life across eleven alternative folk anthems united by her confessional lyricism and instrumental proficiency on guitar, bass, djembe, and piano.\nAs a result, she delivers her most personal, passionate, and powerful statement to date informed by true trials, tribulations, and triumphs.\n\u201cThe album is called The Beautiful Struggle, because I feel as though everybody lives a beautiful struggle,\u201d she states. \u201cThere are so many good things in life. There are so many bad things in life. You\u2019re just trying to find a happy balance. You know what you want. However, you might not be able to have it. Maybe it\u2019s just out of reach, so your struggle is reaching for it.\u201d\nThe music magnifies this universal journey. After keeping a childhood songwriting ambition a secret, she went from braving open mics to brightening the spirits of bedridden hospital patients alongside the charity Musicians On Call. Following a seminal \u201cAmateur Night\u201d gig at the Apollo, she dropped her 2013 debut, Peace, Love, & C. Holmes and canvased the country on a sold-out tour with Trevor Hall. 2017\u2019s Stand Up\u2014produced by Warren Huart [Colbie Caillat, James Blunt]\u2014would be the first official release through Cove House Records.\nIn the aftermath, she garnered the acclaim of Paste, Relix, and Jam in the Van and toured with everyone from Hall to Xavier Rudd and Nahko of Medicine for the People in addition to booking her own national headline run. As early as 2017, she started compiling ideas for what would become her 2019 offering.\nA true experience catalyzed the process as she mustered the courage to tell her then-girlfriend, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I met my wife, she had been previously with her husband,\u201d recalls Christina. \u201cI was going through my thing, but I knew I was in love with her the moment I saw her. Since she was married, I didn\u2019t really express my feelings. The struggle was I knew who I wanted to be with, yet I couldn\u2019t. All of these wrenches kept getting thrown into the mix. I admittedly threw some of those in myself. Finally, we got married last year. The album covers the whole period.\u201d\nShe holed up at Spitfire Studios in Los Angeles in order to put the trip down on tape. For the first time, she expanded her palette like never before. Previously shy about her instrumental diversity, she played everything from guitar to percussion herself, making a decision \u201cto let go of the last part of myself in my teenage bedroom and show who I am as a musician.\u201d\n\u201cEverybody Knows\u201d hinted at this impressive musicality, looping vocals on top of djembe. Meanwhile, the single \u201cRise\u201d pairs a bright guitar lead and organic percussion with her warm delivery. It culminates on the empowering chant, \u201cWe will rise up when we are called upon. We will rise up and we will just keep on.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a song I felt like I needed to hear\u2014and the world needed to hear,\u201d she elaborates. \u201cAt the end of the day, we must find common ground with each other. If we decide we can have a greater purpose of living and moving forward, we can work through the violence in the world together. We\u2019ve got to stop doing what we\u2019re doing, rise above, and create a better world for all of us. The song is meant to make you gravitate towards the rest of the stories in the album and hopefully understand me as an artist.\u201d\nThese \u201cstories of struggle\u201d comprise the entire body of work.

The Charleston-raised and Los Angeles-based songstress brings an empowered female perspective, positive mindset, and a whole lot of raw attitude to simmering throwback R&B with soul to spare. On her independent Love Train EP series [SinceThe80s], she presents a full picture of this boundary-breaking singular signature style powered by her fierce and fiery individuality.\n\n\u201cAsiahn is me in my true form,\u201d she exclaims. \u201cAsiahn is a feminist. Asiahn is a nerd. Asiahn loves anime. Asiahn loves to cook. I believe in equal rights for everyone in every aspect. I\u2019m always positive. I feel like my purpose is to help people live and love.

I\u2019m taking a journey and inviting listeners along.\u201d\n\nRight out of the gate, the initial single \u201cNOLA\u201d clocked upwards of 1.6 million Spotify streams as she unveiled a powerful accompanying music video depicting the narrative of a same-sex couple. Standing for \u201cNo Love in Los Angeles,\u201d \u201cNOLA\u201d directly set the stage for the follow-up single \u201cLost In London,\u201d following one thread. Over echoes of sparse production, her delicate delivery dips between sensual peaks and valleys as she confidently recounts an emotionally charged tryst in intimate detail.\n\n\u201cSo, I go from no love in L.A. to getting lost in London,\u201d explains Asiahn. \u201cIt\u2019s the moment of a rebound.

That\u2019s how I end part II. I go from believing there\u2019s no love anywhere to meeting someone. It comes from knowing yourself and loving yourself first. Keep loving. Keep living.

The result of this decision is the band Vitriol, which soon involved Gianluca Pappalardo, Pierangelo Carvello and Alessandro Sanfilippo. These musicians contributed their professional influences to enrich the style of the new band, inspired by the modern progressive rock & metal genre and by the musical experiences of the 70\u2019s historical bands. V.i.t.r.i.o.l. is the acronym of one of the most famous mottos of Renaissance alchemy: \u201cVisita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem\u201d (Enter the bowels of the Earth and, through your purification, you will find the hidden stone). It is a metaphor representing the path of man inside his own Ego in order to finally find the philosophical Truth. In the same way, the main character of the story of their first EP, called Knowledge, has a quests for his beloved, Truth; he reaches the destination after a number of pitfalls and after meeting some allegorical characters (such as Faith and Insanity) he\u2019s also wrong-footed by the words of his beloved. The double meaning of the term \u201cvitriol\u201d (corrosive chemical element and acronym of the renaissance motto) can describe well the essence of the band, constantly hanging in the balance between its aggressive component and its introspective/reflective one. Once the first collected work of the band was distributed to media, it immediately generated lots of good reviews by the alternative rock and metal magazines in both paper and digital media: the EP received 15.5/16 in issue #59 of the prestigious Progression Magazine, the best score as \u201cindependent release\u201d and one of the best scores among 200 label\u2019s supported albums. It is considered the \"Best Demo of the Month\" in the November issue of Metal Maniac, one of the most important magazine in Italy, and received 8 out of 10 in a majority of the most famous international webzines, such as UsaProgressiveMusic, Rock Hard, Progressive Ears, MetalWave, Unprogged, TrueMetal, Metallo Italiano, Eutk, Nova Muzique as well as many others. Subsequently, the band caught the attention of the American label Melodic Revolution Records which has added Vitriol to their roster in 2010. During the same year Tommaso Semrov joined the band as guitarist and Vitriol started pre-producing their first full-length album \"Into The Silence I Sink\" which was released in November 2012. Recorded, mixed and mastered at Fear Studio in Ravenna and at the band's studio in Bologna, published by Melodic Revolution Records, it's a concept album revolving around the theme of Silence, metaphorically approached as \"deep absence of communication\". 10 songs, conducive to an analysis of the different causes of this absence of communication: the anonymity of the urban environment, the historical contraposition of Ideologies (Outward Silence, between person and person), differences between who we are and who we appear to be (Inner Silence, between the own appearance and essence). Concluding the album, the last song analyzes what must have been the most atrocious communicative Silence that has ever happened: a bewildered Christ asking \"My God, my God, why did you abandon me\"? \u201cInto The Silence I Sink\" was evaluated by the international press as one of the best albums of 2012. The American radio show Prog Metal Show put the album at the 8th place in the \"Top 50 progressive metal albums of the year\". The band promoted their work with two official videos, \"The Frozen Wind\" and \"Slowly She Dies\", and the \"Making of\" the album. In 2013-2014 Vitriol toured Europe across Italy, UK, Poland, Austria and in 2015-2016 performed as opener of Pain of Salvation, Evergrey, Soen, Kingcrow. At present they're working on their next album, with Gabriele Gozzi as new lead vocalist of the band.

The New York City band sounds like someone spinning a radio dial with such passionate intensity that all the stations blend together into a single, transcendent, almost spiritual force. It\u2019s disco to the beat of modern house; it\u2019s a Supremes cover of a Cardi B banger; it\u2019s Roland Kirk playing jazz through one saxophone, funk through another, and the most earwormy pop tune the 1970\u2019s could muster through a third. It\u2019s an experience\u2014one so effecting that with only a self-released 12\u201d single in circulation, 79.5 had been written up twice in The New Yorker on the merit of their live sets alone.\n\nStill, all this mixing and matching, this manic twirling of an FM dial, might seem like a bit of a mess: a recipe for ungrounded noodling and static. And perhaps it would be, were these disparate influences not anchored so solidly by the delicate crunch of singer and narcissist keyboardist Kate Mattison\u2019s Fender Rhodes. The Rhodes is the throbbing heart of 79.5, the melodic grit that gives its pristine vocals their edge. And like Mattison, it is the touchstone around which the band was built.\n\nThough the genesis of 79.5 was defined more by an organic growth than a singular event, the band could begin its origin story in 2012, the year Mattison renamed her band after an imaginary radio station, one that acted as a mercurial melting pot for genres as varied as house, soul, disco, jazz and new jack swing, all seasoned with an AM Gold crackle. Whenever, wherever 79.5 began, the band that has since coalesced around Mattison\u2019s Rhodes is comprised of individuals who have an inextricable connection between music and their paths through life.\n\n\u201cBoy Don\u2019t Be Afraid,\u201d the first single off of Predictions, showcases the sleek musicianship and palpable joy that course through entire record. Produced by Big Crown Records co-founder Leon Michels, Predictions is a timeless journey through a New York City dreamscape\u2014where spring never ends, the clubs never close, and new love is always right around the corner of the next city block. Mysterious, classy, and underscored with a simmering passion, the record captures the infectious mood of 79.5\u2019s live sets, transporting listeners directly to the front of the stage.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason radio stations as eclectic as 79.5 don\u2019t exist. People tend to gravitate towards a specific type of music in a given moment, one that syncs up with their emotional state or that satiates their particular taste. But somehow the blend of influences 79.5 has synthesized hits a sweet spot that feels at home in nearly any moment, any setting. Disc Jockeys across all wavelengths love to remind their listeners not to \u201cflip that dial,\u201d but tuned into 79.5, it\u2019s unlikely anyone would ever want to.", "otherInfo": "\" sounds like ESG meets Fleetwood Mac with Sade Saxophone for good measure.\""}, {"Address": "261 Driggs Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11222", "Artist": "Hideous Divinity", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8203452.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.948318, 40.72254], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Metal, Death Metal", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Warsaw", "moreBioInfo": "HIDEOUS DIVINITY's music starts taking form in January 2007 between Oslo (Enrico, former founding member of HOUR OF PENANCE now living in Norway) and Rome (Synder & Mauro, both members and ex-members of HOUR OF PENANCE and EYECONOCLAST).

Working for the first time with producer Rob Cavallo (the Warner Bros. Records chairman whose production credits cover Green Day\u2019s many groundbreaking albums, Goo Goo Dolls, Fleetwood Mac and many others), Groban pushed himself to fully capture the spirit of his acclaimed concerts, fueled by his vibrant bond with legions of his fans, the famed Grobanites. \u201cThe album was really sparked by an energy I had on the road,\u201d he says. Any of the hundreds of thousands who saw his shows in support of 2010\u2018s Illuminations, in which his writing and ambition took full flower, knows what he\u2019s talking about. Those concerts were at turns playful and intimate \u2014 even in arena settings \u2014 and affectingly powerful, with equal measures of musical virtuosity and spirited, spontaneous personality. The latter has also brought him a rising career in movies and television, with an hilarious recurring guest role on The Office, a sparkling part in the hit Steve Carrell/Julianne Moore film Crazy, Stupid, Love and a as costar of the upcoming small-ensemble comedy Coffee Town. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is the energy, the dynamic I want for my next record, the feeling I\u2019m getting on stage,\u201d he says. When he and Cavallo had dinner after a show in Chicago to discuss the possibility of working together, it was clear right away that they had the same things in mind. \u201cWhen Rob came out to Chicago he basically shared the same adjectives with me that I had in my head,\u201d Groban says. \u201cI wanted this to be soulful, wanted it to be righteous and dynamic and inspirational and energetic. And mainly wanted to find the sweet spot of my singing voice again. I always find it on tour.\u201d To achieve this, Cavallo \u2014 the 1998 Grammy Awards producer of the year \u2014 devised a creative studio approach. Though as a producer he\u2019s best known for his rock work, he\u2019s had a greatly wide-ranging career and, he notes, was raised immersed in the classical world thanks to his opera-loving grandparents \u2014 Luciano Pavarotti was a family friend who would visit, drawn largely by his grandmother\u2019s cooking. The chance to bring all those worlds together in one project was a challenge he relished. Working at the famed Ocean Way Studios in Hollywood, he started with an all-star core band: drummers Matt Chamberlain and Abe Laboriel Jr., the latter having just come off the road anchoring Paul McCartney\u2019s band; bassist Chris Chaney came from Jane\u2019s Addiction; in-demand guitarist Tim Pierce joined with credits ranging from Madonna to Dave Matthews, and keyboard player Jamie Muhoberac has worked with the Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac, Seal, My Chemical Romance and many others. To this, the producer added the secret ingredient, a trio of the top orchestral session artists in L.A. in cellist Dane Little, violinist Charlie Bisharat and harp ace Gayle Levant. And then, to provide as fertile an environment as possible, he gave them and Groban a sense of complete freedom. \u201cWe tried this experiment,\u201d Cavallo says. \u201cWe got the best \u2014 the best guitarists, keyboards, bass, drummers, and then got the best harpist, cellist and violinist in L.A. and got them to play together so they would be sensitive to each other. We tested it out, didn\u2019t know if it would work. And it worked great! Everyone had to listen to each other and react and play accordingly. Josh was the leader. Everyone\u2019s chemistry came together at that time. Really made for passionate vocal takes. What you\u2019re really getting now is a very pure type of truth from Josh. Very pure.\u201d Arrangements were worked up collectively, \u201cThe rhythm section came in ready to rock,\u201d Groban says. \u201cThe orchestral guys came in controlled, and the nice balance was the that the rock guys brought out a real edge in the orchestral players and the orchestral players brought out a real sense of control and nuance to the way the rock guys would play. To see Abe Laboriel play with a harpist was great! And Gayle said that it hasn\u2019t been since the Sinatra days that they were able to improvise with a rhythm section. So when they said to me, \u2018Your mic is ready,\u2019 it made it inspiring for me to sing on top of that, add my element, the three worlds blending together.\u201d Most of what\u2019s on the album was from the first few takes of each song, with the spontaneous spirit intact. Even the full orchestra parts, added later, expanded directly from the music created by the three strings players in the initial sessions. And the vibe extended outside the studio. \u201cIt\u2019s a musical camaraderie, not just showing up for a gig,\u201d Groban says. \u201cThat all starts at the top with Rob. And it wasn\u2019t just the playing, but the joking around and the dinners \u2014 we all got to know each other so well. Sometimes that magic that happens when you\u2019re off the clock, so to speak, when you\u2019ve technically done your job but think you can do it better. Got that extra oomph from everybody.\u201d It went literally outside the studio in the case of \u201cHollow Talk,\u201d a song that originated with the Danish indie band Choir of Young Believers.\u201d It\u2019s a song of complex musical turns and intertwined emotions, building from an intimacy to a big, expansive sound with orchestra and bagpipe. Groban remarked in the studio that it brought out the vision of a lonely girl walking down the street \u2014 and engineer Allen Sides, inspired, took a microphone out onto Sunset Boulevard to record street noises. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing the cars go by and going, \u2018I don\u2019t know why this would work,\u2019 but it really does,\u201d Groban says. \u201cAnd it turned out awesome.\u201d Groban was inspired to push himself as a writer, expanding on the achievements on Illuminations, the first album to be centered on his own compositions. \u201cBrave\u201d saw him team with long-time collaborator Tawgs Salter and singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk. \u201cWhen Rob was saying, \u2018Let\u2019s widen the lane,\u2019 you still don\u2019t want to sound out of your element,\u201d Groban says. \u201c\u2018Brave\u2019 represents one of the higher energy songs, but never felt out of place to me. Never felt this was out of my world. It represents the kind of energy I had on stage. I would want the lights going crazy and the band rocking out and something that blows the hair back and moves me. This to me represents every adjective Rob and I thought of in that meeting in Chicago.\u201d The lyrics and melody for \u201cBelow the Line,\u201d co-written with Salter and Simon Wilcox, were formed on the day Groban participated in Life Below the Line, for which people subsist on $1.50 for a day in order to understand the levels of true poverty. \u201cIt was not fun,\u201d says the singer, whose own Find Your Light Foundation has focused on much-needed arts education programs. \u201cA can of beans was my food, half in the morning and half at night. Somehow a song came out of it. It\u2019s not necessarily the full message of the song. The vibe is, \u2018We\u2019re not helping ourselves until we\u2019re helping others.\u2019\u201d Another regular collaborator, Lester Mendez (who also produced two songs on the album), teamed with Groban on \u201cFalse Alarms\u201d and, along with Salter and Italian lyricist Marco Marinangeli, \u201cE Ti Prometter\u00f2.\u201d For a second Italian song, \u201cSincera\u201d he reunited with acclaimed producer-composer Walter Afansieff (who produced the song) and Marinangeli. Such personal bonds and connections abound throughout the album. Groban and Irish singer-songwriter Glen Hansard, co-writer of \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d and co-creator of both the movie and musical Once, have built a friendship \u2014 the musical even includes a winking joke at Groban\u2019s expense and the singer introduced its segment at the Tony Awards show. Laura Pausini, Groban says, \u201cwas the first global superstar I ever met,\u201d an encounter that happened when he was just 17 and attending the MIDEM conference in the south of France. A friendship grew and both kept hoping there would be an opportunity to collaborate, which finally came with \u201cE Ti Prometter\u00f2.\u201d A few years back, Groban found himself sitting next to one of his heroes, iconic writer Jimmy Webb, on what turned out to be a harrowingly storm-tossed New York flight. Here, he steps up to tackle Webb\u2019s \u201cThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress,\u201d a song of complicated emotions that has tantalized with past interpretations by such stars as Judy Collins and Linda Ronstadt. And the haunting traditional Irish song \u201cShe Moved Through the Fair\u201d came to him while \u201chaving my late-night glass of wine and trawling YouTube\u201d via a live solo version by English folk-rock legend Richard Thompson, another long-time Groban favorite. \u201cHaving grown up on Irish music, I thought, \u2018Let\u2019s give it a try,\u2019\u201d he says of the song, which has also been recorded by artists including Van Morrison and Sinead O\u2019Connor. To give it the right tone, Levant switched to Celtic harp and Groban brought in another old friend, Eric Rigler, virtuoso on the Irish Uilleann pipes. \u201cAfter writing sessions, trying to be clever, it\u2019s nice to be reminded by songs like this that just sit in a place that\u2019s right.\u201d And to tie it all up, the album ends with the Stevie Wonder classic. \u201cTalking about the light and dark and trials and tribulations of love, no one writes about that better than Stevie Wonder,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about how imperfect we can be, how many lessons we can learn. \u2018Even though I messed up in the past and have done things wrong, the next time love comes my way, I\u2019m not going to let go.\u201d Groban\u2019s voice brings a truly personal stamp to the song, with the band and full orchestra joined by a full gospel choir. And the end of the song again captures the spirit that fueled the whole of the All That Echoes sessions, with Groban drumming (!) and singing a \u201cbig, stupid finish, unabashedly saying, \u2018There it is!\u2019\u201d \u201cTo me,\u201d he says, \u201cafter all the messages we put on the record, there was no better way to start than \u2018Brave\u2019 and no better way to finish off than this.\u201d New album - Stages Available Now: http://smarturl.it/a3z3eg", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "153-49 Reeves Avenue, Queens, NY 11367", "Artist": "Santiago Cruz", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8439533.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.8212967, 40.7388695], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Latina, Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Kupferberg Center for the Arts", "moreBioInfo": "Nac\u00ed un domingo, cuando el calendario marcaba el 1\u00ba d\u00eda del mes de febrero, en la capital musical de Colombia, Ibagu\u00e9, de ah\u00ed que estemos hablando de canciones, que vaya un poco contra la corriente al arrancar la vida cuando se supone que todos debemos estar descansando, y que mi equipo del alma sea el Deportes Tolima. Viv\u00ed toda mi infancia, y hasta los 17 a\u00f1os, en la ciudad donde nac\u00ed. All\u00ed hice pre-escolar en el Jard\u00edn Infantil \u201cEl Renacuajo\u201d, primaria en el Liceo V. A. L. (Vida, Amor y Luz) y secundaria en el Colegio San Luis Gonz\u00e1ga, ahora Colegio Champagnat, y luego de graduarme del colegio ingres\u00e9 a la VI Brigada del Ej\u00e9rcito, para cumplir con mi a\u00f1o de servicio militar obligatorio. La m\u00fasica siempre ha orbitado a mi alrededor, incluso desde que estaba en la barriga de mi mam\u00e1, Fabiola, ya que ella es m\u00fasico por convicci\u00f3n, aunque la vida la haya llevado a enfrentar otros retos. Incluso tengo memoria del primer bolero que me aprend\u00ed (Deseo), cuando a\u00fan no hab\u00eda nacido, y que mi mam\u00e1 lo cantaba en mi 8\u00ba mes de gestaci\u00f3n. Soy profesional en Finanzas y Relaciones Internacionales, de la Universidad Externado de Colombia en Bogot\u00e1, con diploma y todo, aunque \u00e9ste repose y acumule capas de polvo en alg\u00fan caj\u00f3n, pero siempre supe que mi destino estaba guiado por canciones. He hecho toda la escuela que un m\u00fasico de la calle puede hacer. He cantado en serenatas, con media de aguardiente Tapa Roja como \u00fanico pago, he cantado en bares de diferentes tama\u00f1os y diversos estilos, he amenizado almuerzos, fiestas de 15 a\u00f1os, bautizos, cap\u00edtulos de novelas, y hasta alg\u00fan velorio, y tuve bar propio cantado canciones ajenas. Fue all\u00ed donde tuve la oportunidad de conocer y perfeccionar el oficio de cantar en vivo, noche tras noche, haciendo de la comunicaci\u00f3n entre el artista y la gente nuestra virtud m\u00e1s relevante. Alguien me dijo alguna vez que la m\u00fasica me hab\u00eda salvado la vida, y estoy de acuerdo. Es lo que mejor se hacer, ya que mi zurda nunca fue prodigiosa con el bal\u00f3n, qu\u00e9 otra cosa quedaba por hacer? Cuando uno es un peque\u00f1\u00edn siempre dice: \u201cQuiero ser futbolista, o m\u00fasico, o Superman\u201d, por suerte le pegu\u00e9 a una de las tres. Las canciones me vienen del alma, y no conozco otra manera de escribir, y quisiera pensar que cuando alguien oye alguna de mis canciones, en un disco, en la radio, o en un concierto, es all\u00ed, al alma, el lugar al cual llegar\u00e1. Y escribo de amor, en todas sus formas, incluido el desamor, su forma m\u00e1s cruel. Mi equipaje para llegar a \u00e9ste \u201cCruce de Caminos\u201d lo componen 2 discos, anteriores, muchos amores y varias traiciones, una visita al infierno, y un auto-descubrimiento de lo que soy. En 2003 sali\u00f3 al mercado \u201cSolo hasta hoy\u201d, con \u201cNo mires atr\u00e1s\u201d y \u201cUna y otra vez\u201d como banderas, y en el 2006 sali\u00f3 \u201cSentidos\u201d, donde fueron \u201cAcabado\u201d y \u201cTus Regalos\u201d las canciones m\u00e1s importantes, comercialmente hablando. \u00c9stos dos cap\u00edtulos musicales me han brindado varios de los momentos m\u00e1s emocionantes de mi vida, siendo el m\u00e1s importante la respuesta de la gente frente a mis canciones, pero tambi\u00e9n me permiti\u00f3 conocer a varios de mis \u00eddolos, y compartir escenario y canciones con ellos, artistas como Alejandro Sanz, Pablo Milan\u00e9s, Miguel Bos\u00e9, Fito P\u00e1ez y Franco de Vita, han salpicado e inspirado con su arte lo que hago, y he tenido la fortuna de abrir sus shows, y en algunos casos cantar hombro a hombro en el escenario. Ahora estamos frente a \u00e9ste \u201cCruce de Caminos\u201d, desde que escrib\u00ed la primera de las 30 canciones que compuse para \u00e9ste \u00e1lbum hasta ahora han pasado 23 meses, muchos \u00e1ngeles, y 2 viajes a Espa\u00f1a, y ha sido un camino maravilloso. Espero que las canciones que seleccionamos les gusten, en palabras de Nacho Ma\u00f1\u00f3, el productor musical de \u00e9ste disco, y mi hermano del alma, \u201ces un disco sincero, personal y sincero, algo cada vez m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de encontrar en \u00e9ste negocio\u201d. \u201cCREO EN SECRETOS, Y EN EL ARTE COMO FORMA DE VIDA, CREO EN QUE TODO SE DEVUELVE, EN EL MISTERIO Y LA AVENTURA.

After four decades of singing background for icons like the Rolling Stones, Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, and Nine Inch Nails, Lisa is finally offering her own humble, heartfelt song, accompanied by her inventive new band Grand Baton. The past 18 months have been a whirlwind, with performances at the Newport and Monterey Jazz Festivals, at the Hollywood Bowl, and in major cities all over the world. The unexpected success of the Oscar-winning documentary Twenty Feet from Stardom (2013) altered the course of Lisa's musical journey. The film told her story, complete with clips of her 1991 Grammy-winning R&B hit \"How Can I Ease The Pain,\" live footage of her legendary duets with Mick Jagger on \"Gimme Shelter,\" and glowing testimonials from famous colleagues like Sting, Patti Austin, and Chris Botti. It showcased her virtuosity and vulnerability, opened a window on her sometimes lonely life on the road, earned her a second Grammy award, and left audiences eager to see and hear more. Lisa set out on her first tour with no recordings or video to help book and promote shows, headlining first in small clubs, moving quickly to festivals and concert halls. Journalists, music business insiders, and supporters jumped in to spread the word. \"Her glamorous-girl-next-door quality makes fans all over the world think she's their own secret discovery.\" (Broadway World) \"A sublime experience,\" \"phenomenal times infinity,\" \"mind blowing,\" \"an intangible souvenir that will remain in our hearts and minds forever.\" (Facebook followers) \"Transcendental!\"(The Huffington Post) \"She brought down the house in the single best show I\u2019ve seen in the many years I\u2019ve visited Birdland.\" (The New York Times) \"You know you're in the presence of greatness when the hair on the back of your neck stands up. On her own stage, [Fischer] exuded supreme confidence. The display of vocal magic was mesmerizing . . . quiet and subtle until the mighty shout was unleashed . . . .\" (The Edmonton Sun) \"[A] wondrous instrument that can seamlessly blend classical, jazz, soul, gospel, rock and folk.\" (Minneapolis Star Tribune). Lisa has found ideal co-conspirators in Grand Baton. The band's organic fusion of African, Middle Eastern, and Caribbean rhythms, psychedelic soul, and progressive rock awakens and ignites Lisa's flexibility and freedom of expression. \"Collectively they bring amazing musicianship, hearts and souls and most importantly a sense of playfulness,\" she says. \"It's a dream to be sonically surrounded with this kind of sensitivity and care.\" The band has helped her realize her lifelong desire to make music that heals but still rocks the house. In performance, she draws from an eclectic palette of influences, whether putting her stamp on Led Zeppelin and Little Willie John or recasting rock anthems from her tours with the Stones and Tina Turner. While Lisa's range is legendary, her greatest gift is the ability to connect, to reach the hearts of her listeners. Raised in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, Lisa emerged from New York's fervent studio scene in the early-1980s and quickly became session singer royalty. She paid her dues as a member of the Marvelettes before legendary vocalist Luther Vandross invited her to sing background with his touring band. He became her mentor and friend, nurturing her talent over a 20-year period until his untimely passing in 2005. During Lisa's two decades working with Luther, her voice also powered albums by a constellation of music legends including Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan, Bobby McFerrin, George Benson, Diana Ross, Laurie Anderson, Teddy Pendergrass, Dionne Warwick, Grover Washington, Billy Ocean, Melba Moore, Al Jarreau, Patti LaBelle, and other major recording artists. Lisa joined the Rolling Stones on tour for the first time for their 1989 Steel Wheels tour; she has graced their stage for 26 years. When the spotlight catches Lisa singing with Mick Jagger she is a quintessential rock and roll goddess, soaring above the band's earthy groove. \"It's always a high point in the show for me,\" says Mick. Keith Richards commends Lisa's \"amazing power, energy, and projection.\" In 1991, in the midst of touring with both the Stones and Luther Vandross, Lisa recorded a solo album, So Intense, for Elektra Records. \"I used members of my session singing community on the CD, so I felt surrounded by love,\" she says. \"The most difficult thing was finding the right music. It was also the most exciting thing.\" The album featured Lisa's songwriting collaborations with producer Narada Michael Walden on both the Top 10 R&B hit \"Save Me\" and the number one and Grammy-winning R&B single \"How Can I Ease the Pain.\" Lisa also won the Grammy for \"Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female,\" an honor she shared with Patti LaBelle, whose award-winning project Burnin' also featured Lisa on background vocals. Though she continued to record for soundtracks and various studio projects, Lisa's career revolved around supporting other artists. Then, in 2011, the late Gil Friesen and director Morgan Neville approached Lisa when they began interviewing singers for Twenty Feet from Stardom, a feature-length documentary celebrating the contributions of background vocalists. Alongside vocal trailblazers like Darlene Love and Merry Clayton, Lisa candidly discussed the delicate balance between life and career, success and challenges, as well as the nuance of singing with other vocalists. \"Ms. Fischer has become the unexpected star of Mr. Neville's film,\" said the New York Times. \"She's the empress of that world,\" music legend Patti Austin declared in the film. \"That's a powerhouse voice. I think of her as a star,\" said Sting. Between her down-to-earth persona in interview footage, her vocal mastery in archival clips, and her multi-tracked performance of Samuel Barber's \"Sure on This Shining Night,\" Lisa moved viewers with her voice, her soft-spoken charm, and her thought-provoking insights. \"This movie is going to make Lisa Fischer a star,\" said music industry pundit Bob Lefsetz. \"And she deserves it, because she's just that damn good. Whether fronting her own band or supporting other artists, Lisa's passion for music in all its forms leads her to constant growth and experimentation with different styles. She recorded the title track for Billy Childs' all-star tribute to Laura Nyro, Map to the Treasure (2014), collaborated with YoYo Ma and Gregory Porter, and co-created music with J.C. Maillard for the Alonzo King LINES Ballet. \"It's an exciting new chapter for an artist who had early career success but eschewed the trappings of celebrity in favor of the satisfaction of making honest music every night,\" Broadway World observes. With spiritual truth-telling as her compass and loving kindness as her guide, Ms. Lisa Fischer is on a creative journey, destination unknown. \"Inspiration is all around,\" said Lisa in a recent interview with New York's Daily News. \"My heart is wide open and I\u2019m in love with the thought of singing to anyone who wishes to listen.\" \" I just want to sing.\"", "otherInfo": "Lisa Fischer in concert is addictive. Every performance is so enriching, so exciting, so transcendent that you want more. With remarkable vocal range and vocabulary, Fischer can sing soul, jazz, rock, gospel, pop, folk and classical with equal facility and authority. She often mixes styles in the same song, sometimes in the same vocal line. Her approach tends to be intimate, artful and almost meditative, accompanied by her interpretive dancing, but she also can cut loose and funk with fierceness and rock with abandon."}, {"Address": "881 7th Ave, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "The New York Pops", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9161478.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.980276, 40.764881], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Stern Auditorium / Perelman Stage at Carnegie Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Saluting the power of the female voice, The New York Pops pays tribute to Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, Barbra Streisand, Adele, and fellow icons who have transformed the world through song.

But Norie\u2019s expertise in selecting dancehall also resonated with a mainstream listenership, as he found out when he joined up with (hip hop) DJ Self as one of six deejays comprising a collective called Da Union, which enabled him to take dancehall into several (Manhattan) clubs where it had previously been excluded. This led to a few guest appearances on Power 105.1 FM, and eventually his Sunday night show on the station, which has contributed to his enviable status as America\u2019s most influential radio personality for dancehall reggae. As such, Norie is usually the first to transform a core dancehall anthem into an international hit, which he recently did with Stephen and Damian Marley\u2019s single \u201cJah Army\u201d, featuring Buju Banton.\n\nNorie is also the personal deejay for Beenie Man, with whom he travels whenever the artist has a show outside of Jamaica and he has also toured with Elephant Man, Bounty Killer, Mavado and Serani. On March 30, 2011 at New York City\u2019s BB King\u2019s nightclub, Norie made history selecting the rhythms for seven time Grammy winner Stephen Marley\u2019s first performance done solely to backing tracks (that is, without his band\u2019s accompaniment); Marley headlined Norie\u2019s two year anniversary party for his Power 105 show, which was also the one year anniversary celebration for his immensely popular monthly live concert series, \u201cAnything Goes\u201d. \u201cStephen was a little hesitant at first, because he never performed to tracks before, but he did it and he was happy about it, so it is a great experience to have under my belt,\u201d Norie shares.\n\nNorie has recently partnered on several projects with Queens New York based VP Records, the largest independent reggae label in the world. He selects the music at each of VP\u2019s album release parties and the label\u2019s artists are regularly showcased at his \u201cAnything Goes\u201d series. For VP Records\u2019 \u201cReggae Gold 2011\u201d, a collection of the year\u2019s biggest reggae hits, Da Reggae Don provided a vibrant, 35-minute bonus mix CD, rife with artists\u2019 shout-outs to Norie (including 2011 Celebrity Apprentice winner/country superstar John Rich) and customized renditions of popular songs. Additionally, Norie has just started recording artists on his own dancehall rhythms and he plans to release those tracks as part of his own compilation series sometime in the near future.\n\nEach of Norie\u2019s endeavors is in pursuit of his ultimate goal: expanding the overall popularity of Caribbean music, especially dancehall reggae, the music that inspired his career path almost 20 years ago. \u201cMy radio show has served a lot of purposes; not only did it allow my fans to get to know me but it allowed me to give back to this music game,\u201d Norie explains. \u201cBut I would like to get further in radio, be more than just a deejay because then I can help reggae by impressing upon program directors that New York\u2019s Caribbean population is really an untapped market that no one is paying attention to so why not go out and support it? We don\u2019t have to follow the same trends that everyone has been doing for years and years, we can do things differently, add on and make it much stronger.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "198 Broadway, Amityville, NY 11701", "Artist": "Gimme Gimme Disco", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9668478.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.41742, 40.67899], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Disco, Funk", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Amityville Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Welcome to the 70's Disco Dance Party Inspired by ABBA", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1465 Jerome Ave., The Bronx, NY 10452", "Artist": "Mas", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6211977.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.91711, 40.841353], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Indierap, Jazz, Electronic", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Patron Night Club", "moreBioInfo": "http://masofficial.com http://www.youtube.com/masoffiziell https://soundcloud.com/ichbinmas http://instagram.com/ichbinmas", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "65 Wall St, Huntington, NY 11743", "Artist": "The Amazing Smokin\u2019 J\u2019s", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9867661.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.42811, 40.873593], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Barmani\u2019s Bar & Kitchen", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "152 Metropolitan Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11249", "Artist": "Cliff Westfall", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8666899.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.96214, 40.715906], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Skinny Dennis", "moreBioInfo": "Cliff Westfall is a NYC-area musician known for his clever, literate update on classic country songwriting and killer live performances.

Avec des influences de T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, Led Zeppelin ou encore des Rolling Stones, KANDY propose un Rock 100% made in France. Leur musique \u00e9voque, au rythme des accords, les r\u00eaves et le mal-\u00eatre de toute une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration. Des odeurs de voyages, de souvenirs et des tranches de vie choisies s\u2019entrem\u00ealent et vous transportent le temps d\u2019une chanson dans un autre monde, le leur. En Janvier 2009, KANDY signe chez Akamusic gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 294 producteurs, son 1er EP \"Je Pars\", et devient le 1er groupe de Rock fran\u00e7ais produit par le grand public. Leur premier single \"Je Pars\" sorti en septembre 2009 fut diffus\u00e9 par plus de 65 radios FM en France et en Belgique et sur de tr\u00e8s nombreuses web radios. 2010 marquera un tournant, avec la signature d'un 1er Album \u00ab Ce Petit Monde \u00bb( Akamusic/Universal) produit par 1018 producteurs et port\u00e9 par les singles \u00ab De ses mains \u00bb et \u00ab La Comptine \u00bb qui s\u00e9duiront un grand nombre de radios (Champagne FM, NRJ French, Goom Radio, et d'autres....). On se souvient encore du concert de lancement de l\u2019album au Sentier des Halles \u00e0 guichets ferm\u00e9s avec une salle chaleureuse reprenant en ch\u0153ur les titres phares de leur 1er Album (Je Pars, Le Temps me Lasse, L'Ange Masqu\u00e9...) . La presse sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e (Rock'N Folk, Rolling Stone, Rock One) fut unanime et accueillit \u00ab Ce Petit Monde \u00bb avec grand int\u00e9r\u00eat procurant ainsi a cette formation de tr\u00e8s beaux articles. KANDY donna \u00e9galement un grand nombre d'interviews radios (Virgin Radio Champagne, Goom Radio Rock It, NRJ Nord, France Bleue Champagne, Cigale FM, Radio Primitive, RJR, Radio fajet, et d\u2019autres...) et dans la presse locale. 2011 fut l'ann\u00e9e des concerts de promotion permettant au groupe de se perfectionner et d\u2019accueillir un nouveau guitariste Raphael Marmarosi. En janvier 2012 le contrat avec Akamusic \u00e9tant \u00e9chu, Gregory Pittet quitte le groupe et est remplac\u00e9 par Erwan Chandon \u00e0 la batterie.

On March 30, 2011 at New York City\u2019s BB King\u2019s nightclub, Norie made history selecting the rhythms for seven time Grammy winner Stephen Marley\u2019s first performance done solely to backing tracks (that is, without his band\u2019s accompaniment); Marley headlined Norie\u2019s two year anniversary party for his Power 105 show, which was also the one year anniversary celebration for his immensely popular monthly live concert series, \u201cAnything Goes\u201d. \u201cStephen was a little hesitant at first, because he never performed to tracks before, but he did it and he was happy about it, so it is a great experience to have under my belt,\u201d Norie shares.\n\nNorie has recently partnered on several projects with Queens New York based VP Records, the largest independent reggae label in the world. He selects the music at each of VP\u2019s album release parties and the label\u2019s artists are regularly showcased at his \u201cAnything Goes\u201d series. For VP Records\u2019 \u201cReggae Gold 2011\u201d, a collection of the year\u2019s biggest reggae hits, Da Reggae Don provided a vibrant, 35-minute bonus mix CD, rife with artists\u2019 shout-outs to Norie (including 2011 Celebrity Apprentice winner/country superstar John Rich) and customized renditions of popular songs. Additionally, Norie has just started recording artists on his own dancehall rhythms and he plans to release those tracks as part of his own compilation series sometime in the near future.\n\nEach of Norie\u2019s endeavors is in pursuit of his ultimate goal: expanding the overall popularity of Caribbean music, especially dancehall reggae, the music that inspired his career path almost 20 years ago. \u201cMy radio show has served a lot of purposes; not only did it allow my fans to get to know me but it allowed me to give back to this music game,\u201d Norie explains. \u201cBut I would like to get further in radio, be more than just a deejay because then I can help reggae by impressing upon program directors that New York\u2019s Caribbean population is really an untapped market that no one is paying attention to so why not go out and support it? We don\u2019t have to follow the same trends that everyone has been doing for years and years, we can do things differently, add on and make it much stronger.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "399 NJ-10, Randolph, NJ 07869", "Artist": "Lisa Coppola Music Page", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10047909.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.558825, 40.863764], "Date": "Fri Feb 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-14", "Genre": "Genres: Country, Country Blues, Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Mr. Crabby's Craft Kitchen & Bar", "moreBioInfo": "ELEVATOR PITCH:\nLISA COPPOLA is a lifelong Jersey Girl who is a dedicated & gifted singer/songwriter with a 4 1/2 octave range blurring lines between love-gone-bad country, confrontational rock & the Blues.

He began his musical journey at the age 12, playing saxophone, flute and drums, and eventually, exclusively drums. He played mostly jazz all through his teens. After earning a BA in History from Wagner College in 1973, and after studying with Jack DeJohnette, Bob Moses and Steve Haas he moved to NYC in 1975 to pursue his musical career. From 1975 to 1984 Baratta played gigs in and around NYC and other locales. Some of his bandmates and associations were with John Stubblefield, Joe Ford, Frank Strozier, Hal Galper, Mike Richmond, Saheb Sarbib, Dennis Irwin, Vernon Reid, Billy Bang, Jack Wilkens, Ryo Kawasaki, Jessica Hagedorn and the Gangster Choir, Guilherme Franco, Pe De Boi, Cyro Baptista, and a very memorable one day hit with Hank Mobley and then Johnny Hartman.\n\nIn 1984, Baratta decided to dramatically alter paths, and pursued a career in movie production. \"Money was tight, the gigs were hard to come by, and I was getting married and wanted to raise a family. It was just time for a very tough decision that had to be made. I looked back many times and terribly missed the joy in playing and the camaraderie with the musicians. It was a total about face, but I have no regrets, except missing the live performance.\"\n\nSince working on his his film, Desperately Seeking Susan in 1984, Baratta has worked on over 50 movies, first as a Location Manager, then Unit Production Manager, and for the past 15 years as a Co-Producer and Executive Producer. A small sampling of his films is Martin Scorsese\u2019s soon-to-be-released The Irishman, Dr.Strange, The Wolf of Wall Street, five Spiderman movies,Too Big To Fail, Taking Pelham 123, Across the Universe, Donnie Brasco, Working Girl, and Big. Currently he is Executive Producing Romeo, a film staring Joaquin Phoenix. For a full listing of Baratta's film credits, visit IMDb: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0053102\n\nDuring the past 33 years of movie making it never prevented Baratta from regularly listening to and attending music at most all the clubs in NYC and festivals elsewhere. As best he could, he tried to maintain relationships with his past bandmates and stay up on the jazz scene. However, with the exception of the occasional one nite gig every few years, Baratta essentially remained on the sidelines when it came to performing. Then a very fortuitous event occurred.\n\nAn opportunity presented itself in the fall of 2016 that changed everything. He decided to return to his roots and main love and began performing music again, while continuing to produce films. From December 2016 to the present he has played with Eric Alexander, Vincent Herring, Walter Blanding, Marcus Printup, Bruce Harris, Gerald Cannon, Bill O\u2019Connell, Emmett Cohen, Jeb Patton, Steve Ash, Chris Pattishal, Mike LeDonne, Ray Gallon, Danny Nimmer, Jerry Weldon, Rogerio Bocatto, Paul Bollenback, Dave Stryker, Mike Goetz, Essiet Essiet, Yoshi Waki, and many others. From Baratta\u2019s lips, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m in heaven. I just want to keep it going. A light has gone off in my head and the music seems clearer and fresher than ever.\u201d\n\nBaratta currently resides in Tenafly, N.J.

This one word is a critical part of what defines a \u201cgreat DJ.\u201d In a world with so many DJ\u2019s, basic skills are no longer enough to separate oneself from the masses. Clients booking DJ\u2019s for nightlife or corporate events, or to provide the soundtrack for one of the most important days in a person\u2019s or couple\u2019s life, should expect more.\n\nSo, what exactly is it that makes a DJ memorable? First a DJ must possess a far-reaching personal knowledge of music spanning multiple genres, allowing them to curate a soundtrack containing expected, and unexpected, tracks for a given night or event. Second, a DJ must incorporate innovative mixing techniques throughout their set to keep the crowd on their toes fully engaged in the music wondering where the DJ will go next. And third, a DJ must possess the experience that will allow them to read their crowd and deliver music which will make every night and every event epic.\n\nThe New York DJ Collective strives to embody what makes a DJ memorable. They are a group of DJs who respect the history of the art form, while staying on top of current trends to remain relevant in the DJ culture. The Collective, as a group, bring 20+ years of both nightlife and private event experience to the table.

Raven began creating a sound which was rooted in British hard rock, with progressive rock tendencies, and a willingness to take musical chances. The band's highly-energized live show and interaction between band members developed an image and style of play-the-band, described as \"athletic\". They began wearing guards, helmets, and plates from various sports (hockey, baseball, etc...), and incorporating them into the playing of their instruments (for instance, elbow pads and hockey masks were used to strike cymbals for a unique performance angle). They also opened for punk bands the Stranglers and the Motors. Early years Eventually, the band signed with Neat Records, the legendary, low-budget metal label of the North. They released Rock Until You Drop in 1981, and Wiped Out in 1982, making an impressive showing on the UK charts at the time. Sufficient noise was made for the American market to take notice and New Jersey's Megaforce Records signed them, issuing their next recording in the States as All for One in 1983. The band came stateside in 1983, and toured extensively with Megaforce bands Metallica and Anthrax, both of whom would gain a place of prominence in the growing thrash metal movement.[citation needed] Commercial success Manager/Megaforce founder Johnny Zazula believed that Raven was major-label material, and kept them touring constantly until the big labels noticed. The infamous Live at the Inferno recording, released in 1984, was a product of one of those tours. Atlantic Records signed Raven to a worldwide contract after a minor bidding war (major label contracts would follow for Metallica and Anthrax in the following year). The band moved its permanent base from Newcastle to New York. Stay Hard was released in 1985, and proved a minor hit on the strength of single/video \"On and On\". The Atlantic years proved to be less than stellar for the band. A drastic shift in a more commercial direction came at the label's behest, with many die-hard fans being alienated by the slick, lightweight production of The Pack Is Back. However, the band recorded two more studio albums and the Mad EP before leaving Atlantic. After the tour for Life's a Bitch, Rob \"Wacko\" Hunter left the band in late 1987 to spend more time with his new wife and family. He would later pursue a career in audio production and engineering, eventually working with jazz greats Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick, Jr.. Later years Virginian Joe Hasselvander (ex-Pentagram) joined as drummer in late 1987, and the band dropped the outlandish image for a more conventional denim-and-leather look for their 1988 release Nothing Exceeds Like Excess. After, the advent of grunge and the dissolution of their record label Combat Records led the band to concentrate on continental Europe and Japan, where they retained more of a following. Recent events The band recorded and toured until 2001, when a wall collapsed on guitarist Mark Gallagher, crushing his legs. Raven went on hiatus for nearly 5 years, from 2001\u20132006, while the guitarist rehabilitated, though Raven never officially disbanded. Raven came back on th elive front playing European festivals in 2005/2006 and started work on the album \"Walk Through Fire\"which was released on 2010 to both critical & fan acclaim. The band consolidated on this success playing in Europe, Japan, and South America. In 2015 the band released \"Extermination\" and recieved even better reviews & acclaim...the band did a 43 date US tour in 2014 & a 40 date Euro tour in 2015 ...currently the band plan Euro festivals & a tour for 2017 & to start work on a new album in the fall. In 2009, the band Released \"Walk Through Fire\" Through King Records in Japan. In 2010 the band signed with Metal Blade in the US and SPV in Europe.

When members from each group were drafted, the remaining members, under the guidance of their English teacher Beverly Hamilton, joined forces and changed the name to \"The Stylistics\". After working locally for a few years, the group was approached by Bill Perry, who asked if they\u2019d be interested in recording. Their first song, \"You're a Big Girl Now\" was recorded at Virtue Recording Studio in Philadelphia. The song was written by their guitarist at the time, Robert \"Doc\" Douglas and Road Manager, Marty Bryant. The song was soon picked up in the tri-state area, and before long, it became a The #1 hit in Philadelphia and other cities.\nInterested in promoting the record nationally, Bill Perry contacted Avco Records and made a deal. After the success of \"You're A Big Girl Now\", Avco wanted to follow up with an album release. Hit veteran producer Tom Bell was contacted and was hired to produce the group's first album titled \"The Stylistics\", and from that album came \"Stop, Look, Listen to your Heart\", \"You Are Everything\" and \"Betcha By Golly Wow\". The success of this album was phenomenal. The ball continued to roll with the release of their second album titled \"Round Two\". The Stylistics were becoming known as the Philly group with the sweet love songs.\n\nHerbert Murrell and Airrion Love are the remaining original members of The Stylistics. Friends since junior high school, Herb and Airrion have managed to keep their institution of 70's music alive. It was thought to be the end of The Stylistics following the departure of their original lead singer, but as in life, THE SHOW MUST GO ON. Their new lead singer, Grammy Award winning recording artist, Barrington \u201cBo\u201d Henderson, began his professional career with groups such as The Dramatics and Lakeside. Later in his career, Bo Henderson became lead singer of the world-renowned group, The Temptations, and was featured on their album Phoenix Rising, which went on to become almost double platinum. He was also a vocalist on the album Ear-Resistible, and helped win The Temptations a Grammy Award.

Thile had set himself a formidable musical challenge and, as befits this enthusiastically risk-embracing artist, he was more than up to the task. In addition to traveling, planning, rehearsing, and performing on the fifteen episodes of APHC\u2019s 2016\u201317 season, Thile managed each week to create a funny, topical, and at times quite poignant new song he would play with a rotating cast of APHC band-mates and guest stars. These were not throwaway radio bits, but smart, fully realized compositions. They served the needs of the show but were just as timely and engaging on their own.\n\nIn July 2017, Thile went into New York City\u2019s Reservoir Studios with producer and longtime friend Thomas Bartlett and that\u2019s when these songs gained an even deeper resonance. As they listened through the APHC versions, Thile and Bartlett realized that, taken together, these songs could form an album-length narrative. Part of the story Thile found was autobiographical. Thanks for Listening represents perhaps the most direct and personal material Thile has ever recorded. It reflects the changes to his own peripatetic life as he assumes a new role as APHC host and, behind the scenes, as a new dad\u2014while continuing to play with his band Punch Brothers and collaborate with such artists as Brad Mehldau, Edgar Meyer, and Yo-Yo Ma. We learn what delights him (like the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series,) and what alarms him (the polarized state of our nation post-election). But Thile also tells a broader tale\u2014satirically, wistfully, frankly\u2014 about the divisions and disconnects plaguing America today, whether it\u2019s on social media or at the Thanksgiving table. The overarching theme, Thile realized, was about the art of listening\u2014the joys of it, the current difficulties of it, and the necessity of hearing what others have to say, not just the overwhelming desire to be heard.\n\nListening, or the lack thereof, figures prominently on several tracks: \u201cFeedback Loop\u201d lampoons the way social media filters out all but those one agrees with, while \u201cModern Friendship\u201d rues the way old pals can drift apart\u2014and suggests that maybe sharing a well-made night cap could help solve that. \u201cStanley Ann\u201d is a graceful imagining of what Barack Obama might have said to his late mom as he departed the White House in January. The deceptively cheerful \u201cFalsetto,\u201d on the other hand, is an all-too-kind speculation on how the current occupant of the White House might gracelessly scold an activist entertainer\u2014managing to insult the singer\u2019s \u201cgirly falsetto\u201d in the process.\n\n\u201cMy initial working title was Get It out on the Radio\u201d (the name of the song he performs at the end of each APHC episode). But the album pivoted away from the show and toward the listeners\u2014and not just to the listeners of Prairie Home but to anyone who listens to things. They are my heroes\u2014people who listen. I find myself all too often on the other side of the conversation, talking about what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s hard to maintain focus or give something enough attention to appreciate it. We\u2019re in a place where listening is a precious commodity. That\u2019s the theme that I noticed rising up, greater than \u2018here is what was happening last week\u2019 or \u2018here is the place we were.\u2019 It\u2019s a celebration of people who haven\u2019t switched off, despite being given every reason to do so.\u201d\n\nThe arrangements have an intimate, dream-like quality to them; the songs feel like reveries, not statements. Thile\u2019s voice is at times double- or triple-tracked, cossetted by subtle echo. He delivers vocal takes that are by turns wry and soulful, frequently deploying a lovely falsetto in an especially evocative way, more Beach Boys than bluegrass. The chorus of \u201cThank You, New York,\u201d performed with singer Gaby Moreno, is a vocal stand-out, a nose-thumbing good riddance to the turbulent year that was 2016 (and a nod to the resilience of New York City and its occupants). Thile\u2019s mandolin playing remains front and center\u2014and it the sole instrument on \u201cBalboa\u201d \u2014but it is often bolstered by Bartlett\u2019s subtle, slightly mysterious, layering of keyboards and electronics.\n\n\u201cI was deeply desirous of a record that sounded like it was coming from your own head. That\u2019s where we veered away from a more archival studio approach\u2014where you go in, perform the songs, and record exactly how those performances sounded,\u201d Thile says. \u201cThe recordings on Thank You for Listening are more fanciful in construction.\n\n\u201cOftentimes I would be at the big room of Reservoir Studios making maps of these songs with whatever stringed instruments seemed appropriate and singing scratch vocals. Then Thomas would take them into his little room and start experimenting on them. And I would start the next map,\u201d he continues. \u201cI would get my pass by having written the song and having created a keep-able demo of the song and then Thomas would get his pass without me looking over his shoulder, telling him \u2018that\u2019s not how it goes.\u2019 Which I\u2019m unable to not do if I\u2019m in the room. It was like an editor editing a novel.\u201d\n\nLike Thile, multi-instrumentalist Bartlett is a musical polymath, comfortable in diverse collaborative situations. He often sits in with the National; he plays piano in the Irish Music group The Gloaming; and he occasionally performs on his own under the Doveman moniker. Rather than enlisting a full APHC-style band in the studio, the pair conceived the project largely as a musical dialogue between them\u2014a listening session of their own, if you will.\n\nThile manned all the stringed instruments, save for bass (from Alan Hampton) and viola (from Nadia Sirota, on the title track). Ted Poor\u2014like Hampton, a member of Andrew Bird\u2019s touring band\u2014played drums on five tracks. Bartlett provided, in Thile\u2019s words, \u201cwhatever sounds weren\u2019t accounted for.\u201d Thile also invited three guest singers to the sessions, all of whom had performed multiple times on APHC: Sarah Jarosz, Gaby Mereno, and Aoife O\u2019 Donovan. He says, \u201cAll three had made really meaningful contributions to how the songs ended up expressing themselves. That goes for all the musicians who played on this last APHC season. They all made such meaningful contributions to these songs. I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d\n\nThe original \u201cSong of the Week\u201d versions can be easily accessed via YouTube, now that all the APHC shows are live-streamed and subsequently archived. The performances are full of personality and humor, as Thile, a dependably energetic live performer, interacts with a roster of players that include various Punch Brothers, brilliant guitarist Julian Lage, and Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins of Nickel Creek. Contrasting these versions with the new studio recordings, one can appreciate the sort of magical transformation that took place at Reservoir Studios, one that was more about inspiration than analysis.\n\nThe process effected a transformation on Thile too: \u201cBefore hosting Prairie Home, I would listen to music much the way an athlete trains. Listening was like hitting the gym, like a pitcher strengthening his rotator cuff. I was listening to improve specific aspects of my musicianship or nourish it in specific ways. The hosting has brought me back into being a music lover, just listening with the idea of enjoying the three to five minutes of a performance, not worrying about whether it\u2019s rendering my sense of counterpoint more sophisticated or increasing my knowledge of how sonata form works or giving me more arrows in my improvisational quiver.\u201d He continues, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u2018do I like this? Is my life better since listening to this song?\u2019 That\u2019s what I care about now.\n\n\u201cI think that development led me to ask Thomas to produce Thanks for Listening,\u201d Thile concludes. \u201cHe and I have stayed up late drinking Amaro and listening to records. I often hold vast amounts of myself back to analyze things and Thomas would consistently play me things that would disarm that side of me. I was yearning to make a set of music that maybe hits more of those marks, to have some of that rub off on me. I hope I succeeded with Thanks for Listening.\u201d\n\n\u2014Michael Hill", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "123 W 43rd St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Ken Burns", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/239922.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.984563, 40.756023], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Emo, Punk", "Time": "5:45 PM", "Venue": "The Town Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Guests Include: Indigo Girls, Ken Burns and Lewis Black.

In 2012, he performed eight sell-out shows at The Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway. Lewis was born in Washington D.C. and raised in Silver Spring, MD. Colicky as a baby, it seems he was destined to be angry and easily irritated. His mother, a teacher, and his father, a mechanical engineer, instilled in both Lewis and his younger brother Ron the importance of education and the necessity to question authority; lessons which have influenced Lewis throughout his private and professional life. When Lewis was 12, his father took him to his first play and he quickly fell in love with the theatre. This ultimately led Lewis to pursue a career in drama. Degrees followed from the University of North Carolina and Yale Drama School, with a stint in Colorado owning a theatre with a group of friends in the interim. During his tenure at UNC, Lewis first ventured into stand-up, performing at Cat\u2019s Cradle in Chapel Hill. Stand-up continued to be a steady presence as he pursued his career in theatre. Lewis eventually settled in New York City and became the playwright-in-residence at the West Bank Caf\u00e9\u2019s Downstairs Theatre Bar. Lewis oversaw the development of more than 1,000 plays, including works by West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin, American Beauty writer Alan Ball as well as his own original works. In addition to overseeing the works on stage, Lewis emceed every show. As the West Bank grew, so did Lewis\u2019 skill as a stand-up and eventually, the fulfilment of performing stand-up outweighed that of working in the theater. Having found his public voice, Lewis left the West Bank in the late 80\u2019s to pursue stand-up full time. In 1996, his friend Lizz Winstead tapped him to create a weekly segment for a show she was producing on Comedy Central called The Daily Show. The segment, a three minute rant about whatever was bothering him at the moment, evolved into Back in Black. It became one of the most popular and longest running segments on the show and also created a long and successful relationship with the network. Since then, Lewis has taped four specials for the Comedy Central Presents series, co-created Last Laugh with Lewis Black, presided over Lewis Black\u2019s The Root of All Evil, and continues to perform Back in Black on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. His popular appearances on Comedy Central helped to win him Best Male Stand-Up at the American Comedy Awards in 2001. Increased exposure from The Daily Show eventually generated a record deal with Stand Up! Records. His first CD, The White Album, was released in 2000 to much critical acclaim. Lewis followed with eight more, six under the Comedy Central Records label. He has been graced with 5 Grammy nominations and two wins for his work. The first nomination came in 2006 for Luther Burbank Performing Arts Center Blues, the second in 2009 for Anticipation. In 2007 he won the Grammy for Best Comedy Album for The Carnegie Hall Performance and in 2011, his second for Stark Raving Black. His most recent release, In God We Rust (Comedy Central Records) was nominated for a Grammy. He\u2019s filmed two specials for HBO, Black On Broadway and Red, White and Screwed. The latter was nominated for an Emmy in 2007. He had a regular feature for two seasons on Inside the NFL (for which he earned a Sports Emmy) and in 2006 was honored to be asked to participate in Comic Relief. In 2009 Lewis filmed his first feature length concert film, Stark Raving Black at the Fillmore Theatre in Detroit. The film had a limited run in theaters across the US and Canada in the summer of 2010. At the end of the theater run, premium movie channel EpixHD picked up the film for its channel along with the accompanying documentary Basic Black. Both are still aired regularly and can be found in the EpixHD on demand queue. 2011 found him producing his second full length concert, In God We Rust, which also still airs on EpixHD. A much sought after guest for several late-night television shows, he\u2019s been seen on Larry King Live, Piers Morgan Tonight, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, The Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O\u2019 Brian and the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. He\u2019s also had numerous appearances on CNN and MSNBC and has occasionally announced the weather with Al Roker. In the midst of a rigorous touring schedule, regular TV appearances and movie roles, Lewis has written three best selling books, Nothing\u2019s Sacred (Simon and Schuster, 2005), Me of Little Faith (Riverhead Books, 2008) and I\u2019m Dreaming of a Black Christmas (Riverhead Books, 2010). All garnered critical praise as well commercial success and spent numerous weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. As a playwright Lewis has penned over 40 plays, many of which have been produced around the country. The Deal, a dark comedy about business, was made into a short film in 1998 and picked up by the Sundance Channel. In 2011, his play One Slight Hitch was produced at the Williamstown Theatre Festival and then again in 2012 at both the ACT Theatre in Seattle and The George Street Theatre in New Brunswick. In 2006, Lewis had a break out year as an actor. He co-starred with Robin Williams in Barry Levinson\u2019s Man of the Year (Universal Pictures), appeared as \u201cthe fake dean of a fake college\u201d in Steve Pink\u2019s Accepted (Universal Pictures) and as the harried airport manager in Paul Feig\u2019s Unaccompanied Minors (Warner Brothers). He also lent his voice to the role of \u201cJimmy\u201d in Bob Sagat\u2019s parody, Farce of the Penguins (Thinkfilm). In addition to his professional pursuits, Lewis is dedicated to a number of charitable organizations. As a long time mentor with the 52nd Street Project, Lewis was roasted in Charred Black 2007 which drew the largest fundraising numbers in the Project\u2019s history. He\u2019s a member of their Advisory Board, is Co-Chair of their Capital Campaign and in 2000, the Ron Black Memorial Scholarship Fund was created in memory of his late brother. Lewis is also committed to raising funds for the Rusty Magee Clinic for Families and Health. He\u2019s a strong supporter of both the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and Autism Speaks and was honored by The Brady Center for his commitment to ending gun violence. In 2012, he was honored by the ACLU of Georgia with their National Civil Liberties Award. At the Williamstown Theatre Festival, he established the William Foeller Fellowship, having taught and performed at the festival for more than a decade. Lewis also supports our military personnel and has performed in 3 tours with the USO where he visited several Middle East and European military bases with Robin Williams, Lance Armstrong, Kid Rock, Miss America Rachel Smith and Kellie Pickler. Today Lewis maintains residences in both Manhattan and Chapel Hill, NC. Still loyal to his alma mater, he\u2019s worked with UNC students to create the Carolina Comedy Festival, a yearly festival on the UNC campus that not only highlights performances, but also provides workshops and lectures for budding comics, writers and performers. With his involvement at UNC, Lewis continues a life-long commitment to education and the arts. In his leisure time, Lewis likes to play golf, even though golf hates him.

With 10 tracks and fifty one minutes long, their 19th full length album is the ultimate combination of sickening brutality and addictive melody. It was yet another incredible album cover design by Travis Smith that sparked the idea of what to name this next album. With 5 of the iconic Overkill winged skulls brooding powerfully around the table seemingly prepared for battle, \u00bbThe Wings Of War\u00ab simply rolled off the tongue.\n\nWith the fresh addition of seasoned drummer Jason Bittner (ex-Shadows Fall, Flotsam And Jetsam, Stigmata), OVERKILL is experiencing a new chemistry this time around, truly giving the record a unique feel. The writing was funneled through its familiar foundation, but now had a fresh influence and energy that inspired the entire band. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had an identity crisis,\u201d says frontman Bobby Blitz, \u201cbut we still like raising an eyebrow from time to time!\u201d Morphing into the modern day and taking advantage of the convenience of technological advances, this old school group of guys utilize technology for its instantaneous qualities that help fuel their momentum, and prevent the build up of stagnant ideas.\n\nAlthough Bassist DD Verni and guitarist Dave Linsk have their own recording set up, OVERKILL goes out of house for their drum recording to longtime friend Joey De Maio of Shorefire Studios in Long Branch New Jersey, and for their vocals to Johnny Rod of Rockland County New York. The the real guitar work gets accomplished at DD\u2019s studio, Blitz absorbs the sounds and fills in the guts with melodies, phonetics, dirty-sweet lyrics, and the songs develop organically.\n\nAlbum opener \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d is OVERKILL kicking the door in with a hard and loud tune that\u2019s rooted in some of the best angst that thrash possesses. Memories retained from this song are memories similar to the classic 80\u2019s vibe but with a new-age mechanical feel that thoroughly updates it. This was also the first song recorded with newcomer Jason Bittner.\n\nThe album\u2019s second single \u201cHead Of A Pin\u201d is a lyrical journey about disappointment and trust. Musically, the song comes across as \u201cBlack Sabbath on meth\u201d proclaims Blitz. It intertwines riffs and vocal melodies that pick it up into a real pounder and create something truly special.\n\n\u00bbThe Wings Of War\u00ab also holds something to look forward to for east coast metal heads with a track entitled \u201cWelcome To The Garden State.\u201d Bobby Blitz explains: \u201cIt\u2019s all about us. It\u2019s the way we grew up as kids, it\u2019s a certain attitude about the area, it\u2019s responding to \u201cwe don\u2019t do that where we\u2019re from\u201d with: \u201cwell guess what, you\u2019re not where you\u2019re from! You\u2019re here, now!\u201d The song sums up the New Jersey attitude with over 4 minutes of thrashy, punky, honest vibration, and defines OVERKILL, as well.\n\nWith at least the next six months already blocked off for a South American tour, followed by a U.S. tour, OVERKILL are on overdrive as usual with no signs of coming to a halt. This most recent cycle has a different feel; an old formula that evolved with new life and new breath and that after all these years, still generates an exquisite power.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1120 Manhattan Ave, New York, NY 11222", "Artist": "Blood Incantation", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9616252.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.955172, 40.736777], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Metal, Death Metal", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Saint Vitus Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Second show added by popular demand!

Her work is at once deeply personal and socially conscious, seriously funny and derisively tragic. Over five albums and a decade of recording, the Denver-born songwriter/guitarist/singer has tackled such topics as the death penalty, anorexia, shoplifting, reproduction, the French resistance movement, adolescence, and the Christian right. Did we mention love? Love found, love lost, love wished for and love taken away.\n\nWhile her songs cover a huge amount of ground, they all have benefit greatly from Jill's subtle intelligence and skillful light-handedness. No sloganeering flag-and-fist waving here, but rather story songs about human beings, real and imagined, which allow us to step back from the issue, be it personal or social, and relate to it as we would a close friend.\n\nTo see Jill live and in concert is a rare treat. It is on stage that she is most comfortable, most powerful, and where the delicacy and range of her work can be best appreciated. She entertains, amuses, provokes, and more often then not, takes her audiences on an emotional roller coaster, from comedy to pathos in a few bars of music.\n\nJill began playing guitar when she joined the Junior High School band. She never learned to read music, though, and faked her way through rehearsals and performances by playing by ear. As she began writing songs, it was very clear to Jill this was becoming more than a teenage hobby. Music was serious stuff. She played in a variety of funk and rock bands in Colorado, and eventually made her first, Todd Rundgren-produced, album for MCA, Things Here Are Different.\n\nBut success did not knock on her door until three years later, when Atlantic Records released her MTV staple and national top 20 hit, I Kissed A Girl. \"That song was a double-edged sword for me,\" Jill Says. \"It was perceived as a novelty hit, but on the other hand it was the first song with an overtly gay topic to be aired on Top 40 radio. I am quite proud of that.\" The self-titled album also yielded another hit song, Supermodel, included in the Clueless soundtrack.\n\nThe song also jumpstarted her live music career in a big way, and since then she's had the honor to induct Neil Diamond in the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, to share the stage with the likes of Neil Young (at his yearly Bridge School benefit concerts), fellow activists Billy Bragg & Steve Earle, and Waren Zevon. Quite the serious guitar player, she even toured the world as lead guitarist in Lloyd Cole's band a few years back.\n\nSince then, she has made four more critically acclaimed albums, Happy Town, Pink Pearl, Underdog Victorious, and 2009's California Years, which Jill released on her own record label, Pinko Records, after collecting over $85,000 from fans who funded the project.\n\nA veritable gypsy, Jill divides her time between a busy touring schedule and a variety of other projects. She has played the role of political troubadour for NPR stations across the country and for Air America Radio. She also served as songwriter/composer for the hit Nickelodeon network show Unfabulous during that show's three-season run. She composed the music for the off-Broadway show Prozak and the Platypus and co-starred in the Eric Schaeffer film Mind the Gap.\n\nIn the words of New York Times pop music critic Jon Pareles, \"Jill Sobule can claim her place among the stellar New York singer-songwriters of the last decade.

Now, the Brooklyn-born soul legend returns with his 5th album, BlackSUMMERS\u2019night, the long-awaited second installment of his trailblazing trilogy, a powerful reminder that great music really is about more than moving the twitter needle. Maxwell\u2019s reentry into the pop orbit straddles but never strains the fertile groundwork he\u2019s already laid as an R&B/soul pioneer. His seminal 1996 debut album, Maxwell\u2019s Urban Hang Suite, which the New York Times credited for \u2018turning away gangsta\u2019 machismo to reclaim the utopian spirit of 70s soul\u2026\u2019has been enthusiastically re-celebrated recently in an avalanche of commemorative articles marking the 20th anniversary of the genre spawning debut. His last album, 2009\u2019s #1 debuting, Grammy-winning BLACKsummers\u2019night and its signature single \u201cPretty Wings,\u201d (which owned the top spot on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles Chart for 4 and a half months) tamped down Chapter 1 of the sensual, pathfinding trilogy. The album landed on most critics\u2019 Year\u2019s Best lists and snared 2 Grammys, with Rolling Stone praising it as an \u2018album about love, not sex, for grown-ups who know the difference.\u2019 The ambitious follow-up reaffirms Maxwell\u2019s commitment to further the musical crossroads, even as he acknowledges his own reluctance to willingly let go of his own creations: \u201cI knew the new album was good, that it was done \u2013 but they still had to tear it from my hands to get it out,\u201d he says. Most revealingly, he admits to arriving at a \u2018good place\u2019 at 43 years of age, equipped with a keener sense of proportion about the seductive mystique he has come to represent. \u201cI think what messes up a lot of pop artists after they\u2019ve been down the road a bit is that the record becomes much more about their personal drama instead of the music. I\u2019m not going to disrespect anyone\u2019s hustle, but I\u2019m not interested in being a celebrity. Today, you have people purposely marketing their personal life into their music. With me, you\u2019re looking at a mom and pop store,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI need that spark that drives the music, but within that life I always want to create something that affects people emotionally and spiritually. At the end of the day that\u2019s what enables me to become secondary to the experience of the music.\u201d With sonic aspirations and priorities intact, and gathering many of the contributors on board for his previous albums, Maxwell says the \u2018operative\u2019 driving theme on the new album is \u2018summer.\u2019 The first single, the stunning \u201cLake By The Ocean\u201d kick-crosses diced-up drum grooves to the singer\u2019s undulating sensuality. His legendary vocal nuances are even richer now, commanding our attention with less on blackSUMMERS\u2019night, seductively shifting intonation and meaning as he reaches for more than just a reprise on the sequel; a master fully in charge of his instrument. It\u2019s all there on songs such as the album\u2019s boogie blast of an opener, \u201cAll The Ways Love Can Feel,\u201d and the intensely brewed confessional \u201cThe Fall\u201d; on the hopeful \u201cFingers Crossed,\u201d and bright funk of \u201cIII,\u201d where he furtively name-checks Michelle Obama. The free-floating blues-driven \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cListen Hear\u201d are also standouts, two songs that Maxwell says simply \u201cflowed through\u201d him in one take. He credits vigorous recording sessions with his longtime co-producer Hod David as bringing shape to the album. \u201cThe times change and the stakes get bigger, but when you\u2019ve worked with the same guy since you were 17 there\u2019s no faking it,\u201d he jokes. He once famously told Rolling Stone after the release of his debut that everyone he\u2019s ever admired possessed a public vulnerability \u2013 \u2018where the sensitivity is right there for you,\u2019 confessing, even then, that it\u2019s not always easy to come by \u2013 that \u2018sacrificing side,\u2019 as he coined it. It is here where the boundary crossing, inspirational Maxwell has always been the most prescientand approachable; open 24/7 to his long-held notion that the music is in the atmosphere, and that his best work has always channeled him. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what taking your time is really about,\u201d he ponders nearly 20 years later. \u201cBeing available. Ready.\u201d Nailing it on the riveting \u201cLost\u201d on the initial try - singing the song for the very first time - is ample evidence of being in tune to life\u2019s full effects. He likens the song in spirit, at least, to BLACKsummers\u2019night touchstone single \u201cPretty Wings\u201d \u2013 \u201cif \u201c\u2018Pretty Wings\u2019 ended up having children and going on,\u201d he laughs, marveling at how the former song is now played at weddings. \u201cThat song as intended is about breaking up and letting someone go and people now celebrate it at the most important gathering of their lives. But that\u2019s OK with me too,\u201d he says. Maxwell cites another nod to the inaugural album of the trilogy, \u201cFingers Crossed.\u201d \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s straight-up \u201cFistful Of Tears\u201d Part 2 \u2013 that feeling of wanting someone to feel good about being involved with you. But I want all my songs to have a life of their own. To be interpreted how people hear and feel them in the normal course of their lives.\u201d That unmediated connection to his audience has always been the lynchpin of Maxwell\u2019s career. Known for stoking libidinal fires long after his records and concerts subside, the LA Times once shrewdly observed he\u2019s also \u2018stayed true to his own internal clock, timing his (musical) pleas as they might unfold in real time,\u2019 rejecting the impulse to falsely heighten any moment. His 1996 debut masterpiece, Maxwell\u2019s Urban Hang Suite, was the rarest of gems, new and cognizant of the soul-standard bearers who came before. Groundbreaking permutations came in the form of iconic singles such as \u201cTil The Cops Come Knockin\u2019,\u201d and \u201cAscension (Don\u2019t Ever Wonder),\u201d among others. The then-23-year-old achieved universal praise and double platinum status for his debut, garnering a Grammy nomination. Maxwell\u2019s MTV; Unplugged came next, cementing his \u2018auteur\u2019 reputation and attracting universal acclaim for his diverse choice of material, including covers of indie breakthrough artists\u2019 Kate Bush and Nine Inch Nails. He went on to acclaimed platinum-plus successes with 1998\u2019s Embrya, and 2001\u2019s Now, enjoying sold-out tours and an ever-expanding loyal audience more than willing to grow with him.

Loved, hated, ridiculed, admired, Falling In Reverse frontman Ronnie Radke is the rare rock n\u2019 roll provocateur whose unpolished unpredictability and reckless honesty make him equal parts hero and villain, depending on whom you ask. Radke puts it all on the line, take it or leave it, each and every time Falling In Reverse does anything.\n\nJust Like You finds Falling In Reverse\u2019s leader with no shortage of material to sing, scream and howl about. In the roughly two years since Fashionably Late, Radke lost a close family member (faced head-on with the tear-jerking album closing ballad 'Brother'), watched old friends succumb to old vices (look no further than the first track 'Chemical Prisoner'), and struggled with his lifelong search for meaning ('God, If You Are Above\u2026' is as real as it gets, kids) and search for personal redemption.\n\nJust as Pinocchio became a real boy, Falling In Reverse is a real band. Emerging guitar hero Jacky Vincent throws down a vicious, Joe Satriani-inspired shred all over their songs; rhythm guitarist Derek Jones injects the band with the strength of crunch that only comes from touring as a metalcore vet. Jovial everyman drummer Ryan Seaman, whose resume reads like an Epitaph catalog, lays back in the cut like the guys in classic hard rock bands of the \u201870s yet pulls off double bass and crazy fills with equal skill.\n\n'God, If You Are Above' rocketed to #1 on the iTunes Rock chart within hours of its release and with good reason. It\u2019s got an energized, emotive drive reminiscent of 'Situations' (the best known song from Radke\u2019s tenure in Escape The Fate which has been viewed 50 million times on YouTube) but updated with the experience, charisma and perspective of the singer\u2019s more well rounded modern persona; the song is naturally topped off by a reliably scorching Jacky Vincent solo. The playful innuendo is still there, in party songs like 'Sexy Drug' and the album\u2019s title track, 'Just Like You,' with it\u2019s over-the-top, hilariously brave refrain: \u201cI am aware that I am an asshole!\u201d\n\nFalling In Reverse\u2019s debut album The Drug In Me Is You was a vivid, self-deprecating, raw document of frontman Radke\u2019s turbocharged life till that point, delivered with a clever wordplay acting as harbinger for the mixtape rhymes that were to come. Now, the appropriately titled Just Like You draws together all of the first two albums strengths.\n\nIn 2014, only Mot\u00f6rhead legend Lemmy edged out Radke on Kerrang!\u2019s list of the 50 Greatest Living Rockstars in the World, a lineup that included the likes of Slash, Steven Tyler and Ozzy Osbourne. Ronnie Radke is the world\u2019s Greatest Living Rockstar, aside from freakin\u2019 Lemmy, according to the UK\u2019s biggest rock mag.\n\nRadke\u2019s aesthetic is so coveted he spends significant \u201cfree time\u201d overseeing clothing design and fulfillment for HOOD$ UP, the Falling In Reverse frontman\u2019s apparel endeavor. Self-empowerment, secret societies and a bizarre amalgamation of esotericism and West Coast gangsterism collide in HOOD$ UP, that transcends \u201cbrand\u201d as much as the guys in Falling In Reverse have managed to agitate and captivate more than a \u201cband.\u201d\n\nAs unscrupulous imitators play catch-up with the look, sound and feel of Falling In Reverse, the band soldiers on, blazing new pathways and bridging the gap between brutal metal and pop rock.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "158 Ludlow Street, New York City, NY 10002", "Artist": "KNG", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.987746, 40.72104], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Piano's NYC", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "KNG is performing live at Piano's NYC on February 15th, 2020, so get your tickets now.

Kids play in the shadows of the row houses that line the sidewalks. Their parents sit on the stoops leading up to front doors. It all seems normal at first glance.\n\n\n\nBut zoom in on one of these homes \u2014 that old duplex built back when this part of town was still mainly open fields. Inside is a completely different community, where fundamentalism, hippie values and volatile, unpredictable emotions coexist and collide. Escape is difficult: the only way out is to pass through the bedrooms of people you might be trying to get away from.\n\n\n\nThis is where Eliot Bronson grew up. Yeah, he often wanted to slip away from there, but the first thing he saw once he exited was the Pentecostal Church across the street where his father and grandfather had preached and where congregants spoke in tongues.\n\n\n\nSo Eliot looked inward instead.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor better or worse, I\u2019ve always been a weirdo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI was reading about Zen Buddhism when all my friends were getting high and drunk in high school.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he adds, \u201cI did all that stuff later.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also observed. In this kaleidoscopic family, where glossolalia and, on occasion, alcohol-fueled ravings, sometimes bled into each other, Bronson found shelter in music. At age 15, he got his first guitar and started teaching himself to play. \u201cRight away, I wanted to write my own songs,\u201d he says. \u201cMy house was pretty chaotic so I took to music like it was a life raft. It was something I could do to keep myself alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nPunk rock was his shelter at first. Then one day his dad put on a few of his favorite LPs \u2014 Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, something by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. Eliot had heard these albums a thousand times before. This time, though\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 it resonated with me,\u201d Eliot says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just in the background. I tuned into it for the first time. There was a magic and a power there. It didn\u2019t talk down to the listener but it was also high art. It asked you to be smart and to become a better version of yourself. For me, this was a moment when it became my music, not just my parents\u2019 music.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom local coffee houses and venues beyond Baltimore, Bronson sharpened his writing and performance. He cultivated a working approach that involved singing to himself as ideas came to him and never jotting down chord changes or lyrics once he had committed the finished version to memory. A local following grew. Astute observers saw something different in the young artist\u2019s work. The Baltimore Sun even anointed him \u201ca folk singing wunderkind.\u201d\n\n\n\nExpanding his range, Bronson toured as one-half of a duo. They moved to Atlanta and picked up a gig in a room frequented by The Indigo Girls, John Mayer, Shawn Mullins and other discerning clientele. When his partner quit to take a sensible non-musical job, Bronson persisted on his own. His songs won first-place honors at MerleFest\u2019s Chris Austin Songwriting Contest and Eddie Owens Presents \u201cSongwriter Shootout.\u201d He issued several solo albums, including a self-titled release in 2014 that prompted Glide Magazine to describe him as \u201ca gorgeous, magnificent hybrid of (Ryan) Adams, Jason Isbell and Jim James.\u201d Bop n Jazz upped that ante by heralding him as \u201cmaybe the best singer/songwriter since Dylan.\u201d\n\n\n\nWriters may have trouble topping these accolades, though that\u2019s what Bronson\u2019s latest album merits. Scheduled to release Aug. 25 on Rock Ridge Music, James offers songs that are more like pictures than movies, capturing moments and digging deeply into their meanings. A stomping beat, raw harmonica and searing electric slide drives the opening track, \u201cBreakdown In G Major,\u201d followed by a selection of songs that only confirm Bronson\u2019s restless, escalating excellence.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood Enough,\u201d for example, captures a relationship in its final stage \u2014 a stage that may end tomorrow or stretch on for years. Bronson sings it sorrowfully, asking the rhetorical question of whether \u201c\u2018good enough\u2019 is good enough for you\u201d from this point. \u201cWhen I stumbled onto that line, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll probably stick,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think the song really came from the first line, \u2018Were we really that young?\u2019 Sometimes it takes just one line to resonate with me and get me to start writing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Mountain,\u201d whose elusive grandeur delivers a powerful message but leaves it to the listener to parse its meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s a very literalist current in writing and music right now,\u201d Bronson observes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of layers to lyrics these days. It\u2019s just what you see on the page. So when you don\u2019t write that way, you get, \u2018What are you hiding?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughs and then concludes, \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way. For me, it\u2019s more about how you feel when you hear it. What does it do for you? That\u2019s the message!\u201d\n\n\n\nOne more, \u201cRough Ride,\u201d is a departure for Bronson. Here, the meaning is clear: When 25-year-old Freddie Gray fell unaccountably into a coma in the back of a Baltimore police van, much of America expressed shock and outrage. So did Bronson, but he channeled those emotions into this song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had mixed feelings about writing this because I don\u2019t like inserting my political or social beliefs into art,\u201d he explains. \u201cArt should be about connecting people, not drawing lines between them. But I was listening to Dylan\u2019s Desire album at the time, especially \u2018Hurricane.\u2019 I always wanted to write a song like that. It was like, \u2018How can you tell a story almost journalistically with great emotional impact and yet not come off heavy-handed?\u2019 I wanted to see if I could do it. Now I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\n\n\nKnown for his empathetic work with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and other utterly original artists, producer Dave Cobb played a critical role in bringing James to fruition. \u201cHis honesty and old-fashioned vibe were so appealing to me,\u201d Bronson says. \u201cThey leant themselves to the way I created. And, of course, it was a huge boost to have this great artist/producer at your back.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey had worked together previously on his 2014 release, Eliot Bronson. \u201cBut this album is different,\u201d Bronson points out. \u201cIt\u2019s more sparse and economical. My voice is stronger. And I think it\u2019s a step away from the purely Americana vibe of the last one in a direction that I have a hard time defining. I\u2019m excited to discover how this music will define itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nWherever he\u2019s bound, Bronson promises to write and sing the truth as he sees and feels it. \u201cFor the really great artists, like Dylan or Paul Simon, you never quite find what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get closer, it changes. It stays elusive. What I want to do now isn\u2019t the same as what I wanted to do five years ago. And that\u2019s what keeps me going.\u201d And it\u2019s that shift that drives Bronson to continue to refine his art.", "otherInfo": "RSVP or QUESTIONS:\ntext or call 937-650-6458\nnolajh@msn.com"}, {"Address": "610 W 56th St, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "Ween", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6600599.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.992666, 40.769855], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Terminal 5", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "149 Westchester Ave, Port Chester, NY 10573", "Artist": "J.J.

Casually virtuosic\u201d (The Guardian)\n\nBarb Jungr was born in the northwest of England in a little mill town, Rochdale, known then as the home of Gracie Fields. Something that everyone who heard her singing on the pavement said as they walked past. \u201cOh she\u2019s like a young Gracie Fields!\u201d. Like Gracie Fields she has had an extensive career as a vocal artist and an entertainer. Growing up in Stockport in the rain, with a Czech father and German mother meant she developed comedic talent very early on, alongside a love of and passion for, music.\n\nThe family moved to Stockport when she was 7, where they found had a garden and an indoor toilet, a great change for the young Barb, who immediately set about organising the other children into shows, which often involed the use of crepe paper. She survived a Convent education by being good at singing, sports and being very, very naughty - not quite bad enough to be bad, per se, but bad enough to be elected as Deputy Head Girl by the bad girls so they had someone on their team on the inside, as it were.\n\nJungr played the violin rather well, and was in the orchestra and school shows, when she wasn\u2019t hurtling down a hockey pitch with a dangerous stick or belting around a netball court, for the Catholic school league. If you really want to understand competition, join a Convent netball team.\n\nJungr began making music with 3 schoolfriends who took the local folk clubs by storm, or at least by a light wind. She studied botany at Leeds, don\u2019t ask her why, and saw a lot of bands, and played in a lot of bands. She left University to avoid doing a PhD on 6 annuals on the Derbyshire limestone and moved to London, where a boyfriend told her she should be using her vocal talent, because only an idiot wouldn\u2019t. So she did.\n\nFrom there she made records, joined bands, and found herself in among the wondrous community of the newly emerging alternative cabaret movement alongside some of the biggest names in British comedy today, many of whom she counts as friends. She won a Perrier Award with Arnold Brown and her musical partner Michael Parker, made radio programmes, toured the UK, and learned everything anyone ever needs to know about costume from Julian Clary alongside whom she worked on TV, radio and tours for some years.\n\nIn the 1990\u2019s she started to make themed shows, travelled all over the world singing and giving workshops (including the bush in Cameroon and more) and developed as a solo artist. By this time she\u2019d started to work with great musicians and arrangers, from all backgrounds musical and more, and returned to Edinburgh relaunched and revitalised in a collection called \u201cSex Religion and Politics\u201d, which has been her focus lyrically for some time. Her affinity with and for the works of Brel, Dylan and Cohen has been well documented. She emerged not only as a great vocal artist but also as an entertainer.\n\nShe began to travel to and from New York, and now has several awards for her work from there. She tours America, Australia and works in mainland Europe, in short, she\u2019s come a long way, that little girl from Rochdale and Stockport.\n\nShe writes for theatre, other singers and herself. And she can still find quite a lot of today\u2019s world, hilarious.

Raised in Washington DC, his music career took flight after moving to Brooklyn, NY. In 15 years of touring, he has built a devout following, performing at sold out theatres and ballrooms across the country. Over time, Cope\u2019s music has become the soundtrack to the lives of those who have embraced it and he continues to inspire audiences through what can only be described as a deep personal connection.\n\nHis first album in seven years, Heroin and Helicopters tackles Cope\u2019s personal struggles with institutional religion, political manipulation, hollowness in the entertainment world, and spiritual enlightenment. It\u2019s named after an encounter with rock \u2018n\u2019 roll icon Santana: one evening at the Fillmore in San Francisco, Santana told him to \u201cstay away from the two H\u2019s\u201d - heroin and helicopters - both things having very fatal results with people in music. Cope saw meaning in the comment, reflected in the current epidemic of addictions that plague our world, not just to substances but to conflict, handheld devices, social media, and the lure of not having to work hard to get places fast. He observed a thread being woven, where mass production has trumped quality goods and shortcuts in life have become commonplace, enticing people to step over others for self-enrichment. Where entitlement and greed have become the norm as empathy and awareness of the human condition become an afterthought, the common man has lost his powerful voice to corporations. It\u2019s less a condemnation of others and more an acknowledgement of the part played by himself and the system that we are all forced to participate in- and the hope that we can do better.\n\nHeroin and Helicopters will be released March 1, 2019, on Citizen Cope\u2019s own label, taking control of his path and trusting his instincts.\n\nhttp://www.citizencope.com.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "327 Bowery, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Jill Sobule", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9494263.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.991787, 40.725751], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Genreless, Singer, Songwriter, pop, rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Bowery Electric", "moreBioInfo": "Jill Sobule belongs to a rare breed of artists. Her work is at once deeply personal and socially conscious, seriously funny and derisively tragic. Over five albums and a decade of recording, the Denver-born songwriter/guitarist/singer has tackled such topics as the death penalty, anorexia, shoplifting, reproduction, the French resistance movement, adolescence, and the Christian right. Did we mention love? Love found, love lost, love wished for and love taken away.\n\nWhile her songs cover a huge amount of ground, they all have benefit greatly from Jill's subtle intelligence and skillful light-handedness. No sloganeering flag-and-fist waving here, but rather story songs about human beings, real and imagined, which allow us to step back from the issue, be it personal or social, and relate to it as we would a close friend.\n\nTo see Jill live and in concert is a rare treat. It is on stage that she is most comfortable, most powerful, and where the delicacy and range of her work can be best appreciated. She entertains, amuses, provokes, and more often then not, takes her audiences on an emotional roller coaster, from comedy to pathos in a few bars of music.\n\nJill began playing guitar when she joined the Junior High School band. She never learned to read music, though, and faked her way through rehearsals and performances by playing by ear. As she began writing songs, it was very clear to Jill this was becoming more than a teenage hobby. Music was serious stuff. She played in a variety of funk and rock bands in Colorado, and eventually made her first, Todd Rundgren-produced, album for MCA, Things Here Are Different.\n\nBut success did not knock on her door until three years later, when Atlantic Records released her MTV staple and national top 20 hit, I Kissed A Girl. \"That song was a double-edged sword for me,\" Jill Says. \"It was perceived as a novelty hit, but on the other hand it was the first song with an overtly gay topic to be aired on Top 40 radio. I am quite proud of that.\" The self-titled album also yielded another hit song, Supermodel, included in the Clueless soundtrack.\n\nThe song also jumpstarted her live music career in a big way, and since then she's had the honor to induct Neil Diamond in the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, to share the stage with the likes of Neil Young (at his yearly Bridge School benefit concerts), fellow activists Billy Bragg & Steve Earle, and Waren Zevon. Quite the serious guitar player, she even toured the world as lead guitarist in Lloyd Cole's band a few years back.\n\nSince then, she has made four more critically acclaimed albums, Happy Town, Pink Pearl, Underdog Victorious, and 2009's California Years, which Jill released on her own record label, Pinko Records, after collecting over $85,000 from fans who funded the project.\n\nA veritable gypsy, Jill divides her time between a busy touring schedule and a variety of other projects. She has played the role of political troubadour for NPR stations across the country and for Air America Radio. She also served as songwriter/composer for the hit Nickelodeon network show Unfabulous during that show's three-season run. She composed the music for the off-Broadway show Prozak and the Platypus and co-starred in the Eric Schaeffer film Mind the Gap.\n\nIn the words of New York Times pop music critic Jon Pareles, \"Jill Sobule can claim her place among the stellar New York singer-songwriters of the last decade. Topical, funny and more than a little poignant ... grown-up music for an adolescent age.\"", "otherInfo": "The Love Hangover, now in its 21st year (and its tenth city and second country), is an annual event held on February 15th.

After his debut performance at his mom\u2019s neighborhood restaurant, he played small gigs around his hometown of Washington, DC, finding his voice and realizing he loved being on stage. Though his love was writing and performing, he attended Berklee College of Music for film scoring (inspired by John Williams) and bass. After graduating, Owen released his first full-length album, Twelve Stories, which was well-received by his growing fan base. Owen quickly began working on new music, releasing his single, \u201cNo Such Thing,\u201d which won the American Songwriter Magazine Lyric Contest. While working on his next release, Owen got a call from the producers of NBC\u2019s The Voice, inviting him to audition for coaches Adam Levine, Christina Aguilera, Pharrell Williams, and Blake Shelton. Receiving the coveted \u201cFour Chair Turn,\u201d Owen ultimately chose to work with Adam Levine. Under Levine\u2019s mentorship, Owen performed his way to the live shows and earned the distinction of being the first Voice contestant ever to play bass on the show. On The Voice, Owen had the opportunity to perform in many styles, which truly reflects his sensibilities as an artist. Although inspired by a variety of genres including folk, pop, and rock, and from artists across the charts, such as Green Day, Paul Simon, Ed Sheeran, and Johnny Cash, the thread that ties his music together and makes it authentically his own is his pairing of personal lyrics with melodies that love to get stuck in your head. Like a soundtrack to real life, Owen\u2019s songs give words to moments that resonate with so many, while remaining honest and vulnerable. Following his experience on The Voice, Owen moved to Nashville, TN, a haven for all genres and home to some of the industry\u2019s best writers and musicians - some of whom Owen has had the pleasure of writing and performing with. Two songs Owen wrote with CMT\u2019s Nashville star, Charles Esten, have been released as part of Esten\u2019s widely followed \u201cEvery Single Friday\u201d series. Owen has also performed multiple times at the iconic Bluebird Caf\u00e9, by himself and on rounds with artists and writers such Gordon Kennedy (Change the World, Eric Clapton). Shortly after the move to Nashville, Owen released his most recent EP, \u201cLove on Your Side,\u201d named for the edgy folk/pop title track. This collection of songs is very close to Owen\u2019s heart, full of stories about his own personal relationships. When he isn\u2019t writing or recording, Owen is performing, bringing his songs to audiences all over the country. In addition to Nashville\u2019s Bluebird Caf\u00e9, he has performed in other iconic venues, such as Hotel Caf\u00e9 in LA, 9:30 Club in DC, and Eddie\u2019s Attic in GA, as both the headliner and an opener for performers including Emmylou Harris and The Proclaimers.

After years of dishonest living\u2014consumed by drugs, alcohol, and addiction\u2014such sincerity is jarring from the 30-year-old Chicago-based musician. Liberated from a self-destructive past and born anew in sobriety, Francis has captured an inspired collection of songs steeped in New Orleans rhythms and Chicago blues. His music evokes a bygone era of R&B\u2019s heyday while simultaneously forging a new path on the musical landscape. Ohio-based Karma Chief Records (a subsidiary of rising soul label Colemine Records) will release two songs, \u201cThese Are The Days\u201d and \u201cChanges, Pt. 1,\u201d in early 2019 with the full LP to follow in summer 2019.\n\nThere is a deep connection between Francis\u2019s childhood\u2014his obsession with boogie woogie piano, his father\u2019s gift of a dusty Dr. John LP\u2014and the songs he\u2019s created. The result is an astonishing collection of material without parallel in the contemporary funk and soul scene. The influences are unmistakable: the vocal stylings of Allen Toussaint and Leon Russell; the second line rhythms of The Meters and Dr. John; the barroom rock \u2018n\u2019 roll of The Rolling Stones; the gospel soul of Billy Preston; the roots music of The Band. Francis pays tribute to the masters but has his own story to tell: \u201cIt\u2019s the life I\u2019ve lived so far.\u201d\n\nAnd what a life it\u2019s been. Born Neal Francis O\u2019Hara, the piano prodigy found himself touring Europe by the age of 18 with Muddy Waters\u2019 son and backing up other prominent blues artists coast-to-coast. In 2012, Francis joined popular instrumental funk band The Heard. With Francis at the creative helm, The Heard transformed into a national act, touring with boogaloo progenitors The New Mastersounds and chart toppers The Revivalists and appearing at Jazz Fest and Bear Creek. As The Heard\u2019s star rose, however, Francis sunk deeper into addiction. Once a promising sideman, by 2015 he had been fired from his band, evicted from his apartment, and was perilously close to self-destruction. \u201cWhen you get close to death like that you can feel it,\u201d Francis recalls. An alcohol-induced seizure that year led to a broken femur, dislocated arm, and, finally, the realization that he needed to get clean.\n\nThe journey from a hospital bed to launching his solo career was neither predictable nor straightforward. There were musical fits and starts, relapses, and broken relationships. Yet the overwhelming passion driving Francis in this second act has been an overabundance of creative energy. \u201cDrinking held my music in a half-cocked slingshot. I was always so consumed by drugs and alcohol that I didn\u2019t have the time, money, or creative energy to do it. Sobriety let it loose.\u201d\n\nDetermined to realize the songs swirling in his head, Francis assembled a crack team of musicians, calling on bassist Mike Starr (The Heard) and drummer PJ Howard (The Revivalists, The Heard). He linked up with producer and analog-obsessive Sergio Rios (Orgone, Cee Lo Green, Alicia Keys) and self-funded a trip to Killion Sound in Los Angeles to record the initial batch of material. \u201cI learned to trust my instincts in that room,\u201d says Francis. Buoyed by classic horn arrangements and Rios\u2019 fierce guitar work, the resulting tracks illuminate a lifetime spent studying the masters of soul music.\n\nFrom the RMI electra-piano riff that kicks off \u201cShe\u2019s A Winner\u201d to the screaming organ swells of \u201cThis Time,\u201d Francis and company let it all hang out. This is fun music, dance music. Yet verse after verse and chorus after chorus, Francis wrestles with his past in a straightforward manner: \u201cIt\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I\u2019m not home/ I\u2019m surrounded by people, but I\u2019m really alone.\u201d Like Toussaint and Russell before him he\u2019s married the upbeat rhythms of New Orleans R&B with the lyrical approach of a confessional singer/songwriter. The refrain on \u201cThis Time\u201d serves as a foxhole prayer for a better future: \u201cLet me get it this time/I won\u2019t let you down/Let me get it this time/I won\u2019t fool around.\u201d\n\n2018 has been a busy year. In February Francis finished recording basic tracks for the yet-to-be named debut album in Los Angeles and spent the following months doing overdubs in Chicago with engineer Mike Novak (who also recorded demos for the project). After playing his first show in November, Francis was signed by Paradigm Talent Agency. He is now preparing to tour relentlessly to promote his own music. \u201cI\u2019m doing this to fulfill a drive within myself, but also to pay tribute to the gifts I\u2019ve been given. And it comes from a place of immense gratitude. I\u2019ve been given so much in my life, especially in the last two years, that this feels like a bonus.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "149 Westchester Ave, Port Chester, NY 10573", "Artist": "J.J.

Born on a military base in Nogales, Arizona in 1922 and raised in Watts, California, his earliest musical influences came from the church\u2013 choir and group singing\u2013 and from \u201chearing Duke Ellington over the radio when [he] was eight years old.\u201d He studied double bass and composition in a formal way (five years with H. Rheinshagen, principal bassist of the New York Philharmonic, and compositional techniques with the legendary Lloyd Reese) while absorbing vernacular music from the great jazz masters, first-hand. His early professional experience, in the 40\u2019s, found him touring with bands like Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory and Lionel Hampton.\n\nEventually he settled in New York where he played and recorded with the leading musicians of the 1950\u2019s\u2013 Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Art Tatum and Duke Ellington himself. One of the few bassists to do so, Mingus quickly developed as a leader of musicians. He was also an accomplished pianist who could have made a career playing that instrument. By the mid-50\u2019s he had formed his own publishing and recording companies to protect and document his growing repertoire of original music. He also founded the \u201cJazz Workshop,\u201d a group which enabled young composers to have their new works performed in concert and on recordings.\n\nMingus soon found himself at the forefront of the avant-garde. His recordings bear witness to the extraordinarily creative body of work that followed. They include: Pithecanthropus Erectus, The Clown, Tijuana Moods, Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Ah Um, The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, Cumbia and Jazz Fusion, Let My Children Hear Music. He recorded over a hundred albums and wrote over three hundred scores.\nAlthough he wrote his first concert piece, \u201cHalf-Mast Inhibition,\u201d when he was seventeen years old, it was not recorded until twenty years later by a 22-piece orchestra with Gunther Schuller conducting. It was the presentation of \u201cRevelations\u201d which combined jazz and classical idioms, at the 1955 Brandeis Festival of the Creative Arts, that established him as one of the foremost jazz composers of his day.\n\nIn 1971 Mingus was awarded the Slee Chair of Music and spent a semester teaching composition at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In the same year his autobiography, Beneath the Underdog, was published by Knopf. In 1972 it appeared in a Bantam paperback and was reissued after his death, in 1980, by Viking/Penguin and again by Pantheon Books, in 1991. In 1972 he also re-signed with Columbia Records. His music was performed frequently by ballet companies, and Alvin Ailey choreographed an hour program called \u201cThe Mingus Dances\u201d during a 1972 collaboration with the Robert Joffrey Ballet Company.\n\nHe toured extensively throughout Europe, Japan, Canada, South America and the United States until the end of 1977 when he was diagnosed as having a rare nerve disease, Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis. He was confined to a wheelchair, and although he was no longer able to write music on paper or compose at the piano, his last works were sung into a tape recorder.\n\nFrom the 1960\u2019s until his death in 1979 at age 56, Mingus remained in the forefront of American music. When asked to comment on his accomplishments, Mingus said that his abilities as a bassist were the result of hard work but that his talent for composition came from God.\n\nMingus received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Smithsonian Institute, and the Guggenheim Foundation (two grants). He also received an honorary degree from Brandeis and an award from Yale University. At a memorial following Mingus\u2019 death, Steve Schlesinger of the Guggenheim Foundation commented that Mingus was one of the few artists who received two grants and added: \u201cI look forward to the day when we can transcend labels like jazz and acknowledge Charles Mingus as the major American composer that he is.\u201d The New Yorker wrote: \u201cFor sheer melodic and rhythmic and structural originality, his compositions may equal anything written in western music in the twentieth century.\u201d\n\nHe died in Mexico on January 5, 1979, and his wife, Sue Graham Mingus, scattered his ashes in the Ganges River in India. Both New York City and Washington, D.C. honored him posthumously with a \u201cCharles Mingus Day.\u201d\n\nAfter his death, the National Endowment for the Arts provided grants for a Mingus foundation created by Sue Mingus called \u201cLet My Children Hear Music\u201d which catalogued all of Mingus\u2019 works. The microfilms of these works were then given to the Music Division of the New York Public Library where they are currently available for study and scholarship \u2013 a first for jazz. Sue Mingus has founded three working repertory bands called the Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Orchestra, and the Mingus Big Band, which continue to perform his music. Biographies of Charles Mingus include Mingus by Brian Priestley, Mingus/Mingus by Janet Coleman and Al Young, Myself When I Am Real by Gene Santoro, and Tonight at Noon, a memoir by Sue Mingus.\n\nMingus\u2019 masterwork, \u201cEpitaph,\u201d a composition which is more than 4000 measures long and which requires two hours to perform, was discovered during the cataloguing process. With the help of a grant from the Ford Foundation, the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by Gunther Schuller, in a concert produced by Sue Mingus at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989, ten years after Mingus\u2019 death.\n\nThe New Yorker wrote that \u201cEpitaph\u201d represents the first advance in jazz composition since Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cBlack, Brown, and Beige,\u201d which was written in 1943. The New York Times said it ranked with the \u201cmost memorable jazz events of the decade.\u201d Convinced that it would never be performed in his lifetime, Mingus called his work \u201cEpitaph,\u201d declaring that he wrote it \u201cfor my tombstone.\u201d\n\nThe Library of Congress purchased the Charles Mingus Collection, a major acquisition, in 1993; this included autographed manuscripts, photographs, literary manuscripts, correspondence, and tape recordings of interviews, broadcasts, recording sessions, and Mingus composing at the piano.\n\nSue Mingus has published a number of educational books through Hal Leonard Publishing, including Charles Mingus: More Than a Fake Book, Charles Mingus: More Than a Play-Along, Charles Mingus: Easy Piano Solos, many big band charts\u2014 including the Simply Mingus set of big band music charts\u2013 and a Mingus guitar book.\n\nReprinted in part from More than a Fake Book \u00a9 1991 Jazz Workshop, Inc.\n\nLinks to Additional Biographical and Historical Information on the Web\n\nLibrary of Congress\nAn index to the holdings of the Charles Mingus Collection, Music Division of the Library of Congress.\nhttp://www.loc.gov/performingarts/encyclopedia/collections/mingus.html", "otherInfo": "Jazz Standard proudly presents our tenth annual Mingus High School Competition 1979).

This mysterious capacity for creativity and rejuvenation under the sea symbolically presents itself again and again in the songs of Dead Reckoning, the take-no- prisoners debut Wicked Cool Records album by Soraia being released October 13. \u201cDead Reckoning is a nautical term meaning that you know where you are in the ocean based not on your location on a map but on where you've already been,\u201d says Soraia singer ZouZou Mansour. \u201cI may not know exactly where I'm headed, but these lyrics are all about who I am today \u2014 the good, bad and ugly.\u201d Tracing threads beginning with the \u201960s soul of Stax and Motown, borrowing flickers of luminescence from rock icons such as Patti Smith and Joan Jett as well as Iggy Pop and The Cramps, through kindred spirits of the \u201990s and beyond like PJ Harvey and The Kills, the primal sounds of this Philadelphia- based four-piece provide a formidable match for a set of mostly autobiographical songs that lead listeners through the depths of desperate situations and guide them out the other side to redemption. \u201cMusic had already saved me from several suicide attempts by the time I was 15, when the lyrics to songs spoke to me and revealed I wasn\u2019t alone in my suffering,\u201d ZouZou reveals. \u201cI knew by that age I was going to do music for a living. \u201cI lived a long time feeling a victim of things: life, people, situations. Powerless. I finally realized I needed connection. That\u2019s where empowerment comes in. My story is about bringing myself back to who I was always meant to be, which required commitment and action. It took action to change my life. And when I committed to and believed in that action, I asked for help where I needed it and continue to check myself and stay humble.\u201d After escaping some harrowing situations and getting sober, the pursuit of ZouZou\u2019s musical dreams began crystallizing in the band Soraia. \u201cSoraia is actually my birth name,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we want it to be how the band is known, because it\u2019s another name for the constellation Pleiades, and generally is taken to mean bright, guiding force or star. Our magic and energy emulate that idea, so it is no longer just the name but a group and the hope and purpose behind what we do. The idea is to give light.\u201d Surrounding ZouZou with boundless talent are bassist and frequent co-writer Travis Smith (\u201cresilient, passionate, with a gift for writing the catchiest riffs I\u2019ve heard from anyone, ever\u201d), guitarist and musical director Mike Reisman (\u201cplays like someone with three times his experience and keeps us centered\u201d) and drummer Brianna Sig (\u201cplays with reckless abandon and precision\u201d). \u201cWhat makes the sound of Soraia,\u201d says ZouZou, \u201cis we all are huge fans of the same legendary artists and bring these strong influences to the table: Travis\u2019 love of The Misfits and garage rock of the \u201960s versus my love of melody and pop, along with influences such as Queen and Led Zeppelin.\u201d The band made waves with their punked up cover of The Kinks\u2019 \u201c(I\u2019m Not) Like Everybody Else,\u201d which hit #1 on rock radio in South America in 2013. Their last independently released album In The Valley Of Love And Guns featured five songs the band co-wrote with Jon Bon Jovi. By this point, the energy emanating from the Soraia constellation had already reached the eyes and ears of renowned tastemaker Steven Van Zandt (The E Street Band, The Sopranos), the Wicked Cool mastermind who has eagerly bestowed Coolest Song In The World honors on five of their tracks since 2013, including his #1 pick of 2016, \u201cElectrocutioner.\u201d They\u2019ve consistently earned heavy rotation on Steven\u2019s weekly syndicated radio show and SiriusXM channel Little Steven\u2019s Underground Garage. Dead Reckoning\u2019s leadoff track \u201cQuicksand\u201d already enjoyed Coolest Song honors in mid-summer 2017. Longtime Rolling Stone editor David Fricke has also attested to his fandom, testifying, \u201cSearing guitars, burning soul and true CBGB grit: Soraia are the rock you need, in your face right now.\u201d The group made the trek up the New Jersey Turnpike in early 2017 to record Dead Reckoning at Van Zandt\u2019s Renegade Nation Studios in downtown New York City. Steven personally produced two of the tracks, one that he wrote for them (\u201cWhy\u201d) and the other an obscure Prince cover, \u201cWow.\u201d The band co- produced the rest of the record with the guidance of Geoff Sanoff [Fountains Of Wayne, Dashboard Confessional]. Finishing touches were provided by boldface studio names: mixes for the Steven-produced tracks by Bob Clearmountain [Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones] and mastering by Bob Ludwig [David Bowie, Neil Young]. As the next release in Wicked Cool Records\u2019 partnership with The Orchard as distributor, Dead Reckoning positions Soraia as an artist to watch. Their rising ambitions are reflected in new horizons they\u2019re setting out to conquer, such as their first European shows, slated for Spain and Germany this fall. \"Dead Reckoning\" - our 12-song album - releases on vinyl, cd, and digital this Friday, October 13th!

Liaan Horton started a band called ZEN along with a few school friends in their senior year at High School. It wasn\u2019t to long before they were playing their original Moderate Rock compositions influenced in parts with a slight punk tone to everyone who would listen. In a short time ZEN built up a strong local fan base and notched up 42 club gig\u2019s in 11 months\u2026.. Not to bad considering the whole band was still busy completing High School! In the summer of 2000 Zen recorded a demo album and soon afterwards split up due to musical differences and personal reasons. Meanwhile in the same town brothers Dewald and Karel Koekemoer started Thrash Metal outfit ANTOCRAT along with Joel Jones, Etienne Rabbi and a few friends. They wrote technically solid Thrash songs with strong Death Metal undertones. ANTOCRAT achieved legendary status in the local Metal scene between 1997 and 2000. A five track EP entitled \u201cGods of War\u201d was recorded and self distributed by the group. Late in 2000 ANTOCRAT disbanded due to unforeseen circumstances and events. Early 2001 Dewald (Guitar) and Karel Koekemoer (Drums) along with Joel Jones (Bass) joined up with Liaan Horton (Guitar & Vocals) to write a few songs and continue under the ZEN name. Obviously there was an interesting change in the music and the band immediately started playing gig\u2019s all over the Gauteng region. All Major clubs at the time where covered including The Doors, Roxys, Big Easy, Nile Crocodile, to name but a few. Festivals followed and the band also played many gigs opening for bigger acts including a stint with Seether (Saron Gas), Wonderboom, Sugardrive and others. The ground work and foundation for BLACKLIST was being laid, even though the band members weren\u2019t aware of it then. That same year Liaan Horton met Adrian Adams while studying Sound Engineering together. Adrian was an excellent and well schooled guitar player influenced by 80\u2019s style Lead Solo\u2019s and Modern Riff\u2019s. Soon a friendship formed that would form the foundation for BLACKLIST\u2019s song writing In 2003 Zen finally ceased to exist and the members took a break to decide on their musical futures and current situations. Later that same year Liaan (vocals), Dewald (Guitar), Karel (Drums) and Adrian Adams (Guitar) decided to start a new Band with a clean sheet. Jaco Slabbert (Bass) entered the fold leaving his previous band CREATION, and so BLACKLIST was born\u2026\u2026. BLACKLIST then decided to start writing songs they wanted to hear and to develop a unique sound that defines BLACKLIST. Vowing not to cheapen their music the group decided to stay in their own studio and perfect their art until they felt musically fulfilled. Every song is a personal expression for every band member and defines what BLACKLIST is all about. Being musically and mentally mature now as musicians and people. BLACKLIST is ready to take their progressively driven Modern Rock with Hard hitting lyrics and memorable Chorus hooks to the next level. Through many up\u2019s and downs, numerous Gig\u2019s and countless hours of playing as one BLACKLIST have gathered a massive amount of experience and this shows in their utter professionalism and dedication. Currently recording their stripped down raw material BLACKLIST are now ready to set out and do what they promised each other and started working for in 2003! In A nutshell BLACKLIST is a group of very experienced passionate and driven musicians. As individuals they have become very close and encourage each others creativity. BLACKLIST isn\u2019t about empty words and superficial music BLACKLIST is all about being real and reaching nothing less than the top of their musical evolution Karel Koekemoer - Drums Dewald Koekemoer - Guitars Jaco Slabbert - Bass Adrian Adams - Lead Guitar Liaan Horton - Vocals \\ Guitar BLACKLIST NEW Full album In Studio", "otherInfo": "Broadway Comedy Club is the setting for a stand up comedy show.

Most clear in my memory, even amid the party that a live music backstage scene can tend to be, Will was the happiest guy in the place \u2013 clearly exactly where he wanted to be, and loving every second. This was a contagious vibe from the outset, one that Will had no trouble channeling into music that rings in the heart of the listener, and a live show as inspiring as it is entertaining. Between two acclaimed and successful albums, 2012\u2019s Rose Queen and 2015\u2019s Ringling Road, and what now clocks in at a near-decade's worth of dogged road work, William Clark Green has established himself as one of the most important voices of his genre - a voice that now pipes up again on his anticipated new album, Hebert Island.\n\nTexas is a big place, complete with fully distinct sub-territories - we reserve the right to bust into several states, should that become strategically expedient - and our traveling musical artists tend to become experts on the rich mosaic that makes up Texas' cultural geography. Will has found himself onstage in a growing portion of her 254 counties, and has called several his home; as he puts it, \"I kinda spend six years everywhere\". Childhood northeast in Tyler, high school years in College Station, college years at Texas Tech in Lubbock, early music career years in the north-central hamlet of Eastland, and lately his most urban digs so far, in Fort Worth - but deep down, Will's Cajun roots call to him incessantly, and thus southeast Texas is never far from his mind. The new album is named for Will's retreat at Hebert Island (say \"AY-Bear\", though you'll occasionally hear \"HEE-Bert\") near Beaumont, and refers to the hilltop upon which his camphouse sits - not an actual island, but a potential one, should the occasional flood come to pass; high ground is valuable in this landscape. Will considers himself a \"half-ass coon-ass\" - a distantly-descended Cajun, but one who holds a deep appreciation for that history and that way of life. \"It's a real place\", Will insists, with the feeling that only such a beloved space can foster - his family has owned it since 1869, in the early years of Reconstruction, and is where they established one of the state's first rice farming operations. It's a place that echoes through time for William Clark Green, connecting his family's past and tradition to who he is as an artist, and as a man, today.\n\nIt's been over three years since Ringling Road. \"I'm not gonna force songs,\" Will sighs. \"We could have finished the record a long time ago, but we didn't like the mixes - we're the bosses, and we don't have to listen to ourselves.\" The pressures and deadlines of the professional recording artist are nothing new, and while he certainly notices that pressure, Will recognizes it to be a good problem to have. \"I remember when no one gave a shit, so yeah, it's incredible to have that want-to. So far, every record I've come out with has been my best record - I wrote my ass off for this one. I wanted to make sure it beat Ringling Road, and I'm not bragging on myself - I just knew it was going to take effort.\"\n\nThat effort has paid off; Hebert Island is a stellar new batch of songs from a guy who has gone to great lengths to keep his energy focused, through all distraction, on quality songcraft. \"My favorite songwriter is Guy Clark - the songwriter's songwriter. It's what I've always cared about the most...the craft of songs is really where it's at for me. I think good songs are undeniable.\" Mostly recorded at Nashville\u2019s Sound Emporium with Benjy Davis at the board, the new album also features players who have been backing Will for near the full ride, including guitarist Steven Marcus and bassist Cameron Moreland. \u201cGoner\u201d stands as a shimmering, no-hard-feelings take on the moment of breakup, the protagonist of the quasi-travelogue \u201cStay\u201d understands that it doesn\u2019t matter where you are, as long as you\u2019re close to love, and the ballad \u201cShe Loves Horses\u201d exemplifies both the warmth and strength that\u2019s developed in Will\u2019s songwriting and the performance power of his players.\n\nWill's desired contribution to the world is songs that change lives for the better, and he realizes that he's conduit as much as creator for that change. And in spite of - or, perhaps, because of - the demands and pressures of the life he's chosen, and the position of leadership he's earned through a decade of determination, William Clark Green is a guy who takes none of this for granted. \"Our path is guided by something that's greater than me, I believe that. We can be very proud of what we've accomplished; we've done it the right way...I feel very proud of what we've done, and I'm thankful every day for where we're at.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1221 6th Ave, New York City, NY 10020", "Artist": "DJ LATIN PRINCE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8917741.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98135, 40.75877], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Open Format DJ", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "PITBULL'S GLOBALIZATION on SIRIUS XM CH 13 ", "moreBioInfo": "The Latin Prince Beginning.\nDJ Latin Prince\u2019s musical career began in 1990s,\nmixing and providing music at local parties, weddings,\nas well as schools.

Lead singers Brandon and Brian have written the bulk of the groups material. They have also written for Usher, Nivea and Toni Braxton.

Most clear in my memory, even amid the party that a live music backstage scene can tend to be, Will was the happiest guy in the place \u2013 clearly exactly where he wanted to be, and loving every second. This was a contagious vibe from the outset, one that Will had no trouble channeling into music that rings in the heart of the listener, and a live show as inspiring as it is entertaining. Between two acclaimed and successful albums, 2012\u2019s Rose Queen and 2015\u2019s Ringling Road, and what now clocks in at a near-decade's worth of dogged road work, William Clark Green has established himself as one of the most important voices of his genre - a voice that now pipes up again on his anticipated new album, Hebert Island.\n\nTexas is a big place, complete with fully distinct sub-territories - we reserve the right to bust into several states, should that become strategically expedient - and our traveling musical artists tend to become experts on the rich mosaic that makes up Texas' cultural geography. Will has found himself onstage in a growing portion of her 254 counties, and has called several his home; as he puts it, \"I kinda spend six years everywhere\". Childhood northeast in Tyler, high school years in College Station, college years at Texas Tech in Lubbock, early music career years in the north-central hamlet of Eastland, and lately his most urban digs so far, in Fort Worth - but deep down, Will's Cajun roots call to him incessantly, and thus southeast Texas is never far from his mind. The new album is named for Will's retreat at Hebert Island (say \"AY-Bear\", though you'll occasionally hear \"HEE-Bert\") near Beaumont, and refers to the hilltop upon which his camphouse sits - not an actual island, but a potential one, should the occasional flood come to pass; high ground is valuable in this landscape. Will considers himself a \"half-ass coon-ass\" - a distantly-descended Cajun, but one who holds a deep appreciation for that history and that way of life. \"It's a real place\", Will insists, with the feeling that only such a beloved space can foster - his family has owned it since 1869, in the early years of Reconstruction, and is where they established one of the state's first rice farming operations. It's a place that echoes through time for William Clark Green, connecting his family's past and tradition to who he is as an artist, and as a man, today.\n\nIt's been over three years since Ringling Road. \"I'm not gonna force songs,\" Will sighs. \"We could have finished the record a long time ago, but we didn't like the mixes - we're the bosses, and we don't have to listen to ourselves.\" The pressures and deadlines of the professional recording artist are nothing new, and while he certainly notices that pressure, Will recognizes it to be a good problem to have. \"I remember when no one gave a shit, so yeah, it's incredible to have that want-to. So far, every record I've come out with has been my best record - I wrote my ass off for this one. I wanted to make sure it beat Ringling Road, and I'm not bragging on myself - I just knew it was going to take effort.\"\n\nThat effort has paid off; Hebert Island is a stellar new batch of songs from a guy who has gone to great lengths to keep his energy focused, through all distraction, on quality songcraft. \"My favorite songwriter is Guy Clark - the songwriter's songwriter. It's what I've always cared about the most...the craft of songs is really where it's at for me. I think good songs are undeniable.\" Mostly recorded at Nashville\u2019s Sound Emporium with Benjy Davis at the board, the new album also features players who have been backing Will for near the full ride, including guitarist Steven Marcus and bassist Cameron Moreland. \u201cGoner\u201d stands as a shimmering, no-hard-feelings take on the moment of breakup, the protagonist of the quasi-travelogue \u201cStay\u201d understands that it doesn\u2019t matter where you are, as long as you\u2019re close to love, and the ballad \u201cShe Loves Horses\u201d exemplifies both the warmth and strength that\u2019s developed in Will\u2019s songwriting and the performance power of his players.\n\nWill's desired contribution to the world is songs that change lives for the better, and he realizes that he's conduit as much as creator for that change. And in spite of - or, perhaps, because of - the demands and pressures of the life he's chosen, and the position of leadership he's earned through a decade of determination, William Clark Green is a guy who takes none of this for granted. \"Our path is guided by something that's greater than me, I believe that. We can be very proud of what we've accomplished; we've done it the right way...I feel very proud of what we've done, and I'm thankful every day for where we're at.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "620 Atlantic Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "Brek.One", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6050521.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.975985, 40.683074], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop, Rap, EDM, HOUSE MUSIC, Funk, Rock, Roll, Disco, Trap, Twerk, Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Barclays Center", "moreBioInfo": "BREK.ONE is not the type of DJ than can be neatly categorized into a definable box.

But at the age of 14, Jake Shimabukuro realized that he was doing something a little different with the four-stringed instrument \u2013 OK, a lot different.\n\nShimabukuro\u2019s wholly unique approach to the ukulele started early. As a youngster growing up in Honolulu, Hawaii, Shimabukuro started playing the instrument at the age of four, learning the basics from his mother, Carol, and then developing his craft further by studying the likes of musical masters such as Eddie Kamae, Ohta-San and Peter Moon. As he matured, Shimabukuro also found inspiration from guitar players, drummers, pianists, and singers. Even athletes helped fuel the intensity of his artistic fire.\n\nIn 2005, Shimabukuro\u2019s touring career really came to life with a video on YouTube. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what YouTube was at the time, so I was totally surprised when people started telling me they\u2019d seen a video of me playing \u2018While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBefore I got a chance to check it out myself, the video had gone viral and a lot of music industry folks seemed to know about it. It was crazy!\u201d Shimabukuro\u2019s deeply beautiful and original take on George Harrison\u2019s love ballad, one which captured colors and moods never associated with the ukulele before, opened the floodgates \u2013 now legions of new music lovers had to hear this instrumental marvel \u2013 and the 2006 release of Gently Weeps (produced by Mac McAnally), which mixed his own originals with equally adventurous versions of \u201cAve Maria\u201d and \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d was an unqualified success.\n\nShimabukuro\u2019s records have topped the Billboard World Music Charts on numerous occasions, and as a live performer he has become one of the hottest tickets around. He\u2019s played with world-renowned orchestras and at prestigious venues such as the Hollywood Bowl, Lincoln Center and the Sydney Opera House, and has dazzled audiences at music festivals including Bonnaroo, SXSW, the Playboy Jazz Festival and Fuji Rock Festival. He even performed for that rarest of audiences: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Not too shabby for a humble young man from Hawaii and his trusty ukulele.\n\nEven with the constant demands on his time \u2013 Shimabukuro tours roughly half the year and makes frequent appearances on media outlets such as The Today Show, Good Morning America, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Night with Conan O\u2019Brien, A Prairie Home Companion and NPR\u2019s Morning Edition \u2013 Shimabukuro\u2019s album output hasn\u2019t slowed. In 2016, he recorded the all-original Nashville Sessions at Music City\u2019s famed Ronnie\u2019s Place studio with producer R.S. Field (Steve Earle, Webb Wilder) and the ace rhythm section of bassist Nolan Verner and drummer Evan Hutchings. And now he\u2019s returned to the same city and studio \u2013 and with the same gang, too (augmented by guitarist Dave Preston) \u2013 for his newest record, The Greatest Day, which will be released on August 31, 2018.\n\n\u201cI had such a great time working with R.S. Field on Nashville Sessions,\u201d Shimabukuro explains, \u201cand I knew I wanted to continue working with him on The Greatest Day. On the last record, it was pretty much the sound of a live trio, which sounded fresh, raw and organic. We were basically writing and improvising in the studio. Now we\u2019ve expanded to a quartet, which has added more colors and variety to the overall production. Once we recorded the live takes, we experimented with overdubs, and added horns, strings and keys, and other funky sounds. There are even some vocals on a few cuts.\u201d\n\nThe 12 tracks that comprise The Greatest Day feature some of Shimabukuro\u2019s most imaginative and adventuresome playing yet. Half of the album is devoted to originals, on which the instrumentalist reaches new heights of compositional distinction. And on the covers, Shimabukuro\u2019s prodigious skills allow him to achieve the impossible, transcending his material \u2013 no mean feat considering some of the classics and standards he\u2019s tackling.\n\nAmong the self-penned tunes, there\u2019s the blissed-out title track, so effervescent and airy that it transports the listener into the clouds. Shimabukuro wrote the song the night before going into the studio. Shimabukuro, Verner and Hutchings recorded their parts first. Later, Dave Preston added a joyous, Edge-like guitar riff that really finished the tune. \u201cIt came together so quickly,\u201d Shimabukuro says, \u201cand when I heard the final mix, I just thought, \u2018Wow, this has been the greatest day!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPangram\u201d has already turned heads in concert. Titled after a sentence that uses all the letters in the alphabet (\u201clike \u2018the quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog\u2019\u201d), it\u2019s based on a chromatic scale that utilizes all the notes in the Western music scale. But even non-musicologists will ride happily along its rivers of cascading melodies and its pumping, rock-soul rhythms.\n\nAnother treasure is \u201cStraight A\u2019s,\u201d a carefree and vibrant ride guaranteed to lift spirits, on which Shimabukuro\u2019s soulful soloing recalls one of his influences, Carlos Santana. The song was inspired by the A string on the ukulele. \u201cI wanted to write something where the \u2018A\u2019 note could ring out through the entire song.\u201d\n\n\u201cMahalo John Wayne\u201d is a flat-out stunner, a delicate melody that transforms into a grand-scale cinematic symphony. Discussing its origins, Shimabukuro explains that his father\u2019s favorite actor is John Wayne (\u201cHe named me Jake after one of the Duke\u2019s characters, in the movie \u2018Big Jake\u2019\u201d), and that the two of them would often watch Westerns together. \u201cThose are some great memories of mine,\u201d he says, \u201cso, I\u2019m saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to John Wayne for my name in this song. In Hawaiian, \u2018mahalo\u2019 means \u2018thank you.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs always, Shimabukuro\u2019s playing has a wonderful quality to it \u2013 there\u2019s an innocence, as if each phrase feels new to him. This sense of discovery is abundant on his astonishing reinterpretations of songs such as the Beatles\u2019 \u201cEleanor Rigby,\u201d now re-imagined as a driving and insistent ballad, brimming with furious jazz chords and a spirited back-and-forth between Shimabukuro and dobro legend Jerry Douglas. \u201cIt was such an honor to have Jerry guest on the record,\u201d Shimabukuro says. \u201cHe was only going to play on one tune, but we had such a great time that he stayed and played on two more tracks. I hope we can do more together one day.\u201d\n\nThe two go toe to toe on Jimi Hendrix\u2019s freak-flag classic \u201cIf 6 Was 9,\u201d spiraling off into a spacey, jazz-rock odyssey that manages to be reverential to the original while simultaneously distinguishing itself as a bold new tour de force. Shimabukuro\u2019s wild wah-wah lines form transfixing sheets of sound, and he even pulls off a neat trick, varying some of his melodies to recall another Hendrix standard, \u201cLittle Wing.\u201d \u201cI wanted to throw in something unexpected, because that\u2019s what I felt like Hendrix would do.\u201d\n\nThe Zombies\u2019 psychedelic rock nugget \u201cTime of the Season\u201d was one Shimabukuro often heard in his house growing up, and on The Greatest Day he trips into nostalgia with an elegant rendition that features some of his smoothest, Wes Montgomery-like phrases. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to play this one for my parents,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as they heard it, they were like, \u2018Oh, wow! You covered the Zombies!\u2019 They thought that was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nThe Greatest Day concludes on a stately note, with a sparse yet exquisite reading of Leonard Cohen\u2019s iconic hymn \u201cHallelujah.\u201d Each line that Shimabukuro plays seeps into one\u2019s heart and soul, proving that music is indeed the universal balm. \u201cI had recorded it before, but after Cohen passed I wanted to re-record it \u2013 I felt a new emotional response to it. It seemed like the perfect way to end the album.\u201d\n\nOnly he didn\u2019t end it there: Shimabukuro was particularly excited about his playing on a recent round of dates with bassist Nolan Verner and guitarist Dave Preston. The addition of a guitarist allowed him to solo more expressively than ever before. The digital edition of The Greatest Day includes a beautiful live version of \u201cBlue Roses Falling\u201d that features Shimabukuro dueting with cellist Meena Cho as well as a concert recording of \u201cKawika\u201d (originally made famous by the Sunday Manoa).\n\nThe CD and vinyl versions of the album include both tracks along with three more cuts including immersive takes on \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d and Shimabukuro\u2019s own \u201cDragon,\u201d. There\u2019s even a slinky, ultra-funky interpretation of Bill Withers\u2019 hit single \u201cUse Me\u201d that sees Preston showing off his soulful vocal chops. They were recorded live with no overdubs at various venues by engineer Brett Lind and mixed by Jack Clarke (who engineered Nashville Sessions and The Greatest Day).\n\nShimabukuro has already been performing some of the material from The Greatest Day live, and he\u2019ll soon work more songs into his set. In mid-July, he embarks on an extensive tour of the U.S and a fall tour of Japan. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to play the new songs in my shows,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking this record was one of the highlights I\u2019ve had in the studio. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the sounds and arrangements. But most of all, we had a ton of fun making it.\u201d\n\nAlong with his tremendous professional achievements, Shimabukuro\u2019s personal life is filled with riches: He\u2019s a loving husband and proud father of two boys. While balancing career with family, he also remains firmly rooted in his commitment to community, frequently performing at schools in Hawaii and overseas, urging youngsters to find their passion and live drug-free.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "5 John Walsh Blvd, Peekskill, NY 10566", "Artist": "Ronald Reggae", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8064523.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.943195, 41.275447], "Date": "Sat Feb 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-15", "Genre": "Genres: Adventure, Action", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "River Outpost Brewing Company", "moreBioInfo": "February 1781, James Watt is issued a patent for the steam engine.

I\u2019ve been doing music my whole life as a bandleader, sideman, producer, studio musician and teacher, but songwriting is my favorite. That\u2019s what this bio is for, shows where I play guitar and sing songs I wrote.

I\u2019ll write some stuff that\u2019s one vibe but then I get bored so I write something totally different. Some people like the variety, some people are confused. C\u2019est la vie. I just hope it makes you feel something; ideally something good or cathartic, or at least reminds you you\u2019re alive.\n\nSome years back I lived in this eccentric Arizona town called Bisbee. Out there I made a couple records and toured around with my band The Border Crossers. We still get together from time to time. I moved to NYC in 2012 and since then have been working with a soul band I co-founded called On The Sun.

Since the release of their previous two albums, songs have started to expand, jam suites have grown, and experiments have been undertaken.

Aunque hoy ya no es el muchacho aquel que en 1998 lanz\u00f3 profesionalmente su primera producci\u00f3n, \u201cTodo se paga\u201d, para Mart\u00ednez el contacto con el p\u00fablico y la calidad musical que presenta en el escenario siguen siendo sus motivaciones y por ellas trabaja cada d\u00eda intensamente.

Y en el 2003, Mart\u00ednez demuestra y reafirma nuevamente por qu\u00e9 es considerado por la cr\u00edtica como uno de los mejores bachateros del momento con \u201cAs\u00ed te amo\u201d, una exquisita producci\u00f3n que cont\u00f3 con la mano m\u00e1gica en la producci\u00f3n del talentoso maestro Rando Camasta.

Whether performing with his own quartet or supporting Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett on tour, Newman\u2019s expert trumpeteering and effervescent stage presence reignited a big band scene in New York City, and has since enticed a new generation of jazz fans across the globe. The Verve Recording artist continues to reign at his weekly residency in New York, as well as appear on television programs and in special performances across the United States and Europe.\nNewman is known for his impeccable horn playing and rendition of romantic favorites. But what sets him apart is his ability to command a room not only with his musical talent, but as a bandleader who makes each person in the audience feel as if they are a part of his performance. His fusion of music playing and easy going banter captures the vivacity of great bandleaders of the past. This exuberance is evident on Newman\u2019s 2016 debut album, Eyes on the City, which pays tribute to his musical journey in New York.\nAlong with his Quartet, fellow musicians from Cincinnati\u2019s College-Conservatory of Music, Newman has allured audiences during his residencies at some of New York\u2019s most iconic venues. His first foray into creating an old school big band night was at the elegant Duane Park for \u201cAfter Dark,\u201d a jazz and burlesque revue on the downtown scene in Tribeca. \u201cAfter Dark\u201d lead to a weekly residency at the legendary Oak Room at The Plaza Hotel, a venue steeped in history which was frequented by the likes of Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli and countless others over its one hundred year history. Newman and his Quartet played each Wednesday to a mixed crowd seeking a slice of history, welcoming Lady Gaga as a surprise guest, until the venue closed in 2011. Currently, Newman performs every Tuesday and Thursday, as bandleader in a residency at Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel, and select Friday nights at NYC\u2019s legendary Rainbow Room with his orchestra. Brian also routinely appears for special live performances with a diverse array of musical acts, which have included Tony Bennett, Jose Feliciano, Stevie Wonder, Mark Murphy, Dierks Bentley, Willie Nile, Molly Ringwald, David Loeb, Steve Wynn\u2019s Orchestra, Ray Benson\u2019s Asleep at the Wheel and Tommy London.\nNewman\u2019s personal style, which meshes classic suits, vintage tattoos and rock-n-roll, has attracted commercial brands such as Jack Daniel\u2019s, Marc Jacobs and Tiffany & Co., who have collaborated with Newman for special events and performances. The Jack Daniel\u2019s partnership in 2012, which launched the brand\u2019s Sinatra Select premium Tennessee Whiskey, brought Newman alongside Frank Sinatra Jr. himself, in a performance in Cannes, France.\nBrian married burlesque star, Angie Pontani of the World Famous Pontani Sisters in February 2013, with whom he most notably performs in connection with Pontani\u2019s New York Burlesque Festival and Burlesque-a-Pades shows.

For The Zoo, much has happened over the last 16 years.

You'd have a hard time trying to guess it too.\n\nOn the surface, he exudes a romantic youthfulness \u2014 fresh faced and ready to entertain the world with his impeccable piano/vocal prowess. Look a little deeper, and it's clear that this New York City local has the 'old soul' songwriting sensibilities of some of the greatest performers of our time. Lauded as 'the Nat King Cole for a new generation' by Time Out magazine, David displays a rich level of emotion and musicality that seldom appears in today's musical landscape.\n\nOriginally born in Rochester, New York, David Raleigh moved to Seattle at the age of four where he began honing his newfound musical abilities. He grew up on a stable diet of classic soul and gospel music, was named a child prodigy in the 'Who's Who Book of Music', and received a scholarship to attend Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan. While still in his teens, a zealous young David was \u201cdiscovered\u201d and signed to cut his first record, aptly titled 'Totally Psyched'. His gospel-flavoured album showcased his stirring vocal abilities and, as a result, sent him packing on tour with Amy Grant, Sweet Comfort and The Archers.\n\nUpon basing himself in New York City, David became a winner on the hit television show 'Star Search' and released his highly acclaimed second album, 'Never Alone'. His music then found its way to the screen, appearing in Disney/ABC's 'Alchemy' (Tom Cavenagh, Sarah Chalke) and in the German cult classic 'Kleine Heie', where he starred as himself. His songs also took him all across America, performing in numerous football stadiums and arenas to welcome home troops from the Gulf War.\n\nBy this stage, David's unmistakable sound positioned him as a mainstay in New York City's music scene, regularly performing at the Bitter End, Don't Tell Mama's, Joe\u2019s Pub, the Friar's Club, Arci's Place and the Metropolitan Room. He also obtained exclusive extended engagements at Stringfellow's, the Supper Club, Tatou, the Waldorf Astoria, the Ritz Carlton and the Hotel Pierre. Inspired by the atmosphere of such venues, David's own vision for a late night fine dining restaurant opened in Greenwich Village to outstanding reviews. While short lived, \u2018Club Raleigh at the Oaks\u2019 successfully showcased his sense of design and musicality to the delight of critics, further thrusting him into the New York spotlight.\n\nDavid Raleigh\u2019s most recent outing 'Beginning Again' (2010), produced by Australian singer/songwriter Nathan Leigh Jones, caught the attention of fans both old and new with its slick piano-pop edge. the album's lead single 'I Do!' struck the right chord both online and on music television, joining VH1's general playlist and spending 10 consecutive weeks in Logo (MTV)'s top ten. the album was toured throughout Europe, Asia and Australia, culminating in the fulfilment of a life long dream \u2014 performing at the iconic Sydney Opera House. His eagerly awaited forthcoming release, further extending his soulful crossover into radio-friendly pop, is currently slated for late 2013.\n\nWhile many artists would dream of a successful career in any one genre, David Raleigh is combining the best of both worlds.

Depending on the hour of the day he's a cultural icon, a rock god, an entrepreneur, a TV star, a father, the face of the American Diabetes Association, a supercross enthusiast, solo artist, Poison frontman, and a generous donor to a myriad of charitable causes.\n\nMichaels first rose to fame as the frontman of Poison. As one of rock's most iconic and enduring bands, Poison defined the fast, gritty, and glamorous rock 'n' roll scene. Since the band's beginning, Poison has achieved massive success- releasing eight studio albums, four live albums, and selling over 30 million records worldwide and 16.5 million records in the U.S. alone.\n\nThe band has charted 10 singles in the Top 40 on Billboard's Hot 100 including the number-one single, \"Every Rose Has It's Thorn.\" Twenty-five years after their debut, Poison is still recording music and performing together.\n\nBret Michaels' solo career has been equally successful: his most recent solo album, \"Custom Built,\" released in July of 2010, topped the charts, reaching #1 on Billboard's Hard Rock list. His current solo tour, \"Get Your Rock On\" is selling out arenas across the country and his forthcoming solo album of the same name will be released this summer.\n\nMichaels has achieved stunning success in the realm of reality TV as well. His \"Rock of Love\" television series is one of the most successful in VH1's history. VH1 and Bret Michaels teamed up again for his family-oriented 2010 docu-series \"Bret Michaels: Life As I Know It.\" He went head to head with some of the brightest minds in business on Donald Trump's NBC hit, \"Celebrity Apprentice\" and went on to \"Trump\" the competition with his Trop-A-Rocka Snapple drink.\n\nMichaels' Trop-a-Rocka Diet Snapple proved to be a fan-favorite- so much so that fans rallied to continue its distribution. He is thrilled to be continuing his partnership with Snapple, remarking, \"When I created my Diet Snapple Trop-A-Rocka Tea, I made it my mission to design the best-tasting diet drink on earth \u2013 made from the best stuff on earth. Creating Diet Snapple Trop-A-Rocka Tea and donating $250,000 to Diabetes research was just the beginning. I'm thrilled that Snapple will be making Trop-A-Rocka a part of its permanent offering.\"\n\nPhilanthropy remains an important facet of Michaels' career. A lifelong diabetic, he partnered with the American Diabetes Association in 2010, acting as a spokesperson and sponsor. Beyond his role as spokesperson Michaels has gone on to help Ford raise an additional $400,000 for diabetes research at the Barrett-Jackson auto auction this past February as well as donating numerous items for auction for Diabetes related events.\n\nMichaels' charitable outreach extends far beyond diabetes, however. Rocking out and giving back go hand in hand for Michaels, who supports a diverse array of charities and causes. In March 2011, he performed at Muhammad Ali's Celebrity Fight Night in support of the Muhammad Ali Foundation, which gives to those suffering from Parkinson's disease. Michaels was so touched by the event and the cause that he donated $20,000 of his own money to the Muhammad Ali Foundation to help heal those afflicted by Parkinson's. Michaels took on the role of fundraiser as well, raising more than $200,000 for the Barrow Brain Tumor Foundation, with a star-studded dinner in his own home. He is also a supporter of the Camelot Therapeutic ranch and sponsors a horse with his family. The ranch provides services at no charge to adults and children with disabilities.\n\nMichaels continues to stretch himself and challenge himself to take on new projects in music, business, and beyond. He recently partnered with legendary guitar company, Dean Guitars, to design his first ever signature Bret Michaels series. Michaels calls Dean Guitars \"the only guitars that can keep up with me, holding up tour after tour.\" He is also actively involved in the world of extreme sports. He created and awarded the first annual Bret Michaels Rock Hard, Ride Hard Award for supercross - a cash prize for the toughest and most tenacious supercross rider of the season - on May 7, 2011. The award will be given out again in 2012.\n\nMichaels has teamed with PetSmart for the \"Pet's Rock\" collection, which will debut in 2012. \"As a dedicated pet owners myself, this is a natural partnership for me, and I can\u2019t wait to unveil the collection,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cI know my own pets rock, and I wanted to design a line of pet products every bit as fun and cool as they are.\"\n\nAlso in 2012, Michaels is teaming up with Reader's Digest for their We Hear You America campaign - the popular national, grassroots initiative that serves as a catalyst to empower Americans to help their local communities by casting votes at ReadersDigest.com on behalf of their hometowns. Bret Michaels is the perfect partner for this campaign because he brings his experiences as a survivor, a rocker, a father, a philanthropist, and an American who has traveled this great land by tour bus from coast-to-coast. \"As a musician and an artist, I wanted to get involved in the We Hear You America campaign because it's not only about inspiring people to improve their lives and their communities, but about giving everyone a voice,\" says Michaels. \"It starts with all of you. Go to ReadersDigest.com every day to vote for your hometown. Your votes, joined with others in your community, could get your hometown funds and promotional support from the We Hear You America campaign.\"\n\nBret Michaels may have been in spotlight for decades, but he is certainly showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe official web site: http://www.bretmichaels.com\n\n###\n\nMAKE A DIFFERENCE", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "95 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Kaki", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9881468.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988383, 40.721329], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, Indie Pop", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Arlene's Grocery", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Joe Talcum, Michael Guggino, Toby Goodshank, Cristy Road, Mega Yeah, KAKI at Arlene's Grocery!"}, {"Address": "95 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "The Mega Yeah", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6639052.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988383, 40.721329], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Arlene's Grocery", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Joe Talcum, Michael Guggino, Toby Goodshank, Cristy Road, Mega Yeah, KAKI at Arlene's Grocery!"}, {"Address": "95 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Toby Goodshank", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.988383, 40.721329], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Arlene's Grocery", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Joe Talcum, Michael Guggino, Toby Goodshank, Cristy Road, Mega Yeah, KAKI at Arlene's Grocery!"}, {"Address": "217 E Houston St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Motel Radio", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9059010.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.986751, 40.722165], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Indie Rock", "Time": "5:30 PM", "Venue": "Mercury Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "Harmonies aren\u2019t dead, at least not in Motel Radio\u2019s case.

The triple-guitar attack and rhythmic dexterity of Periphery has won them devoted adherents across underground subcultures, regardless of whether those fans were weaned on the passion-fueled sounds of the Vans Warped Tour or the progressive rock of Rush. A clear contender for \u201cBreakthrough Band\u201d at Metal Hammer\u2019s 2013 Golden Gods Awards and frequent tourmates of Meshuggah, Dream Theater, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Animals As Leaders and other ultra-shred-happy friends and contemporaries from across the spectrum of loud rock, Periphery have earned their reputation onstage and off through a combination of undeniable chops and upbeat charisma. The Clear EP represents the sum total of Periphery\u2019s unrivaled achievement and the promise of what\u2019s to come courtesy of seven tracks most bands would be extremely grateful to see comprise a full LP. Periphery II: This Time Its Personal made Guitar World\u2019s 2012 \u201cBest Of\u201d list. Clear is undoubtedly destined to turn heads, as well. Born in an era where cookie-cutter musical constructs and fame-driven scene pretenders dominated the album and touring landscape, Periphery immediately rose to the fore with their dedication to unique artistry, musicianship and melody. The band steadfastly refuses to submit to the humorlessness that often plagues metal, particularly metal bands whose players possess such massive skill. They\u2019ve put serious focus on their music, enabling them to share a laugh in presentation. \u201cIcarus Lives!,\u201d \u201cMake Total Destroy,\u201d \u201cScarlet\u201d and like-minded Periphery jams have racked up millions of YouTube views and digital downloads, inspired massive amounts of air-guitar and air-drumming in clubs and theatres around the world and driven attention to the band\u2019s instant genre-classic pair of full-length albums. Periphery and Periphery II: This Time It\u2019s Personal galvanized a new generation of heavy music fans, many of whom have been as likely to scramble for guitar tabs to decode the inscrutable polyrhythms as they are to bruise themselves in the moshpit. Initially the brainchild of producer, solo artist and Guitar World cover star Misha Mansoor, the Washington D.C. based musical collective has since grown into a wild beast that belonging to their fiercely dedicated group of fans as much as to the band. Mansoor is joined by fellow axe wizards Jake Bowen and Mark Holcomb; viciously proficient bass slinger and production minded maestro Adam \u201cNolly\u201d Getgood; monstrous SickDrummer.com staple Matt Halpern; and Spencer Sotelo, who singularly manages to make heads or tails of Periphery\u2019s mindboggling music, inviting newcomers into the band\u2019s world via counter-intuitively catchy vocals. The broader populace is joining the party, too. Periphery debuted at #2 on Billboard\u2019s \u201cHeatseekers\u201d chart, with the follow-up album breaking into Billboard\u2019s Top 50 just two years later. Periphery II: This Time It\u2019s Personal introduced Holcomb and Getgood to the world at large and boasted guest appearances from Dream Theater co-founder John Petrucci, English guitar virtuoso and YouTube star Guthrie Govan (The Aristocrats, ex-Asia) and labelmate Wes Hauch (The Faceless). Like \u201cThe Big 4\u201d of Thrash, the Floridian death metal merchants, early Metalcore pioneers, mathcore inventors and deathcore standard bearers, Periphery\u2019s influence is so pervasive that they are often identified as the singularly most important band in the \u201cdjent\u201d subgenre. The group has taken this distinction in humorous stride (see \u201cDjent Reznor\u201d; \u201cLeague of Extraordinary Djentlemen\u201d; etc.), but to saddle them with one particular genre description would be a great disservice to all Periphery has to offer. Boundary pushing experimentalism, nuanced mathematical cacophony and complex grooves that are alternately engaging and innovative are just the tip of the iceberg for the six-piece monstrosity, who are truly only now getting started.

They toured heavily in support of this album, playing with Buckcherry and Avenged Sevenfold, and later on Nickelback, in arenas across North America. Night after night, the boys would go back to the bus with their ears ringing from 15,000 fans screaming their lyrics.\n\nKnowing that they would need something great to follow up with, the boys set out to write their sophomore album on Capitol, \u201cMiss America.\u201d Topping the Active Rock and Hard Rock charts yet again with \u201cSex is Good\u201d and \u201cStupid Girl\u201d solidified Saving Abel\u2019s place both on the radio and live. Setting out on their own tour this time, Saving Abel headlined theaters around the country for almost 2 years non-stop. They toured with several artists and made a lot of friends along the way, but always kept their focus on the fans, and their eyes toward the future.\n\nJason Flom left Capitol and the band did as well. The band signed to a new major label and the band didn\u2019t want to fall into a rut of making the third album sound like the first two, Saving Abel returned to their Mississippi origin, adding a depth and soul that could only come from their country roots. Using banjos, mandolins, and a healthy helping of moonshine, Saving Abel went into the studio with a mission to stick with \u201cwhat they know best,\u201d and wrote an emotional, soulful record that was still rooted in rock-n-roll, but highlighted their classic country roots. Listening to \u201cBringing Down The Giant\u201d was as reminiscent of Hank Williams as it was of Elvis Presley. In hindsight the album was probably a little self-indulgent and while songs like \u201cConstantly\u201d and \u201cPictures of Elvis\u201d highlighted their softer side and amazing song writing ability, the label and band had creative differences over what to release as a first single and the label won, the result being a mildly successful rollout and the label all but abandoned the band, leaving them in the unusual predicament of not knowing what to do next.\n\nThe next steps were difficult and profound but in the end proved liberating on numerous levels. First the band parted ways with their label and publishing company, those splits were followed by a split with their management, business management and booking agent. The band then hired former Creed, Sevendust, and Paramore manager and Silent Majority Group / ADA label president Jeff Hanson. Hanson brought in new lead singer Scotty Austin and new drummer Steven Pulley, a new booking agent, fan relations manager, business manager, merch company, and radio promotion team and finally enlisted a new producer, former 12 Stones guitarist and songwriter Justin Rimer. \u201cBringing in new faces wasn\u2019t done because we were unhappy with the previous team\u2019s performance, I just felt like we should surround ourselves with people who wouldn\u2019t be disappointed if we didn\u2019t have a gold or platinum record. Those are benchmarks that are much more difficult to achieve than they were 5 years ago and are honestly unrealistic expectations for anyone.\u201d Says Hanson. Hanson then helped the band form their own label in order to move forward on their own terms. The new label was named Tennessippi Whiskey Records based on the fact that the all of the members of the band are from Tennessee and Mississippi and are known for their moderate but very public Jack Daniels consumption Ditching the tour bus and getting back in a van in order to afford the recording of a new record on off days from their perpetual tour, along with a renewed focus on their live performances and spending time in person and on the internet with their fans, the band saw a resurgence in fan attendance at shows and the number of people following the band on their social media sites.\n\nWith the addition of new members Scotty Austin and Steven Pulley to the existing core of Saving Abel Jason Null, Scott Bartlett, and Eric Taylor, the result of this new lineup and independent attitude of the band has been amazing. \u201cThere is so much excitement being generated on a nightly basis by the fans based on their love of Scotty Austin, it makes it seem like it is 2008 again and we are about to blow up again, and I can\u2019t believe this level of excitement exists all over again\u201d says founding member and guitarist Jason Null. Null also goes on to say\u2026 \u201cScotty has an autistic child, and seeing the sacrifices he makes every day to make a life for his son makes it a lot easier for me to get back in a van and play smaller venues without complaining after I spent years in arenas on a bus, him being here really has changed the way all of us view what we do.\u201d Scotty Austin\u2026 \u201cI spent years playing cover gigs, singing 4 hours a night, this is literally a dream come true for me. Playing every night to fans that came to hear and sing along to songs that these guys and I wrote, I could never get tired of it. It also gives me a small platform to try to draw awareness to Autism, if nothing more comes of this than to make my son\u2019s life just a tiny bit better, it will have been worth it. I can\u2019t thank these guys enough for giving me this chance.\u201d Steven Pulley\u2026 \u201cScotty and I literally quit our day jobs the day we were called about being in this band. We were blown away that a nationally recognized band like Saving Abel, who could have gotten any players in America to replace their leaving members, would actually prefer to have a couple of guys like us mainly because we were guys from a small town (Jackson, TN) with big dreams. We basically left home, went on the road, and loved every minute since. Knowing what\u2019s coming on this record, we are definitely living a dream.\u201d\n\nThe new songs from their forthcoming album Blood Stained Revolution mirror the new energy and attitude of the band. The songs themselves are mostly uptempo and upbeat and pay homage to all of the bands we love, Guns and Roses, Tool, and The Allman Brothers. The album is absolutely a continuation of founding member Jason Null\u2019s mainstream southern rock hit writing abilities but with an amazing added energy similar to that of Mick Jagger or Scott Weiland being provided by Scotty Austin. The band is also eager to note that the new album is the first album on which all of the band members were able to participate in the creative process. On the first three albums the creative process was partially controlled by outside factors but on this album it seemed as though the floodgates were open because there were no limitations or interferences and everyone in the band was asked to contribute the ideas that had been percolating among the members for years that they hadn\u2019t always been able to share. Jeff Hanson says\u2026 \u201c I am a huge southern rock fan and Scott Bartlett\u2019s solo album and the Trash the Brand album, Scotty Austin and Steven Pulley\u2019s previous band together, are two of my favorite albums, so having them contribute to the song writing on this album has made a huge difference and in my mind sets it apart from previous Saving Abel records. The fact that there were no time constraints this time and the record was basically written on the road seems to have allowed the band to write when they wanted to as opposed to writing when they had to. It\u2019s fun not forced.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming release will be released on November 11, the date was aptly chosen because by the band because it is Veteran\u2019s Day. Individually and collectively Saving Abel and its members have always been incredible supporters of the amazing men and women in the US Armed Forces. \u201c18 Days,\u201d \u201cDrowning\", and \u201cMiss America\u201d were all written and dedicated to the US Military. Since 2009, Saving Abel has had the honor of being invited and traveling to play for the troops in some of the most remote and dangerous places in the world. \u2026Iraq, Qatar, Cuba, Japan, and India just to name a few. No matter where they are or what they are doing, no matter if it\u2019s 5 minutes to show time, the boys in Saving Abel will ALWAYS stop what they are doing to acknowledge and thank a Soldier, Sailor, Airman or Marine. Scott Bartlett states \u201c It\u2019s amazing that we now feel unencumbered by the confines of the traditional music business to the point that we can release our album on a date of our choosing, We were actually told that we were crazy to be releasing a new record in the 4th quarter, but it is actually a statement for us, to release this album on our own terms, when we want and how we want. At the end of the day all that matters is our music and our fans and what time of year it is isn\u2019t really a part of that equation. We\u2019re celebrating Veteran\u2019s Day with a new record and that\u2019s awesome!\u201d\n\nSaving Abel has no plans to slow down and has dates booked into 2015 and further. The band is still in the van and is starting a \u201cPledge Music\u201d campaign to try to auction off some unique and special VIP experiences in order to be able to get back in a bus again. With the pre sale of the new album, the band will be offering additional add on packages that include fishing and BBQs with the band, guitar lessons, and to allowing fans to perform on their next record.\u201d It\u2019s all about finding that balance between enjoying your fans, family and friends and having a business that allows you to play music for a living, if we can go fishing and have meals with our fans and it helps us be able to stay on the road, we\u2019re all for that, hopefully we can do this forever\u201d says bassist Eric Taylor.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "319 Frost St, Brooklyn, NY", "Artist": "Covet", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8208616.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.938692, 40.719277], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Progressive Rock, Instrumental Rock, Adventure Rock, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Steel", "moreBioInfo": "We a three friends that love to travel and make music!\n\nYvette Young-Guitars\nDavid Adamiak-Bass\nForrest Rice-Drums", "otherInfo": "Periphery - HAIL STAN: North American 2019"}, {"Address": "149 Westchester Ave, Port Chester, NY 10573", "Artist": "Dumpstaphunk", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9947971.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.66549, 41.00139], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Funk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Capitol Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "Dumpstaphunk stands out among New Orleans\u2019 best as one of the funkiest bands to ever arise from the Crescent City. Born on the Jazz & Heritage Festival stage, and descended from Neville family bloodlines, these soldiers of funk ignite a deep, gritty groove that dares listeners not to move. Their performances combine ingenious musicianship and complex funk and jazz arrangements with soulful melodies that are simple enough for anyone to enjoy. In Big Easy tradition, dueling baselines from Tony Hall and Nick Daniels III set off one of the dirtiest rhythm sections on the planet, while Ivan Neville lights up the Hammond B3 keys and cousin Ian Neville\u2019s funky guitar riffs send the groove into overdrive. The band recently welcomed their newest member, Alvin Ford Jr. to the quintet, a New Orleans born and raised powerhouse drummer. Dumpstaphunk tosses around lead vocals and four-part harmonies the way Sly & the Family Stone did, but with three studio albums under their belt, Dumpstaphunk stands on the merit of their own material.

Neha (pronounced NEY-ha) penned eleven of the twelve tunes on her album, demonstrating her prowess as an artful songwriter.\n\nA gifted singer, composer & pianist, Neha\u2019s style can be characterized as a smorgasbord of musical personalities. She cites influences such as Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Otis Redding, Donny Hathaway, Sam Cooke, Dinah Washington, and Carmen MacRae, to name a few. While definitely rooted in jazz, elements of folk, blues, pop and her mother's classical indian musical background also permeate.\n\nA graduate of Northwestern University with a degree in Economics, Neha spent four years post-college working for the tech giant, Google, Inc in the Bay Area. She penned some of her first tracks from her cubicle, and spent much of her free time hitting the jam sessions and songwriting open mics in San Francisco before quitting to pursue her Masters degree at the prestigious New England Conservatory of Music.\n\nSince graduating from NEC in May of 2012, Neha been actively engaged in the Boston performance scene, performing at prestigious venues like Scullers Jazz Club, Lizard Lounge, and Club Passim. In New York, her performance credits include headlining at the famous off-Broadway show \"Sleep No More,\" and being regulars at venues such as The Rockwood Music Hall, Jazz at the Kitano Room, and Caffe Vivaldi. Most recently, Neha came off a mini tour performing the world premiere of \"Project Gilgamesh\" in Cleveland, Ohio written by multi-talented contemporary violinist and composer Daniel Bernard Roumain.\n\nAn account of all things reverie, The Dreamer openly explores Neha\u2019s deepest personal thoughts and wants. Songs like \u201cThe Dreamer,\u201d and \u201cWay Back Then\u201d explore her desire to go against cultural and social expectations of her, while songs \"The Darkness\" and \"Whole\" give us an intimate understanding of who Neha is as a person. Other songs like \"The Willow Tree,\" and \"The French Man\" play on her innocence and penchant for day dreaming, delivered through charming lyrics and wispy vocal lines.\n\n\nBacked-up by her exceptionally talented six bandmates whom she met at NEC (Connor Baker - drums, Evan Allen - piano, Dorsey Bass - bass, Bobby Spellman - Trumpet, Katie Seiler - vocals, Rachel Panitch - violin and vocals), The Dreamer is a tenderly crafted record, a definitive smorgasbord of Neha\u2019s life experiences. Rooted in her love affair with jazz, folk, blues, and her mother\u2019s long standing classical Indian musical training, the record results in a gorgeously personal and open account of Neha's life and deepest vulnerabilities, painted in piercing melodies and whimsically crafted arrangements.\n\n\"Music is as necessary to me as food or air\" says the first generation Indian-American singer-songwriter. \"Leaving the life I led in San Francisco [at Google] and starting all over was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but definitely the most gratifying as well. I spent so much of my life dancing around [creativity], wishing I could be part of that community of creating music and art, but never had the courage to follow through. Finally I just realized I owed it to myself to really go for it, head first. Everyone should have the chance to pursue what they've always envisioned for themselves.\"\n\nNeha currently resides in Brooklyn, NY where she teaches on the faculty at the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music in Park Slope and at the Jalopy Theater and Music School in Red Hook.

Rheinshagen, principal bassist of the New York Philharmonic, and compositional techniques with the legendary Lloyd Reese) while absorbing vernacular music from the great jazz masters, first-hand. His early professional experience, in the 40\u2019s, found him touring with bands like Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory and Lionel Hampton.\n\nEventually he settled in New York where he played and recorded with the leading musicians of the 1950\u2019s\u2013 Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Art Tatum and Duke Ellington himself. One of the few bassists to do so, Mingus quickly developed as a leader of musicians. He was also an accomplished pianist who could have made a career playing that instrument. By the mid-50\u2019s he had formed his own publishing and recording companies to protect and document his growing repertoire of original music. He also founded the \u201cJazz Workshop,\u201d a group which enabled young composers to have their new works performed in concert and on recordings.\n\nMingus soon found himself at the forefront of the avant-garde. His recordings bear witness to the extraordinarily creative body of work that followed. They include: Pithecanthropus Erectus, The Clown, Tijuana Moods, Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Ah Um, The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, Cumbia and Jazz Fusion, Let My Children Hear Music. He recorded over a hundred albums and wrote over three hundred scores.\nAlthough he wrote his first concert piece, \u201cHalf-Mast Inhibition,\u201d when he was seventeen years old, it was not recorded until twenty years later by a 22-piece orchestra with Gunther Schuller conducting. It was the presentation of \u201cRevelations\u201d which combined jazz and classical idioms, at the 1955 Brandeis Festival of the Creative Arts, that established him as one of the foremost jazz composers of his day.\n\nIn 1971 Mingus was awarded the Slee Chair of Music and spent a semester teaching composition at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In the same year his autobiography, Beneath the Underdog, was published by Knopf. In 1972 it appeared in a Bantam paperback and was reissued after his death, in 1980, by Viking/Penguin and again by Pantheon Books, in 1991. In 1972 he also re-signed with Columbia Records. His music was performed frequently by ballet companies, and Alvin Ailey choreographed an hour program called \u201cThe Mingus Dances\u201d during a 1972 collaboration with the Robert Joffrey Ballet Company.\n\nHe toured extensively throughout Europe, Japan, Canada, South America and the United States until the end of 1977 when he was diagnosed as having a rare nerve disease, Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis. He was confined to a wheelchair, and although he was no longer able to write music on paper or compose at the piano, his last works were sung into a tape recorder.\n\nFrom the 1960\u2019s until his death in 1979 at age 56, Mingus remained in the forefront of American music. When asked to comment on his accomplishments, Mingus said that his abilities as a bassist were the result of hard work but that his talent for composition came from God.\n\nMingus received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Smithsonian Institute, and the Guggenheim Foundation (two grants). He also received an honorary degree from Brandeis and an award from Yale University. At a memorial following Mingus\u2019 death, Steve Schlesinger of the Guggenheim Foundation commented that Mingus was one of the few artists who received two grants and added: \u201cI look forward to the day when we can transcend labels like jazz and acknowledge Charles Mingus as the major American composer that he is.\u201d The New Yorker wrote: \u201cFor sheer melodic and rhythmic and structural originality, his compositions may equal anything written in western music in the twentieth century.\u201d\n\nHe died in Mexico on January 5, 1979, and his wife, Sue Graham Mingus, scattered his ashes in the Ganges River in India. Both New York City and Washington, D.C. honored him posthumously with a \u201cCharles Mingus Day.\u201d\n\nAfter his death, the National Endowment for the Arts provided grants for a Mingus foundation created by Sue Mingus called \u201cLet My Children Hear Music\u201d which catalogued all of Mingus\u2019 works. The microfilms of these works were then given to the Music Division of the New York Public Library where they are currently available for study and scholarship \u2013 a first for jazz. Sue Mingus has founded three working repertory bands called the Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Orchestra, and the Mingus Big Band, which continue to perform his music. Biographies of Charles Mingus include Mingus by Brian Priestley, Mingus/Mingus by Janet Coleman and Al Young, Myself When I Am Real by Gene Santoro, and Tonight at Noon, a memoir by Sue Mingus.\n\nMingus\u2019 masterwork, \u201cEpitaph,\u201d a composition which is more than 4000 measures long and which requires two hours to perform, was discovered during the cataloguing process. With the help of a grant from the Ford Foundation, the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by Gunther Schuller, in a concert produced by Sue Mingus at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989, ten years after Mingus\u2019 death.\n\nThe New Yorker wrote that \u201cEpitaph\u201d represents the first advance in jazz composition since Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cBlack, Brown, and Beige,\u201d which was written in 1943. The New York Times said it ranked with the \u201cmost memorable jazz events of the decade.\u201d Convinced that it would never be performed in his lifetime, Mingus called his work \u201cEpitaph,\u201d declaring that he wrote it \u201cfor my tombstone.\u201d\n\nThe Library of Congress purchased the Charles Mingus Collection, a major acquisition, in 1993; this included autographed manuscripts, photographs, literary manuscripts, correspondence, and tape recordings of interviews, broadcasts, recording sessions, and Mingus composing at the piano.\n\nSue Mingus has published a number of educational books through Hal Leonard Publishing, including Charles Mingus: More Than a Fake Book, Charles Mingus: More Than a Play-Along, Charles Mingus: Easy Piano Solos, many big band charts\u2014 including the Simply Mingus set of big band music charts\u2013 and a Mingus guitar book.\n\nReprinted in part from More than a Fake Book \u00a9 1991 Jazz Workshop, Inc.\n\nLinks to Additional Biographical and Historical Information on the Web\n\nLibrary of Congress\nAn index to the holdings of the Charles Mingus Collection, Music Division of the Library of Congress.\nhttp://www.loc.gov/performingarts/encyclopedia/collections/mingus.html", "otherInfo": "Jazz Standard proudly presents our tenth annual Mingus High School Competition 1979).

I got the word back that the label thought maybe it was a good idea to put two CDs out\u2014one of them the slow stuff, more for listening, and the other, like B.B. King said, if you want to boogie-woogie all night long.\u201d The result has a title both simple and clever: Rhythm & Blues, the first double-album set of his storied career. But more than five decades into a life as one of the world\u2019s leading bluesmen, Buddy Guy is used to new surprises, challenges, and accolades. At age 76, he\u2019s a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, a major influence on rock titans like Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, a pioneer of Chicago\u2019s fabled West Side sound, and a living link to that city\u2019s halcyon days of electric blues. He has received 6 Grammy Awards, 28 Blues Music Awards (the most any artist has received), the Billboard magazine Century Award for distinguished artistic achievement, and the Presidential National Medal of Arts. Rolling Stone ranked him in the top 25 of its \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.\" The last year, in fact, has proven to be one of Guy\u2019s most remarkable ever. He was awarded the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime contribution to American culture; earlier in the year, at a performance at the White House, he even persuaded President Obama to join him on a chorus of \u201cSweet Home Chicago.\u201d Also in 2012, he published his long-awaited memoir, When I Left Home, and released Live at Legends, which has been nominated for Best New Recording in the Living Blues Awards. Meanwhile, Guy keeps looking to the future of the blues through his ongoing work with his 14-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Quinn Sullivan. Now the story continues with Rhythm & Blues, 21 tracks which feature contributions from a stellar and wide-ranging set of guests, including Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Brad Whitford of Aerosmith and rising guitar wizard Gary Clark, Jr. \u201cIf you watch a ballgame, it seems like those guys are angry at one another, but when they finish playing, they go out and have drinks together,\u201d says Guy. \u201cMusicians were doing that before anybody\u2014we don't have rivals as far as who can outplay who, but we have so much fun letting other people think that's what it is. So it\u2019s really a blessing to have all of these guys on here.\u201d He had a specific inspiration for a duet with his friend Kid Rock, realizing that \u201cMessin\u2019 with the Kid\u201d\u2014a 1960 hit for Guy\u2019s long-time partner Junior Wells\u2014was a perfect fit lyrically and musically. \u201cI was surprised he hadn't gotten there himself,\u201d says Guy. \u201cI saw him at the White House and I thought, \u2018I ain't gonna tell him, 'cause he might go and do it himself, I'm going to wait until I can do it!\u201d I threw it at him and he jumped the fence\u2014he did a hell of a job with it.\u201d Probably the most unexpected guest on Rhythm & Blues (which was produced by Guy\u2019s frequent collaborator Tom Hambridge, and recorded at Nashville\u2019s Blackbird Studios) is country superstar Keith Urban, who joins Guy on an emotional ballad called \u201cOne Day Away.\u201d Guy maintains that he was well aware of Urban\u2019s instrumental prowess before they teamed up. \u201cI listen to everything, regardless of what type of music it\u2019s branded,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I hear a guitar that makes me pat my feet, and try to not go to sleep 'cause I\u2019m afraid I might miss something, it's all right with me. Any guy who can think about playing music is a friend of mine, and the door is always open.\u201d One song in particular jumped out at Guy, a funky travelogue called \u201cMeet Me In Chicago\u201d written by slide guitar maestro Robert Randolph. \u201cI really fell in love with that one,\u201d he says. \u201cI been in Chicago 56 years\u2014that sounds just like me. It's not really blues, but it's a good beat, so I wanted to see if I could do something with it.\u201d Though Buddy Guy will forever be associated with Chicago, his story actually begins in Louisiana. One of five children, he was born in 1936 to a sharecropper\u2019s family and raised on a plantation near the small town of Lettsworth, located some 140 miles northwest of New Orleans. Buddy was just seven years old when he fashioned his first makeshift \u201cguitar\u201d\u2014a two-string contraption attached to a piece of wood and secured with his mother\u2019s hairpins. On the new album, he recounts these days on such deeply personal songs as \u201cI Came Up Hard\u201d and \u201cMy Mama Loved Me.\u201d In 1957, he took his guitar to Chicago, where he would permanently alter the direction of the instrument, first on numerous sessions for Chess Records playing alongside Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Muddy Waters, and the rest of the label\u2019s legendary roster, and then on recordings of his own. His incendiary style\u2014still in evidence all over Rhythm & Blues\u2014left its mark on guitarists from Jimmy Page to John Mayer. \u201cHe was for me what Elvis was probably like for other people,\u201d said Eric Clapton at Guy\u2019s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2005. \u201cMy course was set, and he was my pilot.\u201d These many years later, Buddy Guy is a genuine American treasure, and one of the final surviving connections to an historic era in the country\u2019s musical evolution. And still, as one glorious track on Rhythm & Blues puts it, he claims that \u201cAll That Makes Me Happy is the Blues.\u201d \u201cI worry a lot about the legacy of Muddy, Wolf, and all the guys who created this stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cI want people to remember them. It's like the Ford car\u2014Henry Ford invented the Ford car, and regardless how much technology they got on them now, you still have that little sign that says \u2018Ford\u2019 on the front. \u201cOne of the last things Muddy Waters told me\u2014when I found out how ill he was, I gave him a call and said, \u2018I'm on my way to your house.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Don't come out here, I'm doing all right. Just keep the damn blues alive.\u2019 They all told me that if they left here before I did, then everything was going to be on my shoulders. So as long as I'm here, I'm going to do whatever I can to keep it alive.\u201d Welcome to the official Facebook page of Chicago's very own Blues legend!

You probably felt the earth rumbling, announcing the man's bone-deep baritone, or you felt the air change as the warmth of his sound filled the atmosphere like a hug from above. That's because All Rise, his sixth studio album, marks a return to Porter's beloved original songwriting \u2014 heart-on-sleeve lyrics imbued with everyday philosophy and real-life detail, set to a stirring mix of jazz, soul, blues, and gospel. Produced by Troy Miller (Laura Mvula, Jamie Cullum, Emili Sand\u00e9), the set also represents the evolution of Porter's art to something even more emphatic, emotive, intimate, and universal too.\n\nAs Porter worked out this album's direction, he looked inward, upward, and around him, and arrived at a raison d'\u00eatre found in the title, ALL RISE. \u201cWe hear that phrase when presidents or judges come into the room,\u201d says Porter, \u201cbut I'm thinking all of us rise \u2014 not just one person being exalted. We are all exalted and lifted up by love. This is my political thought and my real truth. It comes from my personality, my mother's personality, the personality of the blues, and of black people. It's this idea of making do with the scraps, of resurrection and ascension, and of whatever the current situation is, it can get better through love.\u201d\n\nThough Porter had an acclaimed role in the original 1999 Broadway cast of It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues \u2014 and staged his own Nat King Cole & Me musical in 2004 \u2014 it was inevitable that he'd became known for his songs. That was made abundantly clear when both of Porter's indie albums \u2014 2010's Water and 2012's Be Good \u2014 received Grammy nominations, paving the way for his world-beating 2013 Blue Note debut, Liquid Spirit, which won the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album. He hasn't let down his legion of fans since, whether collaborating with Disclosure on \"Holding On,\" scoring another Grammy for Take Me to the Alley (2016), or telling his life story through Cole's songbook. Like others, Porter is still surprised by his runaway success, but he has a theory: \"I was soothed by my voice as a child and I think that's the same thing others get from it. I'm trying to heal myself with these songs.\"\n\nAnd that's the thing about love that All Rise keeps circling. Even when it's painful, confusing, out of reach, or under attack, love is ultimately curative.

Her instantly recognizable voice\u2014capable of being sultry, assertive and roaring\u2014delivers every song with unparalleled honesty and passion. Her wide-open vision of contemporary Americana roots and soul music showcases the evolution of a passionate artist with an up-to-the-minute musical and lyrical approach. With her new Alligator Records album, AMERICA'S CHILD, Copeland confidently announces an electrifying new chapter in her constantly evolving story. Produced by Americana Instrumentalist Of The Year winner Will Kimbrough (who also plays guitar on the album) and recorded in Nashville, AMERICA'S CHILD is a courageous and fiery statement of purpose, a major step forward for the singer whose musical consciousness continues to expand as her star continues to rise.\n\nAMERICA'S CHILD is by far Copeland\u2019s most compelling work yet, with music swelling beyond blues and into spirited Americana, with elements of rock, soul, and country. From AMERICA'S CHILD\u2019s anthemic opening track, Ain\u2019t Got Time For Hate, to the closing lullaby, the traditional Go To Sleepy Little Baby, Shemekia sings with passion and insight about the chaos and uncertainty in the world while still finding joy all around her.\n\nWith guests including John Prine, Rhiannon Giddens, Mary Gauthier, Emmylou Harris, Steve Cropper, J.D. Wilkes, Al Perkins and members of the Time Jumpers, AMERICA'S CHILD bursts with Copeland\u2019s bravado and embraces with her tenderness. Gauthier and songwriter/executive producer John Hahn wrote two striking songs for the project. Smoked Ham And Peaches is a search for truth and tranquility in America, featuring Giddens on African banjo. Americans celebrates our collective diversity in all its forms and colors. American music legend Prine joins Shemekia for a stirring duet on his own Great Rain. Guitar great Cropper adds his scorching playing to the ballad Promised Myself, written by Shemekia\u2019s father, the late bluesman Johnny Clyde Copeland. And her version of I\u2019m Not Like Everybody Else transforms the Kinks song into a blues-fueled declaration of independence.\n\nUpon the birth of her son Johnny Lee Copeland-Schultz in 2016, Shemekia, with fresh eyes, began to take an even deeper look at the state of the world. Of the new album, she says, \u201cAfter having a child, I started thinking about the world I brought him into, how it actually is and how I wished it was and all the things he will have to go through. And to live in this world today, you have to have a strong foundation like I did to make it through. So that\u2019s what 'AMERICA'S CHILD' means to me. I\u2019m truly grateful to all the artists that joined me on this record\u2014it wasn\u2019t about the genre for anyone, it was about the music and mutual love and respect.\u201d\n\nWhen Shemekia broke on the scene at age 18 in 1998 with her groundbreaking Alligator Records debut CD Turn The Heat Up, she instantly became a blues and R&B force to be reckoned with. News outlets from The New York Times to CNN praised Copeland\u2019s talent, larger-than-life personality, and true star power. With each subsequent release, Copeland\u2019s music has continued to grow. From her debut through 2005\u2019s The Soul Truth, Shemekia earned eight Blues Music Awards, a host of Living Blues Awards (including the prestigious 2010 Blues Artist Of The Year) and more accolades from fans, critics and fellow musicians. 2000\u2019s Wicked received a Grammy nomination. Two highly successful releases on Telarc (including 2012\u2019s Grammy-nominated 33 1/3) cemented her reputation as a singer who, according to NPR\u2019s All Things Considered, \u201cembodies the blues with her powerful vocal chops and fearless look at social issues.\u201d\n\nCopeland returned to Alligator Records in 2015 with the Grammy-nominated Outskirts Of Love. She won the 2017 Living Blues Readers\u2019 Award for Blues Artist Of The Year (Female), the same distinction she won the year before. She also took home the 2016 Blues Music Award (BMA) for Contemporary Blues Female Artist Of The Year. Outskirts Of Love won the BMA for Best Blues Album Of The Year. MOJO said Copeland was \u201cspectacular, stirring, sanctified and sassy.\u201d\n\nShemekia Copeland has performed thousands of gigs at clubs, festivals and concert halls all over the world and has appeared on national television, NPR, and in newspapers, films and magazines. She\u2019s sung with Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt, Keith Richards, Carlos Santana, James Cotton and many others. She opened for The Rolling Stones and entertained U.S. troops in Iraq and Kuwait. Jeff Beck calls her \u201camazing.\u201d Santana says, \u201cShe\u2019s incandescent...a diamond.\u201d In 2012, she performed with B.B. King, Mick Jagger, Buddy Guy, Trombone Shorty, Gary Clark, Jr. and others at the White House for President and Mrs. Obama.\n\nNow, with AMERICA'S CHILD, Shemekia Copeland is standing on the cusp of her greatest success. Her intensely empowering, American music is as insightful as it is fun. NPR Music says, \u201cShe brings a perfect balance of authority and understatement to each song.\u201d No Depression adds, \u201cWhen Shemekia Copeland opens her mouth, everybody pays attention. She pierces your soul.

I got the word back that the label thought maybe it was a good idea to put two CDs out\u2014one of them the slow stuff, more for listening, and the other, like B.B. King said, if you want to boogie-woogie all night long.\u201d The result has a title both simple and clever: Rhythm & Blues, the first double-album set of his storied career. But more than five decades into a life as one of the world\u2019s leading bluesmen, Buddy Guy is used to new surprises, challenges, and accolades. At age 76, he\u2019s a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, a major influence on rock titans like Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, a pioneer of Chicago\u2019s fabled West Side sound, and a living link to that city\u2019s halcyon days of electric blues. He has received 6 Grammy Awards, 28 Blues Music Awards (the most any artist has received), the Billboard magazine Century Award for distinguished artistic achievement, and the Presidential National Medal of Arts. Rolling Stone ranked him in the top 25 of its \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.\" The last year, in fact, has proven to be one of Guy\u2019s most remarkable ever. He was awarded the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime contribution to American culture; earlier in the year, at a performance at the White House, he even persuaded President Obama to join him on a chorus of \u201cSweet Home Chicago.\u201d Also in 2012, he published his long-awaited memoir, When I Left Home, and released Live at Legends, which has been nominated for Best New Recording in the Living Blues Awards. Meanwhile, Guy keeps looking to the future of the blues through his ongoing work with his 14-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Quinn Sullivan. Now the story continues with Rhythm & Blues, 21 tracks which feature contributions from a stellar and wide-ranging set of guests, including Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Brad Whitford of Aerosmith and rising guitar wizard Gary Clark, Jr. \u201cIf you watch a ballgame, it seems like those guys are angry at one another, but when they finish playing, they go out and have drinks together,\u201d says Guy. \u201cMusicians were doing that before anybody\u2014we don't have rivals as far as who can outplay who, but we have so much fun letting other people think that's what it is. So it\u2019s really a blessing to have all of these guys on here.\u201d He had a specific inspiration for a duet with his friend Kid Rock, realizing that \u201cMessin\u2019 with the Kid\u201d\u2014a 1960 hit for Guy\u2019s long-time partner Junior Wells\u2014was a perfect fit lyrically and musically. \u201cI was surprised he hadn't gotten there himself,\u201d says Guy. \u201cI saw him at the White House and I thought, \u2018I ain't gonna tell him, 'cause he might go and do it himself, I'm going to wait until I can do it!\u201d I threw it at him and he jumped the fence\u2014he did a hell of a job with it.\u201d Probably the most unexpected guest on Rhythm & Blues (which was produced by Guy\u2019s frequent collaborator Tom Hambridge, and recorded at Nashville\u2019s Blackbird Studios) is country superstar Keith Urban, who joins Guy on an emotional ballad called \u201cOne Day Away.\u201d Guy maintains that he was well aware of Urban\u2019s instrumental prowess before they teamed up. \u201cI listen to everything, regardless of what type of music it\u2019s branded,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I hear a guitar that makes me pat my feet, and try to not go to sleep 'cause I\u2019m afraid I might miss something, it's all right with me. Any guy who can think about playing music is a friend of mine, and the door is always open.\u201d One song in particular jumped out at Guy, a funky travelogue called \u201cMeet Me In Chicago\u201d written by slide guitar maestro Robert Randolph. \u201cI really fell in love with that one,\u201d he says. \u201cI been in Chicago 56 years\u2014that sounds just like me. It's not really blues, but it's a good beat, so I wanted to see if I could do something with it.\u201d Though Buddy Guy will forever be associated with Chicago, his story actually begins in Louisiana. One of five children, he was born in 1936 to a sharecropper\u2019s family and raised on a plantation near the small town of Lettsworth, located some 140 miles northwest of New Orleans. Buddy was just seven years old when he fashioned his first makeshift \u201cguitar\u201d\u2014a two-string contraption attached to a piece of wood and secured with his mother\u2019s hairpins. On the new album, he recounts these days on such deeply personal songs as \u201cI Came Up Hard\u201d and \u201cMy Mama Loved Me.\u201d In 1957, he took his guitar to Chicago, where he would permanently alter the direction of the instrument, first on numerous sessions for Chess Records playing alongside Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Muddy Waters, and the rest of the label\u2019s legendary roster, and then on recordings of his own. His incendiary style\u2014still in evidence all over Rhythm & Blues\u2014left its mark on guitarists from Jimmy Page to John Mayer. \u201cHe was for me what Elvis was probably like for other people,\u201d said Eric Clapton at Guy\u2019s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2005. \u201cMy course was set, and he was my pilot.\u201d These many years later, Buddy Guy is a genuine American treasure, and one of the final surviving connections to an historic era in the country\u2019s musical evolution. And still, as one glorious track on Rhythm & Blues puts it, he claims that \u201cAll That Makes Me Happy is the Blues.\u201d \u201cI worry a lot about the legacy of Muddy, Wolf, and all the guys who created this stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cI want people to remember them. It's like the Ford car\u2014Henry Ford invented the Ford car, and regardless how much technology they got on them now, you still have that little sign that says \u2018Ford\u2019 on the front. \u201cOne of the last things Muddy Waters told me\u2014when I found out how ill he was, I gave him a call and said, \u2018I'm on my way to your house.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Don't come out here, I'm doing all right. Just keep the damn blues alive.\u2019 They all told me that if they left here before I did, then everything was going to be on my shoulders. So as long as I'm here, I'm going to do whatever I can to keep it alive.\u201d Welcome to the official Facebook page of Chicago's very own Blues legend!

Throughout his prolific career as part of three of the greatest live groups in rock history \u2013 Allman Brothers Band, Gov\u2019t Mule and the Dead \u2013 his virtuosic artistry has led to thousands of unforgettable performances and millions of album and track sales. Despite all of the ground that Haynes has covered on his musical journey, the impressive thing is that he still has many miles to explore. On his newest solo album Ashes and Dust, he puts forth one of his most gorgeous, musically rich and personal albums to date. It is endlessly exciting to see one of the most brilliant minds in modern music shine an entirely new light on the depths of his creativity.\n\n\n\nAshes and Dust, only the third studio album Haynes has ever released under his own name, is a masterful work of art and a particularly important statement for Haynes. The songs are immediately and clearly different from his usual style \u2013 encompassing beautiful acoustic arrangements, a rootsy/Americana soundscape and honeyed vocals that cut straight through to the soul. Although many of these songs are brand new, some of the tunes that make up this album have been dear to Warren for years. In some cases he has been carrying them around for 20 or 30 years, waiting for the right time to record them.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing songs all my life from a more folky, singer-songwriter, even Celtic direction,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while, I\u2019ve been compiling songs that didn\u2019t necessarily fit in with Gov\u2019t Mule or the Allman Brothers or even my last solo album. So this record was really a chance to bring a lot of that music to fruition. It\u2019s really given me the opportunity to take a lot of songs I love, that didn\u2019t have a home, and build a home for them.\u201d\n\n\n\nGiven his life-long commitment to experimentation and eclecticism, though, it should come as no surprise that the album reveals yet another new side of his musical personality. Knowing that he wanted to pursue a more folk-based approach on this project, he brought in the New Jersey-based Americana band Railroad Earth as collaborators.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have a cool chemistry with those guys\u2014they add their own personality to the songs, but they\u2019re really great at interpreting, as well,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other casually for several years, and then at Del-Fest a few years ago, we winged a few songs together and it went really well. A little later, when I was opening the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY, they joined me for part of the set. We did that with a little more rehearsal, more preparation, and it was a great experience. At that point, I started thinking that maybe I should make my next record with these guys.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven with a clear sense of his goals for the album, Haynes and Railroad Earth still needed to explore various avenues and possibilities. They recorded more than 30 songs, often trying entirely different arrangements for each take or even recording late at night and not listening to playbacks until they reconvened the next day.\n\n\n\nFans of jam-band powerhouse Gov\u2019t Mule or the most recent soul-charged incarnation of the Warren Haynes Band\u2014or listeners who know Haynes through his 25-year affiliation with the Allman Brothers Band or his work with various extensions of the Grateful Dead family\u2014may be surprised to hear him working in a more song-based context. Several of the tracks on Ashes and Dust, like \u201cCompany Man\u201d and \u201cCoal Tattoo,\u201d are links to the folk tradition of narrative writing.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love story songs,\u201d Haynes says. \u201cI was very influenced by the whole concept of writing songs that tell a story. When I first got bitten by the singer-songwriter bug, when I was 14, it was due to those people who transported you to another place and another time with their songs\u201d\n\n\n\nWhich is not to say that Ashes and Dust leaves his instrumental adventures behind; several songs such as \u201cBlue Maiden\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cStranded in Self-Pity\u201d open out into more extended musical journeys. \u201cIn the studio, you\u2019re always looking for the balance between structure and focus and improvisation, opening up the music to chance\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut too much of either can keep the music from being as rewarding or as effective as it can be. Luckily my audience loves things to be stretched out. They love to hear the performance aspect. It was nice to take a few dirt roads, musically speaking, and go to some places none of us were expecting.\u201d\n\n\n\nHaynes shares that this album also brought out some new dimensions for him as a guitarist. \u201cMy playing here is quite different from what I\u2019ve done in recent projects. It\u2019s showcasing a side of my musicality that\u2019s unlike, in some cases, anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says, noting that he played a hollow-body D\u2019Angelico instrument (\u201ckind of a jazz guitar\u201d) for many of the sessions. \u201cI like to adapt to my surroundings\u2014to the music itself and to the musicians, trying to choose a musical voice that fits into the overall picture a certain way. I played a lot more slide guitar than I\u2019ve played in a long time and a lot of acoustic guitar, things that were more directed to weaving themselves into the fabric of this music.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the songs, \u201cSpots of Time\u201d (the lyrics of which include the phrase that gives the album its title), may be familiar to ardent Haynes-watchers. The song was written by Haynes and Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers have been playing it on stage in recent years. He had hoped that the song would be included if the Allmans made another studio album, but after the legendary band retired in 2014, he decided to record it himself\u2014but not before inviting Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and percussionist Marc Quinones to join him in the studio.\n\n\n\nOn \u201cGold Dust Woman,\u201d Grace Potter adds her unique vocal timbre. Sparking a fast friendship and instant chemistry several years ago, Haynes and Potter have performed this song together many times on stage and this endeavor seemed like the perfect opportunity to document it in the studio.

Throughout his prolific career as part of three of the greatest live groups in rock history \u2013 Allman Brothers Band, Gov\u2019t Mule and the Dead \u2013 his virtuosic artistry has led to thousands of unforgettable performances and millions of album and track sales. Despite all of the ground that Haynes has covered on his musical journey, the impressive thing is that he still has many miles to explore. On his newest solo album Ashes and Dust, he puts forth one of his most gorgeous, musically rich and personal albums to date. It is endlessly exciting to see one of the most brilliant minds in modern music shine an entirely new light on the depths of his creativity.\n\n\n\nAshes and Dust, only the third studio album Haynes has ever released under his own name, is a masterful work of art and a particularly important statement for Haynes. The songs are immediately and clearly different from his usual style \u2013 encompassing beautiful acoustic arrangements, a rootsy/Americana soundscape and honeyed vocals that cut straight through to the soul. Although many of these songs are brand new, some of the tunes that make up this album have been dear to Warren for years. In some cases he has been carrying them around for 20 or 30 years, waiting for the right time to record them.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing songs all my life from a more folky, singer-songwriter, even Celtic direction,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while, I\u2019ve been compiling songs that didn\u2019t necessarily fit in with Gov\u2019t Mule or the Allman Brothers or even my last solo album. So this record was really a chance to bring a lot of that music to fruition. It\u2019s really given me the opportunity to take a lot of songs I love, that didn\u2019t have a home, and build a home for them.\u201d\n\n\n\nGiven his life-long commitment to experimentation and eclecticism, though, it should come as no surprise that the album reveals yet another new side of his musical personality. Knowing that he wanted to pursue a more folk-based approach on this project, he brought in the New Jersey-based Americana band Railroad Earth as collaborators.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have a cool chemistry with those guys\u2014they add their own personality to the songs, but they\u2019re really great at interpreting, as well,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other casually for several years, and then at Del-Fest a few years ago, we winged a few songs together and it went really well. A little later, when I was opening the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY, they joined me for part of the set. We did that with a little more rehearsal, more preparation, and it was a great experience. At that point, I started thinking that maybe I should make my next record with these guys.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven with a clear sense of his goals for the album, Haynes and Railroad Earth still needed to explore various avenues and possibilities. They recorded more than 30 songs, often trying entirely different arrangements for each take or even recording late at night and not listening to playbacks until they reconvened the next day.\n\n\n\nFans of jam-band powerhouse Gov\u2019t Mule or the most recent soul-charged incarnation of the Warren Haynes Band\u2014or listeners who know Haynes through his 25-year affiliation with the Allman Brothers Band or his work with various extensions of the Grateful Dead family\u2014may be surprised to hear him working in a more song-based context. Several of the tracks on Ashes and Dust, like \u201cCompany Man\u201d and \u201cCoal Tattoo,\u201d are links to the folk tradition of narrative writing.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love story songs,\u201d Haynes says. \u201cI was very influenced by the whole concept of writing songs that tell a story. When I first got bitten by the singer-songwriter bug, when I was 14, it was due to those people who transported you to another place and another time with their songs\u201d\n\n\n\nWhich is not to say that Ashes and Dust leaves his instrumental adventures behind; several songs such as \u201cBlue Maiden\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cStranded in Self-Pity\u201d open out into more extended musical journeys. \u201cIn the studio, you\u2019re always looking for the balance between structure and focus and improvisation, opening up the music to chance\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut too much of either can keep the music from being as rewarding or as effective as it can be. Luckily my audience loves things to be stretched out. They love to hear the performance aspect. It was nice to take a few dirt roads, musically speaking, and go to some places none of us were expecting.\u201d\n\n\n\nHaynes shares that this album also brought out some new dimensions for him as a guitarist. \u201cMy playing here is quite different from what I\u2019ve done in recent projects. It\u2019s showcasing a side of my musicality that\u2019s unlike, in some cases, anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says, noting that he played a hollow-body D\u2019Angelico instrument (\u201ckind of a jazz guitar\u201d) for many of the sessions. \u201cI like to adapt to my surroundings\u2014to the music itself and to the musicians, trying to choose a musical voice that fits into the overall picture a certain way. I played a lot more slide guitar than I\u2019ve played in a long time and a lot of acoustic guitar, things that were more directed to weaving themselves into the fabric of this music.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the songs, \u201cSpots of Time\u201d (the lyrics of which include the phrase that gives the album its title), may be familiar to ardent Haynes-watchers. The song was written by Haynes and Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers have been playing it on stage in recent years. He had hoped that the song would be included if the Allmans made another studio album, but after the legendary band retired in 2014, he decided to record it himself\u2014but not before inviting Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and percussionist Marc Quinones to join him in the studio.\n\n\n\nOn \u201cGold Dust Woman,\u201d Grace Potter adds her unique vocal timbre. Sparking a fast friendship and instant chemistry several years ago, Haynes and Potter have performed this song together many times on stage and this endeavor seemed like the perfect opportunity to document it in the studio. That chemistry, along with Railroad Earth\u2019s unique instrumental interpretation, plays out here in fine form on the sole duet on the album.\n\n\n\nThe presence of these world-class musicians and artists, along with that of Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin and famed harmonica player Mickey Raphael (who each make an appearance here on \u201cWanderlust\u201d) is yet another reason why Ashes and Dust stands as such a personal, ambitious document of Warren Haynes\u2019 history. With songs that reach back to his initial fascination with music and others that go right up to the present day, it\u2019s a look behind his first-rate playing and into his enduring creative spirit.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese songs were each very important to me when they were written, especially since some of them go so far back,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all visual memories and experiences of certain time periods that I tried to capture in song. They really represent a collection of memories in my life.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1090 Wyckoff Ave, Queens, NY 11385", "Artist": "Loosh and the Best News", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8326769.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.902137, 40.694328], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "H0L0", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "217 E Houston St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Zanders", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.986751, 40.722165], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Mercury Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Lackadazies, Safety Meeting, Zanders, Danny Christmas"}, {"Address": "116 E 16th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Sean Patton", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7226363.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988348, 40.735421], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Indie, Acoustic, Singer/songwriter, Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand", "moreBioInfo": "Follow me on Twitter at twitter.com/mrseanpatton COMIX comixny.com", "otherInfo": "Sean Patton, Corinne Fisher, Derek Gaines, & More!"}, {"Address": "235 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Jeru the Damaja", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9620903.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.987088, 40.759536], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Sony Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Jeru the Damaja (born Kendrick Jeru Davis) aka D.

Indeed, since he debuted almost two and a half years ago on New York City hip hop station WWPR Power 105.1 FM, Norie\u2019s Sunday night show \u201cAnything Goes-Caribbean Edition\u201d, a vigorous blend of soca, reggaeton, roots reggae and dancehall, accented with a distinctive Brooklyn flavor, consistently tops the ratings for the 8-10 PM time slot according to Arbitron statistics.\n\nRespectfully referred to as Da Reggae Don, DJ Norie was born to Panamanian parents in Brooklyn, which is often referred to a Jamaica\u2019s 15th parish, due to its concentration of immigrants from reggae\u2019s birthplace. Raised in Brooklyn\u2019s East Flatbush area, Norie became familiar with the music of Shabba Ranks, Super Cat and Ninja Man (dancehall reggae superstars of the late 1980s and early \u201890s) by listening to coveted sound clash cassettes that furthered the popularity of the latest reggae hits and the renown of the era\u2019s premier Jamaican sound systems. \u201cListening to the cassettes of Stone Love, Kilimanjaro and other sounds I thought, I want to be a part of that,\u201d Norie recalled.\n\nBarely into his teens, Norie began working with a neighborhood sound doing odd jobs such as carrying speakers and other equipment to their various gigs around Brooklyn. He paid close attention to the deejays (or selectors in Jamaican parlance) observing their proficiency in choosing just the right tunes to elicit roaring responses from the crowd and keep them on the dance floor. When the selectors needed to take a break, Norie got the chance to display his burgeoning skills on the wheels of steel; however, these early career-training sessions took place unbeknownst to Norie\u2019s mother. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will get in trouble for saying this now but my mom used to work nights so I used to sneak out to play at these basement parties, and basically that is how I learned to select,\u201d Norie laughingly discloses. \u201cIt was kind of hard in the beginning; they used to line up four or five records, tell me what to play and when I played them, people used to go crazy. So it used to seem like, yeah, I can do this, even though I was scared as s*#t. But I did it anyway and it was a good experience.\u201d\n\n\n\nNorie\u2019s fears subsided with repeated stints at the turntables and eventually he was recruited by Spectrum Disco, working with selectors Redds and Super C; as Spectrum\u2019s popularity spread throughout Brooklyn and the greater New York area during the 1990s, so too did Norie\u2019s renown as an intimidating selector. In the late 1990s Super Claude, the founder of Afrique Sound Station, one of the most venerated sound systems in the New York area, recruited Norie to join the set. Alongside Afrique\u2019s remarkable team of selectors, which included Jagga B, Crazy Richie and Super Twitch, Norie\u2019s talents were taken to a wider audience that spanned many states and several countries. \u201cSometimes you have to make a move, enhance yourself and go for you, and Afrique is where my name really started from, its what took me to the level of traveling with the music,\u201d Norie reflects. \u201cI will never forget Spectrum Disco because that is where I came from but Afrique has been in the business for more than 20 years, they set the trend for \u2018nuff sounds and it is a blessing to have been a part of it.\u201d\n\nNorie has also played on numerous Brooklyn based pirate and Internet stations that exclusively play reggae and Caribbean music (he even started one of his own, My Radio 94.3 FM), a phenomenon indicative of the vast potential for Caribbean music in the New York area. But Norie\u2019s expertise in selecting dancehall also resonated with a mainstream listenership, as he found out when he joined up with (hip hop) DJ Self as one of six deejays comprising a collective called Da Union, which enabled him to take dancehall into several (Manhattan) clubs where it had previously been excluded. This led to a few guest appearances on Power 105.1 FM, and eventually his Sunday night show on the station, which has contributed to his enviable status as America\u2019s most influential radio personality for dancehall reggae. As such, Norie is usually the first to transform a core dancehall anthem into an international hit, which he recently did with Stephen and Damian Marley\u2019s single \u201cJah Army\u201d, featuring Buju Banton.\n\nNorie is also the personal deejay for Beenie Man, with whom he travels whenever the artist has a show outside of Jamaica and he has also toured with Elephant Man, Bounty Killer, Mavado and Serani. On March 30, 2011 at New York City\u2019s BB King\u2019s nightclub, Norie made history selecting the rhythms for seven time Grammy winner Stephen Marley\u2019s first performance done solely to backing tracks (that is, without his band\u2019s accompaniment); Marley headlined Norie\u2019s two year anniversary party for his Power 105 show, which was also the one year anniversary celebration for his immensely popular monthly live concert series, \u201cAnything Goes\u201d. \u201cStephen was a little hesitant at first, because he never performed to tracks before, but he did it and he was happy about it, so it is a great experience to have under my belt,\u201d Norie shares.\n\nNorie has recently partnered on several projects with Queens New York based VP Records, the largest independent reggae label in the world. He selects the music at each of VP\u2019s album release parties and the label\u2019s artists are regularly showcased at his \u201cAnything Goes\u201d series. For VP Records\u2019 \u201cReggae Gold 2011\u201d, a collection of the year\u2019s biggest reggae hits, Da Reggae Don provided a vibrant, 35-minute bonus mix CD, rife with artists\u2019 shout-outs to Norie (including 2011 Celebrity Apprentice winner/country superstar John Rich) and customized renditions of popular songs. Additionally, Norie has just started recording artists on his own dancehall rhythms and he plans to release those tracks as part of his own compilation series sometime in the near future.\n\nEach of Norie\u2019s endeavors is in pursuit of his ultimate goal: expanding the overall popularity of Caribbean music, especially dancehall reggae, the music that inspired his career path almost 20 years ago. \u201cMy radio show has served a lot of purposes; not only did it allow my fans to get to know me but it allowed me to give back to this music game,\u201d Norie explains. \u201cBut I would like to get further in radio, be more than just a deejay because then I can help reggae by impressing upon program directors that New York\u2019s Caribbean population is really an untapped market that no one is paying attention to so why not go out and support it? We don\u2019t have to follow the same trends that everyone has been doing for years and years, we can do things differently, add on and make it much stronger.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "115 President St, New Jersey, NJ 07055", "Artist": "Grupo Alfa 7", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-74.122971, 40.873141], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Fiesta Night Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "115 President St, New Jersey, NJ 07055", "Artist": "Mar Azul", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-74.122971, 40.873141], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Fiesta Night Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "115 President St, New Jersey, NJ 07055", "Artist": "Grupo Alfa 7", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-74.122971, 40.873141], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Fiesta Night Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "244 E 79th St, New York, NY 10075", "Artist": "Tom Wardle", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8995256.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.955678, 40.773428], "Date": "Sun Feb 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-16", "Genre": "Genres: Summer Pop", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Sojourn", "moreBioInfo": "English singer/songwriter giving it a go in the US.

Just as comfortable on stage as he is behind the turntables, Cipha has carved out a distinct voice in music and comedy over the past 15 years.\n\nCipha got his first break interning for Wildman Steve and DJ Riz of the Flip Squad. His tireless work ethic and perceptive DJ skills earned him opening slots at legendary NYC nightspots like the Tunnel and the Palladium. Soon after that, Cipha found himself spinning for Lil Kim, Mos Def and Jay-Z on national tours, and rocking private parties & album release galas for superstars like P. Diddy, Eminem and Mariah Carey. Most importantly, Cipha learned how to break new records, helping turn once-unknowns like Sean Paul, 50 Cent, Pitbull, Rick Ross, Rihanna into superstars, and maintain a healthy sense of humor on the mic.\n\nCipha\u2019s ear for talent and club-honed musical instincts also made him a natural A&R executive, a position he has held with labels ranging from Rawkus and Tommy Boy to the Neptunes\u2019 Star Trak imprint with Pharrell Williams, and Roc-A-Fella with Jay-Z. In 2003, he took an even bigger leap into the music industry and began hosting \u201cSucker Free\u201d and \u201cTRL\u201d on MTV. He has also set a goal to take over the Improv comedy world. After being a student at the UCB theatre for over two years, Cipha now has a weekly sold out \u201cTake It Personal: Hip Hop Improv Show, where a different Hip Hop celebrity tells a true life story and Cipha & his team of improvisers perform a complete live comedy show based on those stories.

Labels like Schematic in Miami, Interdimensional Transmissions from Detroit & Viewlexx out of The Hague set the foundation for Daze. Daniel Gomez adopted his Daze moniker early on at his mother\u2019s suggestion. Practicing on a set-up she bought him, Daze was spinning at weddings by age 14, funneling his earnings into vinyl to play raves on the side. That eventually led to producing his first tracks in 2004 on a cracked version of Fruity Loops and later that year, he jumpstarted a electro / techno white label called Omniamm. Daze\u2019s risk-taking & punk approach is at the core of everything he does and it\u2019s a big part of the ethos of his current label, Omnidisc. \"We're not searching for chart topping hits. We\u2019re more interested in curating a catalog of music you\u2019ll remember when you walk out the door. We seek out tracks that are as raw as possible & welcome imperfections. We love the charm of an unpolished record\u201d, says Daze. It\u2019s also this freeform & experimental approach together with an element of surprise that sets him apart from the pack as both a DJ & Producer. As a DJ, he prefers to express his versatility across long sets. He is known to cut & weave from Electro to Techno into Italo Disco, into a record by Yazoo deliberately intended to provoke a reaction. \u201cI once played a Paula Abdul record at Berghain\u2026 basically, it\u2019s like it or leave it,\u201d says Daze. As a producer, his output ranges from releases on Kompakt\u2019s Speicher series, to remixes on Phantasy, Comeme, Monkeytown & more\u2026 but he also reaches far beyond techno & has created original runway soundtracks for award winning American streetwear designer John Elliott & the Australian brand Song for the Mute. \"I\u2019m obsessed with the detailed manipulation of audio. It\u2019s at the core of how I make music & I constantly feel the need to involve myself with projects that challenge & allow me to think out of the box... whether it\u2019s creating a single recognizable noise for the new MacBook, or an advert for a fashion campaign blending original music with sound design,\u201d says Daze. Danny Daze\u2019s radical approach to preserving music\u2019s integrity while breaking its boundaries may seem volatile, but it\u2019s not random. \u201cI\u2019ve always gone against the grain & it\u2019s important for everything I do to feel authentic.

I\u2019m pretty proud of how it turned out.

Loved, hated, ridiculed, admired, Falling In Reverse frontman Ronnie Radke is the rare rock n\u2019 roll provocateur whose unpolished unpredictability and reckless honesty make him equal parts hero and villain, depending on whom you ask. Radke puts it all on the line, take it or leave it, each and every time Falling In Reverse does anything.\n\nJust Like You finds Falling In Reverse\u2019s leader with no shortage of material to sing, scream and howl about. In the roughly two years since Fashionably Late, Radke lost a close family member (faced head-on with the tear-jerking album closing ballad 'Brother'), watched old friends succumb to old vices (look no further than the first track 'Chemical Prisoner'), and struggled with his lifelong search for meaning ('God, If You Are Above\u2026' is as real as it gets, kids) and search for personal redemption.\n\nJust as Pinocchio became a real boy, Falling In Reverse is a real band. Emerging guitar hero Jacky Vincent throws down a vicious, Joe Satriani-inspired shred all over their songs; rhythm guitarist Derek Jones injects the band with the strength of crunch that only comes from touring as a metalcore vet. Jovial everyman drummer Ryan Seaman, whose resume reads like an Epitaph catalog, lays back in the cut like the guys in classic hard rock bands of the \u201870s yet pulls off double bass and crazy fills with equal skill.\n\n'God, If You Are Above' rocketed to #1 on the iTunes Rock chart within hours of its release and with good reason. It\u2019s got an energized, emotive drive reminiscent of 'Situations' (the best known song from Radke\u2019s tenure in Escape The Fate which has been viewed 50 million times on YouTube) but updated with the experience, charisma and perspective of the singer\u2019s more well rounded modern persona; the song is naturally topped off by a reliably scorching Jacky Vincent solo. The playful innuendo is still there, in party songs like 'Sexy Drug' and the album\u2019s title track, 'Just Like You,' with it\u2019s over-the-top, hilariously brave refrain: \u201cI am aware that I am an asshole!\u201d\n\nFalling In Reverse\u2019s debut album The Drug In Me Is You was a vivid, self-deprecating, raw document of frontman Radke\u2019s turbocharged life till that point, delivered with a clever wordplay acting as harbinger for the mixtape rhymes that were to come. Now, the appropriately titled Just Like You draws together all of the first two albums strengths.\n\nIn 2014, only Mot\u00f6rhead legend Lemmy edged out Radke on Kerrang!\u2019s list of the 50 Greatest Living Rockstars in the World, a lineup that included the likes of Slash, Steven Tyler and Ozzy Osbourne. Ronnie Radke is the world\u2019s Greatest Living Rockstar, aside from freakin\u2019 Lemmy, according to the UK\u2019s biggest rock mag.\n\nRadke\u2019s aesthetic is so coveted he spends significant \u201cfree time\u201d overseeing clothing design and fulfillment for HOOD$ UP, the Falling In Reverse frontman\u2019s apparel endeavor. Self-empowerment, secret societies and a bizarre amalgamation of esotericism and West Coast gangsterism collide in HOOD$ UP, that transcends \u201cbrand\u201d as much as the guys in Falling In Reverse have managed to agitate and captivate more than a \u201cband.\u201d\n\nAs unscrupulous imitators play catch-up with the look, sound and feel of Falling In Reverse, the band soldiers on, blazing new pathways and bridging the gap between brutal metal and pop rock.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": " 707 8th ave, W 45th St,, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Jeremiah Lloyd Harmon", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9416239.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988703, 40.759044], "Date": "Mon Feb 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-17", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Songwriter, Folk Jazz, Baroque Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Secret Room NYC", "moreBioInfo": "Jeremiah Lloyd Harmon, born in Alexandria, LA., is a singer-songwriter based in Baltimore, Maryland.

It\u2019s an album that will undoubtedly solidify his standing as one of the most compelling and vital Americana artists around.\n\nOn Lucky Enough, Foehl touches on a range of Americana styles, all with emotionally charged lyrics and can\u2019t-get-out-of-your-head choruses, from somber folk elegies (\u201cStealing Starlight\u201d and \u201cAmerican Miles\u201d) and gospel-tinged tunes (\u201cCarousel Horses\u201d) to barroom country singalongs (\u201cLong Time to Make Old Friends\u201d) and jaunty calypso-flavored, country-infused pop (\u201cWish I Knew\u201d). These are deeply personal songs for Foehl, and while they were written during some dark days, there\u2019s a sense of optimism and gratitude, an overriding feeling that the hope outshines the heartbreak. In 2017 Foehl was making a big move, heading to Nashville to continue his craft as an artist and a songwriter. That made sense after co-writing the leadoff song (\u201cFly\u201d) with up-and-coming country singer/songwriter Brent Cobb on Lee Ann Womack\u2019s 2014 GRAMMY-nominated album, The Way I\u2019m Livin\u2019.\n\nOn the way, he got a call from his mother, Linda. She had lymphoma, and she needed him. He didn\u2019t hesitate, ditching his fully loaded car in Nashville and flying straight home to Massachusetts. In that year and a half taking care of his mom, he wrote most of the songs you will hear on Lucky Enough.", "otherInfo": "#Rockwood15Years"}, {"Address": "10 Kings Road, Madison, NJ 07940", "Artist": "Country", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7104142.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.4306, 40.76501], "Date": "Mon Feb 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-17", "Genre": "Genres: Country", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Madison Community Arts Center", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "30 Lincoln Center Plaza, New York, NY 10023", "Artist": "Iestyn Davies - Countertenor", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8588961.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.981696, 40.771089], "Date": "Mon Feb 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-17", "Genre": "Genres: Classical Music", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Metropolitan Opera House", "moreBioInfo": "\"Iestyn Davies has one of the most glorious countertenor voices in the world today\" Michael Church, The Independent", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "165 W 26th St, New York, NY 10001", "Artist": "The Gershwin Brothers", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8270254.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.993657, 40.745856], "Date": "Mon Feb 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-17", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Sid Gold's Request Room", "moreBioInfo": "Dave Foster (Bubble) and Lane Steinberg (The Wind) have dedicated themselves to sharing the music of Sol and Al Gershwin with the world.

Grandfathers made quarters appear out of thin air. Men in black suits with white gloves cut people in half and pulled furry animals out of tall hats. Somewhere along the line, though, we grew up. We stuffed that love for magic into a plastic TMNT lunchbox and tucked it away to make way for life in the \u201creal world.\u201d\n\nNot Denny Corby.\n\nDenny fell in love with magic as a young kid growing up in Scranton, PA. His parents did everything they could to stir up his enthusiasm. They enrolled Denny in every magic class he could find and encouraged him to perform for friends and family as often as possible. The kid had a clear knack for entertainment.\n\nDenny\u2019s family owned the only paper company in Scranton. Naturally, that made The Office a TV staple in the Corby house. If you met him, you\u2019d swear he was a cross between Michael Scott and Jim Halpert (with a little bit of Andy Bernard thrown in).\n\nAt the age of 16, Denny went to work for his parents. Between the paper business and a cleaning company his family owned, Denny had a hand in literally everything. From stripping floors and waxing bathrooms to loading trucks and making sales calls, Denny worked his tail off in the \"real world.\u201d Still, he couldn\u2019t leave magic behind. While working for his parents, he continued to perform on nights and weekends.\n\nDenny began his college career at Marywood University in Scranton and finished it in 2004 at Bay State College in Boston. After school, he went back to work for his parents. He loved being a part of what his family had built but the tension between his day job and his passion for magic started to overwhelm him. Finally, Denny\u2019s family encouraged him to step out and take a risk in doing what he truly loved.\n\nFour years later, Denny is a wildly successful magician, entertainer and keynote speaker. He performs regularly for a slew of corporate clients including Comcast, Tyson Foods, Berkshire Hathaway, and BMW. His shows range from intimate office gatherings of 20 to crowds of 2500 and everything in between.\n\nThrough appearances on America\u2019s Got Talent and major cable networks like Fox and NBC, Denny has graced television screens across the country. He\u2019s also put out an instructional DVD, Magic Tricks Now, showing people how to use some of his favorite tricks to impress their friends, family, coworkers, and even strangers.\n\nWherever you meet him, Denny is guaranteed to make your day. He's a warm-hearted goofball who lives to make people laugh and see them smile. You'll never find him any happier than when he\u2019s cracking jokes and having fun with friends, family, and even complete strangers.\n\nAt the end of each show, somebody always asks whether magic is real. Denny\u2019s answer is simple. For whatever bit of time he has, a magician gets to pull a crowd of people out of their crazy lives and fill them with a sense of joy and wonder. Instead of worrying about their jobs or their finances, each audience member is right there in their seat loving every minute of the show.\n\nThat\u2019s where the real magic lies.\n\nWhen Denny\u2019s not busy making full-sized automobiles appear out of thin air (yes, he actually did that), you\u2019ll catch him making bowling pins disappear down at the local Strike & Spare. Sometimes, though, he just wants to pick up his sticks and make a little noise drumming to his favorite songs from Korn and Avenged Sevenfold... or any modern top 40 hit, really. If he\u2019s feeling a bit more mellow, you might find him holed up with a coloring book and a box of fresh crayons.\n\nWherever you find him, Denny will probably drop what he\u2019s doing and make you smile.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "235 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Broadway Sings", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9619272.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.987088, 40.759536], "Date": "Mon Feb 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-17", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Sony Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1272 Broadway,, Brooklyn, NY 11221", "Artist": "Frog", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9714925.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.924884, 40.690956], "Date": "Mon Feb 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-17", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "the broadway", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Broadway Presents: Frog / Nick Cage / Bad Kiss / Free $$$"}, {"Address": "116 E 16th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Krystyna Hutchinson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7678900.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988348, 40.735421], "Date": "Mon Feb 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-17", "Genre": "Genres: Stand-up Comedy", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand", "moreBioInfo": "Krystyna is a stand-up comedian, writer and actress living in New York City.

Produced by Grammy\u00ae winner Scott Billington, Porcupine Meat features all-new compositions that range from the down-and-dirty funk of I Don t Want Nobody Hanging Around and the playful double entendre of Catfish Stew, to the deep blues of Got Me Accused and the slippery R&B of the title track (about the charms of an otherwise malicious lover).

A dozen albums into her critically acclaimed career, she may also be the best-kept secret in jazz, a status that\u2019s certain to change as more people are discovering her for themselves.\n\nThe year 2009 was a big one for Alexis: She released her first albums on both Mot\u00e9ma Music and Venus Records\u2026 and went to Basic Training to prepare for her new job as a jazz singer for the US Army.\n\nDuring her seven years in the Army\u2019s Big Band, Cole had the opportunity to grow as a musician and a person, sharing the stage with ensembles as diverse as the New York Philharmonic and Kool and the Gang. Alexis continued recording throughout her tour of duty, releasing a string of well-received albums, including four titles for Venus, two for Motema, and two on Chesky Records. She proved her versatility on everything from jazz standards to Paul Simon\u2019s lesser known compositions, to Disney love songs to a project on which she teamed up with a fellow serviceman 50 years her senior, the legendary guitarist Bucky Pizzarelli.\n\nThough Alexis transformed into an insightful interpreter of jazz during her Army years, understandably, her personal advancements and achievements had to take a back seat to her military responsibilities.\n\nAlexis has blossomed since leaving the service in 2016, trading her uniforms and fatigues for sleek cocktail dresses and chic hats, and focusing fully on her art. The singer\u2019s career has taken on exciting new momentum, with recent accomplishments including gigs at celebrated venues like The Carlyle, Carnegie Hall, Birdland, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and the Blue Note; and performances as a soloist with prominent orchestras such as the Boston Pops and the Detroit Symphony. Alexis also recently contributed a guest turn on pianist Harold Mabern\u2019s star-studded album Afro Blue, alongside the likes of fellow guests Norah Jones, Gregory Porter, and Jane Monheit.\n\nOn the education front, Alexis Cole now heads the vocal program at the renowned conservatory at SUNY Purchase, and is a Jamey Aebersold-sponsored clinician. She\u2019s looking forward to guest lecturing at the acclaimed Prince Claus Conservatoire in the Netherlands this coming academic year.\n\nAlexis Cole\u2019s freshly reclaimed civilian status has opened a new world where her profound experience can meld more completely with her worldview and personal expression.

It started separately, and naturally became one with my voice as a composer and saxophonist.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarcus Strickland\u2019s debut Blue Note/ Revive Records release Nihil Novi (Latin for Nothing New) is about our relationship with time: how many things in the world can seem new, but are actually cyclical occurrences or developments from where the past left us off. From 2 Live Crew to Twerking, and Rodney King to Eric Garner, be careful what you call new. The multi reedist/ beatmaker made this record with a strong and inspiring urgency that is inclusive of, yet not exclusively from his jazz roots.\n\n\n\n\"A musician does not grow from forcing themselves into a vacuum. Genres eventually cross pollinate, making our ability to be in the present more relevant than the original given terms. Creativity does not stay within lanes, it feeds off of its surroundings.\" However, Strickland has a deep rooted respect and admiration for his predecessors, and it shows in his music. \"One great tool that we have to navigate the present is culture. Culture, being the culmination of our triumphs and failures, gives us an advantage when dealing with similar situations, and it reminds us of what is important. So for me Nihil Novi is just a reminder to me of what's mostly important to me, musically and emotionally. I just want it to feel good. When I made the beats that inspired this record I was entrenched in J Dilla, Mad Lib, Slum Village, D'Angelo. I learned from them how to add and subtract layers for an overall affect, how powerful even the most subtle melodic line is when it is absent.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cThe many layers, pre-production, and the need for fresh ears to this music were the reasons why I wanted to work with a producer on this venture.\u201d Says Strickland. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to learn how to produce without working close with producers, so I mustered up the courage to ask one of the most well regarded of my heroines to produce this record, Meshell Ndegeocello.\u201d The genre-less, bass guru, songstress, producer generously accepted and immediately allotted the tracking, mixing and mastering to highly regarded sound wizard, Bob Power.\n\n\n\n\"I could not have planned it any better, the way that things sprouted out when I first started introducing this music to drummer Charles Haynes, who co-produced on most of the tracks. He helped me put together the band, I already knew I wanted to work with him, Jean Baylor, Keyon Harrold (who I already worked with on previous Twi-Life projects) and BIGYUKI. Charles introduced me to Kyle Miles and Mitch Henry and a band was born.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownBeat Critic\u2019s Poll winner Marcus Strickland has steadily proven to be an essential part of the jazz continuum since he stepped on the scene in the early 2000s. He will present his Twi-Life group at The 2013 NYC Winter JazzFest; a highly anticipated annual event which showcases over seventy new and established groups in tandem with the Arts Presenters (APAP) conference. Twi-Life, an electric band with its inception rooted in the soul music Strickland grew up listening to, is a testament to his irrepressible versatility. \u201cIt seems, so far, that every Twi-Life band will be signi\ufb01cantly different than the next because it is my refuge for trying out my wildest ideas,\u201d says Strickland, who is emerging as one of the most multi-faceted and proli\ufb01c writers and performers of his generation.\n\n\n\nHis genre-bending propensity has produced fascinating and unconventional collaborations and this time around is no different; the members of this eclectic ensemble have worked individually with artists like Kanye West, Bilal and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. The group includes the wide-ranging talents of hip-hop lyricist, DJ and Berklee professor, Raydar Ellis; legendary trombonist, Frank Lacy; dexterous keyboardist Yuki Hironao; The Roots\u2019 newest member, bassist Mark Kelley; dynamic drummer Charles Haynes; and special guest, singer-songwriter Jean Baylor, formally of the hit- making 90s R&B duo, Zhan\u00e9.\n\n\n\nStrickland\u2019s development as a producer is the nexus of this project whose music comes mostly from taking his beats and applying acoustic instrumentation and improvisation. \u201cOnce you combine the many textures, layers and number crunching of [drum] programming with human spontaneity, the possibilities are in\ufb01nite and it becomes yet another instrument for human invention.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info

Having made a splash with the soulful R&B-revival sound of their debut album, 2010\u2019s Pickin\u2019 Up The Pieces (released on Dangerbird Records), the band offered up a New Wave-influenced dance-pop sound with its Elektra Records debut, 2013\u2019s Heatseekers No. 1 More Than Just A Dream, which featured the gold-certified and #1 Alternative Radio singles \u201cThe Walker\u201d and \u201cOut of My League.\u201d The album\u2019s success sent Fitz and the Tantrums on a two-year touring odyssey, which enabled the Los Angeles-based sextet \u2014 known for its explosive, no-holds barred live shows \u2014 to cement themselves as one of the country\u2019s hottest live acts.\n\n\u201cWe felt incredibly validated by the reception to More Than Just A Dream,\u201d says the band\u2019s co-vocalist Michael \u201cFitz\u201d Fitzpatrick. \u201cWe knew we could pull from many different styles and create a truly hybrid form of music, and do it in a way that felt authentic. At that point, we felt even more empowered to do whatever we wanted creatively.\u201d But when it came time to write the songs for Fitz and the Tantrums\u2019 third album, it became clear to Fitz and his co-vocalist Noelle Scaggs that they were suffering from a classic case of writer\u2019s block.\n\nIt was January 2015 and the band, which also includes James King (saxophone, flute), Jeremy Ruzumna (keyboards), Joseph Karnes (bass), and John Wicks (drums, percussion), had barely been home since the release of More Than Just A Dream two years prior. Cooped up with each other in an insular environment on tour had taken its toll. \u201cThe last album was made super fast and in something of a bubble,\u201d Fitz says. \u201cThis time there was a lot of massive change happening for all of us personally, so once we put our roots back in the ground at home, I needed someone to hold up a mirror and say, \u2018Where are you right now, as a human being? What do you care about? What do you want to say to the world?\u2019\u201d\n\nTo hold up that mirror, the band turned to outside collaborators for the first time \u2014 the songwriters and producers Sam Hollander (Panic! At The Disco), Wallpaper\u2019s Ricky Reed (Twenty-One Pilots), Jesse Shatkin (Sia, Matt & Kim), and Joel Little (Lorde), which gave the band an opportunity to answer some tough questions. \u201cWe relinquished control of ourselves,\u201d Scaggs says, \u201cand that enabled us to tell our story in a completely truthful manner.\u201d\n\nThe result is Fitz and the Tantrums\u2019 most emotionally connected record yet and one that centers on the theme of desire. \u201cI wanted to explore this idea of desire in all of its forms,\u201d Fitz says, \u201cfrom primal, sexual desire on a song like \u2018HandClap\u2019 to the desire or need to belong on a song like \u2018A Place for Us.\u2019 Desire is one of those emotions that really forces you to turn your brain off and just feel. That's just the nature of it. And that lends itself really well to us making a record that provides a soundtrack for people to access that emotion no matter where they are. If you\u2019re getting ready for work in the morning and you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Ugh, I hate my boss,\u2019 you have access to this music anytime that just changes the molecular structure in the room. It changes the energy.\u201d\n\nThat transformative experience \u2014 further bolstered by the album\u2019s diverse palette of musical influences including hip-hop, trap music, reggae, and world music rhythms played on 808s \u2014 is something Fitz and the Tantrums have always strived to deliver. \u201cTo me, the songs on this album offer a release from whatever is going on,\u201d Scaggs says. \u201cThey help the listener shift their mood in that moment. Our goal was to make a record that makes anyone listening feel something from the heart and feel like they are a part of this community we\u2019ve created.\u201d\n\nOne of the first songs written was the first single \u201cHandClap,\u201d which garnered over a million streams on Spotify its first week out. A tale of lust and animal desire, contrasted with the desire to not be alone, \u201cHandClap\u201d set the tone of the album right away: \u201cI was searching for something that felt visceral and edgy,\u201d Fitz says. \u201cAs soon as that moment happened, I was relieved. It felt like the compass \u2014 that theme of letting go and losing control \u2014 had been set. And it found its way into the rest of the album.\u201d \u201cComplicated\u201d is a story about the most basic form of desire: \u201cIt\u2019s when you have no willpower against the pure sexual chemistry you have with someone you know is going to hurt you,\u201d Fitz says. \u201cBurn It Down\u201d is about the desire to break down the protective mechanisms that one has in place but that are keeping you from being present in a relationship. \u201cThat comes from a very personal place for me,\u201d Fitz says. \u201cI carried the twisted family dynamics I saw as a kid into my adult relationships and found them to be a massive hindrance. So the question became, \u2018Am I going to burn down this relationship with this baggage I\u2019ve carried my entire life?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd finally, \u201cA Place For Us\u201d is about the desire to belong. \u201cWhether you're the jock in school, or you're the Freaks & Geeks guy in the corner, I think everybody has, to some degree, this sense of not being accepted,\u201d Fitz says. \u201cAnd that is a super powerful message.\u201d Adds Scaggs: \u201cTo me, the song is about building community. We\u2019re all connected and once people realize that, it\u2019s going to change the way the world works.\u201d\n\nIn this way, \u201cA Place For Us\u201d continues to uphold Fitz and the Tantrums\u2019 long-held worldview. With their lively sonic mix of '80s New Wave, blue-eyed soul, disco, and dance-pop, the band has always used celebratory music as a way to break down social barriers and bring people together. Fitz, a longtime studio engineer and aspiring musician, formed the group in 2008, driven simply by \u201ca need to be creative and not lose my mind over a breakup.\u201d He found worthy musical partners in his bandmates, with King, Ruzumna, Karnes, and Wicks all being top-notch players, and the fierce, elegant Scaggs supplying the feminine emotional counterpoint to Fitz\u2019s physical, masculine id.\n\n\u201cFrom the first second, we just connected,\u201d Fitz says of Scaggs. \u201cOur voices naturally blended together. And then, because so much of what we write about is the dynamic between a man and a woman, we started to sing toward each other onstage. And that energy just grew. Then we\u2019d sing out to the audience and encourage them to not just be passive listeners, but to be participants, an actual rhythmical part of the music. And that became a huge part of our identity. Our live show became our calling card everywhere we went.\u201d And with their third full-length release, Fitz and the Tantrums have made an album that captures that jubilant, enraptured spirit. \u201cWe wanted to give people permission to lose control,\u201d Fitz says. \u201cWe want the album to be a call to arms and for people to come to the church of the song.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "154 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "John Eliot Gardiner", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9161473.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.979544, 40.765139], "Date": "Tue Feb 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-18", "Genre": "Genres: Classic", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Sir John Eliot Gardiner\u2019s groundbreaking interpretations of Beethoven\u2019s music have cast this magnificent body of work in a new light.

Organized by post-bop pianist Marc Cary, The Harlem Sessions (originating at Gin Fizz and now based at Smoke Jazz Club) invites musicians, poets, artists, philosophers and dancers to build and explore a new common repertoire with original ensemble arrangements. A key player in galvanizing this fresh and dynamic sense of cultural awareness, drummer/composer Curtis Nowosad was on hand anchoring the groove every week during the gathering\u2019s first years \u2013 and he\u2019s still part of the action today.\n\nHaving made his home in Harlem since 2013 when he was working on his masters at the Manhattan School of Music, the 31-year-old Canadian native emerges as a powerful musical force for social justice on a groundbreaking self-titled jazz and blues-driven collection that illuminates past and present American history while creating some profound history of its own.\n\nWhile it may seem curious to some that Curtis would self-title his third overall album, it\u2019s reflective of a desire to share his deeper core identity. He imparts his truth and the issues that have long mattered to him via five impactful originals and edgy, intensely rendered versions of three thematically related pieces: Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s \u201cHome is Where the Hatred Is,\u201d Skip James\u2019 \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Co-produced with Cary, it\u2019s also the drummer\u2019s first collection to feature the explosive and intuitive chemistry of his NY-based ensemble that has held court in NYC everywhere from Smalls, Fat Cat and Rockwood Music Hall to The Jazz Standard and full week residencies at Dizzy\u2019s Club at Jazz at Lincoln Center.\n\nThe group includes Duane Eubanks (trumpet), Braxton Cook (alto sax), Andrew Renfroe (guitar), Jonathan Thomas (piano, Fender Rhodes, organ) and Luke Sellick (bass). Guests include Corey Wallace (trombone), Matthew Whitaker (organ) and vocalists Michael Mayo (whose beautiful wordless vocal brings a rich humanity to \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d and \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d) and Brianna Thomas, who brings the burning soul-blues angles and edges to \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Cary himself guests on Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer and synth.\n\nCurtis laid the foundation for this current release with two previous critically acclaimed collections, his debut The Skeptic & the Cynic (which spent two weeks at #1 on the Canadian Jazz charts and featured Grammy-nominated pianist Taylor Eigsti) and the WCMA-winning and JUNO-nominated Dialectics (Cellar Live), which made DownBeat Magazine\u2019s \u201cBest of 2015\u201d list, reached #3 on the CMJ jazz charts and spent ten weeks on the JazzWeek charts. The Skeptic & the Cynic was comprised mostly of cover songs by Michael Jackson, Bob Marley, Joni Mitchell, Pink Floyd, Black Star and 2Pac, along with two originals. Recorded in Winnipeg in 2014 after Curtis\u2019 first year at Manhattan School of Music, Dialectics featured mostly original music along with arrangements of compositions by Thelonious Monk, Wayne Shorter and the jazz standard \u201cI Remember You.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recorded my first two albums in my hometown of Winnipeg,\u201d Curtis says, \u201cwith a band made up of my former teachers from the University of Manitoba. Those works were geared towards my growth as a musician and gaining a deeper knowledge of jazz. Stylistically, the new one is definitely a departure from those, yet is a much better reflection of who I am and the themes and issues that matter to me. It\u2019s more important to me than just, \u2018here are some new songs.\u2019 These social issues were always simmering in my mind, and I was very vocal about them among the people I know and love, but it took a while before I was able to convey my feelings musically.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ve lived a lot of life between the release of Dialectics and now,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019ve gained a great deal of life and musical experience and been through a lot, so it felt appropriate to self-title the album. The music is very personal to me. I have gained a lot of insight living in Harlem for the past 5 1/2 years, and as a European-descended practitioner of Black American Music, I feel it is my duty to approach this music and these themes in a respectful, earnest and serious manner. I also feel that as I have made the transition from being an \u2018outsider looking in\u2019 (being from Canada) to an \u2018insider looking out,\u2019 so to speak, I have a unique perspective that I have chosen to express with this album.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding the world from Curtis\u2019 perspective will no doubt prompt listeners not only to enjoy some of the most inventive, hard-hitting jazz they\u2019ve heard in a long time, but also to start Googling and brushing up on their social history. Four of his five originals are devoted to activists who gave their lives or livelihoods to the struggle for a better planet.\n\nThe dreamy and mystical, then percussively busier and bustling \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d is dedicated to the Standing Rock Sioux and all other indigenous people in the U.S., Canada and worldwide who are fighting for their rights to exist without encroachment. Ranging from lilting and simmering gospel to fiery bebop to an electric piano, organ and affected saxophone jam, \u201cNever Forget What They Did to Fred Hampton\u201d reflects both the forward thinking, socially conscious vision and the violent chaos that beset the Black Panther movement. Curtis composed the track on the anniversary of the FBI\u2019s assassination of Hampton, one of the movement\u2019s young, charismatic leaders who was head of the Chicago Chapter of the Party when he was gunned down in December 1969, at the age of 21. \u201cHis murder must be remembered and understood as we celebrate his message and vision of a brighter future for African Americans and all people devoted to justice and solidarity,\u201d the drummer says.\n\nThe emotional, deeply soulful ballad \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d is dedicated to Brazilian politician Marielle Franco, who was the leading voice in her country against police brutality and corruption before her assassination in March 2018. \u201cBlues 4 Colin K\u201d is a lively, high energy blues romp with a hypnotic soul transporting melody designed to shed light on former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who like Muhammad Ali fifty years before him, was robbed of his best years of competing for taking a stand (via taking a knee during the national anthem) against injustice and the oppression of Black people. Curtis balances the heavy themes with a personal statement of a different kind, the romantic and whimsical \u201cWaltz 4 Meg,\u201d dedicated to his wife Megan, whom he has known for over half his life.\n\nCurtis, who started playing drums at 12 and picked up piano at 16, grew up in Winnipeg, the son of a piano teacher mother and saxophonist father. While he grew up hearing jazz around the house, Curtis opted instead for bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Yet his mindset shifted quickly from hard rock to jazz when he heard Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers, particularly their 1963 album Caravan. \u201cI liked John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman and started learning with records I checked out of the public library,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was something about Blakey being a thunderous drummer and bandleader that tapped into my spirit and made me realize I wanted to be that kind of musician as well. Why jazz? Its sense of freedom just spoke to me, and I think that\u2019s what attracts a lot of people. There are no limits. I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to interact with a lot of New York musicians when I was in high school and college, and that played a large part as well.\u201d\n\nEstablishing himself on the NY jazz scene, Curtis has played in the bands of Philip Harper, Craig Harris, rising star saxophonist Braxton Cook and renowned pianist Marc Cary (who both make major contributions to the album) while headlining major jazz festivals in Canada and several in the U.S. He has also performed with four NEA Jazz Masters: Candido Camero, Dave Liebman, Jimmy Owens and Kenny Barron. A recipient of several awards and scholarships, in 2014 Nowosad performed at the Bimhuis in Amsterdam as a winner of the Keep an Eye Jazz Award. He was twice selected to participate in Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC and also attended the Banff Jazz Workshop.\n\nCurtis is an alumnus of the University of Manitoba, where he studied with Terreon Gully and Quincy Davis, and holds a master\u2019s degree from Manhattan School of Music, where he was a student of John Riley, and performed with the multi-Grammy nominated MSM Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra, under the direction of Bobby Sanabria. He currently serves on MSM\u2019s Precollege jazz faculty and is an endorser of Canopus Drums.\n\n\u201cFrom a purely musical standpoint, this album was creatively fulfilling because it was the first time that I had handled all of the audio editing myself, which was quite a task because there are so many layers, from horns to vocals to electronic sounds,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cIt was a challenge to figure out how to bring the right people into unique configurations for each song so that we could best bring their artistry to life, and we were still adding guests a week before the recording session. It was going to be a purely instrumental project until Marc and I talked about adding vocals \u2013 which led us to bring the incomparable Michael Mayo and Brianna Thomas on board.\n\n\u201cThematically, my feeling is that if we never deal with history we will never know how to grow and move forward as a society\u201d he adds. \u201cOne of the problems in the U.S, Canada and many other countries is that we don\u2019t do nearly enough to understand that history and take the necessary steps toward dismantling systems of oppression. Jazz has always inherently reflected the times it\u2019s created in, but often when it\u2019s institutionalized in colleges and university programs, we tend to focus on jazz history alone as opposed to the American and world history it emerges from. I hope this project will inspire listeners to read up on the different icons I was inspired to write about, and open their eyes and ears to not only what was going on in previous generations but also today. By better understanding those important connections, we can collectively begin to question all the societal structures around us.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "18 Minetta Ln, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Dan Rather", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-74.001164, 40.730384], "Date": "Tue Feb 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-18", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Minetta Lane Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Emmy & Peabody Award winner and former CBS News anchor Dan Rather brings his unforgettable staged performance, Stories Of A Lifetime, to the Minetta Lane Theatre, where it will be recorded live for Audible Theater.

Her work is at once deeply personal and socially conscious, seriously funny and derisively tragic. Over five albums and a decade of recording, the Denver-born songwriter/guitarist/singer has tackled such topics as the death penalty, anorexia, shoplifting, reproduction, the French resistance movement, adolescence, and the Christian right. Did we mention love? Love found, love lost, love wished for and love taken away.\n\nWhile her songs cover a huge amount of ground, they all have benefit greatly from Jill's subtle intelligence and skillful light-handedness. No sloganeering flag-and-fist waving here, but rather story songs about human beings, real and imagined, which allow us to step back from the issue, be it personal or social, and relate to it as we would a close friend.\n\nTo see Jill live and in concert is a rare treat. It is on stage that she is most comfortable, most powerful, and where the delicacy and range of her work can be best appreciated. She entertains, amuses, provokes, and more often then not, takes her audiences on an emotional roller coaster, from comedy to pathos in a few bars of music.\n\nJill began playing guitar when she joined the Junior High School band. She never learned to read music, though, and faked her way through rehearsals and performances by playing by ear. As she began writing songs, it was very clear to Jill this was becoming more than a teenage hobby. Music was serious stuff. She played in a variety of funk and rock bands in Colorado, and eventually made her first, Todd Rundgren-produced, album for MCA, Things Here Are Different.\n\nBut success did not knock on her door until three years later, when Atlantic Records released her MTV staple and national top 20 hit, I Kissed A Girl. \"That song was a double-edged sword for me,\" Jill Says. \"It was perceived as a novelty hit, but on the other hand it was the first song with an overtly gay topic to be aired on Top 40 radio. I am quite proud of that.\" The self-titled album also yielded another hit song, Supermodel, included in the Clueless soundtrack.\n\nThe song also jumpstarted her live music career in a big way, and since then she's had the honor to induct Neil Diamond in the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, to share the stage with the likes of Neil Young (at his yearly Bridge School benefit concerts), fellow activists Billy Bragg & Steve Earle, and Waren Zevon. Quite the serious guitar player, she even toured the world as lead guitarist in Lloyd Cole's band a few years back.\n\nSince then, she has made four more critically acclaimed albums, Happy Town, Pink Pearl, Underdog Victorious, and 2009's California Years, which Jill released on her own record label, Pinko Records, after collecting over $85,000 from fans who funded the project.\n\nA veritable gypsy, Jill divides her time between a busy touring schedule and a variety of other projects. She has played the role of political troubadour for NPR stations across the country and for Air America Radio. She also served as songwriter/composer for the hit Nickelodeon network show Unfabulous during that show's three-season run. She composed the music for the off-Broadway show Prozak and the Platypus and co-starred in the Eric Schaeffer film Mind the Gap.\n\nIn the words of New York Times pop music critic Jon Pareles, \"Jill Sobule can claim her place among the stellar New York singer-songwriters of the last decade. Topical, funny and more than a little poignant ... grown-up music for an adolescent age.\"", "otherInfo": "The evening will begin unaccompanied, with Tony Trischka alternating fearlessly between five banjos.

Back in 2014, he was invited to perform for a podcast at the Dickinson home in Amherst, MA. On the drive up, attracted by the title of her poem \u201cFrequently the Woods are Pink,\u201d he set her words to music and performed it in her bedroom. (The podcast\u2019s host invited artists to create there, just as Dickinson herself had done.) This setting proved to be the impetus for a unique, creative out-pouring. Over time, five more matings of music to poems followed, resulting in the song cycle you\u2019ll hear tonight interpreted and sung by the exceptionally talented, Jill Sobule, Maeve Gilchrist, Hannah Read, and Tracy Bonham."}, {"Address": "327 Bowery, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Maassai", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8278398.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.991787, 40.725751], "Date": "Tue Feb 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-18", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Bowery Electric", "moreBioInfo": "femcee | activist. brooklyn, NYC. wordplay + vibrational revolution, yo. confrontational. uncomfortable. but Healing. & love full.", "otherInfo": "Chukwu with Maassai, ACIDHEAD, and Keenyn"}, {"Address": "269 Norman Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11222", "Artist": "Fellahin Fall", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9631289.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.94218, 40.727844], "Date": "Tue Feb 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-18", "Genre": "Genres: Industrial Metal, Metal, Gothic Metal", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Kingsland Bar & Grill", "moreBioInfo": "Fellahin Fall is a gothic-industrial metal band born out of the crushing urbana of Brooklyn, New York.\nAtavistic yet post-human, Fellahin Fall tells tales of an atomized man's yearned escape from the Metropolis.", "otherInfo": "The Kingsland Presents:\n\nSeptember Mourning with support from Madame Mayhem, American Grim, Fellahin Fall, & Pellagra\n$12 adv /$15 dos"}, {"Address": "85 West St, New York, NY 10006", "Artist": "Nick Cabrera", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9156247.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.014611, 40.709548], "Date": "Tue Feb 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-18", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, R&B, soul, Rock, Latin", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bill's Bar & Burger", "moreBioInfo": "Hi I'm Nick.

A modern experience of new and old, audiences can expect to hear a thoughtfully curated blend of vaudeville, hot jazz, folk music, cabaret and contemporary jazz flowing seamlessly through the ages.

Taking cues from artists like Counting Crows, Tom Petty, and Jason Isbell, he creates his own brand of Americana rock & roll.\n\nHello, my name is Seth Adam.\n\nIt is unconventional to offer a biography written in the first person. As the clich\u00e9 goes, rules were meant to be broken...\n\nI am a 43 year old singer/songwriter born and raised in Connecticut. I reside in the great city of New Haven. I\u2019ve been playing music, in one form or another, since I was 5 years old. I got my start playing in front of audiences when I was in the elementary school chorus. Rock & roll got a hold of me just before my teen years, and I performed my first \u201crock & roll band\u201d show at one of those old moose/elk/insert-animal-type halls when I was 14. I've been hooked on the rock & roll ever since.\n\nHere's the part where I tell you what I am currently doing with my career.\n\n2016 was a turning point in my career as I wrote and recorded songs out of a hobbled together, home studio space. Playing all of the instruments, engineering, producing, and everything else-ing on my own resulted in an EP called East Rock. The experience inspired me to continue to do much of the same for the foreseeable future, foregoing using the formal recording studios. In January 2018, I released a single (and video) called \u2018Anytown,\u2019 written in response to the events in Charlottesville VA the summer before. Currently, I am writing and recording songs for a full-length album as well as wrapping up an all-acoustic version of my 2007 release, Where You Come From, celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the original.\n\nHere's the part where I give you some history, drop some names, and tell you about some influences.\n\nI describe my music as singer-songwriter/Americana/folk/rock. That\u2019s a lot of sub genres, but probably the best way to characterize it. My earliest influences were Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, and Kenny Rogers. My dad used to play their records for me when I was a kid. Though the teenage years were my hair-metal, progressive-rock, and grunge phases, I find the music I write now to be the most heartfelt. My biggest influence is Counting Crows with Led Zeppelin coming in at a close second place. In recent years I\u2019ve come to nearly deify The Beatles and Son Volt. Ryan Adams, Jason Isbell, and Wilco have also been tremendous influences on my work.\n\nI love making music. It's how I make a living. It takes a lot of work and it pays off. In 2007, my song \u2018Get Out\u2019 was licensed to Volkswagen for their Sights & Sounds campaign. In 2008, then-Fox entertainment columnist in NYC, Roger Friedman, called me \u201cthe hardest-working, best live act in indie rock.\u201d In 2010, I received a nice hometown nod from The New Haven Advocate\u2019s reader\u2019s poll, winning the Best Rock Band category. For my 2013 release, \u201cSteel Tempered Pride,\u201d I had the good fortune of working with David Immergl\u00fcck, guitarist for Counting Crows, James Maddock, and Camper Van Beethoven. In 2016 I was nominated for Male Performer of the Year for The New England Music Awards, and again in 2017 for Songwriter Of The Year. Through the years, I\u2019ve opened for Grammy-winning Steep Canyon Rangers, Grammy-winning Robert Cray, Tonic, Vertical Horizon, The Alternate Routes, Will Hoge, Gary Louris (The Jayhawks), Ken and Drew from Sister Hazel, Kyle Cook (Matchbox Twenty), and Mayer Hawthorne.\n\nI also like dogs. I think they're cool.\n\nSee you soon,\n\n-Seth Adam, January 2019", "otherInfo": "Solo show.\n\nOpening for NYC's own, East River Bandits!\n\nGet more at:\n\nWEBSITE: http://www.sethadam.com\nMAILING LIST/NEWSLETTER: http://www.sethadam.com/#newsletter\nTWITTER: http://www.Twitter.com/sethadam\nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/sethadammusic\nSPOTIFY: https://open.spotify.com/artist/6asuAkp46aswfLcqULqeLv\nPANDORA: http://pdora.co/2tSEsgL\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/sethadammusic\nAPPLE MUSIC: https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/seth-adam/269781802\nBANDCAMP: https://sethadam.bandcamp.com\nSETH ADAM STORE: https://sethadam.bandcamp.com/merch\nCONCERTS: http://www.bandsintown.com/track/Seth Adam\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/sethadammusic\n\nFor more information on 11th St. Bar please visit: https://11thstbar.com"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Nate Smith", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8253098.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Tue Feb 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-18", "Genre": "Genres: R&B, Soul, Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Since moving from Chesapeake, Virginia to New York City in 2001, Nate Smith has helped reinvigorate the international jazz scene with his visceral style of drumming by playing with such esteemed leading lights as bassist Dave Holland, saxophonists Chris Potter and Ravi Coltrane, and singers Patricia Barber, Somi, and Jose\u0301James. The New York Times described Smith as \u201ca firecracker of a drummer.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s rising career reaches a new benchmark with the release of his bandleader debut, KINFOLK: Postcards from Everywhere, on which he fuses his original modern jazz compositions with R&B, pop, and hip-hop. The disc shows Smith leading a scintillating core ensemble, consisting of pianist and keyboardist Kris Bowers, guitarist Jeremy Most, alto and soprano saxophonist Jaleel Shaw, electric bassist Fima Ephron, and singer and lyricist Amma Whatt, and Michael Mayo on backing vocals. The lineup expands on several cuts with the inclusion of Potter and Holland along with other illustrious guests \u2013 guitarists Lionel Loueke and Adam Rogers, and singer Gretchen Parlato.\n\nAs the title KINFOLK suggests, the music bristles with a magnetism that can be only achieved by assembling the right musicians, building upon and blending their individual voices and developing a bracing group rapport. Indeed, Smith refers to the aforementioned musicians as \u201ckindred spirits,\u201d while embracing some philosophies gleaned from his mentor, Holland. \u201cDave once told me, \u2018I really believe that musicians find each other,\u2019\u201d Smith recalls. \u201cHe feels that all the collaborations he\u2019s done and all the sidemen that he\u2019s hired came into his life on purpose, even though he might not have been looking for something specific. He discovers people along the way.\n\n\u201cKINFOLK is about the musical family that I\u2019ve put together,\u201d Smith continues. \u201cAll core members of the band have very unique and specific points of view.\u201d He reinforces the idea of family by composing tunes that touch upon his childhood. Such is the case with the jovial \u201cMorning and Allison,\u201d whose title partly invokes Allison Drive, the street on which Smith grew up. The song stars Ms. Whatt serenading idyllic recollections of a child enjoying a bright, fun-filled Sunday morning.\n\nSmith recorded his parents \u2013 Lettie and Theodore Smith \u2013 talking about their respective parents on the mesmerizing interludes \u201cMom\u201d and \u201cDad.\u201d On the former, Smith\u2019s mother tells how her father migrated from Virginia to Detroit and was drafted into U.S. Army then later returned to Virginia, where he bought the family a house. The latter provides a vehicle for his father to recall how his father tirelessly worked at Navy shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia during the Jim Crow era without getting proper financial compensation or promotion until decades later. \u201cI think of these stories as snapshots that ultimately gave shape to the Black American experience into which I was born, which ultimately informs this music\u201d Smith explains, before stressing the importance of having his parents\u2019 voices on the album.\n\nThe significance of having Smith\u2019s father on the disc was brought home even more after his passing in March 2015. \u201cHe never got a chance to hear the music or the band,\u201d Smith says.\n\nSmith celebrates the legacy of his paternal grandfather on the haunting ballad \u201cHome Free (Peter Joe).\u201d The song begins with a chamber- like string intro then moves into a gorgeous hymnal melody, highlighted by Shaw\u2019s uncoiling of a splendid, blues-soaked lyricism. \u201cOf my four grandparents, Peter Joe was the one I felt the closest to,\u201d Smith says. \u201cHe was a real buddy of mine. He died when I was only nine but I still think about him a lot.\u201d\n\nSmith reemphasizes the theme of nostalgia with \u201cRetold\u201d and \u201cPages.\u201d \u201cRetold\u201d finds Bowers tickling a melancholy yet romantic melodic motif on which guitar and saxophone run parallel lines across. \u201cWhen I started writing this song, it always sounded like someone telling a love story from start to finish,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThe real feature of the song is Kris\u2019 amazing piano solo. He\u2019s so lyrical and rhythmic in the way that he plays.\u201d The dreamy \u201c\u201cPages\u201d becomes a superb showcase for Parlato to sing the song\u2019s theme about turning the pages of a photo album. \u201cI\u2019ve loved Gretchen since the first time I heard her sing,\u201d Smith says. \u201cShe becomes a part of the musical fabric. When she sings, it\u2019s never about the singer being at the front and the band being way in the back. It\u2019s all one sound. She also has really big ears and has amazing ideas about phrasing.\u201d\n\nThe spirit of the Black Lives Matter movement permeates the somber ballad \u201cDisenchantment: The Weight,\u201d another tune that spotlights Whatt\u2019s thoughtful lyrics and delicate singing. Underneath the prowling melody, Smith drums martial rhythms that convey a sense of marching forward. Written in the summer of 2013 soon after the verdict of the Trayvon Martin murder trial, Smith says that the song\u2019s cyclical harmonic pattern represents a longing sigh that many people felt and continue to feel after witnessing such ongoing travesties.\n\nFollowing that aforementioned song is \u201cSpinning Down,\u201d an intricate tune, marked by multiple subdivided rhythms inside of larger rhythmic cycles. Featuring Holland playing acoustic bass alongside Ephron on electric, intertwining saxophone passages from Shaw; incredible solos from Bowers and Loueke, and surprisingly the only drum solo on the disc, the song touches upon the theme of trying to ease a restless mind. \u201cIt works well right after \u2018Disenchantment\u2019 because that song is about everything that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cSpinning Down\u2019 is about the mind trying to work all that wrong out.\u201d\n\nThe other tunes on KINFOLK reflect Smith\u2019s unfettered love for groove and funk. The disc opens with the feisty \u201cSkip Step,\u201d a tricky tune, featuring Holland and Loueke, which Smith explains was influenced by his love for Earth, Wind & Fire; specifically the level of musical sophistication that the group\u2019s founder and leader, Maurice White ceaselessly incorporated in its signature sound. Smith describes the song as a straight-up R&B jam with an extra eighth note at the end \u2013 hence the song\u2019s title. \u201cI wanted the song to be as danceable as possible but with this one little hiccup or skip at the end of the phrase,\u201d Smith says. \u201cI also thought about Lionel, because, like Dave, he can make anything groove. He\u2019s such a relaxed player and his time-feel is so crazy that he can make any song feel good.\u201d\n\n\u201cFeel good\u201d vibes carry over into \u201cBounce (Part I and II),\u201d featuring Potter on tenor saxophone. In fact, the song was first performed during Smith\u2019s tenure as a core member of Potter\u2019s acclaimed Underground ensemble. Smith revised the song to include another section after being influenced by Miles Davis\u2019 seminal 1986 LP, Tutu. \u201cOn Tutu, there\u2019s a little bit of written material and then there\u2019s a little bit of groove section in which people start improvising,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThen they go back to the written material. They cycle that around. That was the idea for \u2018Bounce.\u2019\u201d\n\nJust as the second part of \u201cBounce\u201d offered a canvas for Potter to improvise, the\nquicksilver \u201cFrom Here \u2013 Interlude\u201d does the same for Shaw, whom Smith praises as someone whose improvisations balance the wisdom of an older musician with the fiery enthusiasm of young gun.\n\nAs the title suggests, the fractured, hip-hop leaning \u201cSmall Moves \u2013 Interlude,\u201d is a play on Smith\u2019s manipulation of the song\u2019s chord changes by moving them from minor to major by the addition or subtraction of one note. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s an allegory for life \u2013 you can make one small move or say one small thing out of kindness or cruelty and it\u2019ll change your entire trajectory,\u201d Smith says.\n\n\u201cSpiracles\u201d \u2013 the sole non-original on the disc \u2013 is a Stereolab song from the group\u2019s 1999 disc, Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night. On Smith\u2019s makeover, he decelerates the tempo then buttresses it with a more defining backbeat while retaining the song\u2019s billowing melody. The song includes a tender alto saxophone aside from Shaw, along with a lulling guitar solo from Rogers. \u201cI love the chord changes and the melody of that song. There\u2019s a cycle of discovery every time I go through that song\u2019s form,\u201d Smith enthuses.\n\nBecause Smith didn\u2019t come strictly from the formal matriculation of music studies as so many of his jazz contemporaries did, he lovingly describes his approach to drumming as \u201cunrefined,\u201d which in turns helps him distinguish his voice. He did, however, earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1997 in media arts and design from James Madison University. While he was still in college, the legendary singer Betty Carter recruited him for her world-acclaimed Jazz Ahead program.\n\nSmith says that the visual arts discipline he studied in college definitely seeps into his compositions. \u201cI love great movies and images. I\u2019ve always had a deep interest in composing for film,\u201d Smith says. \u201cFor this project, there is something very cinematic about the way that I conceived this record. That\u2019s why it was so important for me to cast the right characters in terms of musicians. They bring to life the themes of family, nostalgia and identity that define this music.\u201d Ultimately, Smith likens the songs on KINFOLK to film vignettes sequenced together to tell a greater story about the unfolding journey of a working artist. This music represents snapshots from that voyage \u2013 these songs are the postcards from everywhere along the winding road.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "915 Wyckoff Ave, Ridgewood, NY 11385", "Artist": "dreamcrusher", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.906299, 40.696974], "Date": "Tue Feb 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-18", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Trans Pecos", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Dreamcrusher with RIPS, Big Bliss, Lutkie + more TBA"}, {"Address": "315 West 44th St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Percussion", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.989689, 40.759], "Date": "Tue Feb 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-18", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Birdland", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Pianist Omar Sosa and violinist-vocalist Yilian Ca\u00f1izares have come together to create a very beautiful and personal album, AGUAS.

A Renaissance man and self-described purist, Leo is a restless seeker of knowledge with a deep love of all things that come from the Earth. These two passions are the driving forces behind his music.\n\nThe Chordaes' moniker refers to the chordae tendineae of the heart, otherwise known as your \u201cheartstrings.\u201d \u201cOne of the things about this music is that it\u2019s very visceral given the complexity,\u201d says Leo. For me, the key to great music is having the best of both worlds\u2014the complexity versus the raw emotion and the push and pull between the two. I want to tug at people\u2019s heartstrings\u2014and their brains. That\u2019s my goal.\u201d\n\nLeo\u2019s search for authenticity and expertise also inspired a love for cooking at an early age. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved food. I made my first grilled cheese sandwich at 8 years old and I was fascinated by the way food changes as it\u2019s being cooked. As I got older I started noticing patterns in different foods from different cultures and I wanted to learn about how and why those foods were made and the science behind it. My passion for food is similar to music in that way\u2014I\u2019m just very interested in the spread of culture throughout the world.\u201d\n\nThe Chordaes\u2019 latest EP \u201cWhat We Breathe In\u201d delves deeper into Leo\u2019s quest, reflecting on the lives of young people searching for connection and trying to find their way in today\u2019s America. The collection tackles this creeping sense of powerlessness\u2014both in the world and in personal relationships. With major influences that include Brian Wilson, Jimmy Webb, The Beatles, Radiohead, Simon & Garfunkel and Carole King, this is music that wears its heart on its sleeve\u2014an urgent, moving collection that draws from multiple eras of rock, folk, and pop history to emerge as something all its own.\n\nGuided by producer Marc Swersky (Joe Cocker, Roger Daltrey), the new EP\u2019s Wrecking Crew- inspired recording process, with most instruments captured live and with minimal overdubs, has produced a timeless sound. The title track \u201cWhat We Breathe In,\u201d mixed by Kevin Killen (U2, David Bowie), is a true generational anthem, a declaration of our common humanity in a time when our leaders sow fear and division. The radio single, \u201cVenus,\u201d mixed by Mark Needham (The Killers, The Revivalists) is about longing for someone who is out of reach but who holds power over one\u2019s heart. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re locked in place by forces greater than we are,\u201d says Leo. \u201cIt\u2019s about being in limbo with someone, being powerless to move closer to or farther away from them.\u201d\n\nThe Chordaes continue to grow a fan base with regular live performances at NYC spots like Rockwood Music Hall and Mercury Lounge, while praise has rolled in. Deli Magazine says, Leo is \u201ca vocalist who can touch hearts in ways reminiscent of unforgotten NYC hero Jeff Buckley.\u201d Record of the Day calls \u201cVenus\u201d \u201chook-laden, addictive and infused with heartfelt emotion, this is a wonderfully crafted pop song\u2026monstrously infectious.\u201d\n\nAs the single \u201cVenus\u201d embarks on its radio campaign during the summer of 2019, The Chordaes will continue to tour the East Coast, seeking answers to the questions of the thinking mind, while hoping to leave an enduring impression on the heart\u2014or at least to tug a string or two.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "370 New York Ave, Huntington, NY 11743", "Artist": "Fitz", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/2207572.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.425768, 40.869652], "Date": "Tue Feb 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-18", "Genre": "Genres: New Wave Alternative, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Paramount", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "635 Sackett Street, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "John Reynolds", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.983337, 40.678441], "Date": "Tue Feb 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-18", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "littlefield", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "You won't be alone forever.

He has been making records since the mid 90s, when he started in the group Once Blue on EMI Records. It was his first experience writing for another singer, lead vocalist, Rebecca Martin. Combining folk, jazz and pop, the group defined a direction for Harris and was also notable for featuring the guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel. As a solo artist since then Jesse has released 13 albums, including many with his former backing band The Ferdinandos and one all-instrumental recording (Cosmo). His forthcoming album, Music For Chameleons (to be released March, 2017 on Sunnyside Records) finds him again with Will Graefe (guitar) and Jeremy Gustin (drums) of Star Rover, as well as Jesse Carmichael (keys), of Maroon 5, and Jason Lader (bass). Special guests include Petra Haden on backing vocals and Brazilian string arranger Maycon Ananias, who played all the keyboards and arranged the strings on Jesse\u2019s 2012 release, Sub Rosa. In 2003 Jesse received the Grammy Award for Song Of The Year for Norah Jones\u2019 breakout hit \u201cDon\u2019t Know Why,\u201d from her debut album, Come Away With Me, which has sold over 20 million copies worldwide. Four other Harris compositions appear on it, \u201cShoot The Moon,\u201d \u201cOne Flight Down,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve Got To See You Again,\u201d and \u201cThe Long Day Is Over,\u201d and he plays guitar throughout. Since then, Jones and Harris have collaborated many times. She duets with him on \u201cWhat Makes You\u201d from his album The Secret Sun and sings harmonies on several others,Crooked Lines, While The Music Lasts and Watching The Sky. He appears as guitarist on almost all of her albums, contributing songwriting to The Fall, and produced her version of his song \u201cWorld Of Trouble\u201d for the Ethan Hawke film The Hottest State. That soundtrack features not only Harris\u2019 score, but new versions of his songs by Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, Cat Power, Feist, The Black Keys, M. Ward, Brad Mehldau, Bright Eyes (on whose album \u201cI\u2019m Wide Awake It\u2019s Morning\u201d Jesse also appears as guitarist), and others. Recently Harris and Jones appeared together in the Amy Poehler/Paul Rudd comedy They Came Together, performing his song \u201cIt Was The Last Thing On Your Mind,\u201d also produced by Harris. Other artists who have covered his material include Kandace Springs, Smokey Robinson, Sasha Dobson (whose album Modern Romance he co-produced with Richard Julian), George Benson, Pat Metheny, and Solomon Burke, on whose album Like A Fire Harris also plays guitar and sings backing vocals. Songwriting collaborations have included Madeleine Peyroux, Lizz Wright, Melody Gardot, Maria Gadu, and Vinicius Cantuaria. In 2013 Jesse joined John Zorn\u2019s The Song Project, along with Mike Patton and Sofia Rei, writing lyrics for various Zorn compositions and singing them at festivals worldwide with an all-star band that features Marc Ribot on guitar, John Medeski on keyboards, and Zorn conducting. Two albums of the group have been released on. Since then, production credits include albums for Julian Lage, Forro In The Dark, and Petra Haden, who recorded an entire album of Jesse\u2019s songs, entitled \u201cSeemed Like A Good Idea \u2013 Petra Haden Sings Jesse Harris\u201d (Sunnyside Records). Harris and Haden are currently on tour in support of that release. HIs forthcoming release \"Music For Chameleons\" comes out March 10, 2017 on Sunnyside Records. For more info read below. Jesse Harris \u2013 Music for Chameleons Singer/songwriter Jesse Harris has made a career out of crafting stunning songs that are impactful no matter how they are expressed. The most effective vehicle for his compositions has been with his own voice and with the duo, Star Rover. For his new recording, Music for Chameleons, Harris expands the ensemble and creative input to create a collection of songs that are broad in scope and powerful in performance. The New York based Harris is well known for his tremendous songwriting and for his collaborations with other celebrated musicians, including Norah Jones, Petra Haden, Kandace Springs and Melody Gardot. Music for Chameleons (the title taken from a book of Truman Capote short works) is another advance in his collaborative endeavors, allowing the music to blossom with the help of some brilliant musical minds, not only the members of Star Rover, guitarist Will Graefe and drummer Jeremy Gustin, but also keyboard/guitarist Jesse Carmichael (Maroon 5), bassist/producer/engineer Jason Lader (Rick Rubin, Frank Ocean, Maroon 5, Jenny Lewis and Julian Casablancas) and string arranger Maycon Ananias (Maria Gadu). The concept for the recording arose from a recent tour for Harris and Star Rover on the West Coast. While in Los Angeles performing at the Blue Whale, Harris took the band into the studio with his friend and producer Jason Lader playing bass. Lader proposed that they invite Maroon 5 keyboard/guitarist Jess Carmichael to join them. The session went extremely well and produced two tracks, \u201cOn My Way Back\u201d and \u201cYou Don\u2019t Have To Be Alone.\u201d Inspired by the session, Harris knew that he wanted to do more and got the ensemble back into the studio a couple of months later. The record was truly a collaborative effort. Harris wrote new pieces or took recent pieces that he had written, and worked them out with Star Rover in rehearsals and live performance. They then took the material to Los Angeles, where Lader and Carmicheal were able to add to the collective sound and energy. Harris also reached out to his friend Maycon Ananias, a Brazilian composer and arranger, who, with the help of the Opera Orchestra Curytiba String Ensemble, provided some wonderful string parts to a number of the compositions. Petra Haden also appears adding her signature arrangements to two songs. The music on Music for Chameleons is varied and informed by many traditions. The rhythms of the wistfully disjunct \u201cOn My Way Back\u201d are inspired by Brazilian music. The deceptively optimistic tone of \u201cForget It Happened This Way\u201d belies a lyric that depicts a flawed relationship and its pleasantly jarring mix of 3/4 and 4/4 time signatures. \u201cI\u2019m Not On Your Mind\u201d and \u201cYou Can Only Wait So Long\u201d illustrate melancholy with unique moods, a hazy mellowness in the former and a fidgety reluctance in the latter. \u201cAnything Was Possible\u201d was written for and performed by Harris in the Sally Field film Hello, My Name Is Doris, and revisited here as more of a jazz ballad than the folky original.In the middle of the frigid New York winter of 2014, Jesse Harris, enamored with the experimental, mostly-instrumental duo Star Rover (Will Graefe guitar and Jeremy Gustin drums) began to jam with them regularly at their Bushwick loft.

A Renaissance man and self-described purist, Leo is a restless seeker of knowledge with a deep love of all things that come from the Earth. These two passions are the driving forces behind his music.\n\nThe Chordaes' moniker refers to the chordae tendineae of the heart, otherwise known as your \u201cheartstrings.\u201d \u201cOne of the things about this music is that it\u2019s very visceral given the complexity,\u201d says Leo. For me, the key to great music is having the best of both worlds\u2014the complexity versus the raw emotion and the push and pull between the two. I want to tug at people\u2019s heartstrings\u2014and their brains. That\u2019s my goal.\u201d\n\nLeo\u2019s search for authenticity and expertise also inspired a love for cooking at an early age. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved food. I made my first grilled cheese sandwich at 8 years old and I was fascinated by the way food changes as it\u2019s being cooked. As I got older I started noticing patterns in different foods from different cultures and I wanted to learn about how and why those foods were made and the science behind it. My passion for food is similar to music in that way\u2014I\u2019m just very interested in the spread of culture throughout the world.\u201d\n\nThe Chordaes\u2019 latest EP \u201cWhat We Breathe In\u201d delves deeper into Leo\u2019s quest, reflecting on the lives of young people searching for connection and trying to find their way in today\u2019s America. The collection tackles this creeping sense of powerlessness\u2014both in the world and in personal relationships. With major influences that include Brian Wilson, Jimmy Webb, The Beatles, Radiohead, Simon & Garfunkel and Carole King, this is music that wears its heart on its sleeve\u2014an urgent, moving collection that draws from multiple eras of rock, folk, and pop history to emerge as something all its own.\n\nGuided by producer Marc Swersky (Joe Cocker, Roger Daltrey), the new EP\u2019s Wrecking Crew- inspired recording process, with most instruments captured live and with minimal overdubs, has produced a timeless sound. The title track \u201cWhat We Breathe In,\u201d mixed by Kevin Killen (U2, David Bowie), is a true generational anthem, a declaration of our common humanity in a time when our leaders sow fear and division. The radio single, \u201cVenus,\u201d mixed by Mark Needham (The Killers, The Revivalists) is about longing for someone who is out of reach but who holds power over one\u2019s heart. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re locked in place by forces greater than we are,\u201d says Leo. \u201cIt\u2019s about being in limbo with someone, being powerless to move closer to or farther away from them.\u201d\n\nThe Chordaes continue to grow a fan base with regular live performances at NYC spots like Rockwood Music Hall and Mercury Lounge, while praise has rolled in. Deli Magazine says, Leo is \u201ca vocalist who can touch hearts in ways reminiscent of unforgotten NYC hero Jeff Buckley.\u201d Record of the Day calls \u201cVenus\u201d \u201chook-laden, addictive and infused with heartfelt emotion, this is a wonderfully crafted pop song\u2026monstrously infectious.\u201d\n\nAs the single \u201cVenus\u201d embarks on its radio campaign during the summer of 2019, The Chordaes will continue to tour the East Coast, seeking answers to the questions of the thinking mind, while hoping to leave an enduring impression on the heart\u2014or at least to tug a string or two.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "99 Monmouth St, Red Bank, NJ 07701", "Artist": "Simo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8860131.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.070254, 40.348917], "Date": "Tue Feb 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-18", "Genre": "Genres: Jam Bands, Jam Rock, Blues, Blues-Rock, Roots Rock, Psychedelic Rock, Jazz, Funk, Acid Rock, Traditional Blues, Soul, Soul-Blues, R&B, Guitar Virtuoso, Shoegaze", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Count Basie Center for the Arts", "moreBioInfo": "On his new and first solo record, the soon to be released, OFF AT 11, Crows Feet recording artist and Chicago native now Nashvillian, JD SIMO wants you to know that, \u201cA Totem is a spirit being, sacred object or symbol that serves as the center of one\u2019s beliefs.\u201d The gifted artist offers this in a psychedelic, free-flowing, dynamic soundscape that exemplifies just that\u2026 His Totem.\nAcid rock, traditional blues, folk, soul, free form jazz, and the never ceasing desire to improvise pulses from this collection in a mind bending, kaleidoscope of sound, energy and vibe.

They have played Bonarroo, Warren Hayne\u2019s Christmas Jam and Mountain Jam since the formation of the band in 2010.\n\n\u201cThe experience with SIMO set the stage and pushed me forward to record TOTEM\u201d I loved the process, the playing and the struggle to make this record a reality. I hope everyone feels the LOVE.\u201d JD said.\nSIMO debuted at number 4 on the Billboard Blues chart in January 2016.He has been noticed by No Depression, Rolling Stone, Guitar Player, Relix, Guitar World and NPR among others.

After a few years, major orchestras began to request her and, after moving to Lausanne, she collaborated with several ensembles for six years. During this period, the artist created a quartet of musicians from Germany, Venezuela and Switzerland (and later Cuba) and named it \u201cOchumare\u201d. Six months later, in 2008, she won the Montreux Jazz Festival Competition with this group. Since then, her career has crescendoed. In recent years, she has shared a stage with Ibrahim Maalouf, Omar Sosa, Youn Sun Nah, Richard Bona, Chucho Vald\u00e9s, Roberto Fonseca, Dhafer Youssef and El Comit\u00e9.\n\nInvocaci\u00f3n, her second album, topped last year\u2019s Qobuz world music ranking and has been reissued in a deluxe edition.\n\n\u201cAguas\u201d, the album produced in collaboration with Omar Sosa, was released on 5th October 2018. Together with their compatriot Inor Sotolongo on percussion, the duo created an intimate, personal record that reflects the perspectives of two generations of Cuban artists who live a long way from their homeland. The album is a mix of moving songs and energetic ballads, a symbol of the incomparable musical chemistry between the two artists.\nA unique fusion between Afro-Cuban music, classical music and jazz.\n\nThe new album, \u201cErzulie\u201d, named after the Haitian goddess of love and freedom, will be released on 15th November. Recorded in New Orleans, the album features the participation of several guests including Christian Scott (trumpet), Michael League (double bass), Bill Laurance (piano), Bobby Sparks (organ) and Justin Stanton (keyboards).", "otherInfo": "Join us at Birdland for the AGUAS Trio, with Omar Sosa, Yiliam Ca\u00f1izares and Gustavo Ovalles!"}, {"Address": "428 Lafayette St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "U.S. Girls", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8192301.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.992325, 40.729107], "Date": "Tue Feb 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-18", "Genre": "Genres: experimental pop, Pop", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Dance", "moreBioInfo": "U.S. Girls is American-born, Meg Remy\u2019s musical moniker. The Toronto-based multidisciplinary artist's music traces a circuitous evolution. It encompasses unconventional, challenging sound work as prominently as her vocally-driven explorations of American pop mores (often on the same album). Since 2007, Remy has toured several times in Europe, Eastern Canada and the United States. She accompanies her hugely distinctive voice with innovative set-ups, including combinations of reel-to-reel players, tape decks, and samplers, as well as occasionally singing with a full band. Remy has released a clutch of original records on labels as diverse as Siltbreeze, Kraak, FatCat and her own Calico Corp. imprint. While her early Siltbreeze-released works, \u2018Introducing\u2026\u2019 and \u2018Go Grey\u2019, explore the limits of 4-track fidelity, they also bear hallmarks of a budding melodic ear, and vocal cadences clearly born of constant exposure to oldies radio. Given this, it\u2019s little surprise that subsequent U.S. Girls records, \u2018U.S. Girls on Kraak\u2019 and \u2018Gem\u2019 (both co-produced with Remy\u2019s partner, Slim Twig), are works of unabashed pop art. The two albums brought Remy\u2019s voice further into focus, while evincing a playful disregard for genre in splicing together styles as disparate as R n\u2019 B, glam rock, and sound collage. Perhaps what\u2019s most striking about the cumulative power of these records, when taken in combination with her concurrent collage and film work, is Remy\u2019s consistent vision. Her exploration of feminist themes relating to abuse and gender inequality become more clearly defined, even as her sound appears to evolve toward a mainstream, pop idiom. Her narrative use of an \u2018everywoman\u2019 perspective in her lyrics forms something of a feminine counterpoint to Bruce Springsteen\u2019s work. Through this prism, Remy\u2019s project gains resonance as a form of social commentary; music with something truly at stake.

But so is The Family Crest itself.\n\nThe brainchild of McCormick, The Family Crest was started as a recording project in 2009 with co-founder John Seeterlin (bass). \u201cWe were in another band and had become disillusioned about what that band had become about,\u201d explains McCormick. \u201cEveryone wanted to be rock stars at the expense of the music. John and I were actually planning on leaving music at that point because we wanted something that in ten years we could be proud of.\u201d\n\nInstead of leaving music, they set out to reinvent how it could be created, starting The Family Crest. \u201cWe always liked making music with people -- getting a bunch of people together and singing. So we put ads everywhere,\u201d says McCormick. \u201cWe posted on Craigslist and emailed old friends from school.\u201d The outcome was greater than the original duo imagined, with 80 people credited on the first recording the band produced. From that a band emerged, at the urging of the guest musicians, who wanted to hear the songs performed live. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with a lot of conservatory students as well as people who just sing in the shower,\u201d McCormick adds. \u201cIt became a lot about giving these people a chance to express themselves without being locked into a commitment.\u201d\n\nNow a seven-piece core band, boasting over 400 \u201cExtended Family\u201d members, The Family Crest will release Beneath the Brine in February 2014 on Tender Loving Empire. Just with its previous recordings, the San Francisco band set out to capture a plethora of instruments -- including bassoon, vibraphone and French horn -- in unique places, such as living rooms, churches and cafes across the West Coast.\n\nFollowing on the heels of last summer\u2019s The Headwinds EP (which earned fans in WXPN and Paste), Beneath the Brine shows that McCormick\u2019s ambition was well placed. The expansive breadth of arrangements \u2013 from dark, classical romanticism (\u201cBeneath the Brine\u201d) to horn-laden sounds akin to the Roaring 20s (\u201cHowl\u201d) -- are complemented by the incredible range of McCormick\u2019s voice. Beneath the Brine also showcases The Family Crest\u2019s ability to infuse pop into complex arrangements, with songs like \u201cLove Don\u2019t Go\u201d and \u201cThe World.\u201d The album is a sweeping soundscape befitting the oceanic theme of the title and what SPIN notes as \u201cambition wide enough to swallow you whole.\u201d\n\nIt has also proven The Family Crest\u2019s belief that anyone can be musical when given the opportunity. \u201cWe live in a very disconnected age,\u201d notes Laura Bergmann (flute/keys), \u201cso it\u2019s a really special experience to have a recording session in a cafe that\u2019s open to the public and to sing next to people you\u2019ve never met before, doing something together that\u2019s tangible and very meaningful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I listen to the record,\u201d adds McCormick, \u201cit\u2019s like listening to the last two years of my life.

The New York Times described Smith as \u201ca firecracker of a drummer.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s rising career reaches a new benchmark with the release of his bandleader debut, KINFOLK: Postcards from Everywhere, on which he fuses his original modern jazz compositions with R&B, pop, and hip-hop. The disc shows Smith leading a scintillating core ensemble, consisting of pianist and keyboardist Kris Bowers, guitarist Jeremy Most, alto and soprano saxophonist Jaleel Shaw, electric bassist Fima Ephron, and singer and lyricist Amma Whatt, and Michael Mayo on backing vocals. The lineup expands on several cuts with the inclusion of Potter and Holland along with other illustrious guests \u2013 guitarists Lionel Loueke and Adam Rogers, and singer Gretchen Parlato.\n\nAs the title KINFOLK suggests, the music bristles with a magnetism that can be only achieved by assembling the right musicians, building upon and blending their individual voices and developing a bracing group rapport. Indeed, Smith refers to the aforementioned musicians as \u201ckindred spirits,\u201d while embracing some philosophies gleaned from his mentor, Holland. \u201cDave once told me, \u2018I really believe that musicians find each other,\u2019\u201d Smith recalls. \u201cHe feels that all the collaborations he\u2019s done and all the sidemen that he\u2019s hired came into his life on purpose, even though he might not have been looking for something specific. He discovers people along the way.\n\n\u201cKINFOLK is about the musical family that I\u2019ve put together,\u201d Smith continues. \u201cAll core members of the band have very unique and specific points of view.\u201d He reinforces the idea of family by composing tunes that touch upon his childhood. Such is the case with the jovial \u201cMorning and Allison,\u201d whose title partly invokes Allison Drive, the street on which Smith grew up. The song stars Ms. Whatt serenading idyllic recollections of a child enjoying a bright, fun-filled Sunday morning.\n\nSmith recorded his parents \u2013 Lettie and Theodore Smith \u2013 talking about their respective parents on the mesmerizing interludes \u201cMom\u201d and \u201cDad.\u201d On the former, Smith\u2019s mother tells how her father migrated from Virginia to Detroit and was drafted into U.S. Army then later returned to Virginia, where he bought the family a house. The latter provides a vehicle for his father to recall how his father tirelessly worked at Navy shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia during the Jim Crow era without getting proper financial compensation or promotion until decades later. \u201cI think of these stories as snapshots that ultimately gave shape to the Black American experience into which I was born, which ultimately informs this music\u201d Smith explains, before stressing the importance of having his parents\u2019 voices on the album.\n\nThe significance of having Smith\u2019s father on the disc was brought home even more after his passing in March 2015. \u201cHe never got a chance to hear the music or the band,\u201d Smith says.\n\nSmith celebrates the legacy of his paternal grandfather on the haunting ballad \u201cHome Free (Peter Joe).\u201d The song begins with a chamber- like string intro then moves into a gorgeous hymnal melody, highlighted by Shaw\u2019s uncoiling of a splendid, blues-soaked lyricism. \u201cOf my four grandparents, Peter Joe was the one I felt the closest to,\u201d Smith says. \u201cHe was a real buddy of mine. He died when I was only nine but I still think about him a lot.\u201d\n\nSmith reemphasizes the theme of nostalgia with \u201cRetold\u201d and \u201cPages.\u201d \u201cRetold\u201d finds Bowers tickling a melancholy yet romantic melodic motif on which guitar and saxophone run parallel lines across. \u201cWhen I started writing this song, it always sounded like someone telling a love story from start to finish,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThe real feature of the song is Kris\u2019 amazing piano solo. He\u2019s so lyrical and rhythmic in the way that he plays.\u201d The dreamy \u201c\u201cPages\u201d becomes a superb showcase for Parlato to sing the song\u2019s theme about turning the pages of a photo album. \u201cI\u2019ve loved Gretchen since the first time I heard her sing,\u201d Smith says. \u201cShe becomes a part of the musical fabric. When she sings, it\u2019s never about the singer being at the front and the band being way in the back. It\u2019s all one sound. She also has really big ears and has amazing ideas about phrasing.\u201d\n\nThe spirit of the Black Lives Matter movement permeates the somber ballad \u201cDisenchantment: The Weight,\u201d another tune that spotlights Whatt\u2019s thoughtful lyrics and delicate singing. Underneath the prowling melody, Smith drums martial rhythms that convey a sense of marching forward. Written in the summer of 2013 soon after the verdict of the Trayvon Martin murder trial, Smith says that the song\u2019s cyclical harmonic pattern represents a longing sigh that many people felt and continue to feel after witnessing such ongoing travesties.\n\nFollowing that aforementioned song is \u201cSpinning Down,\u201d an intricate tune, marked by multiple subdivided rhythms inside of larger rhythmic cycles. Featuring Holland playing acoustic bass alongside Ephron on electric, intertwining saxophone passages from Shaw; incredible solos from Bowers and Loueke, and surprisingly the only drum solo on the disc, the song touches upon the theme of trying to ease a restless mind. \u201cIt works well right after \u2018Disenchantment\u2019 because that song is about everything that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cSpinning Down\u2019 is about the mind trying to work all that wrong out.\u201d\n\nThe other tunes on KINFOLK reflect Smith\u2019s unfettered love for groove and funk. The disc opens with the feisty \u201cSkip Step,\u201d a tricky tune, featuring Holland and Loueke, which Smith explains was influenced by his love for Earth, Wind & Fire; specifically the level of musical sophistication that the group\u2019s founder and leader, Maurice White ceaselessly incorporated in its signature sound. Smith describes the song as a straight-up R&B jam with an extra eighth note at the end \u2013 hence the song\u2019s title. \u201cI wanted the song to be as danceable as possible but with this one little hiccup or skip at the end of the phrase,\u201d Smith says. \u201cI also thought about Lionel, because, like Dave, he can make anything groove. He\u2019s such a relaxed player and his time-feel is so crazy that he can make any song feel good.\u201d\n\n\u201cFeel good\u201d vibes carry over into \u201cBounce (Part I and II),\u201d featuring Potter on tenor saxophone. In fact, the song was first performed during Smith\u2019s tenure as a core member of Potter\u2019s acclaimed Underground ensemble. Smith revised the song to include another section after being influenced by Miles Davis\u2019 seminal 1986 LP, Tutu. \u201cOn Tutu, there\u2019s a little bit of written material and then there\u2019s a little bit of groove section in which people start improvising,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThen they go back to the written material. They cycle that around. That was the idea for \u2018Bounce.\u2019\u201d\n\nJust as the second part of \u201cBounce\u201d offered a canvas for Potter to improvise, the\nquicksilver \u201cFrom Here \u2013 Interlude\u201d does the same for Shaw, whom Smith praises as someone whose improvisations balance the wisdom of an older musician with the fiery enthusiasm of young gun.\n\nAs the title suggests, the fractured, hip-hop leaning \u201cSmall Moves \u2013 Interlude,\u201d is a play on Smith\u2019s manipulation of the song\u2019s chord changes by moving them from minor to major by the addition or subtraction of one note. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s an allegory for life \u2013 you can make one small move or say one small thing out of kindness or cruelty and it\u2019ll change your entire trajectory,\u201d Smith says.\n\n\u201cSpiracles\u201d \u2013 the sole non-original on the disc \u2013 is a Stereolab song from the group\u2019s 1999 disc, Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night. On Smith\u2019s makeover, he decelerates the tempo then buttresses it with a more defining backbeat while retaining the song\u2019s billowing melody. The song includes a tender alto saxophone aside from Shaw, along with a lulling guitar solo from Rogers. \u201cI love the chord changes and the melody of that song. There\u2019s a cycle of discovery every time I go through that song\u2019s form,\u201d Smith enthuses.\n\nBecause Smith didn\u2019t come strictly from the formal matriculation of music studies as so many of his jazz contemporaries did, he lovingly describes his approach to drumming as \u201cunrefined,\u201d which in turns helps him distinguish his voice. He did, however, earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1997 in media arts and design from James Madison University. While he was still in college, the legendary singer Betty Carter recruited him for her world-acclaimed Jazz Ahead program.\n\nSmith says that the visual arts discipline he studied in college definitely seeps into his compositions. \u201cI love great movies and images. I\u2019ve always had a deep interest in composing for film,\u201d Smith says. \u201cFor this project, there is something very cinematic about the way that I conceived this record. That\u2019s why it was so important for me to cast the right characters in terms of musicians.

It's a bold, impressive and powerful move that both reflects the decade gone by and hints at what the future has to offer. More than that, it demonstrates that age-old clich\u00e9 is still true today \u2013 if you want something done right, do it yourself. Not only did they self fund their new album \u2018You Are We\u2019 with the help of their fans through a PledgeMusic campaign, but the band converted an empty warehouse in the heart of their native Sheffield into their own multi-purpose studio. It\u2019s not the first time the band have had their own space \u2013 2010\u2019s debut EP \u2018The North Stands For Nothing\u2019 was recorded at a home studio called The Barn \u2013 but with this new space, which was built with the band\u2019s own money, they\u2019ve taken things to the next level.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been a very DIY aspect to this band,\u201d explains vocalist Lawrence \u2018Loz\u2019 Taylor, \u201cso going it alone a bit more now just reiterates that to everyone. The Barn was a very important place for us \u2013 it\u2019s where we grew as friends and it was where we hung out and could be creative \u2013 so the idea with this new space is that it gives us a lot more creative space. There\u2019s a studio and live room, and we have space now to achieve what we want to achieve as a band. This place is going to house us for a good few years.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve all been skint for a while because of this place,\u201d chuckles guitarist Sean Long, \u201cbut we\u2019re hoping that it comes into its own. It\u2019s already becoming a space for other bands, too. They can use it as a pre-production space or store their gear here, and it\u2019s constantly busy with people coming here and working. It\u2019s a nice positive space where we can all get creative and be the band we want to be.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a place where the band \u2013 completed by guitarist/vocalist Mat Welsh, bassist Aaran McKenzie and drummer Adam Savage \u2013 aim to break down the barrier even more between themselves and their fan base. As part of the new record\u2019s PledgeMusic campaign, fans were able to head to the studio and take part in the music video for \u2018Hurricane\u2019. \u201cThat was absolutely crazy,\u201d beams Taylor. \u201cI\u2019m still aching from that! But the special thing is that every kid who came down for the video shoot actually helped make the album happen. And to that extent they made this warehouse capable of living.\u201d \u201cNow more than ever,\u201d adds Long, \u201cour fans know that it\u2019s them making all of this possible for us. The divide between artist and fan is ridiculous, because there are no fans without the artist and there\u2019s no artist without the fans. They go hand in hand together as one absolute thing, and I really like that we can see that in play with what we\u2019ve been doing. It\u2019s very reassuring to see that support right in front of us.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all the more crucial because of the experiences While She Sleeps have had with the music industry in their decade of existence, not least with previously being on a major label. They\u2019re quick to point out that it\u2019s not been all bad, but that it\u2019s not been all good either, and that it\u2019s their fans who have propelled them through both the good times and the bad. The same is true for their own personal struggles, especially when Taylor had to have surgery on his voice midway through making \u2018Brainwashed\u2019. Lesser bands might have given up the fight, but While She Sleeps pushed on through, encouraged by the loyalty, love and devotion of their fans. As much as that\u2019s been made visible thanks to the new warehouse space, it\u2019s also audible on the band\u2019s new record. Made with Carl Bown, who also produced \u2018Brainwashed\u2019, its songs are full of as much force, focus and determination as ever. The likes of \u2018Hurricane\u2019 and first single \u2018Civil Isolation\u2019 continue the band\u2019s trajectory as one of the most inspiring, riotous and important voices in British music today, demonstrating both their continued musical evolution and their incisive social conscience. Yet while these are brutal anthems that paint a vivid picture of a post-Brexit Britain, they stand as both the most universal and most personal songs of the band\u2019s career.\n\n\u201cI feel like these are some of the most powerful and relatable songs that we\u2019ve ever written,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cThese songs look at the world as a whole, but it\u2019s also very much about us. We\u2019ve all been through a few ups and downs over the past few years, and I think it\u2019s important for us to express that, because our music is our healing and our therapy. There\u2019s a lot of heartfelt stuff in there from our own personal experiences, but there\u2019s also much more of a global view, too.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re never not going to be singing about worldly issues and politics,\u201d says Long, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what we do without even trying. But, as Loz says, on this album it\u2019s all housed within very personal ways of dealing with those things. We\u2019re not just screaming about all the problems in the world, we\u2019re screaming about how we feel about those things. I\u2019ve never been more connected to moments in the studio when I\u2019m writing music than I have with this record.\u201d\n\nThis album does more than bridge the divide between past and present. It establishes who While She Sleeps really are in unfiltered, grotesque and beautiful glory. It sets them up as their own driving force, as a band who operate on their own terms and conditions and write music the exact same way. It\u2019s a record not just made in spite of the problems and pressures they\u2019ve faced in the past, but one created out of them and brimming with the passion that has always propelled the band and clearly continues to do so a decade on.\n\n\u201cThe main thing with While She Sleeps,\u201d says Taylor, \u201cis that we\u2019re digging our own path and the longer we keep working at it, the more people will realise we\u2019re not going anywhere. We\u2019re just going to keep on doing our own thing. And if we can explore new sounds and styles and still sound like us; if we can progress but still hold onto the While She Sleeps sound, then that\u2019s great.\u201d \u201cMy mum even likes it,\u201d says Long, laughing, \u201cso I\u2019m very happy.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "22 E 29th St, New York, NY 10016", "Artist": "Nick Cabrera", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9156247.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.985521, 40.744634], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, R&B, soul, Rock, Latin", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "The Seville", "moreBioInfo": "Hi I'm Nick.

Right now, we have this newfound positivity when it comes to our music and group. We\u2019re really inspired. We pulled a gem out of two years on the road, ups, downs, and crazy things going on.\u201d\nThat gem arrives in the form of the group\u2019s sixth full-length and second for Spinefarm Records, White Bat. The quartet\u2014Schuylar, Adam Tanbouz [lead guitar], Matty Williams [bass], and Jesse Shelley [drums]\u2014positioned themselves to make such a statement since forming in 2003. Bolstered by a cult fan base, their discography encompasses I Am Hollywood, Suck Out the Poison, and the seminal It Hates You. 2014\u2019s Heavy Fruit notably garnered praise from the likes of Alternative Press, Revolver, New Noise, and Ultimate Guitar, among others. MetalInjection bestowed a glowing 9-out-of-10-rating upon the crowdfunded Few in 2017, describing it best, \u201cLet\u2019s cut right to the chase: He Is Legend is one of the most underrated and under-appreciated bands in all of metal.\u201d Along the way, the boys would share the stage with everyone from Killswitch Engage and Sevendust to Gwar and Underoath.\nThis longevity and brotherhood set the stage for the next chapter.\n\u201cMatt, Adam, and I have been in a band for upwards of 17 years,\u201d the vocalist continues. \u201cJesse and I have become the fastest of friends in the past three years. Everybody brings what they bring to the table. Nobody worries about what one ingredient is going to do to the dish. They all work together. This is super He Is Legend. It sounds like a mixture of all of our albums together. It has a moodiness and heaviness we haven\u2019t ventured into in a while. It\u2019s conceptual. More than the content and concept, the music is representative of what we are now.\u201d\nThis time around, the musicians diligently worked across the country. Jesse recorded drums in Atlanta at Glow in the Dark Studios with Matt Goldman. Guitars and bass would be tracked at Warriorsound with Al Jacobs. Meanwhile, Schuylar ventured out West to reteam with Mitch Marlow for vocals in Los Angeles.\nInspired by Michelle McNamara\u2019s true crime classic I\u2019ll Be Gone In The Dark, he wandered around the shadiest and most shadowy corners of the city of angels. Getting into a menacing mindset for the concept, he visited the grave of Walt Disney, canvased mausoleums, went to the Museum of Death, and \u201csat in crazy seedy little bars, wrote, and got into this headspace\u2014like preparing for an acting role.\u201d\nHe inhabited the lead role with the intensity and preparation of a method actor, baring his fangs on the first single and title track \u201cWhite Bat.\u201d A barrage of thrashed-up guitars and psychological vocal bludgeoning, it takes flight on a visceral, violent, and vibrant chant. Within two months\u2019 time, it closed in on 1 million Spotify streams and introduced the record with teeth.\n\u201cWhite Bat is a moniker for this fictional killer,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt\u2019s his calling card. The name has a ring of finality to it, which I dug. It came out of nowhere. It sums up this era of He Is Legend, which is in-your-face\u2014dare I say Far Beyond Driven-style\u2014but still rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. The character is battling his own demons and trying to figure out if his life is being led through fantasy, or if he\u2019s actually doing these things. On the other side of the coin, a White Bat is a rare breed. That\u2019s as much as I\u2019ll say about the concept,\u201d he cuts himself off as if keeping a secret\u2026\nWhether it be the ominous clean guitar and swamp conjuration of \u201cUncanny Valley\u201d or the rip-roaring rage of \u201cEye Teeth,\u201d White Bat spreads its wings with a raw sense of recklessness. Powered by a raucous riff, \u201cBurn All Your Rock Records\u201d explodes as a clarion call, while everything culminates on the sludge \u2018n\u2019 roll goth daydream of \u201cBoogiewoman.\u201d\n\u201cAt one point when I was in the desert, I had written a poem,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe first lines about everything being brown and remaining trapped in an area stuck with me for a long while. Right before going to L.A., I went through my notebooks and jotted down some one-liners on a yellow legal pad I wanted to use. I knew this had to be the closer. Lyrically, I like the wordplay of these different syndromes such as Stockholm Syndrome. They conjure imagery of someone standing by through the most heinous of things.\u201d\nIn the end, the quartet are much more than rock band.\nThey\u2019re He Is Legend.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never felt more typecast as ourselves,\u201d Schuylar leaves off. \u201cThis is probably the best depiction of what our music sounds like. We wrote a record for big stages. We found this life and essence like, \u2018Here we are. This is the band in its purest form.\u2019 We\u2019re fucking back. We\u2019re here.

In a particularly cacophonous cultural moment, Lowland Hum offers refreshment and reprieve. The band's songs have been described as poetic and evocative, and their arrangements minimal, hushed and dynamic. Lowland Hum\u2019s performances are characterized by the space they create together for their audiences. Their sharing style paves the way for moments of intimate vulnerability and levity alike. In early 2017 Lowland Hum released Thin, their third full-length studio album and took their new songs on the road for a nationwide headline album release tour; sharing the stage with Josh Ritter, Jesca Hoop, and Penny and Sparrow along the way. They will embark on a European tour in the fall of 2017. Both their live show and studio releases have garnered critical acclaim from the likes of NPR, Paste Magazine, Huffington Post, the Washington Post, American Songwriter and others.\n\nLonger Version:\nLowland Hum is wife and husband team Lauren and Daniel Goans. Together they invite their listeners to share in the space of vulnerable intimacy they have formed over years of steady collaboration. In the live setting, the duo offers an immersive experience of thoughtful songcraft interspersed with audience interaction and extemporaneous songs about the day's happenings. Their recordings take listeners on a journey through relatable, imagistic poetry exploring themes of memory, longing, confession and identity, and drawing attention to often unnoticed resonances of the everyday.\n\nDaniel and Lauren are a prolific, two-person creative factory basing their operation in Charlottesville, Virginia. They write, arrange and produce all of their own music, and have honed a cohesive design aesthetic to match the hushed simplicity of their sound.\n\nThe duo's beginning starts with Daniel, a songwriter, performer and producer from North Carolina. Daniel and Lauren\u2019s creative worlds first collided one hot, Greensboro summer in 2010 when Daniel asked Lauren to design the album art for a solo record he was working on. Having once heard Lauren singing to herself at a party, he eventually coaxed her into singing some harmonies on that same album. This was Lauren's first experience with recording. Previously, her performance experience consisted of her middle and high school chorus classes, which, in her own words, provided her with a strong connection to melody and harmony in a context that was well-suited to her shy disposition.\n\nInitially, Lauren performed with Daniel, singing harmonies on songs he had written, but within a year or so, the two began cowriting and arranging virtually all of the material together. Lowland Hum formed officially in 2012, a few months after the two were married and their collaboration deepened. In the years following the release of their critically acclaimed debut Native Air (2013), the duo has tirelessly toured the country, spending more time on the road than at home. In 2014 they followed up their debut with Four Sisters, a conceptual EP and video series, and then, in 2015, they released their eponymous sophomore full-length album, garnering a slew of praise, including an NPR First Listen. Lowland Hum has performed in diverse settings all over the country ranging from folk festivals, art museums and theaters to living rooms and gardens. During their time off the road, Daniel produces albums for other bands.\n\nLauren's background in visual art asserts itself in the duo's collaboration significantly. She has created all of the band's artwork and design as well as several transportable installation pieces that served as additions to the band\u2019s live performances. She is also responsible for an impressive collection of music videos often using found footage from public domain archives. Over the years, Lauren has designed five editions of handmade lyric books that the duo passes out to audiences so they can read along and interact more deeply with the lyrical content of their songs if they so choose.\n\nLowland Hum's songs have been described as poetic and evocative, and their arrangements minimal, hushed and dynamic. They continue to attract a growing body of listeners around the world. Daniel and Lauren spent the summer of 2016 creating their third full-length album in a friend's attic. The album, Thin, came out on February 10, 2017, and is their \"deepest collaboration to date\" according to the band. They completed a nationwide headline tour, sharing the stage with the likes of Josh Ritter, Jesca Hoop and Penny and Sparrow along the way. After playing a handful of festivals this summer, the band will embark on a nationwide tour supporting Penny and Sparrow in the fall followed directly by a five week European tour. The band is releasing an EP of bsides from Thin in September and plans to release a Christmas record in early November.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "99 Monmouth St, Red Bank, NJ 07701", "Artist": "Live", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9107631.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.070254, 40.348917], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Alternative Rock", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Hackensack Meridian Health Theatre at the Count Basie Center for the Arts", "moreBioInfo": "Official FB Page for the rock band LIVE\n\n\n\nwww.thebandlive.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "146 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Margaux", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.963479, 40.7101], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Baby's All Right", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "~++~"}, {"Address": "198 Broadway, Amityville, NY 11701", "Artist": "A Very Special Episode", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8412114.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.41742, 40.67899], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "Genres: Post Punk, Shoegaze, Rock", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Amityville Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Television Music", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "198 Broadway, Amityville, NY 11701", "Artist": "Finite State", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.41742, 40.67899], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Amityville Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "146 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Cutouts", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8774265.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.963479, 40.7101], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Baby's All Right", "moreBioInfo": "https://soundcloud.com/the_cutouts", "otherInfo": "~++~"}, {"Address": "217 E Houston St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Meghan Fitton", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10028780.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.986751, 40.722165], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Soul, folk, Country", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Mercury Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "Just a Boston girl in the big city trying to tell stories.

Throw in modern influences like Kentucky guitar-slingers, My Morning Jacket; and New Orleans\u2019 rhythmically tight MUTEMATH; rappers Jay Z, Kanye West and J. Cole, along with seminal blues giants Muddy Waters, Howling Wolf and B.B. King, and you get an idea of the Blue Stones\u2019 musically eclectic palette.\n\nFrom the slap back echo and the Rolling Stones \u201cooh-oohs\u201d in the gut-punching \u201cThe Drop\u201d through the tribute to perseverance in the martial snare, bluesy singalong of \u201cRolling with the Punches\u201d and the acoustic-to-electric whisper-to-a-scream dynamism of the title track, Black Holes shows a band blasting into outer space and leaving \u201cSolid Ground\u201d behind. It\u2019s the voyage of a group beginning to find its way, emerging from isolation and perspiration to inspiration, reaching an audience waiting to be tapped, and entertained. A rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band fighting the good fight, looking to connect in an increasingly fragmented music universe.\n\n\u201cThe album\u2019s about being a young adult on the cusp of entering the real world from a sheltered environment, like college,\u201d explains Jafar. \u201cFeeling torn between taking the secure path or doing something that might be riskier, but you\u2019re passionate about\u2026 following what you love as opposed to sticking to the straight and narrow.\u201d\n\nIndeed, \u201cBlack Holes (Solid Ground)\u201d is about precisely that either/or dichotomy, caught between infinite space and terra firma, willing to take a shot at the unknown rather than settle for the familiar, in between Jafar\u2019s restless guitars and Tessier\u2019s tight drum beats.\n\u201cWe play blues-rock, though it\u2019s not loose and dirty, like the traditional kind,\u201d explains Justin. \u201cIt\u2019s lean, raw, tight, without a wasted note.\u201d\n\nIt took seven long years \u2013 and an independently released EP \u2013 for The Blue Stones to hone their approach, putting in those requisite 10,000 hours to perfect their craft, and then build upon that. As Jafar describes the audience participation of \u201cRolling with the Punches,\u201d which is the group\u2019s usual, rollicking set-closer, \u201cIt takes a lot to be a success. You have to stay proud and focused. And it\u2019s always fun to have people sing the words you\u2019ve written and just sit back and take it all in.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a similar message in the album finale, \u201cMagic,\u201d in which Jafar admits he doesn\u2019t believe in it. \u201cPeople these days are all looking for instant gratification, the quick reward,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want something that will endure, that\u2019s not how it works. You have to put in the hours and the effort.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Stones have done just that, with an approach that isn\u2019t afraid to take chances, like plumbing Jafar\u2019s love of hip-hop and Miles Davis into the funky backbeat of \u201cBe My Fire\u201d or the epic psychedelic experimentation in the pitch-dark \u201cMidnight.\u201d\n\u201cYou never know where we\u2019ll pull inspiration from,\u201d says Justin.\n\u201cThis is the album we\u2019ve always wanted to make,\u201d adds Tarek. \u201cWe set out to show we\u2019re more than loud and lo-fi, that we have range and dynamics.\u201d\nAnd now it\u2019s time to take to the road, play these songs and add to their growing legion of admirers.\n\n\u201cWe have dreams and we have goals, but we separate the two,\u201d adds Justin. \u201cA dream is to headline Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, where we saw so many great bands. Our goal, though, is to reach out at every show and win people over one by one. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve always done it and it\u2019s worked so far. We believe in what we\u2019re doing and we have emotional connections to the songs we\u2019re playing. We want to provide our audience with the kind of experiences we had when we were younger attending shows of our favorites. That\u2019s what we look to pass on.\u201d\n\u201cMy whole attitude is, let\u2019s see what happens,\u201d nods Tarek. \u201cAnd that\u2019s allowed me to be up for anything.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not over now,\u201d sings Jafar in \u201cLay,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t lay your flag and turn away/Please don\u2019t leave me with another regret.\u201d\nWith the release of Black Holes, The Blue Stones are ready to raise the stakes and turn up the heat.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2271 Adam Clayton Powell Je Blvd, New York, NY 10030", "Artist": "Gedalya", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9163610.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.944106, 40.814306], "Date": "Wed Feb 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-19", "Genre": "Genres: Folk Rock, Folk, Easy Listening, Spiritual, Adult Contemporary, Country, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Shrine", "moreBioInfo": "Gedalya is a folk rock singer/songwriter based in New York.

The Mona Dahls are: Orly Bendavid\u2019s tender, emotional vocal melodies, neatly composed folk chords, rootsy grooves, and bluesy riffs. Daniella Fischetti\u2019s heart wrenching sweeping violin aria\u2019s. Robin Mitchell\u2019s poignant, creative, and sensitive piano constructions.

According to iTunes Editors' Notes:\n\n\"A fair number of hot shot guitarists can lay down licks with presence and panache, but that number shrinks drastically when you tally the ones who are also sharp-shooting singer/songwriters. That\u00eds what makes Chris Bergson an unusual triple threat and this live recording shines a spotlight on the strength of his material as well as the alternately simmering and fiery feel that he and his band serve up in a club setting. New York City native Chris Bergson is a bluesman of a distinctly urban stripe. Instead of swamps and rivers, his songs - many penned in collaboration with lyricist Kate Ross - are full of citified imagery from the midtown Manhattan locale of \"61st & 1st\" to the Brooklyn scenes of \"Gowanus Heights.\" The three-man horn section accentuates the soul leanings of tunes like \"The Only One\" and brings out the R&B shadings in Bergson's gritty growl. At times, the blend of Bergson's earthy vocals and terse, biting guitar with Craig Dreyer's organ evokes The Band. Yet whether the guitarist and his group are venturing into R&B, roots rock or straight blues, they create an invitingly organic feel on a recording that clearly captures the band in their element.\"\n\nSpecial guests include soul singer Ellis Hooks and a three piece horn section featuring baritone saxophonist Ian Hendrickson-Smith (Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings), tenor saxophonist David Luther (Bettye LaVette) and Grammy Award-winning trumpeter Freddie Hendrix performing horn arrangements by Jay Collins (Gregg Allman).\n\nJazz Standard has been a musical home for the Chris Bergson Band for the past ten years and provided an ideal venue for their first live record. The album was recorded and co-produced by award-winning producer/engineer Roman Klun whose credits include albums by the Spin Doctors, Joan Osborne and the Holmes Brothers.\n\nBergson has had the opportunity to play with two masters of American music - drummer/singer Levon Helm of The Band and Howlin' Wolf's guitarist Hubert Sumlin - and their influence can be heard throughout the album.\n\nNotable past performances include:\nMoulin Blues (Holland), Groningen Rhythm and Blues Night (Holland), Blues Open (Holland), Noct en Blues (Chaumont, France), Blues in Hell (Norway), Harvest Time Blues (Ireland), Leicester Blues Festival (UK), Waterfront Blues Festival (Portland, OR), Saratoga Jazz Festival (NY), Levon Helm's Midnight Rambles (Woodstock, NY), River to River Festival (NYC), Joe\u2019s Pub (NYC), The Blue Note (NYC), Jazz Standard (NYC), John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (DC), SXSW, and opening for B.B. King at B.B. King's Blues Club (NYC).\n\nBorn in New York City but raised in Somerville, Massachusetts, Chris Bergson returned to Manhattan in\n1995. While backing jazz singers Annie Ross, Dena DeRose, Sasha Dobson and Norah Jones, he released\nBlues for Some Friends of Mine and Wait for Spring on Juniper Records in 1997 and 2000,\nrespectively. In 2002 Bergson was appointed a Jazz Ambassador of the USA by the John F. Kennedy\nCenter for the Performing Arts and he toured Africa with his trio. Evolving to further embrace the blues\nwhile also adding pop influences, he followed up with Blues (2003), Another Day (2005) and his\ntriumphant artistic breakthrough, the widely acclaimed Fall Changes (2007) -- MOJO\u2019s #1 Blues Album\nof 2008 -- that established him as an eloquent, evocative and lyrical songwriter with a sharp urban vision.\nRecorded at Levon Helm\u2019s Woodstock studio, it led to Bergson being personally invited to perform at the\nfamed drummer\u2019s Midnight Rambles while opening the way for more stateside festivals and subsequent\ntours of Europe.\n\nClick here to read Kay Cordtz's in-depth profile of Chris Bergson in ROLL Magazine:\nwww.rollmagazine.com\n\nChris Bergson currently serves on the faculty of NYC's 92Y where he teaches Rock, Blues and Jazz guitar and is the music mentor for the Recanati-Kaplan Scholarship Program.\n\nBergson endorses McCurdy Guitars and Levy's Leathers Gig Bags.\n\nSelected Press\n\n\"Gut-busting, horn-bedecked NY blues...

Combining influences that span decades, Natasha\u2019s work dwells in the elemental, emerging in timeless forms. Natasha Khan first captured our imagination way back in 2006 with a set of distinctively haunting and rich, darkly phantasmagoric songs ripe with magic realism. Her sensual and gilt-decorated dream world was opened up in two Mercury Music Prize nominated albums, the atavistic, reverb-drenched Fur and Gold (2006) and 2009\u2019s more electronically poppy Two Suns. The latter featured the irresistible Daniel \u2013 which won Ms Khan an Ivor Novello award for Best Contemporary Song \u2013 and was recorded in London and across America. Bat for Lashes continues to win over the hearts of the nation having made a triumphant return last year with the highly acclaimed third album The Haunted Man. A richly layered and accomplished record, it pulls Khan\u2019s distinctive creative vision into sharper focus, confirming her as a true innovator and an established UK artist. Khan has since been nominated for \u2018Best Female at the Brit Awards and the beautiful track \u2018Laura\u2019, one of the 2012\u2019s best, was nominated for an Ivor Novello for \u2018Best Song Musically And Lyrically\u2019, and was released as a limited edition 7\u201d for this year\u2019s Record Store Day. In September this year, Natasha Khan and Jon Hopkins announced a very special collaboration for the soundtrack to the upcoming British film How I Live Now, directed by Kevin Macdonald. The pair have written the beautifully sparse and atmospheric track \u2018Garden\u2019s Heart\u2019 together, a haunting and fitting tribute to the film\u2019s dark subject matter of a world war breaking out in 21st century Britain.
