Johnson began playing and writing songs on his four-track in the mid-'90s before he formed I Rowboat, a Velvet Underground-inspired indie rock band. Johnson began dabbling in folk with I Rowboat guitarist Dan Strack and drummer Brian Belval as the Fruit Bats. When I Rowboat disbanded, Johnson played guitar and banjo with Califone. That group's Tim Rutili and Ben Massarella, who also own Perishable Records, urged the Fruit Bats to record their work for the label, which resulted in the trio's 2001 debut, Echolocation. Over the next two years the group toured and refined its lineup and sound, adding Lisee as well as more pop and experimental elements to its folk-rock base. In 2002, the group signed to Sub Pop, who released their sophomore effort, Mouthfuls, in spring of 2003. Two years later, after relocating to Seattle and expanding to a four-piece, the band released their third full length album, Spelled in Bones. In 2006, Johnson became a member of The Shins, but remains committed to the Fruit Bats.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Andy Frasco LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8276724.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Indie, Rock, Blues, Jazz, Alternative, Feel Good Music, Folk", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Party Blues with a touch of Barefoot Boogie", "otherInfo": "This week: Billy Strings, MC Taylor, and David Shaw!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Marina V LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10280080.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Electronic Pop Indie Rock, Pop, Russian, Folk, Singer & Songwriter, Pop Rock", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201chauntingly beautiful\u201d ~ L.A.

Scoring one of the best albums of 2012 with \"High Wide & Handsome,\u201d the Trishas lit up the genre for a few years while always leaving Wilson room for solo gigs, guest spots on over a dozen albums by now, and song-swaps with like-minded artists all over Texas and beyond.\n\nBoth deeply personal and solidly collaborative, Holidays & Wedding Rings is an evident labor of love from the sort of songwriter who can delve into the sweetness of family life without hitting sap.

The result is both a recorded and live experience that has been described as \"a more nuanced level of rock brutality\" (The Stranger, March 2018) and \"one of the best live shows in Seattle right now...\" (Seattle Music Insider, July 2018).\n\nAfter five EPs worth of loud, fast rock- and punk-oriented songs inspired by blues, latin, and funk, Actionesse found themselves yearning for growth. The band had sensed their music's lack of focus, and resented their electric nature that, while inviting to some, felt tired and directionless. Meanwhile, a heavier, darker and more angular sound was brewing in the writing room, seen in partial bloom on Actionesse's 2018 EP, 'Deep'. Yet, despite the popularity of their newly forged genre-moniker, \"post-horncore\", the band knew that a stronger element and a more fully-fledged version of themselves were yet to come.\n\nOver the course of 2018, Actionesse saw a swift rise in notoriety within their local scene, and began opening for national touring acts such as Korpiklaani, Death Valley Girls, Big Business, Arkona, and Jessica Hernandez and the Deltas (in addition to packing rooms up and down the I-5 corridor in Bellingham, Everett, Seattle, and Tacoma).\n\n\u201cHalfway through the show, provided with ample backbone by drummer Jimmy Colven, the quartet was joined by a guest horn star on the [baritone] saxophone. What followed was life changing.\u201d\n- Dan\u2019s Tunes (November 2018)\n\nIn the Fall of 2018, Actionesse took on a new form with addition of one of Seattle's top baritone saxophone players, Olivia Guinn (Butt Dial, Chaotic Noise Marching Corps, Filthy Femcorps). Barreling forth with rejuvenated vigor, 2019 has seen Actionesse in their boldest, rawest mode yet - with their third tour on the way, festival bookings, and the announcement of their debut full-length LP, 'The Deep, Bright Below', post-horncore stands to make its mark on the city of Seattle.\n\n\"Actionesse puts on one of the best live shows in Seattle right now, and they don\u2019t do it by way of wacky outfits or fancy light shows: they do it by sheer force of intensity in both their music and their deportment.\u201d\n- Seattle Music Insider (July 2018)", "otherInfo": "STREAMING LIVE ON NECTAR YOUTUBE CHANNEL:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV3GuytG6_IQEFe_iibgESA\n\n5.21 Thursday (Rock)\n\nNectar & SolidSound present:\n\nNECTAR VIRTUAL CONCERT SERIES featuring\n\nACTIONESSE\n\nThursday, May 21st\n\n8:00-9:00pm PST\n\n\"Pay What You Will\" via PayPal @ paypal.me/nectarlounge\n\nor Venmo: @nectar-lounge\n\n$10 & up Suggest Contribution (your contributions are greatly appreciated!)\n\nA Fundraiser for:\n\nACTIONESSE\n\nand to help keep Nectar operational thru COVID-19 lockdown\n\nStreaming live via\n\nNectar Lounge\n\n412 N 36th St\n\nwww.nectarlounge.com\n\n------------------------\n\nACTIONESSE\n\nhttps://www.actionesse.com\n\nPost-horncore band Actionesse began in early 2015, in Bellingham, WA, and is currently located in Seattle, WA.

The band corralled two sonic stalwarts for their first full length record, including engineer Nich Wilbur (Angel Olsen, Black Belt Eagle Scout) and Seattle-area sage Trevor Spencer (Father John Misty, Fleet Foxes), who mixed the record.

The hours she spent rifling through vinyl in the warehouse of Chemical Records, where Sam once worked as a house buyer, gives her an insurmountable understanding of the genre. Having played nearly every club in Ibiza \u2013 including residencies at Ushuaia, Amnesia and Sankeys \u2013 and landed at top-end festivals, there are few who can offer a house music education like Sam Divine. Last year, she racked up over a hundred gigs and is well on track to exceed that in 2017, having already hit up the likes of Europe, North America and Asia. And her reputation for energising a dancefloor has been acknowledged by her inclusion in Pete Tong\u2019s Selector Series for Radio 1. A late starter, Sam took up DJing at 21 \u2013 learning to mix in her mum\u2019s garden shed. Her breakthrough came soon after with a DJ competition and landed her first residency at a club in Weston-super-Mare, where she was also the main booker, while also working in record stores. In 2005, after swapping Bristol for Ibiza, Sam became a vital component of San Antonio\u2019s west end (where this year she makes a triumphant return as a resident for Defected at Eden) and has spent every season on the White Isle ever since. During this time, Divine also began working with Defected, who in 2009 signed her to their artist roster. A weekly warm-up at Mambo ensued, opening for legendary names like Kenny Dope and Frankie Knuckles, as well as hosting the weekly Defected Radio show that currently holds the #2 spot on iTunes in the UK Music Podcasts chart. The real turning point, however, came when she played We Are FSTVL in 2013. \u201cI dropped a mix the night before and everyone went mad for it; the tent went from nothing to one-in-one-out within half an hour,\u201d she explains. \u201cAfter that, the bookings just went nuts.\u201d With her tireless work ethic, this summer, Sam will play Tomorrowland, Eastern Electrics, Defected Croatia, SW4, and Creamfields. This year also marks the 10-year anniversary of La Vita, the annual DJ charity night that she helped to launch and has so far raised \u00a335,000 for Breast Cancer Research. Sam also launched her own label D-Vine Sounds back in 2015, which this year she will showcase with a stage at We Are FSTVL, dates in Ibiza and a boat party at Defected Croatia. Recently, Sam has also begun to flirt with production; her first major release, a remix of garage anthem \u2018Flowers\u2019 with production partner Curtis Gabriel, hit #1 on both Traxsource and Beatport. Last year\u2019s \u2018Confessions\u2019 was her first release on Defected, while her \u2018Sam Divine In The House\u2019 compilation featured further productions and went #1 on iTunes\u2019 Dance chart. This summer she dropped \u2018In Da Nation\u2019 EP with Cassimm on DFTD. Sam Divine\u2019s work ethic has seen her more than earn her stripes on the scene. A dedicated army of fans now spreads across the globe as her uplifting house sets captivate audiences everywhere she takes to the booth. With an unwavering love of music and tireless dedication to her craft, Sam is living proof you can achieve pretty much anything you set your mind to \u2013 and no one can hold her back. twitter.com/djsamdivine soundcloud.com/djsamdivine instagram/djsamdivine defected.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Danny Howard ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sonny Fodera ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9116401.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "House", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Album out now: http://defct.de/sfffit\n\nHaving come up through the ranks at a startling rate, Australian Sonny Fodera is now leading from the front.

His standout contribution is a terrific three disc affair that is jam packed with his own stellar originals and remixes as well as some brand new and exclusive material (including Sonny Fodera ft. Alex Mills \u2013 \u2018Always Gonna Be,\u2019 Sonny Fodera ft. Shannon Saunders \u2018Over This\u2019 and \u2018The Definition\u2019 amongst many others). Aside from that high impact work, Sonny has also turned out a consistently excellent string of EPs on labels like Defected, Dirtybird and Visionquest, as well as remixing Rudimental. Never was he in finer form that with \u2018Let Go\u2019, a collaboration with Cervendos that sat pretty in the Beatport Deep House Top 10 for no fewer than 12 weeks in 2014, whilst more recently, his current single with Yasmin, \u2018Feelin U\u2019 shot straight in to the 2nd spot in the Beatport chart, only to be outdone by a stunning remix of Gershon Jackson on the legendary Strictly Rhythm label. As such, Sony currently has no fewer than six releases in the Beatport Deep House Top Ten, proving that he is very much creating the sounds of now for DJs and dancers everywhere.\n\nAs a result, of course, Sonny is a hugely in demand DJ who started 2016 with a 30 date tour of the UK, United States and Australia. It was his smooth technical skills in the booth that first won him the affections of Green Velvet, and nowadays he weaves his tight, seductive sets featuring all colours of the house spectrum everywhere from Footwork Toronto to Warung in Brazil, Cielo in New York City to Pacha, Sankeys, Amnesia DC10 and in Ibiza as well as We ARE FSTVL and many others.\n\nThe future is just as bright as the past for Sonny, who was born in Adelaide, Australia, and has lived between there, Ibiza, the USA and the UK since, though he is currently settled in London. It means he is fully focussed on the next chapter, which already promises to be a thrilling one for his fans, with a new album due on Defected \u2018Frequently Flying\u2019 , as well as more EPs on influential labels like Cajual and Lee Foss\u2019s highly anticipated new imprint, Repoulate Mars.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Carl Cox ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6609346.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Electronic, Techno", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Carl Cox - Biography April 2017 One of the most charming DJs in the business. A musical ambassador and a veteran of acid house, a champion of techno, a dance music pioneer, label owner, King of Ibiza \u2013 you name it, Carl's been there and done it, never losing sight of his passions \u2013 playing music, breaking tunes and celebrating life. It was at the age of 15 that Carl bought a set of turntables and began working as a mobile DJ. Disco was the first music that captivated him but by the early 80s Cox had moved on to playing the same music as other young London DJs \u2013 rare groove, New York hip-hop and electro. He was perfectly placed to hear Chicago house music in its earliest forms, and when the epic 'Acid Trax' by Phuture (a.k.a. DJ Pierre) came out in early '87. \u201cIt was then that I thought, 'This is it,\u2019 says Carl. \u201cI would do my parties, and I'd play old rare groove and hip hop and soul and I would say 'Right you've got to hear this Phuture track\u2019 and people would just stop and listen.\u201d As a founder of the sound, Carl rode the exploding British rave scene. He played the opening night of Danny Rampling's legendary Shoom, co-promoted The Project with Paul Oakenfold, where he also DJ\u2019d and did the sound system. He held a residency at the Zap Club in Brighton and at the Sunrise rave in 1988, hooked up a third turntable for his dawn-breaking set, got 15,000 people back on their feet, and established a personal rep for three-deck wizardry. The next step was to make music, and Carl's 1991 debut single for Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto label, 'I Want You,' reached Number 23 in the national UK charts and gave Carl his first Top of the Pops appearance. Two more singles also made the charts. But Carl was a reluctant pop star and as the masses moved onto fluffy house and trance, and the hardcore created jungle, Cox retreated into the club world that had nurtured him, and instead embraced the underground sounds of techno. \"Techno drives home somewhere,\" he says of his core music. \"It takes you to an element of surprise, not knowing where you're going. It's scary but wonderful at the same time.\" Carl\u2019s classic releases include his 1995 mix CD, 'F.A.C.T,' which became a techno benchmark, selling over 250,000 copies, and the 1996 EP 'Two Paintings and a Drum,' which again broke the British top 30. Alongside Carl\u2019s \u2018Ultimate Music Management\u2019 company, which counted Josh Wink and Laurent Garnier among 27 clients, there was the Ultimatum record label, for which Carl recorded his third top 30 UK single, 'Sensual Sophis-ti-cat.' In 2005, Carl\u2019s third album, \u2018The Second Sign\u2019 caused a stir across Europe and reached number 3 in Spain\u2019s national chart. Also gaining critical acclaim was \u2018Dirty Bass,\u2019 a collaboration with Christian Smith, and the funky \u2018Give Me Your Love\u2019, both released on 23rd Century Records, an outlet for his own burgeoning production output. Carl formed his own label, Intec Records, in 1999, scoring a series of underground hits and enjoying eight years at the forefront of electronic music. After its closure in 2006, Carl was still inundated with new music, finally deciding to re-launch the label as Intec Digital at the start of 2010. It\u2019s been a triumphant return, thanks to exclusives from some of the biggest names in techno. \u201cThe label couldn\u2019t be going better,\u201d says Carl. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be back at the helm discovering underground DJs.\u201d Intec Digital was also the home for Carl\u2019s 6th studio album, \u2018All Roads Lead To the Dancefloor,\u2019 released to critical acclaim in 2011 on state-of-the-art, self-updating USB technology. In 2013 Carl re-launched his seminal Pure Intec series, 9 years after the hugely successful original \u2018Pure Intec.\u2019 The release also coincided with the launch of a new series of Intec club nights where Carl played to a sold out XOYO in East London. Since then Intec have continued to hold regular parties across the world, including sell outs in Ibiza, Madrid, Switzerland, Amsterdam for ADE, and London\u2019s fabric. And of course Carl\u2019s name cannot be mentioned without Ibiza. His legendary Ibiza residency at Space came to an end in 2016, after an unbelievable 15 consecutive years. Since 2001 Carl helped establish Space as one of the biggest clubs in the world. With carefully thought out line ups, and as much emphasis on new talent as big names, Carl always strived to keep his night at the forefront of Ibiza clubbing making it one of the most successful residencies in Ibiza history. Starting out in 2001 with just 6 nights, his residency grew and adapted as the club did, so for Carl it was only right to end his residency as Space itself closed its doors. And what a way to go out. Carl\u2019s final 15 week season was his biggest ever, with every single night selling out, heralded by fans and critics alike as a triumphant finale to a piece of dance history. Following the end of his Ibiza residency Carl also decided to say goodbye to his record breaking weekly Global Radio show, which he\u2019d been broadcasting for nearly 16 years. When the final show aired in February 2017, the show was reaching a staggering 17-million weekly listeners worldwide, syndicated across over 60 terrestrial FM, satellite and DAB stations throughout 35 countries. \u201cIt was a hard decision as I loved every minute of creating my Global shows\u201d said Carl at the time. \u201cBut all things must come to an end at some point and it was time to focus on new ventures.\u201d And focus on new ventures he has\u2026. Carl continues to be one of most in demand DJs on the planet, with club dates and festival appearances across the world. After 12 years delivering his Carl Cox & Friends stage at Ultra, Carl is now proud to be ambassador for the Resistance parties, for Ultra worldwide. He also now has his own festival, Pure \u2013 which he initially launched in Australia in 2016. It returned this year with even more dates, including Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Auckland, his Pure brand is something he\u2019s keen to expand on and he\u2019s already taking it global. Summer 2017 saw Carl return to Ibiza with Pure Carl Cox \u2013 two sold out parties at super club Privilege. Built on the idea of taking things back to basics, Carl put the music first and foremost for some no nonsense, no frills house and techno parties \u2013 heralded by many as a highlight of the summer.

Tras sus primeros escarceos con los sonidos electr\u00f3nicos con tan s\u00f3lo 16 a\u00f1os, sus habilidades t\u00e9cnicas, su especial conexi\u00f3n con el p\u00fablico y su amplio y diverso abanico de estilos musicales pronto le convertir\u00edan en uno de los artistas m\u00e1s vers\u00e1tiles y polivalentes de la escena nacional. Como el buen vino, De La Swing ha madurado con el paso del tiempo y su progresi\u00f3n sonora le ha catapultado hasta poder presumir de compartir tiempo y escenarios con varios de los nombres m\u00e1s importantes de la escena mundial; y es que compartir cabina junto a artistas como Marco Carola, Loco Dice , Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Laurent Garnier, Joseph Capriati, Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch, Paco Osuna o Vitalic, o actuar en festivales y eventos tan emblem\u00e1ticos y reputados como Monegros Desert Festival, Eastern Electrics Festival, Kingsday Madness, We are Together, Plages Electroniques, Ultra Cape Town/Johannesburg & Origin Festival son prueba fehaciente del asentamiento sonoro y arrollador \u00e9xito a escala mundial del madrile\u00f1o. Incorpor\u00e1ndose a la familia Row en 2010 como residente y pilar fundamental de un club como Elrow de Barcelona, la trayectoria de De La Swing ha experimentado un constante crecimiento mejorando exponencialmente y llegando a abanderar, -junto al resto de familia Row-, su residencia tambi\u00e9n en las fiestas especiales a cargo del club catal\u00e1n albergadas en Ibiza como El Row en Privilege Ibiza durante las temporadas 2012 y 2013, o un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s tarde en Space Ibiza. De La Swing es ese tipo de artista inconformista cuya carrera y evoluci\u00f3n musical es cuidada hasta el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo detalle y donde la profundidad, creatividad e innovaci\u00f3n sonora se abrazan sin acritud seg\u00fan pisa el escenario.

Y es que si el de Madrid destaca con sus sesiones desenvueltas en un constante Groove y fusionando techno y house de la nueva escuela, sus producciones van un paso m\u00e1s all\u00e1. Con una mentalidad solida, f\u00e9rtil y arriesgada, De La Swing es el alma m\u00e1ter detr\u00e1s de labels tan en alza en el panorama nacional como Elrow Music, Florida Music & Ker Recordings, habiendo tambi\u00e9n colaborado y remezclado para sellos como Form, Drakos Recordings y Amazing Lab. Pero su amor por la m\u00fasica y el eclecticismo musical le ha hecho mostrar su otra cara art\u00edstica; su faceta m\u00e1s underground bajo el pseud\u00f3nimo \u2018Smoked Signal\u2019, habitualmente presente como residente del Ker Club de la Ciudad Condal y habiendo compartido vivencias y an\u00e9cdotas en su escenario con nombres como Martinez Brothers, Art Department, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Seth Troxler, Scuba o Los Suruba entre otros. English version: Born in Madrid in the 80\u2019s, Domingo Bellot starts his musical career at the age of 16. Influenced in its beginnings by techno and drum&bass, his technical skills, ability to connect with the crowd and he\u2019s diverse musical style has made him one of the most versatile DJ\u00b4s in Spain. Over the past 5 years De La Swing has shared turntables with different top level Djs as Marco Carola, Loco Dice, Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Laurent Garnier, Joseph Capriati, Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch, Paco Osuna or Vitalic among others, and has played at festivals like Monegros Desert Festival (Spain), Eastern Electric Festival (London), Kingsday Madness (Holland), We are Together (Marseille), Plages Electroniques (Cannes), Ultra Cape Town/Johannesburg & Origin Festival (South Africa), resulting rapidly a well-known and familiar Dj in countries as Spain, France, Italy and Holland. Since 2010 this Madrid born is one of the emblematic ElRow residents, the after hour based in the ever growing electronic hub of Barcelona, that has become one of the best clubs worldwide, brainchild of the organisers of Europe's only desert festival, Monegros, and owners of the acclaimed techno club Florida 135 in Fraga, Huesca. Equally important are his recent El Row residencies during the summer season in Privilege Ibiza -in 2012 and 2013- and Space Ibiza in 2014. De la Swing is that type of non-conformist artist which lives in a continuous sound evolution, where the depth, darkness and fun are always present in his sets and throughout which he shows his creativity and innovation on stage, driving his passion and vibrancy to create a different story every time, while establishing a unique connection with the crowd. While in the studio, De la Swing is a solid and fertile mind being in charge of different labels as Elrow Music, Florida Music & Ker Recordings, having also produced and remixed for labels like Form, Drakos Recordings and Amazing Lab. However, his skills and abilities go further on. We can also enjoy its more underground side with his aka \u2018Smoke Signal\u2019, usually as resident in Ker Club Barcelona once a month, sharing his talent with artists such as Martinez Brothers, Art Department, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Seth Troxler, Scuba or Los Suruba.

Even fans may be surprised to realize it\u2019s the first full-length solo album from one of brightest and busiest stars in her recent years amid the folk/Americana/independent country music scene.\n\nAn artist of singular talent and restless creativity, she broke into the Texas country/folk scene as one of the co-lead vocalists of the Gougers before the band gradually gave way to not only Wilson's solo work (the fine EP \"Dirty Blonde Hair\" was released in 2010) but also higher-profile musical adventures with The Trishas, an all-female singer-songwriter band that has toured through some of the state and nation's best venues. Scoring one of the best albums of 2012 with \"High Wide & Handsome,\u201d the Trishas lit up the genre for a few years while always leaving Wilson room for solo gigs, guest spots on over a dozen albums by now, and song-swaps with like-minded artists all over Texas and beyond.\n\nBoth deeply personal and solidly collaborative, Holidays & Wedding Rings is an evident labor of love from the sort of songwriter who can delve into the sweetness of family life without hitting sap. Someone who can dig into heartache without wallowing in it, go slow and subtle and still leave a listener rapt.

The hours she spent rifling through vinyl in the warehouse of Chemical Records, where Sam once worked as a house buyer, gives her an insurmountable understanding of the genre. Having played nearly every club in Ibiza \u2013 including residencies at Ushuaia, Amnesia and Sankeys \u2013 and landed at top-end festivals, there are few who can offer a house music education like Sam Divine. Last year, she racked up over a hundred gigs and is well on track to exceed that in 2017, having already hit up the likes of Europe, North America and Asia. And her reputation for energising a dancefloor has been acknowledged by her inclusion in Pete Tong\u2019s Selector Series for Radio 1. A late starter, Sam took up DJing at 21 \u2013 learning to mix in her mum\u2019s garden shed. Her breakthrough came soon after with a DJ competition and landed her first residency at a club in Weston-super-Mare, where she was also the main booker, while also working in record stores. In 2005, after swapping Bristol for Ibiza, Sam became a vital component of San Antonio\u2019s west end (where this year she makes a triumphant return as a resident for Defected at Eden) and has spent every season on the White Isle ever since. During this time, Divine also began working with Defected, who in 2009 signed her to their artist roster. A weekly warm-up at Mambo ensued, opening for legendary names like Kenny Dope and Frankie Knuckles, as well as hosting the weekly Defected Radio show that currently holds the #2 spot on iTunes in the UK Music Podcasts chart. The real turning point, however, came when she played We Are FSTVL in 2013. \u201cI dropped a mix the night before and everyone went mad for it; the tent went from nothing to one-in-one-out within half an hour,\u201d she explains. \u201cAfter that, the bookings just went nuts.\u201d With her tireless work ethic, this summer, Sam will play Tomorrowland, Eastern Electrics, Defected Croatia, SW4, and Creamfields. This year also marks the 10-year anniversary of La Vita, the annual DJ charity night that she helped to launch and has so far raised \u00a335,000 for Breast Cancer Research. Sam also launched her own label D-Vine Sounds back in 2015, which this year she will showcase with a stage at We Are FSTVL, dates in Ibiza and a boat party at Defected Croatia. Recently, Sam has also begun to flirt with production; her first major release, a remix of garage anthem \u2018Flowers\u2019 with production partner Curtis Gabriel, hit #1 on both Traxsource and Beatport. Last year\u2019s \u2018Confessions\u2019 was her first release on Defected, while her \u2018Sam Divine In The House\u2019 compilation featured further productions and went #1 on iTunes\u2019 Dance chart. This summer she dropped \u2018In Da Nation\u2019 EP with Cassimm on DFTD. Sam Divine\u2019s work ethic has seen her more than earn her stripes on the scene. A dedicated army of fans now spreads across the globe as her uplifting house sets captivate audiences everywhere she takes to the booth.

It was at the age of 15 that Carl bought a set of turntables and began working as a mobile DJ. Disco was the first music that captivated him but by the early 80s Cox had moved on to playing the same music as other young London DJs \u2013 rare groove, New York hip-hop and electro. He was perfectly placed to hear Chicago house music in its earliest forms, and when the epic 'Acid Trax' by Phuture (a.k.a. DJ Pierre) came out in early '87. \u201cIt was then that I thought, 'This is it,\u2019 says Carl. \u201cI would do my parties, and I'd play old rare groove and hip hop and soul and I would say 'Right you've got to hear this Phuture track\u2019 and people would just stop and listen.\u201d As a founder of the sound, Carl rode the exploding British rave scene. He played the opening night of Danny Rampling's legendary Shoom, co-promoted The Project with Paul Oakenfold, where he also DJ\u2019d and did the sound system. He held a residency at the Zap Club in Brighton and at the Sunrise rave in 1988, hooked up a third turntable for his dawn-breaking set, got 15,000 people back on their feet, and established a personal rep for three-deck wizardry. The next step was to make music, and Carl's 1991 debut single for Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto label, 'I Want You,' reached Number 23 in the national UK charts and gave Carl his first Top of the Pops appearance. Two more singles also made the charts. But Carl was a reluctant pop star and as the masses moved onto fluffy house and trance, and the hardcore created jungle, Cox retreated into the club world that had nurtured him, and instead embraced the underground sounds of techno. \"Techno drives home somewhere,\" he says of his core music. \"It takes you to an element of surprise, not knowing where you're going. It's scary but wonderful at the same time.\" Carl\u2019s classic releases include his 1995 mix CD, 'F.A.C.T,' which became a techno benchmark, selling over 250,000 copies, and the 1996 EP 'Two Paintings and a Drum,' which again broke the British top 30. Alongside Carl\u2019s \u2018Ultimate Music Management\u2019 company, which counted Josh Wink and Laurent Garnier among 27 clients, there was the Ultimatum record label, for which Carl recorded his third top 30 UK single, 'Sensual Sophis-ti-cat.' In 2005, Carl\u2019s third album, \u2018The Second Sign\u2019 caused a stir across Europe and reached number 3 in Spain\u2019s national chart. Also gaining critical acclaim was \u2018Dirty Bass,\u2019 a collaboration with Christian Smith, and the funky \u2018Give Me Your Love\u2019, both released on 23rd Century Records, an outlet for his own burgeoning production output. Carl formed his own label, Intec Records, in 1999, scoring a series of underground hits and enjoying eight years at the forefront of electronic music. After its closure in 2006, Carl was still inundated with new music, finally deciding to re-launch the label as Intec Digital at the start of 2010. It\u2019s been a triumphant return, thanks to exclusives from some of the biggest names in techno. \u201cThe label couldn\u2019t be going better,\u201d says Carl. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be back at the helm discovering underground DJs.\u201d Intec Digital was also the home for Carl\u2019s 6th studio album, \u2018All Roads Lead To the Dancefloor,\u2019 released to critical acclaim in 2011 on state-of-the-art, self-updating USB technology. In 2013 Carl re-launched his seminal Pure Intec series, 9 years after the hugely successful original \u2018Pure Intec.\u2019 The release also coincided with the launch of a new series of Intec club nights where Carl played to a sold out XOYO in East London. Since then Intec have continued to hold regular parties across the world, including sell outs in Ibiza, Madrid, Switzerland, Amsterdam for ADE, and London\u2019s fabric. And of course Carl\u2019s name cannot be mentioned without Ibiza. His legendary Ibiza residency at Space came to an end in 2016, after an unbelievable 15 consecutive years. Since 2001 Carl helped establish Space as one of the biggest clubs in the world. With carefully thought out line ups, and as much emphasis on new talent as big names, Carl always strived to keep his night at the forefront of Ibiza clubbing making it one of the most successful residencies in Ibiza history. Starting out in 2001 with just 6 nights, his residency grew and adapted as the club did, so for Carl it was only right to end his residency as Space itself closed its doors. And what a way to go out. Carl\u2019s final 15 week season was his biggest ever, with every single night selling out, heralded by fans and critics alike as a triumphant finale to a piece of dance history. Following the end of his Ibiza residency Carl also decided to say goodbye to his record breaking weekly Global Radio show, which he\u2019d been broadcasting for nearly 16 years. When the final show aired in February 2017, the show was reaching a staggering 17-million weekly listeners worldwide, syndicated across over 60 terrestrial FM, satellite and DAB stations throughout 35 countries. \u201cIt was a hard decision as I loved every minute of creating my Global shows\u201d said Carl at the time. \u201cBut all things must come to an end at some point and it was time to focus on new ventures.\u201d And focus on new ventures he has\u2026. Carl continues to be one of most in demand DJs on the planet, with club dates and festival appearances across the world. After 12 years delivering his Carl Cox & Friends stage at Ultra, Carl is now proud to be ambassador for the Resistance parties, for Ultra worldwide. He also now has his own festival, Pure \u2013 which he initially launched in Australia in 2016. It returned this year with even more dates, including Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Auckland, his Pure brand is something he\u2019s keen to expand on and he\u2019s already taking it global. Summer 2017 saw Carl return to Ibiza with Pure Carl Cox \u2013 two sold out parties at super club Privilege. Built on the idea of taking things back to basics, Carl put the music first and foremost for some no nonsense, no frills house and techno parties \u2013 heralded by many as a highlight of the summer.

An important purveyor of international, underground house and techno, Saved has become a global brand, renowned for cutting-edge releases and standout events around the globe. In early 2014 Saved celebrated their 100th release.

Over the last couple of years, the man originally turned on to the dance by Derrick Carter has fomented his own groove driven, emotive brand of house that now resonates around the world. Turning heads right from the off were his compilations on Deep Down and Defected, which found Sonny adding his remix flair to a bunch of classics, and after that came sophomore effort After Parties & Aeroplanes. Again a collaborative affair featuring the likes of Doorly, Gene Farris and Cajmere, it was a more jacking, sharp-edged treat designed for maximum dance floor impact, but was also stuffed with unforgettable vocals that agin saw Sonny stepping up his game.\n\n2016 saw the already influential artist stepping up yet again, this time by making his brilliant entry into the hallowed Defected In the House series. His standout contribution is a terrific three disc affair that is jam packed with his own stellar originals and remixes as well as some brand new and exclusive material (including Sonny Fodera ft. Alex Mills \u2013 \u2018Always Gonna Be,\u2019 Sonny Fodera ft. Shannon Saunders \u2018Over This\u2019 and \u2018The Definition\u2019 amongst many others). Aside from that high impact work, Sonny has also turned out a consistently excellent string of EPs on labels like Defected, Dirtybird and Visionquest, as well as remixing Rudimental. Never was he in finer form that with \u2018Let Go\u2019, a collaboration with Cervendos that sat pretty in the Beatport Deep House Top 10 for no fewer than 12 weeks in 2014, whilst more recently, his current single with Yasmin, \u2018Feelin U\u2019 shot straight in to the 2nd spot in the Beatport chart, only to be outdone by a stunning remix of Gershon Jackson on the legendary Strictly Rhythm label. As such, Sony currently has no fewer than six releases in the Beatport Deep House Top Ten, proving that he is very much creating the sounds of now for DJs and dancers everywhere.\n\nAs a result, of course, Sonny is a hugely in demand DJ who started 2016 with a 30 date tour of the UK, United States and Australia. It was his smooth technical skills in the booth that first won him the affections of Green Velvet, and nowadays he weaves his tight, seductive sets featuring all colours of the house spectrum everywhere from Footwork Toronto to Warung in Brazil, Cielo in New York City to Pacha, Sankeys, Amnesia DC10 and in Ibiza as well as We ARE FSTVL and many others.\n\nThe future is just as bright as the past for Sonny, who was born in Adelaide, Australia, and has lived between there, Ibiza, the USA and the UK since, though he is currently settled in London. It means he is fully focussed on the next chapter, which already promises to be a thrilling one for his fans, with a new album due on Defected \u2018Frequently Flying\u2019 , as well as more EPs on influential labels like Cajual and Lee Foss\u2019s highly anticipated new imprint, Repoulate Mars.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Wehbba ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8725741.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Techno", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Electronic Music Artist\nhttp://twitter.com/wehbba\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/wehbba\nManagement:\nleticia@vanriel.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Roberto Surace ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "CAAL ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gaty Lopez ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10390200.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Tech House, Friends, Electronic", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Gaty Lopez started his DJ career in 1989, working on many radios and clubs.

Over the past 5 years De La Swing has shared turntables with different top level Djs as Marco Carola, Loco Dice, Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Laurent Garnier, Joseph Capriati, Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch, Paco Osuna or Vitalic among others, and has played at festivals like Monegros Desert Festival (Spain), Eastern Electric Festival (London), Kingsday Madness (Holland), We are Together (Marseille), Plages Electroniques (Cannes), Ultra Cape Town/Johannesburg & Origin Festival (South Africa), resulting rapidly a well-known and familiar Dj in countries as Spain, France, Italy and Holland. Since 2010 this Madrid born is one of the emblematic ElRow residents, the after hour based in the ever growing electronic hub of Barcelona, that has become one of the best clubs worldwide, brainchild of the organisers of Europe's only desert festival, Monegros, and owners of the acclaimed techno club Florida 135 in Fraga, Huesca. Equally important are his recent El Row residencies during the summer season in Privilege Ibiza -in 2012 and 2013- and Space Ibiza in 2014. De la Swing is that type of non-conformist artist which lives in a continuous sound evolution, where the depth, darkness and fun are always present in his sets and throughout which he shows his creativity and innovation on stage, driving his passion and vibrancy to create a different story every time, while establishing a unique connection with the crowd.

After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece. Majestic is also opening for the Prodigy as part of his festival looks with Kiss FM UK.\n\nSo with the Majestic message travelling fast, hyping the crowd into a frenzy, Majestic takes on the role of grand puppeteer, from waiving lighters in the air to chanting back at the DJ, his commands are dutifully followed and quite a sight to behold. Through years of hard graft, quite literally behind the scene, Majestic has studied the sound of the underground for well over a decade. Majestic is realising his destiny as one of the biggest talents to come out of the UK underground scene, infinitely more than just the best live MC in the game.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "KAMAUU ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9696023.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "From the present moment.", "otherInfo": "Live on Instagram"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Laurie Berkner Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8451562.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Laurie Berkner - lead vocals, guitar; Susie Lampert - keyboardpiano, vocals; Brady Rymer - bass, vocals; Bobby Golden - percussion and drums", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"The Queen of Children's Music\" - People Magazine\n\nWhen Laurie Berkner embarked on her career as a children's recording artist in the summer of 1997, she started small - personally filling orders of her first release (Whaddaya Think of That?) from her living room in Manhattan while still keeping up her preschool music teaching jobs. It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label. Two Tomatoes moved into a real office in New York City, with real staff including Shannon Chirone, John Waldman (Great Knight Productions), Corinne Barlow, Katie Messer, Michelle Puskas, Justice Longshore, and publicist Elizabeth Waldman Frazier.\n\nIt's one big happy family!", "otherInfo": "Laurie Berkner is doing daily Facebook lives during the COVID-19 school and community closures.

But not every artist gets asked by their heroes to join\nthem, as artists, on their stage. It's a compliment that Jacob Moon keeps getting from the\nmusicians who have inspired him since he started as a singer-songwriter out in Hamilton,\nOntario. Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "A different theme every day!

Not only a nod of approval from three of the most influential organisations in the business but an injection of funds at a crucial point to go towards further recordings. Their touring stepped up a notch in 2016 with some key look shows, playing alongside the likes of Carl Cox at his infamous Space residency, continued support from Ushuaia\u2019s notorious ANTS as well as support from Nic Fanciulli\u2019s Social Festival. Further highlights saw Eli & Fur play at Woogie Weekend, Los Angeles, Manchester\u2019s The Warehouse Project, Berlin\u2019s Kraftwerk and Circoloco\u2019s first ever event in Los Angeles. As we go into 2017 off the back of an incredible few years, Eli & Fur immediately step into the Red Bull Studios London. A once in a life time opportunity for the girls to take over the residency room in London\u2019s HQ & invite some of the most exciting writers & producers to collaborate with them on their first album. If that weren\u2019t enough\u2026 their touring takes them to Hard\u2019s fun packed Holy Ship, Carl Cox\u2019s stage at this years Ultra Music Festival as well as a spot on the worlds most talk about music festival, Coachella.

Labels like Schematic in Miami, Interdimensional Transmissions from Detroit & Viewlexx out of The Hague set the foundation for Daze. Daniel Gomez adopted his Daze moniker early on at his mother\u2019s suggestion. Practicing on a set-up she bought him, Daze was spinning at weddings by age 14, funneling his earnings into vinyl to play raves on the side. That eventually led to producing his first tracks in 2004 on a cracked version of Fruity Loops and later that year, he jumpstarted a electro / techno white label called Omniamm. Daze\u2019s risk-taking & punk approach is at the core of everything he does and it\u2019s a big part of the ethos of his current label, Omnidisc. \"We're not searching for chart topping hits. We\u2019re more interested in curating a catalog of music you\u2019ll remember when you walk out the door. We seek out tracks that are as raw as possible & welcome imperfections. We love the charm of an unpolished record\u201d, says Daze. It\u2019s also this freeform & experimental approach together with an element of surprise that sets him apart from the pack as both a DJ & Producer. As a DJ, he prefers to express his versatility across long sets. He is known to cut & weave from Electro to Techno into Italo Disco, into a record by Yazoo deliberately intended to provoke a reaction. \u201cI once played a Paula Abdul record at Berghain\u2026 basically, it\u2019s like it or leave it,\u201d says Daze. As a producer, his output ranges from releases on Kompakt\u2019s Speicher series, to remixes on Phantasy, Comeme, Monkeytown & more\u2026 but he also reaches far beyond techno & has created original runway soundtracks for award winning American streetwear designer John Elliott & the Australian brand Song for the Mute. \"I\u2019m obsessed with the detailed manipulation of audio. It\u2019s at the core of how I make music & I constantly feel the need to involve myself with projects that challenge & allow me to think out of the box... whether it\u2019s creating a single recognizable noise for the new MacBook, or an advert for a fashion campaign blending original music with sound design,\u201d says Daze. Danny Daze\u2019s radical approach to preserving music\u2019s integrity while breaking its boundaries may seem volatile, but it\u2019s not random. \u201cI\u2019ve always gone against the grain & it\u2019s important for everything I do to feel authentic.

They were vibrant, priapic, anthemic and focused. As they showed on a three-track demo, and on the subsequent debut single for independent label Neat (\u2018Roll The Dice\u2019/\u2019Love Xs Love\u2019), they were more than mere Def Leppard slaves. In fact, the Pettin\u2019 had an international sound that owed something to AC/DC, UFO, Thin Lizzy and Foreigner, but also had its own raging momentum.\n\nNot that the band found the road straightforward. But, thanks to a work ethic that took them around the country, plus a valuable session for Radio 1\u2019s prestigious \u2018Friday Rock Show\u2019, the band eventually landed a crucial deal with the major label Polydor Records. Moreover, their 1983 debut album (\u2018Lettin\u2019 Loose\u2019) was co-produced by the creative Mack together with Queen guitarist Brian May. Now, that\u2019s pedigree.\n\nAmazingly, that album has survived more than 20 years of high-speed hi-tech developments intact. While other, more celebrated records have dated badly, \u2018Lettin\u2019 Loose\u2019 re-affirms the belief back then that the Pettin\u2019 would follow Leppard to big time stature. What went wrong at the time has little to do with the band, or lack of ambition/talent.\n\nIn America, where they should have broken big long before Bon Jovi gave Love A Bad Name, they were held back by the label\u2019s insistence on an anaemic re-mix (as well as a title change to \u2018Heavy Pettin\u2019, which caused more confusion than anything else). If the band\u2019s essential, vital British brio had been left as conceived in the first place, who knows what might have been achieved. Still, a slot on the bill for the 1983 Reading Festival, the day that Black Sabbath infamously headlined when fronted by Ian Gillan, did them no harm and touring with Kiss, Ozzy, and Motley Crue helped the quintet\u2019s progress.\n\nTwo years later, the Pettin\u2019 return to the studio, this time with producer Mark Dearnley (who\u2019d worked with AC/DC and Krokus). The result? \u2018Rock Ain\u2019t Dead\u2019, which surprised many with a slicker yet conversely tougher approach. The lads really had progressed, although ironically if things had gone to plan, this would have been produced by Lance Quinn, of Bon Jovi and Lita Ford fame. However, just hours before the band were due to fly to Philadelphia, to work with Quinn at his Warehouse Studios, the decision was taken by PolyGram (to whom both Heavy Pettin and Bon Jovi were signed in the US) that, instead, he should start work immediately on what was to be Jovi\u2019s second record, \u20187800 Degrees Fahrenheit\u2019.\n\nPerhaps then, it should have been obvious that record company politics were to scupper Pettin in the crucial American market. Despite continuing to show up well in the UK, once again the US was to prove elusive \u2013 through no fault of the five musicians. In many respects, this was the point when the writing was scrawled over every available wall space. Regardless of their obvious determination and grassroots support in Britain, it seemed as if Pettin\u2019s realistic chance of significant international success had gone. A third album, \u2018The Big Bang\u2019, was released by FM Revolver in 1989. Although it still proved this lot were way ahead of so many others who were selling truckloads of units and getting acclaim from the media; as the 1980s faded into memory, so too did Heavy Pettin\u2019.\n\nDriven by a desire, a passion and a capacity simply to invoke the magic and rapport the band enjoyed, they released Prodigal Songs in 2007. The album was well-received by their loyal fans and the limited pressing sold out making it a highly sought-after collector\u2019s item.\n\nIn 2017, original members Hamie, Punky, and Gordon joined by Jez Parry on bass and Michael Ivory on drums performed for the first time in 25 years at Scotland\u2019s Winter Storm. Reinvigorated, Heavy Pettin, now joined by ex-Gun guitarist Dave Aitken due to Punky hanging up his guitar and going into retirement, did several shows in 2018 including a 6 date UK tour, with 3 sold-out gigs in Nottingham, London and Edinburgh, as well as 2 sold-out headline gigs in Milton Keynes and Glasgow.\n\nThe 2019 Heavy Pettin\u2019 assault started in North Wales with HRH AOR Festival, then off to Germany\u2019s Headbangers Open Air Festival in July, and Aug/Sept tour including The Golden Age of Rock Festival Belgium, with Dee Snider and Angel, plus a mainland British tour with RockGoddess.\n\nHeavy Pettin\u2019 is currently finishing 2019 recording and mixing a new Independent EP, \u20184 Play\u2019 for mid-February fan release.on their Facebook site.\nTrack Listing :\n1.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cordovas ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9577041.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Lucca Soria, Sevans Henderson, Joe Firstman, Toby Weaver", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Rooted in triple-stacked harmonies, southern storytelling, and cosmic country twang, Cordovas create their own version of American roots-rock with That Santa Fe Channel.\n\nThe album marks the band's ATO Records debut, arriving after more than a half-decade's worth of international touring, communal living, and shared songwriting sessions. It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Norman Brannon ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Silver Shine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8079422.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Punk Rock And Roll, Rockabilly, Psychobilly, Punkabilly, Punk Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Silver Shine is a Hungarian rock band that has been around since 2004.

You\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhy should I care about The Urban Voodoo Machine? They\u2019ve been around for ages, haven\u2019t they? Aren\u2019t they a novelty band who wears funny make-up? Don\u2019t they sometimes play jazz? Aren\u2019t half of them dead or something?\u201d\n\nSo bear with us, sunshine, cos you clearly need educating.\n\nThe story starts with Paul-Ronney Angel, a man with a double-barrelled first name. I could be a wanker about this and say the story starts with Bon Scott-era AC/DC \u2013 with Tom Waits, or the Clash, Louis Armstrong, the Pogues, the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, Johnny Cash, Lionel Bart or Bertolt Brecht \u2013 but let\u2019s stick with Paul-Ronney, it\u2019s quicker.\n\nPaul-Ronney Angel ate his parents and fled the fjords of Norway with just a bottle of moonshine and several slices of decomposing fish in his back pocket. (Before he left they tried him in the Norwegian Army \u2013 he lasted a total of five hours.)\n\nAfter that, Angel washed up in London during the dying breaths of Thatcherism and took advantage of all that swinging London had to offer: he sold The Big Issue, busked Johnny Thunders & Robert Johnson numbers in Soho bus stops and played guitar for anyone who\u2019d have him.\n\nThe Urban Voodoo Machine came to him in 2002 as a fully-formed idea. He\u2019d lead a band who\u2019d play \u2018Bourbon Soaked Gypsy Blues Bop\u2019n\u2019Stroll\u2019. They\u2019d dress in black and red. There would be a LOT of them. And their music would sound like a great night out in a dangerous part of town. From the get-go, The UVM fused junkyard blues and stinging rockabilly with mariachi horns, fiddles, sinister cabaret and punk rock tangos. \u201cI wanted to play rock\u2019n\u2019roll music with a different instrumentation,\u201d says Angel, \u201ctaking inspiration from everything from delta blues, latin and gypsy music without losing the spirit and attitude of punk.\u201d His lyrics \u2013 part Lemmy, part Bob Dylan \u2013 made other (more acclaimed) songwriters sound totally. Fucking. Boring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not Americana and were definitely not \u2018retro\u2019,\u201d says Angel. \u201cI write songs about living in London right now. Although having a shit time, no money, heartbreak, mental illness, addiction and suppression from the big guy is kinda universal and timeless, I guess\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah-yeah-yeah,\u201d you\u2019re thinking, \u201cbut can they cut it live?\u201d Well, there\u2019s a reason why they\u2019ve played Glastonbury, Download, Latitude, Bestival, Hard Rock Calling and toured with The Pogues and New York Dolls. With an act honed alongside the burlesque dancers, snake-charmers and fire-eaters they call friends, The UVM have become one of the greatest live acts in the country \u2013 terrifyingly bizarre, hysterically funny; a riot for the eyes and sensation for the ears: a sing-a-long, drink-a-long, clap-a-long affair.\n\nIn 2006 they launched the Gypsy Hotel Club in the then-unfashionable part of London\u2019s East End, Dalston, a monthly Bourbon Soaked Snake Charmin\u2019 Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Cabaret night for likeminded misfits, movers and shakers. Time Out Magazine wrote, \u201cIf you have 12 hours to live, spend it at Gypsy Hotel!\u201d\n\nMagazines and newspapers have lauded them for their \u201cmariachi-influenced blues, whiskey-soaked country rags and punkabilly-style rave-ups\u201d (The Washington Post) and noted that they\u2019re \u201cdrawing deep from a dirty well where Tom Waits, Nick Cave and Dick Dale are enjoying a burlesque all-nighter with Ennio Morricone\u201d (Classic Rock). They became one of the few bands that could appear on Clive Anderson\u2019s Loose Ends on BBC Radio 4 and Britain\u2019s biggest heavy metal festival Download in the same year and win at both.\n\nIn 2014, when Paul-Ronney named their third album Love, Drink & Death! he had no idea what the year had in store. In October, fiddle-player Rob Skipper died of an accidental heroin overdose, aged just 28. Guitarist Nick Marsh (formerly frontman of Flesh For Lulu) fought throat cancer throughout that year. He died in June 2015, aged 53. The Voodoo Machine transformed themselves into a New Orleans-style marching band for his funeral. The Urban Voodoo Machine Marching Band also played the Classic Rock Awards that year \u2013 the only band to do so without electricity.\n\nAnd that brings us to new album Hellbound Hymns. Marsh plays on eight of its 13 songs. (Angel: \u201cHe was really putting the hours in when he knew the cancer had come back.

You\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhy should I care about The Urban Voodoo Machine? They\u2019ve been around for ages, haven\u2019t they? Aren\u2019t they a novelty band who wears funny make-up? Don\u2019t they sometimes play jazz? Aren\u2019t half of them dead or something?\u201d\n\nSo bear with us, sunshine, cos you clearly need educating.\n\nThe story starts with Paul-Ronney Angel, a man with a double-barrelled first name. I could be a wanker about this and say the story starts with Bon Scott-era AC/DC \u2013 with Tom Waits, or the Clash, Louis Armstrong, the Pogues, the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, Johnny Cash, Lionel Bart or Bertolt Brecht \u2013 but let\u2019s stick with Paul-Ronney, it\u2019s quicker.\n\nPaul-Ronney Angel ate his parents and fled the fjords of Norway with just a bottle of moonshine and several slices of decomposing fish in his back pocket. (Before he left they tried him in the Norwegian Army \u2013 he lasted a total of five hours.)\n\nAfter that, Angel washed up in London during the dying breaths of Thatcherism and took advantage of all that swinging London had to offer: he sold The Big Issue, busked Johnny Thunders & Robert Johnson numbers in Soho bus stops and played guitar for anyone who\u2019d have him.\n\nThe Urban Voodoo Machine came to him in 2002 as a fully-formed idea. He\u2019d lead a band who\u2019d play \u2018Bourbon Soaked Gypsy Blues Bop\u2019n\u2019Stroll\u2019. They\u2019d dress in black and red. There would be a LOT of them. And their music would sound like a great night out in a dangerous part of town. From the get-go, The UVM fused junkyard blues and stinging rockabilly with mariachi horns, fiddles, sinister cabaret and punk rock tangos. \u201cI wanted to play rock\u2019n\u2019roll music with a different instrumentation,\u201d says Angel, \u201ctaking inspiration from everything from delta blues, latin and gypsy music without losing the spirit and attitude of punk.\u201d His lyrics \u2013 part Lemmy, part Bob Dylan \u2013 made other (more acclaimed) songwriters sound totally. Fucking. Boring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not Americana and were definitely not \u2018retro\u2019,\u201d says Angel. \u201cI write songs about living in London right now. Although having a shit time, no money, heartbreak, mental illness, addiction and suppression from the big guy is kinda universal and timeless, I guess\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah-yeah-yeah,\u201d you\u2019re thinking, \u201cbut can they cut it live?\u201d Well, there\u2019s a reason why they\u2019ve played Glastonbury, Download, Latitude, Bestival, Hard Rock Calling and toured with The Pogues and New York Dolls. With an act honed alongside the burlesque dancers, snake-charmers and fire-eaters they call friends, The UVM have become one of the greatest live acts in the country \u2013 terrifyingly bizarre, hysterically funny; a riot for the eyes and sensation for the ears: a sing-a-long, drink-a-long, clap-a-long affair.\n\nIn 2006 they launched the Gypsy Hotel Club in the then-unfashionable part of London\u2019s East End, Dalston, a monthly Bourbon Soaked Snake Charmin\u2019 Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Cabaret night for likeminded misfits, movers and shakers. Time Out Magazine wrote, \u201cIf you have 12 hours to live, spend it at Gypsy Hotel!\u201d\n\nMagazines and newspapers have lauded them for their \u201cmariachi-influenced blues, whiskey-soaked country rags and punkabilly-style rave-ups\u201d (The Washington Post) and noted that they\u2019re \u201cdrawing deep from a dirty well where Tom Waits, Nick Cave and Dick Dale are enjoying a burlesque all-nighter with Ennio Morricone\u201d (Classic Rock). They became one of the few bands that could appear on Clive Anderson\u2019s Loose Ends on BBC Radio 4 and Britain\u2019s biggest heavy metal festival Download in the same year and win at both.\n\nIn 2014, when Paul-Ronney named their third album Love, Drink & Death! he had no idea what the year had in store. In October, fiddle-player Rob Skipper died of an accidental heroin overdose, aged just 28. Guitarist Nick Marsh (formerly frontman of Flesh For Lulu) fought throat cancer throughout that year. He died in June 2015, aged 53. The Voodoo Machine transformed themselves into a New Orleans-style marching band for his funeral. The Urban Voodoo Machine Marching Band also played the Classic Rock Awards that year \u2013 the only band to do so without electricity.\n\nAnd that brings us to new album Hellbound Hymns. Marsh plays on eight of its 13 songs. (Angel: \u201cHe was really putting the hours in when he knew the cancer had come back. He was like, \u2018Right, these might be my last recordings with this band, so let\u2019s roll the tape and make it a good one!\u201d) To borrow one of the song titles, it\u2019s all mixed-up.

It\u2019s hard to tell where one ends and the other begins with traveled Orlando musician Beth McKee. But these days, that separation matters less and less.\n\nBETH MCKEE\nMusician Beth McKee is the gestalt of all the places she\u2019s settled. From her native Mississippi where she learned the blues firsthand from Malaco Records session musicians to her immersion in the scenes of Austin, New Orleans, North Carolina, and now Orlando \u2013 all their musical terroir is in her sound. But those influences, too, have become less distinct in the distillation of Beth\u2019s aesthetic. You\u2019ll recognize the hues if you really wanna parse it. But if you just listen, you\u2019ll hear a sound that is quintessentially Southern. It\u2019s tapped from the roots and rolls like honey. And that voice is rich and fortified but never has to peacock to show its easy radiance.\n\nA working pianist since she was 14, Beth McKee\u2019s identity really began when she moved to Austin, Texas. From the trenches of bars and blues bands, she was recruited by harmonica legend Greg \u201cFingers\u201d Taylor to join his band and embarked on a tour opening for Jimmy Buffett. Afterwards, Beth moved to New Orleans to join noted \u201890s bayou-country band Evangeline, which was discovered and signed by Buffett to his Margaritaville Records label. She released two albums with Evangeline before setting out to make her own mark.\n\nBeth\u2019s solo career has spanned this decade with several albums, including a 2010 tribute to Louisiana music icon Bobby Charles (I\u2019m That Way). The legend himself was so impressed with her interpretations of his songs that she was invited to sing with him on his own record Timeless, the last before his death. \u201cBobby Charles mastered simplicity and universal truth in his songs; Beth was his favorite interpreter of the bared-soul truth his songs communicated,\u201d says Jim Bateman, Charles\u2019 longtime manager. \u201cEverything she does taps into that universal thread that everyone understands without thinking.\u201d\n\nIn addition to touring and coordinating the Swamp Sistas, Beth mentors songwriters, conducts songwriting clinics as musical \u201cinformances\u201d at various Southern universities, and hosts a songwriters series in Orlando to showcase homegrown and visiting talent, as well as road-test her own material.\n\nSWAMP SISTAS\nWhile her records are slices of soul, Beth McKee\u2019s energy has progressively become more oversoul. As the founding principal of Swamp Sistas, she mobilizes an ever-growing alliance of over 2,700 creative and active Southern women that\u2019s inclusive of all age and genre (members include legends like Janis Ian and Dorothy Moore and next-gen rising stars like Sarah Shook and E-Turn). More relevant than ever, the Swamp Sistas support not just each other but their home communities at large. Artistically, they collaborate, mentor, and perform in the Swamp Sistas Songwriter Circle. Philanthropically, they organize and perform to raise money and awareness for targeted local causes and organizations like Second Harvest Food Bank in major events like the Swamp Sistas La Las, Beth\u2019s big reimagination of the traditional Creole house party.\n\nNEW ALBUM: DREAMWOOD ACRES\nReleasing 16 May 2018, Dreamwood Acres is produced by Mitch Easter prot\u00e9g\u00e9 John Pfiffner and features collaborators from the jangle-pop god\u2019s inner circle. The subtly lush album is a furtherance of Beth McKee\u2019s signature of roots music that rides the idyllic backroads of soul, gospel, blues, folk, pop, and rock. Here, she steps even further out with some newer indie threads (\u201cResurrection Mary,\u201d \u201cIn Between the Lines\u201d).\n\nBeth herself says, \u201cdreamwood acres could be from any place \u2013 from a summer camp to a cemetery, suburb or a sanitarium \u2013 and this record runs that gamut. I just let the songs go wherever they wanted. Let\u2019s call it free-range music.\u201d It\u2019s a golden Southern kaleidoscope that\u2019s emotionally embracing and smolderingly smooth.

He started writing tunes around that time. Later he studied music at the Conservatory in Cologne and also took classes with creative masters such as Dave Holland, Steve Coleman, Muhal Richard Abrams, George Lewis, and Steve Lacy.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2009, he lived in Amsterdam where he became part of that city\u2019s internationally renowned improvised music scene.\nSince 2002, he has been touring internationally with the trio Kaufmann/Gratkowski/de Joode, an improvising unit which has released four CDs so far, to much critical acclaim.\n\nIn the late \u201890s and \u201800s, Achim led two groups with reed player Michael Moore: trio kamosc and gueuledeloup quartet.\nIn 2007, he recorded kyrill, a set of compositions for piano trio featuring Valdi Kolli and Jim Black. Their follow-up cd, entitled verivyr, was released in 2011.\n\nHe has also collaborated with his wife, poet/painter Gabriele Guenther, on the audiodrama Borderline \u2013 From the Shadows of a Journey, and has written music for various chamber ensembles.\nIn his solo work, mixed techniques are used to create a fluctuating world of sounds and gestures. Resonance and reverberation, space and density play an important role in both his solo and ensemble work.\n\nSince his move to Berlin, he got involved in various new projects, such as the trio gr\u00fcnen with Robert Landfermann and Christian Lillinger, Oni Kramler (with Matthias Schubert, Antonio Borghini, and various guests), and a trio with cellist Okkyung Lee and trumpeter Axel D\u00f6rner.\n\nIn 2013, the sextet SKEIN (Kaufmann/Gratkowski/de Joode plus Richard Barrett, Okkyung Lee, and Tony Buck) had its premiere at the dOeK festival in Amsterdam and subsequently recorded for SWR radio.\n\nHe recently released duo albums with long-standing collaborators Michael Moore and Thomas Heberer.\n\nIn addition, Achim has played and/or recorded with Han Bennink, Mark Dresser, George Lewis, Steve Swallow, Tobias Delius, Wolter Wierbos, Mark Helias, Paul Rutherford, Thomas Lehn, Ab Baars, Paul Lovens, Dylan van der Schyff, Peggy Lee, Chris Speed, Tom\u00e1sz Stanko, Gerd Dudek, Bill Elgart, Paul Lytton, Harri Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Andrea Parkins, Harris Eisenstadt, Ingrid Laubrock, Tristan Honsinger, Shelley Hirsch, Steve Swell, Thomas Heberer, Urs Leimgruber, Roger Turner, Fay Victor, Fred Lonberg-Holm, John Hollenbeck, Bob Brookmeyer, Simon Nabatov, L\u00ea Quan Ninh, Gerry Hemingway, John H\u00e9bert, Al Foster, Adam Nussbaum, and many more.\n\nHe was awarded the German SWR Jazz Award in 2001, and the prestigious Albert Mangelsdorff award in 2015.\n\n\u201cFor many years, Achim Kaufmann has been one of the most inspiring and exciting personalities of the European jazz and improvisation scene. His music bears witness to great harmonic subtlety and structural depth. A brilliant pianist and composer, his reflected exploration of tradition has led him to a nuanced, contemporary sound language that encompasses poetry, energy and abstraction in equal measure.\u201d Julia Neupert, SWR Radio\n\nwww.achimkaufmann.com\n\nInto The Shed\nInto The Shed is a concert series focusing on presenting musicians who are all a part of the big and vibrant Berlin jazz and improvised music scene.

'Deleter' is the new track from Grouplove and it is an emergency opener. It's fueled by pounding keys, squalling guitar lines, and lightning drumming before the voice of Christian Zucconi questions everything around him: faith systems, his sense of belonging, communities, his own psyche. \u201cAll this time I thought you were a leader/It turns out you're only a deleter.\u201dIt could be interpreted as a political statement, but it's also highly personal. \u201cAll this time been burning with a fever / It turns out I've always been my healer,\u201dis also switched in as a rhyming line, and in the end sees Zucconi and his collaborator, wife and frontwoman Hannah Hooper realizing that amid every progression and every regression you always come back to yourself for the answers. They're already within you.\n\nToday in a cafe in their LA neighborhood of Silver Lake,the pair sit down as two people who have experienced and borne witness to a great deal of change, trauma and growth in the past three years. You may associate the band as a beacon for positivity and optimism. They're still a five-piece \u2013albeit with a new drummer in Ben Homola \u2013and at their core, remain a vessel for looking at the glass half full. Hence their opening sentiment: a rallying cry for tearing down false idols and building anew.\n\nAfter the band completed touring their 2016 album Big Mess, it all got tumultuous. Back in LA, Hannah had committed to taking some personal time to pursue an art show of her paintings. Just before theshow and before the band started writing again, they lost a dear friend. As Hannah painted,she felt connected to him, and was consumed by thoughts of death and the afterlife. All the while the left side of her body had started to feel out of her possession. \u201cIt felt like I was having a slow stroke,\u201d she recalls. She got an MRI to be safe. The day she finished painting the show, the results came through. The news was bad \u2013she needed brain surgery. \u201cWhat the fuck?! I just went white.\u201d\n\nWith Hannah's shocking news and the world outside feeling like it was in constant crisis, making music became the greatest remedy for the band and they started to write. They wrote more than they've ever written. Decamping to Northern California they worked in a way they never had before, experiencing a collective catharsis.\n\nThey made very aggressive grunge. \u201cIt felt good to scream,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cWe write music as a way to deal with good times or bad.\u201d The shows, the songsandthe writing took Hannah out of a state of constant freak-out. It didn\u2019t only help heal Hannah, but also helped heal Christian, who wasn't just a Buddha-like figure for Hannah and their young daughter but,was helping keep the band in productive spirits too.\n\nIn October 2018, the band \u2013 including Homola, guitarist Andrew Wessen and bassist Daniel Gleason \u2013 traveled to El Paso, Texas with esteemed producer Dave Sitek [of TV On The Radio] for a month. This was a shift for the band, who had previously worked almost entirely in house with founding member and former drummer/producer Ryan Rabin. Rabin left amicably prior to the band beginning work on this album. Sitek had heard 'Deleter' and loved it but he wanted to work with the band to veer away from their previous grunge-leanings. He wanted to take them outside the box and stretch them beyond what they had ever had to deal with. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cIt's like playing a sport with a new teammate. We just became better.\u201d\n\nWorking in Texas was a headtrip. \u201cWe had never recorded in a place where time did not exist, because it doesn\u2019t exist at Sonic Ranch if you don\u2019t want it to. We watched the sun rise every singleday, I had lost the concept of time,\u201d Andrewadds. Ben felt the same and helped set the scene in Texas: \u201cWe never missed a sunrise, listening back with the studio doors wide open, sitting around a tired fire surrounded by miles and miles of pecan trees. Hannah and I laughed uncontrollably, couldn\u2019t even produce words, couldn\u2019t stop crying -Were we happy or losing our minds? Haha I\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\nNot only did they learn new tricks, but Sitek encouraged them both to simplify their sound and to extend it. The songs they made during this period are so ambitious, that it pushed them to become a seven-piece band ontour. The limitations were gone. They were away from the world, immersed and unplugged in the middle of nowhere. They were also half a mile from the border and during the height of Trump's family separations crisis.\n\nBeing close to that inspired the song 'Promises.' \u201cNothing disappoints me like the news,\u201dsings Christian, taking into consideration his own experience as a father. \u201cYou're just following orders, closing your eyes and telling lies while they're taking our daughters.\u201d The track sounds like a paranoid futuristic Western.\n\n\u2018Youth\u2019 is an anthem reminding people never to forget their inner child. \u201cWhen we finished Youth a group of us drove to El Paso and went grocery shopping, bought fireworks, went to a guitar shop and stopped at a food stand. We had been up for 2 days. We looked insane, we felt insane & and it was insane. But I\u2019ll never forget how the song felt as we sped down the highway, Dave driving 150 mph, all of us just crammed in. I can literally picture it perfectly because I was so fucking proud of the song and couldn\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t exist 1/2 day before,\u201d Andrew recalls.\n\nSongs like \u2018Expectations\u2019 and \u2018Places\u2019speak to the more internal and personal friction many of us feel these days. \u2018Places\u2019line, \u201cthere\u2019s a place we\u2019re all running from, and we don\u2019t know how to get there,\u201d is Christian examining his experience in a constantly evolving world.\n\nWhen the band got back to LA, they got in the studio with a second producer \u2013Malay, famed for working with Frank Ocean and Lorde. They found themselves more prolific than ever, in an easier mode of creativity. Songs like \u2018Inside Out\u2019 were written and recorded in just a couple of days. Hannah remarks that the song reminds us that life is more beautiful the more honestlywe live it.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to collaborate with brilliant musical minds whose only agenda was to make honest and exciting music. It\u2019s what you hope for. Malay is the perfect example of someone who creates from his inner music fan,\u201d Dan recalls.\n\nHannah has always been the visual force for all of Grouplove\u2019s art, and in June 2019, she was given the opportunity to showcase her own paintings at the legendary artist Shepard Fairey\u2019s gallery. Now, post-surgery, she\u2019s still recovering. Butshe sees it as a gift; a way to connect with others.\n\nIt's been almost ten years since Grouplove met on a commune in Greece and brought the idea of themselves being a band back to California. They'd never have anticipated making it this far. Healer represents a re-birth and one that almost comes full circle to their initial idealism. \u201cWhen we all met in Greece, Christian and I were leaving New York at an all-time low. We just wanted to have a fun summer. We wanted to make art. And we're still doing that. We found that feeling again on this album, of hopelessness put into a medium of expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis album is us fighting for that feeling,\u201d says Hannah.\u201cThere's a darkness that's real and everyone deals with it at a certain point in their life. We\u2019re addressing that life is hard.We understand and we are going through it with you.\u201d\n\nGrouplove is: Hannah Hooper, Christian Zucconi, Andrew Wessen, Daniel Gleason, Benjamin Homola", "otherInfo": "Instagram Live & Chat"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Chi & Greg ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10351656.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Gregory Meyer, Chi Ko", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Chi & Greg are a Brooklyn-based duo made up of Chi Ko and Gregory Meyer.

Her introduction\nto jazz was the result of the fortuitous location of her upbringing, the village Samois\u00adsur\u00adSeine\u2014the\nsame place where legendary gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt had lived. Every June for decades,\ngypsies have descended upon Samois, setting up caravans in nearby meadows for the annual Django Reinhardt Festival. During those June nights many years ago, after her parents would fall asleep, a\nyoung, curious Aim\u00e9e would climb out her bedroom window and wander into the gypsy encampments.\nAim\u00e9e would sing by the fire with Django\u2019s descendents and began to fall in love with the gypsy way of\nlife\u2014scampering home before the sun rose. Explained Aim\u00e9e, \"I was hypnotized by gypsy music which\nmade me want to tap my feet\u037e music that swings makes me so happy.\"\nAs a teenager, Aim\u00e9e performed in various Parisian caf\u00e9s and clubs. When her family moved to\nSingapore, she remained in Paris to attend the American School of Modern Music. She also auditioned\nfor \"Star Academy,\" a kind of French \"American Idol.\" Selected to be one of 16 semi\u00adfinalists, Aim\u00e9e\nhad second thoughts when handed a contract that tied her up every which way for years\u2014including the\nsongs to sing. This was too much for her gypsy spirit\u2014so she quit. The French media so pursued\nAim\u00e9e, she sought refuge in her mother's homeland of the Dominican Republic.\nGiven it\u2019s proximity to New York City, Aim\u00e9e then opted to attend SUNY Purchase on a scholarship.\nShe discovered campus life as a freshman and Manhattan as a sophomore\u2014and her musical influences\ngrew in leaps and bounds.\nIn 2006, Aim\u00e9e organized a backpacking tour of Europe where she and musician friends played and\nsang on street corners. In 2007, the group targeted jazz festivals where they performed for food and\nlodging. On a whim, Aim\u00e9e entered the Montreux Jazz Voice Competition and won\u037e the prize included\nthe financing of a her first full\u00adlength recording, \"Cyrille Aim\u00e9e & The Surreal Band.\" Just months later\nanother surreal experience would follow: Aim\u00e9e found herself performing on a major European tour with\nthe French supergroup Caravan Palace\u2014filling\u00adin for their ailing lead vocalist.\nIn recent years Aim\u00e9e has toured in many different contexts and has created several self\u00adproduced\nrecordings, including duet projects with Brazilian guitarist Diego Figueiredo.

The Edmonton, Kentucky-based rock n\u2019 roll quartet Black Stone Cherry was raised on musical forefathers such as Cream, Led Zeppelin, Muddy Waters, and the Faces, among other 1970s staples, and, now, with its sixth album, Family Tree, BSC salutes its classic rock heritage and honors its legacy with a beast of a Southern rock n\u2019 roll album.\n\n\u201cWe caught divine intervention with this one,\u201d guitarist Ben Wells says with a good chuckle. \u201cWe hit a creative spark and tapped into a spirit and a fire we hadn\u2019t before.\u201d Drummer John Fred Young adds: \u201cFamily Tree showcases all of our collective musical influences and how we have taken those to create something that is truly our own unique Southern American Rock \u2018N Roll Sound.\u201d\n\nFor 17 years, Black Stone Cherry has put forth a new vicious breed of Southern rock, injecting youthful vitality and a myriad of fresh new influences into the beloved American rock tradition. To date, the band has released five critically acclaimed albums, and one well-received blues EP. Black Stone Cherry has also rocked 12,000-cap arena shows, topped the UK charts, and shared the stage with a diverse roster of superstars, including Def Leppard, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Bad Company, M\u00f6torhead, and ZZ Top.\n\nBlack Stone Cherry came together in 2001 in Edmonton, Kentucky, eventually coalescing around the lineup of Chris Robertson, vocals and guitar; Ben Wells, guitar and vocals; Jon Lawhon, bass and vocals; and John Fred Young, drums. Young's dad Richard, and his Uncle Fred, are two members of the iconic country-fried rock n\u2019 roots band The Kentucky HeadHunters, and the high school-aged boys came up honing their craft in the group\u2019s Practice House, a 1940s bungalow.\n\n\u201cWe grew up in the Kentucky Headhunters\u2019 rehearsal space, looking up at posters of Cream, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, the Stones, Montrose, and the Faces. We were like kids someone took in a time capsule and put in the woods,\u201d says drummer John Fred Young.\n\nLike the band\u2019s previous album and EP, Black Stone Cherry opted to self-produce and track Family Tree at David Barrick's Barrick Recording, the same studio where BSC recorded its self-titled debut and Kentucky albums . BSC also opted to not over-rehearse in advance of the album, instead preferring the immediacy and spontaneity of in the-moment takes. \u201cThere was a lot of laughter in the studio this time, and an air of comfort because we had self-produced the last few releases. It helped us get down to the nitty gritty bones of our music,\u201d says bassist Jon Lawhon. The band also entrusted guitarist and vocalist Chris Robertson to mix the album. This homespun approach perfectly suited the loose but epiphanic creative sessions that birthed Family Tree.\n\nFamily Tree boasts BSC\u2019s tried-and-true lucky number with its 13 songs, and, like all BSC releases, features songwriting contributions from each member. The result is a modern and meaty blues-based rock album, with unexpected sonic twists like punchy horn sections, barrelhouse pianos, Southern gospel organ, atmospheric synthesizer passages, and forays into funk and country.\n\nThe title track melds brawny blues riffage with BSC\u2019s most telepathic ensemble playing, showcasing the group\u2019s maturation as a unit without detracting from its Southern, hard rock wallop. The album also packs some satisfyingly surprising moments. \u201cCarry Me On Down The Road\u201d is a sleek slice of pure 1970s American rock n\u2019 roll\u2014something you would hear blaring out of a 1972 Chevy El Camino. \u201cJames Brown\u201d offers forth some stanky swamp-funk, replete with wah-wah guitars and gospel girl vocals. \u201cBad Habit,\u201d however, dripping sensual innuendo hammered home by a horny groove-rock beat, delivers some prime hooky and heavy BSC.\n\nOne Family Tree centerpiece is the rustically elegant \u201cMy Last Breath,\u201d a sweetly downhome ode to the unbreakable bonds of family. The song\u2019s goose bump-inducing call and response male and female vocal breakdown is one of those musical moments where light just shines through the speakers and you know everything is going to be alright.\n\nTwo special guests bring Family Tree full circle, one being Chris\u2019 5 year-old son singing backup on the brawny swaggering \u201cYou Got The Blues,\u201d and the other being jam band icon Warren Haynes\u2019 vocal and guitar cameo on the delta stomp of \u201cDancing In The Rain.\u201d The band first met Warren 17 years ago when they first came to New York to showcase for their new label. \u201cI remember coming to New York when we first were signed, and hearing Warren\u2019s voice behind me the minute my feet hit the street,\u201d recalls bassist Jon Lawhon. \u201cHearing him play on this track all these years later gave me chills.\u201d\n\nHaving Warren guest on the album was a wonderful gesture of \u201cyou\u2019re in the family now.\u201d It was truly a validation of all the miles the band has clocked on tour, and the dues the guys have paid being away from home. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how four good old boys from nowhere Kentucky can still be around 17 years later,\u201d singer/guitarist Chris Robertson says. Ben Wells concludes: \u201cI don\u2019t remember how life was outside of Black Stone Cherry.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON). The Allaire Show features John sharing the stage with local and up-and-coming talent as well as more experienced and established musicians, some who\u2019ve come from as far away as Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\n\nAWARDS\n- American Songwriter Assoc. \"Best Lyrics\" Award 2009 for \"Magnets\" (Nashville, TN)\n\n- Toronto Independent Music Awards \"Best Live Act\" (2009)\n\n- CBC Telefest top independent music video in Ontario (1989)\n\n- Top independent video in Canada 1989 as selected by MuchMusic\n\n- Canadian College and University Radio Assoc. top album of the month - \"All's Well\" (1989)\n\n- PROCAN (now SOCAN) independent songwriter award for \"Cry at Night\" (1987)", "otherInfo": "Pub Party Fridays brought to you by Flora Hall Brewing.

It will include 11 brand new songs. This will be the first record that he has recorded & produced in his own home studio in Co. Armagh. There will also be a special limited edition of the album available only on the benreel.com website, which will include 5 bonus tracks. Since his debut back in 1999, each album has gone from strength to strength, touching on different styles of music from rock,soul,blues, Alt Folk/Americana & with the occasional injection of reggae. This was highlighted on his 2012, 18 song best of album (Ben Reel 1999-2009 Compilation 10) released only as a limited edition for loyal fans to buy at gigs, also available on iTunes worldwide. Ben\u2019s music has evolved into an honest earthy sound that has matured like a fine wine and he has very much his own sound today. This can be heard on this new album. Darkness & The Light is a powerful soulful album with deep meaningful lyrics and memorable epic anthemic songs, with strong melodies combined with imaginitive expansive arrangements. Recorded digitally but with an analog feeling of warmth. The songs deal with the struggles of life of ordinary folk since the global economic crash. Also probing for spiritual meaning and balance between the Yin and the Yang, trying to find light, hope and healing in these troubled times. Serious songs from a serious artist in a serious moment in time. In the last 10 years he has had numerous high profile TV & Radio appearances and airplay under his belt including Bob Harris BBC Radio 2 and has supported names like Jools Holland, Alabama 3, The Cranberries and appeared as a special guest at one of Hal Ketchum's shows in Dublin.

His band includes amongst the finest musicians in Ireland, his brother in law Michael Black on Drums, Ronnie O\u2019Flynn on bass and Mick McCarney on guitar. With this line up they have built up a loyal underground following. Ben is often described as an \u2018artist lying beneath the radar for way too long\u2019. In 2011 Ben played showcase gigs in Nashville & Memphis (Folk Alliance) where he colloborated with some of Nashville's finest, David Olney, Sergio Webb & Irene Kelley to name a few. Plans are in the pipeline to return to the U.S in 2013 to promote his new record and to follow up on his success on Airplaydirect.com radio download rock chart, which he has been number 1 for the last 3 months. Plus he will be touring extensively in Ireland, UK & Europe.

Rainy Nights nails down the pang of loneliness that emigrants feel when they are far from home and someone says something that just triggers regret. The easy, soulful melody and performance underlines the impact, with Reel\u2019s singing striking just the right note. It is the high point of the album. Though Feel Alive , the title track and the gospel of Old Bog Road come close. The Armagh singer-songwriter comes across as a honest man determined to use his love of music to best effect, and he is lucky in having a band, particularly guitarist Mick McCarney, full of expression and no little skill. www.benreel.com Download tracks: Rainy Nights, Time to Get Real http://dvdfever.co.uk/reviews/erbenreel.shtml Elly Roberts reviews The Ben Reel Band: Time To Get Real Another little gem from the Emerald Isle. Rating: 8/10 Irishman Ben Reel has consistently released solid albums over the past 10 years. My last CD encounter was 2007\u2019s fabulous New Horizon. Now on his fifth album, Time To Get Real, keeps that tradition well and truly alive with a dazzling collection of Americana crossover songs that ought to have ears pricking at all the \u2018real music\u2019 stations. Reel has a penchant for ignoring fads and trends keeping the focus on real music which is why he\u2019s become a cult artist in his native Ireland, though sadly he hasn\u2019t been picked up as genuine singer-songwriter in the UK. Everybody in the business knows he\u2019s hot stuff having supported Jools Holland, Alabama 3, The Cranberries and stage star Michael Ball no less. The good news is he doing rather well in Holland, Belgium and Germany. As an introduction to the album he\u2019s released Feel Alive as a single. The down and dirty groove has some sublime guitar licks carried by a great melody and his rough edged vocals. ________________________________________ This box of delights opens with a gentle country shuffle in the form of Rainy Night as the band moves with confidence and swagger, again with Reel dropping in some superb guitar breaks and a fine line in vocal gymnastics including falsetto along with a Neil Young-like harmonica swish. The introduction of songbird Julieanne Reek on the deliciously tender love ballad Summers Always Here only adds to the romantic mood. With a troubled heart he gushes with lyrics like \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re like the warm summer sun that\u2019s rising / Feel your warm love in my heart / Melting away the cold ice of winter / The storms have passed / There\u2019s a new life on the way.\u201d Embracing an eclectic mindset, Keep On Drivin\u2019 takes on a C.C.Rider rockabilly hue drenched in honeyed vocals, stylish pedal steel, thumping basslines and wah wah, whereas Time Slips Away is deeply reflective, yearning for his childhood days and the onset of wisdom now he\u2019s turned 35. A heavy funky bass, rolling organ, and acoustic chords make Who You Are the albums catchiest song, with the main hook coming in the chorus. For Old And Wise Reel delves deep into a more traditional Irish template which brings forward his wishes not to die a typical rock\u2019n\u2019roll death \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t wanna overdose like a rockin-roll star /Or choke on my vomit after whiskey in the jar.\u201d By far the best song on the album, closes it \u2013 the stripped back dusty-bowl ballad Old Bog Road. Reverbed harmonica leads to gentle acoustic picks, chords slabs and wailing solos, on what is essentially a mournful ballad. The verdict \u2013 Quality album. http://www.billybop.be/admin/CDdetail.asp?ID=8717 Ben Reel : Time To Get Real \u2013 CD, BRBCDA-007;B Reel Records Album Kindly Submitted by G-Promotions Style : Americana Rate (1-5) : Ben Reel is the latest addition to a series of Americana artists emerging from Ireland! Against the backdrop of the troubles in Northern Ireland, Ben first picked up his guitar when he was 15 years old inspired by greats like Bruce Springsteen or Neil Young. Today this inspirations are still to be found in his passionate music! Leading track \u201cRainy Night\u201d is one of those tunes that you start to whistle along without ever having it heard before! Country and Americana are the main genres on this album but this doesn\u2019t mean the album is limited to it. On \u201cFeel Alive\u201d Ben comes with some enjoyable soul influences while \u201cKeep on drivin\u2019\u201d throws in a lot of country as does \u201cLooking for a Lost Horizon\u201d. \u201cOld & Wise\u201d throws in some old styles and mix folk influences into this Americana tune. On \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d the title track of this album, Ben Reel, returns to his old habits and creates a song that could be from the hand of \u201cThe Boss\u201d. Closing down the album is \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d that opens with a beautiful haunting blues harp. The haunting keeps going on, both with his voice and slide guitar! As an extra, hidden track we can hear a nice rockabilly kind of version (Live) of Keep on Drivin\u2019 in a mix with the classic \u201cTrain Train\u201d Time To Get Real is already the fifth album for Ben Reel and in the past two years he has successfully toured Holland, Belgium and Germany steady working on a growing fan base. Back you\u2019ll can find him as supporting act for bands like the Cranberries, Alabama 3 or Jools Holland. The album is a true Americana effort and comes with handful of interesting tunes that makes me feel that this artist need to be in the spotlight a little more. Mr Blue Boogie http://www.getreadytorock.com/reviews2009/ben_reel.htm BEN REEL Time To Get Real (2009) Play this new Ben Reel CD to any music aficionado, and ask them where it was recorded. Nine out of ten would say Nashville. Guaranteed. Now, Ben Reel may not be a household name (yet), but let's assume for a moment his work is unfamiliar to you. OK, what genre music would you say Time To Get Real was? No problem - southern, country blues rock. And name any influences you can hear at play? Again, no problem - Neil Young is an obvious one, but also Springsteen and perhaps Chris Isaak and even a little Clapton circa 361 Ocean Boulevard. So, nationality? No brainer - a man from the deep south of the US of A. Wrong on all accounts, because Time To Get Real is the 5th album in 10 years from Irish guitarist and singer songwriter Ben Reel. And naturally it was recorded in Monaghan in the north of the emerald isle. In reviewing Ben's last album New Horizon (2007) - which had an altogether more 'west coast' feel - we pondered on image, and what might make Ben stand out from the likes of Marc Cohn. It may be that with Time to Get Real, and diving deep into Americana, Ben has found his niche. Beautifully played and recorded it's bound to strike a chord with the market that's fuelling the resurgence of Neil Young, and Springsteen's exploration of the American psyche. But the challenge is still to get his music across the pond. It's not easy to crack America - many have tried and failed, but the rootsy warmth of the songs, the soulful singing and classy playing (some wonderful blues guitar and harmonica work) would undoubtedly be lapped up with a little exposure. So remember the name - Ben Reel - a real class act. *** Review by Pete Whalley http://www.lonesomehighway.com/pdf/online-issue-7.pdf Ben Reel Time To Get Real B. Reel Northern Ireland native Ben Reel has delivered a roots album that is full of strong songs and good playing. There\u2019s some solid keyboard playing, a rhythm section that drives things along and some very tasty guitar from Mick McCarney. Reel\u2019s voice is accompanied by welcome backing vocals that help to portray the mood of the songs. Rainy Night sets the tone for time and place, a song that looks at what has been missed by moving away from your home town. Other topics are ageing, freedom, the nature of searching and of truth. Mature songs for a mature audience that\u2019s given a melodic and malleable musical base that could just as easily have come from the States as from Northern Ireland. Reel no doubt has taken from those who have also come from the North, such as the undeniable influence of Van Morrison as a beacon of musical innovation. Reel does not have Morrison\u2019s track record, but this is an album that shows all the signs of a true talent making his own way. It\u2019s time to get serious is the signal Ben Reel gives with the release of his latest cd \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d. Wasn\u2019t he before? Haven\u2019t got a clue because for me Ben Reel is a complete stranger. He is (northern) Irish and has been working at his craft for quite some time. \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d sure is a good way to get to know him and the cd is full of piercing impulses. Delicate songs, strongly carried by the accompanying musicians, but by no tarnishing ben\u2019s Vocals. (His vocals show comparisons to Rod MacDonald and John Stewart). I hope that I grow old and wise suggests that Ben has come to an age where he starts realising his own mortality, what undoubtedly determines the profundity you find again in his lyrics. With what I don\u2019t want to affect his compositions. As I said before, I only know Reels past from what I read in his biography, But \u201cTime to get Reel\u201d indeed looks like the start of a new development, a new awakening. No trace of a personal crisis. My guts tell me Ben Reel has defined he wants to make a good product. One he will be remembered by. The closing song \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d tells of a permanent goodbye Ben Reel manages to create a excellent variation of styles, and within a limited nr of spins I still a real positive feeling about Ben Reel. Serious, skilful. driven \u2026. (after the official songs there is a hidden track, a live song, where you hear the presence of a modern day Elvis. Not renewed, but very entertaining. www.rootstime.be /Rein van den Berg Oct 09 The Irish hearts are often rather melancholic. Maybe the beautiful sceneries see to a tendensy of warmth and retirement. It characterizes at any rate the dark songs of Ben Reel, which the cover of the newest album, time to get real, suggest. Eleven songs written by reel himself and richly arranged with violin, piano, appropriate guitar lines and a choice of extra additioned instruments. With this the Irish know how to display a large scale of spheres and feelings, carying names as Neil Young and sometimes Bob Dylan. Indeed in rags, because Ben Reel is a slippery costumer. Ben\u2019s first album, \u201cthis is the movie\u201d, came out in Ireland in 1999, after this the EP \u00ebxorcise me\u201d(2000) only with 3 tracks, which seemed to be forerunner for his second album \u201cLost in Haze\u201d (2001). After that came Sweet Victory (2004), U People (2006) and New Horizon (2007). We don\u2019t have to complain about man\u2019s releases and qualities: guitarplayer Ben Reel, born in silverbridge but now living in Castlebalyney, is a supreme storyteller; has a pleasant voice, writes, beside that, upperclass songs and has also the quality to gather very able musicians around him. At his new album Ben Reel is accompanied again by a fine equilibiated band: Ronnie, Michael. Mickey, John, Colin. And now we are calling names: the recordings were done in the Attic studios with producer Ronan who also has a vocal contribution in the last two songs. In the quite openers Rainy Summers etc. we hear Reel\u2019s wife Julieanne who takes the change of the singing second. Anyway, in their natural but yet larger soundscape is more than enough space for improvisation and variety, which we can hear clearly on their new album. What Ben has settled with this successor is impressing. In 11 songs the band knows to create an oppressing atmosphere, which gets enlightened only now and then. Rasping and grating, then again with deceptive lovely acoustic guitars, then with thin guitarsounds and spacious violin, the listener is taking to a voyage through the Deep South of the mind, which only can turn out bad. It is oppressing, dark, stirring and especially very beautiful. Roots, pop and folk are going hand in hand with now and then an experimental strain. The point is that Ben Reel makes magnificent music. Music that mixes influences from alt-country with the atmospheric and darkness the music from Ireland so often charcterizes. Music that attracts attention by the variety and the highstanding music, because they really can play. Ben Reel searches, with his new album, joining with the greatness of the alt-country, but takes here at the same time surrender. Time to get real is just a good patterncard of the ability of the Ben Reel Band. Everything sounds beautiful, clear and especially respectable. The sharp ends are removed expertly and almost everything is produced in a way that it has to be specially accessed for the singersongwriter radiosize.

There's lots to inspire and Ben Reel has absorbed those influences and let them inform his particular style of travelling blues. \"Time To Get Real\" isn't a classic troubadour album, but it is deep hearted blues packed with characters, places and just a wee bit of drinking. The songs are strong through out, all could standalone without being thought of as filler. Time to step up from being a solid support to being the headliner. BELGUIM http://www.ctrlaltcountry.be/Pagina1.htm#BenReel BEN REEL \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d (Ben Reel) (3,5****) Ireland has long been enjoying a good reputation, where the singer-songwriters are concerned. And with Ben Reel has another one to be proud of. With \"Time To Get Real\" the man has just delivered his fifth album in ten years time, and that is a very beautiful album. Reel is gifted with a warm, a little soulful vocal style, shows himself a truly excellent song smith and professional manner together in genres like rock, pop, folk, Americana and blues into his songs. He calls himself Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young as inspiration, but there really is not much sign of that. Reel sounds like a particularly original. Someone with a vision of his own writing and placing songs. Someone with an own sound. And it would absolutely not surprise us if he behave the songs on \"Time To Get Real\" soon break on larger scale. He fully deserves it already! Songs like it a little reminiscent of Neil Young \"Rainy Night\", the beautifully subdued piano and harmonica work on-going rootspopdeuntje \"Summer's Always Here\", the soulful rockin 'Feel Alive', the bluesy bounce \"Keep On Drivin '\", the summer, somewhere between pop, folk and country resident \"Old & Wise\" is simply magnificent.

(SWA) REAL ROOTS CAF\u00c9 Netherlands Dutch to English translation Very recently came from Time to get real, the fifth full-time CD of Irish singer-songwriter Ben Reel. For me a great unknown, but already 20 years active in music since he was a teenager in 1989 founded his first band, \"Trim the Velvet '. After the breakup of this band eight years later, Ben's solo tour in 1999 and came from his solo CD's available. With five number one so he just scored an average of two years each. Ben's music is best described as Irish mid-tempo alt-country, the songs are nice sound and treat a number of pressing issues for Ben. He describes one part of his life and Rainy Night Time just slips away, do proclaim his feelings, especially love, respect, in four songs and shares his thoughts with us and future expectations in another four songs. He concludes (No. 11 is) a kind of summary of this in Old Bog Road: Seasons change as people come and go, life and death is the endless flow. Want to find the answers, because the story to be told, is not gonna quit the mining for gold. Want to find a reason before I go. Before they take my body, down that old bog road. Heavy thoughts for a guy who has several years of the 40 removed. But we are not all looking for the deeper meaning of life? Incidentally, after more than six minutes of the final number is still nearly six minutes a lasting valve closure, which Ben totally in style and tempo rocking (leading to a sodden organ) announces yet another time by a wish to: (I 'll) keep on driving, a live concert recording and a perfect valve. Always funny, some unexpected hidden track. Ben's band was great response and are in addition to Ben's acoustic guitar (and occasional harmonica) bass, drums and electric guitar. A few songs do keyboards and violin along. Ben has a somewhat gritty but pleasant voice. His wife Julianne sings along to eight songs, four songs is half Bloch (e, you never know with those Irish first names) to hear. I think it's a good CD, especially through the expressiveness of the songs both lyrically and in terms of melody (Fred Schmale) Put simply and aptly, New Horizon is all killer, no filler! Rarely have I heard an album so complete and so fully realised. From the brilliance of the playing and arranging to the magnificence of Reel's voice, this is heaven all the way. A superb album by an artist good enough to hold his own in rock\u2019s premiere league. Andrew Hobbs, Hi Fi + magazine When it comes to making classy albums, Ben Reel's your man. Year on year, Reel's songwriting is growing in stature in every department, yet he still doesn't get the wide spread recognition he richly deserves it's one of the strongest albums this year. This CD isn't just music: it's art. AllGigs.co.uk review of New Horizon, 8th October 2007 Ben Reel, a native of South Armagh, has in the words of one journalist \u2018operated under the media\u2019s radar for far too long\u2019. On the evidence of this release, his fourth album, I would have to agree. The songs and the playing are really impressive, an earthy mix of rock, roots and blues, all mixed lovingly together with soulful vocals. His song writing shows maturity and progression which comes through with repeated plays. Featuring some great slide guitar from Micky McCarney and terrific vocals from Kelie Redmond, \u201cHell In Ur Own Head\u201d is a standout, closely followed by the semi spoken \u201cWhen Will Be Ever Be Free\u201d. \u201cFor U And I\u201d shows the band at their best with a lovely rock/soul groove that you wish would go on longer. All in all this is an impressive album from a major talent who needs further investigation.

Covering the obscene and praising the perverse, extreme Death Metal still reigns as the driving force that continues to devour all other forms of hard rock. As each year passes in this brutal movement, it becomes increasingly difficult to find suitable leaders to carry the torch and continue to entice and surprise an audience that certainly isn\u2019t shocked or impressed by much. That search has ended. Allow us to introduce CARNIFEX. Derived from the Old English word for executioner, their moniker could not be more appropriate. It\u2019s a word that reeks of death and destruction from the Dark Ages to describe a fiercely morbid death metal band. It\u2019s hard to imagine that San Diego \u2013 known for its white sand beaches, endless sunny days and astronomical real estate- is also home to the brutal beat down that is CARNIFEX.\n\nIn 2005, vocalist Scott Lewis had a chance meeting with like-minded, gifted drummer Shawn Cameron. Having both played in a countless number of bands over the years that just didn\u2019t seem to fit, the connection between the two was felt instantly. Together, they began a search to fill the musical void that had existed in each of their lives. They quickly formed a group and hit the road. CARNIFEX, being the serious-minded musicians that they are, hit the road hard. Refusing to be another \u201chere today, gone tomorrow\u201d trend, CARNIFEX let nothing stop them from perfecting their live show, touring relentlessly, and writing brainsick, yet intelligent, songs. Having endured everything from tour cancellations, van breakdowns and inevitable line-up changes, that \u201cmagical fit\u201d was solidified by the end of 2007. Scott and Shawn were complemented by the intensity of guitarist Cory Arford. Bassist Fred Calderon rounded out the furious unstoppable juggernaut.\n\nThe non-stop touring and methodical songwriting eventually resulted in CARNIFEX selling over 15,000 copies of their first full-length album, Dead in My Arms, with little publicity. Not surprisingly, industry types started to notice; however, none as quickly as Victory Records. Having spent a lot of time writing during the previous year, CARNIFEX was primed to get into the studio to begin the masterpiece that is The Diseased and the Poisoned. Zeuss (UNEARTH, SHADOWS FALL, HATEBREED) at Planet Z Studios was a natural choice for producer, and they entered the studio rapidly and intently.\n\nCARNIFEX is something musically unique. What really makes CARNIFEX stand out from the throngs of other hard rock acts currently scouring the planet are their savage live performances. Their declaration to make every night an experience for fans rather than just a show has proven to be the most appreciated trait of the band among fans. But you can keep your pyrotechnics and other special effects at home CARNIFEX relies solely on the power of their music. \u201cEvery night, we strive to play extremely tight. Sometimes it can be difficult to make such an intense show so interactive, but we make sure that\neveryone is getting involved,\u201d says Lewis.\n\nIn 2008, CARNIFEX proudly delivered the The Diseased and the Poisoned to the metal masses. Intriguing and armed to the teeth with an arsenal of blast beats, machine gun riffs and vocals exorcised from the deepest pits of hell, The Diseased and the Poisoned is the soundtrack to your worst nightmare. Having sold 28,000 copies in the U.S. alone, this record was a huge success, solidifying their spot in the American Death Metal realm.\n\nIn 2010, CARNIFEX released Hell Chose Me, taking a darker and more blasphemous approach to their already visceral sound. Musical growth and a higher level of aggression coupled with themes of despair and isolation make for an abrasive new record. Blood curdling screams, guttural growls, bottom heavy baselines, and razorsharp guitar riffs make for dark and brutal work.\n\nAfter a short hiatus, CARNIFEX is back stronger than ever and with a new home. \u201cSigning with Nuclear Blast is a career defining moment for CARNIFEX,\u201d states Lewis. \u201cTo be aligned with the largest metal label on earth is a true honor. This world-wide deal signals a turning point for us as a band and individuals. Together with Nuclear Blast you will see CARNIFEX like you have never seen us before. Prepare yourself for an album that crushes any and all expectations. An album that will stand as the definitive mark for modern metal.\u201d\n\nDie Without Hope marks the long awaited return of the band, with their fifth full-length album and Nuclear Blast debut. 10 tracks and over 35 minutes of crushing metal that no fan of heavy music can deny. Recorded at Audiohammer Studios in Sanford, FL and produced by the esteemed Mark Lewis (ARSIS, THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER, WHITECHAPEL, DEVILDRIVER, DEICIDE, SIX FEET UNDER), San Diego's finest metal export deliver an album that stands as a definitive cornerstone for modern death metal. Since their formation, CARNIFEX has proven time and time again that their die-hard fan base combined with their DIY work ethic is unmatched; Die Without Hope is no exception.\n\nCARNIFEX\u2019s relentless touring schedule begins with an extensive 5 week headlining tour February 21st though March 29th. Taking the band through all of North America. Followed by a direct support slot to\na major band in April, which includes an appearance at the 2014 New England Metal and Hardcore\nFestival.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brainstory ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9946076.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Psychedelic Pop, Soul", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hailing from the arid lands of the Inland Empire, this power trio forges a path of sonic explorations and cultural and personal liberation through creativity.

In his own way he goes about singing songs from all over the spectrum with an ease that is only fitting of one who is many years older and a prowess on guitar that is singular in its ability to stand alone without accompaniment. Its a wonderful mystery to behold how the essence of any song can be captured so simply by one voice and a guitar, but he does it with originality, taste and an unexpected power for someone who isn\u2019t really on the radar to the wider music community. And it is with a resigned sense of purpose that this 29 year-old Canadian continues to write, interpret and perform music in often the humblest of capacities. This is his path. And he must follow it to the end.\n\n\n\n\u201cI always say \u2018you must inspire yourself, find your path, be true to it and follow it to the end\u2019 because that\u2019s really all that needs to be done in this life. If you can do that then there is nothing to worry about. Whatever your path may be, it will always teach you everything else you need to know about life on the way. For me there is a feeling of obligation to music because it is so clearly the best thing I can offer to the world, but I often fight it in favour of other things only to eventually realize I\u2019m not honouring my true path. So it becomes a balance between seemingly opposing forces that in the end put me right where I need to be.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe opposing force he is referring to is his commitment to a contemplative life of meditation practice. A life traditionally aided by long hours of silence and rigid structure; not a life typically lived by a working musician. After several years of torn aspiration between the life of a Buddhist monk and pursuing a serious music career as a singer/songwriter, Corey is settling somewhat into a situation he feels best serves both of these energies. He feels by maintaining a low-key, almost anonymous attitude to his live performances and online presence he can still allow room to teach guitar (another precious pastime) and spend a few hours alone each day in silent meditation.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the most part I play gigs around here in Southern Ontario. Usually just really ordinary pubs, cafes and restaurants to people who may or may not be listening all that intently but I can show up, play my heart out and leave without having to worry too much about selling tickets, or CD\u2019s and merchandise, trying to make something happen or grow my brand or whatever. I can play covers the way I want, maybe play some originals if I feel like it, work out the kinks of my delivery and be spontaneous. I often don\u2019t even say who I am. Sometimes I don\u2019t really say anything at all. Which is exactly how I go about making my videos as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nOver the years, a devoted worldwide following has sprang up through his YouTube channel where he posts performances of popular and not-so-popular cover songs as well as his own material which has helped define his purpose with music. He plays many kinds of songs without pandering to any one listening demographic and often without much of anything in the way of effects or editing. Just 20 years of craftsmanship and passion on display. The response is overwhelmingly positive as viewers experience the consistent quality and creativity of each performance. Whether its the music of musical heroes or his original songs, its difficult not to be impressed by the standard at which he sets each time he plays.\n\n\n\n\u201cPutting up videos on YouTube has been such a wonderful way for me to exercise my musical freedom and play all the songs I love \u2014 from artists I admire \u2014 and challenge myself to grow as a musician publicly. It allows me to connect with people from all over the world and reminds me why its important for me to do what I\u2019m doing, because they appreciate it. I earn very little money from this medium but its been a constant motivator and mirror for me to reflect and improve which makes it such a valuable aspect of what I do. I really neglected it while I was away travelling recently, which was necessary because I was busy gigging, busking and trying to make ends meet but now that I\u2019m back home with my recording gear I\u2019m looking forward to making videos more consistently.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter spending 18 months in Australia and California doing performances mostly on the street as well as in \u201cordinary pubs and restaurants\u201d half a world away, Corey has returned to Canada and settled in Kitchener, Ontario where he performs regularly, teaches students and still finds time for silence and meditation.

prolific Brill building pop Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and \u2013 fingers crossed - Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music - and give them an experience that they will never forget.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Every Friday I will transport my viewers into the past where they will feel as thought they are sitting behind the recording console at Motown's Hitsville recording studio.

Whether it was \u201cLet it Be\u201d by The Beatles, \u201cBorn to Run\u201d by Bruce Springsteen (a fellow New Jersey native), or \u201cIt\u2019s My Party\u201d by Leslie Gore she was into it. A 90\u2019s baby herself, Bowman\u2019s knowledge and love for music spans decades. Inspired by pop acts and bands of the 90\u2019s in particular she knew she wanted to pursue music at an early age. After graduating high school, not having a clue how to pursue a career in music, she started going into New York City looking to meet with producers and songwriters who might want to work with her. After several failed auditions, several unreturned phone calls, and a little bit of heartbreak she met a producer who saw something in her. Bowman, only a singer at the time began recording songs written by the producer. Suggesting she start writing herself, with the melody and concept already started Bowman alongside her producer finished writing what would be her first single \u201cProblem.\u201d \u201cProblem\u201d was added to Sirius XM 20 on 20 and in 2 weeks was a top 5 requested song. Her next single \u201cKing Boy\u201d trumped her first becoming the 5th most played song of the year on Sirius XM 20 on 20 while also selling over 20,000 copies, a major feat for an independent artist.\n\nWith the success of her first 2 releases Bowman found herself writing with more and more producers/songwriters. She had been working on new music with a writer at Warner Chappell Publishing when the synch team there received a request for a song about staying warm. Alongside the producer Bowman wrote \u201cKeep Me Warm,\u201d a release that would play in a national McDonald\u2019s ad campaign for over a month, as well as receive airplay on 3 different radio formats: Top 40, Hot AC, and AC.\n\nContinuing to work alongside different writers/producers she caught the attention of Kobalt Music. A publishing company who\u2019s rosters includes the likes of Max Martin, Mumford and Sons, Simon and Garfunkel, Lionel Richie, Dixie Chicks, Beck, and countless other successful artists and songwriters. Eventually signed to a Kobalt publishing deal herself Bowman released \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d through AWAL, Kobalt\u2019s global artist services company. \u201cGood Time Good Life\u201d debuted on NBC\u2019s This Is Us, ran in a national Target ad, a national Beaches Resort ad, and was chosen by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to drive The Oscar\u2019s 2017 promo aired on ABC for over 2 months. The Oscar promo lead to Bowman\u2019s national TV debut on Good Morning America where she performed \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d followed up with a performance at the Radio Disney Music Awards, and Live with Kelly and Ryan.\n\nWith the success of \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d and a move out west (a NJ native now in Los Angeles) Bowman found herself working on music going in a slightly different direction. She was doing less co-writes and found herself writing everyday on her own. Songs started pouring out of her. Her life was changing and the music she was writing was some of the realest she had ever written. In March of 2018 Bowman found herself traveling to London to explore a new city and work on new music. A NJ native, now based in Los Angeles, traveling to London. It was on a whim that she decided to attend an open mic night where she\u2019d perform a couple of her new songs for the first time. It was at that open mic night that she would meet the 2 cowriters/producers that would bring this new direction of music, this new project, to life. Bowman traveled back to London for over a month in the summer and in the fall to work on what will be her first ever EP. A lyrically driven, wearing her heart on her sleeve, completely open and honest EP titled Apartment 101 released in 2019.", "otherInfo": "Enjoy an hour of Erin Bowman Instagram Live for a cocktail, conversation & performance."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "J.R. Castillo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6288479.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cMusic has been a big part of my life, my entire life,\u201d says Texas musician J. R. Castillo. While a lot of artists can say the same, the influence of music on Castillo\u2019s life began years before he was born. When Castillo\u2019s father was a boy, he idolized his brother who was nine years older and in the Navy. Castillo\u2019s uncle would come home on leave from the Navy and play guitar on the front porch, and Castillo\u2019s father aspired to play just like his older brother. Tragically, his uncle lost his life serving in the Navy and his father\u2014now the oldest son and responsible for his family\u2014never learned to play like he wanted. \u201cAs he got older [my father] said, \u2018If I ever have a son, I want to put a guitar in his hands and make sure he learns to play,\u2019\u201d Castillo says, and to honor the brother he lost, Castillo\u2019s father put a guitar into his son\u2019s hands at a very early age. His mother also loved music. She encouraged him to sing and find harmonies as she introduced him to all kinds of music, and both his father and mother\u2014a \u201ccloset poet\u201d and \u201cgrammar queen,\u201d respectively\u2014encouraged their son to write. It was no surprise then when their son was fronting bands and performing his own music by the time he was 13. With the bands he was in during middle and high school, Castillo would work his own original music into sets of well-known covers at parties and festivals, and the reaction was always very positive. \u201cIt always seemed that every time I\u2019d announce, \u2018Here\u2019s a song that I wrote,\u2019 it immediately drew people in, which caught my attention,\u201d Castillo recalls. \u201cI saw that people all the sudden weren\u2019t just out there dancing and having a good time, their attention was on the song that I\u2019d written. The reaction of those first few folks\u2014they don\u2019t realize it, the influence they had\u2014as they were out there listening and giving me those words of encouragement after they heard the songs, it really encouraged me to continue with the song writing. It really set me on the path that I\u2019m on today.\u201d Despite his early success, he didn\u2019t immediately run off to Nashville to pursue a record deal; his family assumed that first he would get a college education, though they encouraged him to continue with his music while doing so. However, avoiding the temptation to quit college wasn\u2019t easy when record labels started showing interest during his sophomore year. \u201cIt kind of scared my folks a little bit, because they thought that I was just going to stop everything and pack my bags and move to Nashville. It just seemed like the right thing at that point in time.\u201d It was the advice of friend Casey Monahan at the Texas Music Office that persuaded him he could do both, a decision he\u2019s happy with in retrospect: \u201cI often look back at that moment and I know that it didn\u2019t have a huge an impact. If I had moved over there, it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. I was still able to do everything they wanted us to do, but at the same time we were still able to take care of things at home and I was able to continue my education.\u201d Over the last 15 years\u2014through his formative years, his time at the University of Texas, and up to the present day\u2014Castillo has written over a thousand songs for himself and other artists, 25 percent of which are in Spanish. His songwriting strays from that of many other artists, as his music is often more specific and personal than other artists\u2019 music. \u201cA lot of the stuff is based on life experiences and stuff that I\u2019ve gone through, personal stories,\u201d Castillo says of his songwriting. \u201cI try to take actual stories and actual experiences and lay them out in that three and a half minute length of a song.\u201d For Castillo, the joy of songwriting isn\u2019t in mass appeal, but connecting on a deeper, more-personal level with his listeners. \u201cI want to write about real things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about writing the basic love songs where everybody can relate. I want to write about stuff that people out there listening can actually hold on to and say, \u201cThat\u2019s my song. That guy wrote that song about my life and what I\u2019m going through.\u201d His latest single, \u201cThe Flip Side of Sober,\u201d was released on July 4, and is apart of a full CD release entitled The Hombre that Castillo expects to be released in late September. Other songs on the 16-track album include the classic Leo Sayer hit, \u201cMore Than I Can Say\u201d (one of his mother\u2019s favorites), and unofficial Texas High School football anthem, \u201cAny Given Friday.\u201d \u201cSome of my fellow artists and writers are like, \u2018Man you\u2019re nuts. You\u2019re the only one who would serve up that many songs in one project,\u2019\u201d Castillo remarks. \u201cBut hey, it\u2019s music. I\u2019m cranking it out. I feel blessed to be able to write as much as I do. It gives me an opportunity to share some of myself with the fans.\u201d By Andrew Miller, Nashville Music Guide", "otherInfo": "J.R.

Co-produced and written by Dale Murray, the EP won the 2014 Music Nova Scotia Award for Inspirational Recording of the Year.\n\nSleeping With A Stranger (2012), Martin\u02bcs fifth award-winning album, reflects the artist\u2019s coming of age lyrically and musically. \u201cIt\u02bcs one of those rare albums where you have to listen to it all in one sitting. Like a good book that\u2019s hard to put down, Sleeping With A Stranger tickles the ears and within three bars you\u2019re completely hooked.\u201d (Americana UK, October 2012). The album won her the 2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Recording of the Year Award. It was nominated for three East Coast Music Awards Come Undone Records was nominated for Music Nova Scotia Company of the Year. What I Always Knew was placed in the CBC television drama Heartland and her single Falling For You remained on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 countdown for five months.\n\nMartin returned home from Europe in the spring of 2014, following eighty concert dates which included a performance at Rolling Stone Weekender Festival, a publicity partnership with PopUp Records in Hamburg, and an endorsement from the esteemed Duesenberg Custom Guitar Shop in Hannover, Germany. She secured relationships for her future from her home base as Artist in Residence in the city of Dachau, Germany.\n\nIt\u2019ll Be Alright (2015) found Christina attaining what her music has always suggested, a place where the ghosts of her musical heroes freely mingle with the architecture of modern music. Working closely with her long-time producer and guitarist Dale Murray, drummer Brian Murray and bassist Jason Vautour, Martin made a conscious effort to confound the expectations of those who have categorized her in the past. This record utilizes far more sonic textures, allowing Martin to explore the many sides of her musical personality. The album won a 2016 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year and her It\u2019ll Be Alright single rose to #6 on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 chart. You Ran From Me was voted the #14 most played Canadian song on Sonica for 2015, and Somewhere With You was placed in the CBC Television show Heartland.\n\nFollowing two years of touring across Germany, Poland, The Netherlands, The UK, Switzerland, Austria, France and Canada, Martin returned home briefly in 2016 to write her newest album. A fervent anthem for those who are lost and longing, Lungs Are Burning was the first single from her album Impossible To Hold (Released March 23, 2018). The first single was triggered by the rising Fentanyl drug crisis killing thousands of Canadians, with Christina\u2019s lyrics set to music by her and Dale Murray. With lyrics like \u201cwhile I\u2019m watching the babies\u201d and \u201cgot to go out and get some, baby\u201d, Martin captures the desperation of \u201cchasing the dream\u201d and the horror of living it. Murray\u2019s stately production brings that stark reality home with a bite. Martin: \u201cThe song is an modest attempt to bring light to the heavy topic of addiction, and reflects my own personal sense of loss, longing and a deep void, and the ache I feel from losing my brother and friends to addiction and mental illness.\u201d For her Canadian tour dates, Christina has partnered with Center for Addiction and Mental Health to increase engagement and awareness.\n\n\u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is Martin\u2019s sixth and strongest studio album, achieving a perfect balance between organic ambience and impeccable production. \u201cI\u2019m writing about faith and love more than ever with songs like \u2018Keep Me Calm\u2019 and \u2018Always Reminding\u2019, but I haven\u2019t shaken the need to write about the darker things that are part of our human journey\u201d. Combining good taste, passionate singing and thoughtful lyrics, \u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is where music and poetry meet. The album won the 2018 Music Nova Scotia Award for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\n\nAWARDS\n\n2018 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Impossible To Hold)\n2016 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (It\u2019ll Be Alright)\n2014 Music Nova Scotia Inspirational Recording of the Year (Remember Me \u2013 EP)\n2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Sleeping With A Stranger)\n2009 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n\nARTIST IN RESIDENCIES COMPLETED\n\n2013-2015 Dachau, Germany\n\n2010-2011 Halifax NS, Canada \u2013 Dalhousie Geriatric Medical Research & Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN)\n\nFESTIVALS/CONFERENCES\n\n2019 Ottawa Blues Fest - Ottawa ON, Canada\n2019 Area506 - Saint John NB, Canada\n2018 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto, Canada\n2017 Sonder Fest \u2013 Manchester, United Kingdom\n2016 Reeperbahn Festival \u2013 Hamburg, Germany\n2016 Rising Tide Festival @ Fundy National Park- Alma NB, Canada\n2016 Harmony Bazaar Festival \u2013 Lockeport NS, Canada\n2016 Maverick Festival \u2013 Suffolk, United Kingdom\n2013 Rolling Stone Weekender Festival \u2013 Weissenh\u00e4user Strand, Germany\n2011 Winter Olympics @ Atlantic Canada House \u2013 Vancouver BC, Canada\n2011 Canada Games \u2013 Halifax NS, Canada\n2011 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2010 Belfast Nashville Songwriters Festival \u2013 Belfast, Ireland\n2009 Folk Alliance \u2013 Memphis TN, USA\n2009 North By North East \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2009 Stan Rogers Festival \u2013 Canso NS, Canada\n2002 SXSW - Austin TX, USA", "otherInfo": "How's the yard work coming along for everyone?

The younger brother of Cajun fiddler Michael Doucet, Doucet has used his distinctive hybrid of folk-style fingerpicking and bluegrass-like flatpicking to strengthen the performances of Beausoleil, the band he's shared with his brother for over 21 years. With the release of his debut solo album, Quand J'ai Parti in 1991, Doucet successfully stepped into the spotlight.\nDoucet first played the guitar after recuperating from a broken arm sustained while practicing with his high school football team. Although he initially taught himself to play by using Bob Dylan and Paul Simon songbooks, Doucet became fascinated with flatpicking after listening to an album by Doc Watson.\n\nTogether with his brother and banjo player Raoul Breaux, Doucet played Cajun music in Louisiana clubs in 1975. When the project proved commercially unsuccessful, the band broke up with Doucet enrolling in college and his brother going on to form the Cajun rock band Coteau and the original lineup of Beausoleil. A turning point in Doucet's evolution as a guitarist came when he heard the playing of the late Clarence White on an album, The Kentucky Colonels 1965-1967, in 1980. Inspired by White's use of unusual chords and imaginative melodies, Doucet began to develop his own unique style.\n\nAlthough Doucet did not play on Beausoleil's first recording session in Paris, he joined the group before the recording of their debut album, The Spirit of Cajun Music, in 1976.\n\nGrand Texas Doucet moved to New Orleans, where he continues to reside, in 1980 to work at the World's Fair. In addition to his solo album and recordings with Beausoleil, Doucet was featured on albums by Chuck Guillory (Grand Texas), Octa Clark & Hector Duhon (Ensemble Encore) and Michael Doucet (Dit BeauSoleil).\nDoucet was accompanied on Quand J'ai Parti by members of Beausoleil (Michael Doucet, Jimmy Breaux, Tommy Comeaux, Billy Ware and Tommy Alesi) and influential dobro player Josh Graves, whom he met during a \"Legends of Folk Violin\" tour.\n\n\nMore to come", "otherInfo": "A weekly show of tunes I play now and used to play long ago.

Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No more pjs for me!

Hannah always knew she wanted to be an entertainer, but it wasn't until she was ten years old that she made her debut solo performance at her fourth grade Christmas Recital. She sang \"Tender Tennessee Christmas\". After that she was hooked. She focused on nothing else. At fourteen she picked up a Squire acoustic guitar that her younger sister had abandoned and quickly began learning to write. Over the next four years she performed at fairs, coffee houses, shopping malls and talent shows throughout the Upper Midwest. At eighteen Hannah moved to Nashville, TN to make her dreams a reality. She attended Belmont University in Nashville to study the business of music and vocal performance. After two years she decided to leave Belmont and delve deeper into the art of song writing. She also began performing her own material in and around Nashville. In 2010 Hannah released her first EP, a self produced project called, \"No Stopping, Standing, Parking\". It received rave reviews from the Nashville songwriting community. Soon after it's release, she was personally selected to attend the prestigious Horse & Writer Songwriting Invitational by one of Nashville's most successful songwriters, Skip Ewing. Hannah was a contestant on the 2011 season of the reality television show, \"The X Factor USA\". Her goal was to show America her unique version of country music. The results were evident when her fan base exploded and has continued to grow ever since. Hannah returned to Nashville to continue performing and writing. Her hard work paid off when she secured four song cuts on the debut album of country artist, Rachele Lynae, on Momentum Label Group. Hannah's newest project, \"The Freedom EP\", was released on Thanksgiving Day 2012. Her current single from the project, \"No Where Left to Roam\" has been sent to Country, Americana, College and Internet radio around the world and is receiving an enthusiastic response. \"The Freedom EP\" includes five original tracks and is available now on all major online stores including iTunes and Amazon, as well as her website.

Godog was founded by Warner Brothers Records Alumni to create an all encompassing music company that supports it's artists with radio promotion and publicity. \"Not Ready to Say I'm Sorry Yet\" is the first release from the joint venture.\n\nMark grew up listening to great songwriters. With Prince, Billy Joel, Little Texas and Garth Brooks as early inspirations, he quickly learned how to write passionate songs. As an only child, he was forced to play all the instruments himself writing and recording over 200 songs before finishing High School.\n\nWhen asked to contribute a song for the local Homeless Awareness Project in his hometown of Toledo, OH, he wrote the song, \"Where's Santa Now?\" That song instantly got airplay so he volunteered to promote the charity in a multi-city holiday acoustic tour.\n\nThe story took a big jump when Radio Promotion legend, Bill Scull heard his song, \"Little Breakdown\" at an ASCAP demo review session.

Hannah always knew she wanted to be an entertainer, but it wasn't until she was ten years old that she made her debut solo performance at her fourth grade Christmas Recital. She sang \"Tender Tennessee Christmas\". After that she was hooked. She focused on nothing else. At fourteen she picked up a Squire acoustic guitar that her younger sister had abandoned and quickly began learning to write. Over the next four years she performed at fairs, coffee houses, shopping malls and talent shows throughout the Upper Midwest. At eighteen Hannah moved to Nashville, TN to make her dreams a reality. She attended Belmont University in Nashville to study the business of music and vocal performance. After two years she decided to leave Belmont and delve deeper into the art of song writing. She also began performing her own material in and around Nashville. In 2010 Hannah released her first EP, a self produced project called, \"No Stopping, Standing, Parking\". It received rave reviews from the Nashville songwriting community. Soon after it's release, she was personally selected to attend the prestigious Horse & Writer Songwriting Invitational by one of Nashville's most successful songwriters, Skip Ewing. Hannah was a contestant on the 2011 season of the reality television show, \"The X Factor USA\". Her goal was to show America her unique version of country music. The results were evident when her fan base exploded and has continued to grow ever since. Hannah returned to Nashville to continue performing and writing. Her hard work paid off when she secured four song cuts on the debut album of country artist, Rachele Lynae, on Momentum Label Group. Hannah's newest project, \"The Freedom EP\", was released on Thanksgiving Day 2012. Her current single from the project, \"No Where Left to Roam\" has been sent to Country, Americana, College and Internet radio around the world and is receiving an enthusiastic response. \"The Freedom EP\" includes five original tracks and is available now on all major online stores including iTunes and Amazon, as well as her website.

It\u2019s a word that keeps recurring in any conversation with Chin Injeti, the talented artist/writer/producer associated with three GRAMMY Award-winning projects, two JUNO Awards, and who is also a co-founder of innovative R&B trio, Bass Is Base. And no wonder: the Vancouver-based Injeti barely has enough fingers to place in the various stylistic musical pies he\u2019s juggling, including his latest solo record entitled, The Reverb. Named after a long defunct Toronto nightclub club that offered a wide palate of musical diverse in its weekly programming, the 14 funky and euphoric tracks of delightful groove-a-lusciousness that comprise The Reverb reveal Injeti\u2019s adaptability as a musical chameleon.

I\u2019m a nerd like that. It really helps me when I make records.\u201d It\u2019s a task that has not only served him well on his own work, but the impressive list of clients he\u2019s amassed in the past few years, many with his production partner DJ Khalil. Among the superstars that they\u2019ve written for and produced: Detroit rap icon Eminem (the GRAMMY winning album Recovery & Call of Duty: Ghosts track \u201cSurvival\u201d); Houston Christian hip-hop artist Lecrae's Grammy-winning album, Gravity; multi-million-seller Pennsylvania pop doyenne P!nk\u2019s album, The Truth About Love; and LA\u2019s Aloe Blacc\u2019s, Lift Your Spirit.

Continuing on his freewheeling journey as a true musical citizen of the world, he follows the release of his acclaimed 2016 album This is Nate Najar with a warm, soulful, multi-faceted recording reflecting his enduring love for the City of Lights, entitled Under Paris Skies, Set for release on Sept. 7, 2018, on Woodward Avenue Records, the 11-track collection explores Najar\u2019s passion for French jazz and pop with a deeper commitment and purpose than ever before and showcases the \u201crabbit hole\u201d of research he did to curate a unique eclectic variety of pop, jazz and classical songs rarely re-imagined by American jazz artists.\n\nWhile a deliberate departure from the jam session vibe and stylistically diverse nature of This is Nate Najar (2016)) the new album harkens back to his theme-driven earlier projects, Aquarela Do Brasil (2014) and Blues For Night People: The Nate Najar Trio Remembers Charlie Byrd (2012). Under Paris Skies is also a dynamic showcase of the trio\u2019s latest lineup (featuring Washington, DC bassist Tommy Cecil and UK drummer Matt Home) and Najar\u2019s work on his beloved Ramirez guitar, which previously belonged to Charlie Byrd. Longtime collaborators of the guitarist, Cecil and Home toured with Najar throughout 2017. \u201cWe\u2019re a solid unit, and it felt like the right one to record the new album with\u201d the guitarist says. Chuck Redd, who has played drums on many previous Najar projects (including Aquarela Do Brasil) adds his lush vibraphone harmonies and solos to two numbers.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t love Paris?\u201d Najar asks whimsically. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who says they don\u2019t want to go there, and if you\u2019ve been, how could you not want to go back? I have a love affair with France, which is a wonderful, romantic place on every level. There is such a rich cultural history, with so much global influence. Paris has traditionally been the center of many movements in classical music, but there\u2019s also an incredible legacy of pop and jazz music many Americans may not be familiar with.\u201d\n\nOne great example is the wonderful singer France Gall. Her song \u201cLa Mort Douce,\u201d featuring Najar\u2019s thoughtful acoustic improvisations and the subtle harmonic shadings of Cecil\u2019s bass, kicks off a deeply melodic, rhythmically diverse and improvisation-rich exploratory journey. Najar pays homage to legendary composer Michel Legrand via a brisk, lighthearted swing arrangement of \u201cI Will Wait for You,\u201d from the 1964 film Umbrellas of Cherbourg; Django Reinhardt, via a soulful, percussive romp through \u201cNuages,\u201d and the iconic Serge Gainsbourg with \u201cLa Javanaise,\u201d a waltz that Najar re-imagines with a spirited Caribbean vibe.\n\nAnother key stop Najar makes on Under Paris Skies is the moody, reflective title track \u201cSous le Ciel de Paris,\u201d from the 1951 film of the same name, penned by composer Hubert Giraud. The spirited \u201cCe Petit Chemin\u201d was originally recorded in the 30\u2019s by the beloved vocalist Mireille. Najar and Cecil engage in a hauntingly hypnotic guitar-bass duet of \u201cApr\u00e8s Un R\u00eave,\u201d which composer Gabriel Faur\u00e9 originally wrote for piano and soprano vocal. Redd\u2019s sensual vibes return on the Charles Aznavour ballad \u201cSa Jeunesse\u201d to join forces with Najar\u2019s strings on an easy flowing romantic adventure.\n\nUptempo, grooving jazz and swing create the buoyant rhythmic foundation of the playful yet intricately rendered Charles Trenet tune \u201cQue reste-t-il a nos amours?\u201d which became the American standard \u201cI Wish You Love,\u201d a huge hit for Keely Smith in 1958. Najar wraps up the collection with \u201cChanson du C\u0153ur Bris\u00e9,\u201d a slightly melancholy, richly improvisational ballad whose raw emotion is underscored by guitarist\u2019s scrapes on the wood; and the breezy, balmy, Brazilian leaning \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d which Najar says needs \u201cno real explanation. I tried to imagine how Joao Gilberto would approach it and gave it my best shot.\u201d\n\nThough he waited until more than a decade into his prolific recording career to create an album solely dedicated to the musical spirit of Paris, Najar has long considered Belgian born French legend Django Reinhardt as one of the guitarists who had the greatest impact on his development. The other two are Wes Montgomery and, obvious to anyone who has followed Najar\u2019s career, Charlie Byrd.\n\nHis three recordings on Candid Records \u2013 including Blues For Night People: The Nate Najar Trio Remembers Charlie Byrd and This Is Nate Najar \u2013 earned him accolades from critics and influential jazz voices alike. Becky Byrd, wife of the late guitarist Charlie Byrd, said, \u201cThere is no doubt that there is a piece of Charlie\u2019s soul in Nate\u2019s mind, heart and fingers.

One listen to his smoky, soulful croon and the breezy way his songs half-step and skip smoothly along the stage, and his hometown Chicago roots are obvious. It was there that Splithoff cut his teeth as a songwriter and performer, and he carried that warm, compositional adventurousness with him to his next and current stop in New York City. The urban soul of the Big Apple taught him to treat the swarms of people buzzing around him as an audience ripe for his evolving pop sound. As Splithoff has grown and moved across various gritty concrete landscapes, so too has his music, which deftly incorporates myriad elements from his surroundings and packages them into one unmistakable pop-soul-dance-urban experience. Splithoff\u2019s style is far from the kitchen-sink mentality permeating much of today\u2019s airwaves: one of his strongest skills may be his ability to draw from his deep bag of tricks\u2014piano, guitar, melody, rhythm\u2014 with precision and harnessed emotion. Now, 2016 finds him writing, touring, and releasing new material, with his sights set on expanding well beyond the two cities of his origin.

While \u201cBreaking Down\u201d and \u201cNo Good\u201d are superb examples of rollicking rock, they are just one of many genres that Hamish dips his toes into on the new album Out Of My Head, produced by Jim Scott (Tom Petty, Tedeschi Trucks Band).

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee. Bandmembers from both Umphrey's and Bisco have further more found each other in The Brain Damaged Eggmen, a Pink Floyd and The Beatles coverband\n\n\nDiscography\n\n* Encephalous Crime (self-released, 1996)\n* Uncivilized Area (1998)\n* Bisco Lives (2000)\n* They Missed the Perfume (2001)\n* Se\u00f1or Boombox (2002)\n* TranceFusion Radio Broadcast Vol. 1-4 (2003)\n* Wind at Four to Fly (2006)\n* Rocket 3 (2007)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The String Cheese Incident ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6386811.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Rock, Bluegrass, Jam, Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The String Cheese Incident (SCI) are a jam band from the United States.

With Jazz as the anchoring foundation, P\u00e9rez\u2019s Global Jazz music is a blend of Panamanian roots, Latin American folk music, West African rhythms, European impressionism \u2013 promoting music as a borderless and multidimensional bridge between all people.\n\nBorn in Panama in 1965, P\u00e9rez started his musical studies when he was three years old with his father, a bandleader and singer. By age 10, he was studying the European classical piano repertoire at the National Conservatory in Panama. After receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics in Panama, he studied jazz composition at the prestigious Berklee College of Music. While still a student, he performed with Jon Hendricks, Terence Blanchard, Slide Hampton, Claudio Roditi and Paquito D\u2019Rivera. Quickly established as a young master, he soon toured and/or recorded with artists such as Dizzy Gillespie United Nations Orchestra from 1989-1992, Jack DeJohnette, Steve Lacy, Lee Konitz, Charlie Haden, Michael Brecker, Joe Lovano, Tito Puente, Wynton Marsalis, Tom Harrell, Gary Burton, and Roy Haynes.\n\nIn 1993, P\u00e9rez turned his focus to his own ensembles and recording projects, releasing several albums as a leader, earning Grammy\u00ae and Latin Grammy\u00ae nominations for Central Avenue (1998), Motherland (2000), Across The Crystal Sea (2008), and Providencia (2010). In 1996, he was signed by producer Tommy Lipuma to join the Impulse label and recorded Panamonk, a tribute to Thelonious Monk which according to DownBeat magazine is one of the most important piano albums in the history of jazz. P\u00e9rez\u2019s album Central Avenue, featured mejoranera music (a style of Panamanian folklore singing) and was chosen as one of the 10 best recordings across genres by TIME Magazine in 1998. A collaboration between P\u00e9rez and the prolific composer and arranger Claus Ogerman, 2008\u2019s Across The Crystal Sea was praised by The Guardian as, \u201cSo ultra-smooth it achieves something like a state of grace.\u201d Ogerman said, \u201cThis is a record I wanted to make before I leave the planet.\u201d P\u00e9rez made his Mack Avenue Records debut in 2010 with the release of Providencia. The album was nominated for a 2011 Grammy\u00ae Award in the category of Best Instrumental Jazz Album.\n\nP\u00e9rez joined the Wayne Shorter Quartet in 2010 with John Patitucci and Brian Blade. This latest iteration from Shorter has been known as a unique and predominant force in improvisational music both at their historic live performances and on several recordings. In 2018 Blue Note records released the highly anticipated EMANON from the Wayne Shorter Quartet which won a Grammy\u00ae in the category of Best Jazz Instrumental album in 2019.\n\nFor several years P\u00e9rez has also been touring with his trio \u2013 featuring Ben Street and Adam Cruz \u2013 and with Children of the Light, a collaboration with fellow Wayne Shorter Quartet members John Patitucci and Brian Blade. Mack Avenue released the Children of the Light album in 2015 to great critical acclaim. P\u00e9rez\u2019s current touring project, the Global Messengers, spreads the idea that music can serve as a natural remedy to unfortunate situations, providing an uplifting message, connection, and common ground. The ensemble features musicians from diverse cultural backgrounds, coming together to build community through music.\n\nAs a composer, P\u00e9rez has been commissioned by The Lincoln Center, Chicago Jazz Festival, and Imani Winds Quintet, among others. His octet for members of the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela was commissioned by Carnegie Hall. In 2014, the Banff Centre commissioned P\u00e9rez to write a piano quintet for the Cecilia String Quartet titled \"Camino de Cruces\" and he also composed the music for the Museum of Biodiversity in Panama, designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry. In 2015, P\u00e9rez premiered another two new compositions: \u201cExpeditions \u2013 Panamania 2015\u201d was premiered at the Panamerican games in Toronto and his \u201cDetroit World Suite \u2013 La Leyenda de Bayano\u201d was premiered at the Detroit Jazz Festival. P\u00e9rez returns to the Detroit Jazz Festival in Fall 2019 for the world premiere of a new piece written for his Global Messengers ensemble and co-commissioned by the Detroit Jazz Festival, London Jazz Festival, National Forum of Music Wroclaw, and Koerner Hall at Royal Academy of Music Toronto.\n\nP\u00e9rez, who served as Goodwill Ambassador to UNICEF, has received a variety of awards for his musical achievements, activism and social work efforts. He is a recipient of the United States Fellowship 2018, and the 2009 Smithsonian Legacy Award. He currently serves as UNESCO Artist for Peace, Cultural Ambassador to the Republic of Panama, Founder and Artistic Director of the Panama Jazz Festival, and the Berklee Global Jazz Institute in Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music.", "otherInfo": "On Friday, May 22, SFJAZZ presents the first of a four-part celebration of legendary saxophonist Wayne Shorter featuring the world premiere of a 2019 all-star tribute concert at the SFJAZZ Center, featuring Kamasi Washington, Terrace Martin, Danilo P\u00e9rez, John Patitucci, and Brian Blade.

Though Ben's family lived just outside of Nashville, much of his time growing up was spent on his grandparent's farm in the town in south Georgia of Cairo. Just as with hearing various styles of music, the experiences and lessons learned from this time influenced Ben's perspective on his music. From the time he was 4 years old, Ben constantly took part in youth church choirs, school talent shows and a few different bands as he discovered more and more about his own sound as an artist. By the time he was in high school, songwriting had become a major focus and goal for him alongside the performing that he had long been captivated with. After graduating from Centennial High School in Franklin, TN, Ben was accepted to Belmont University where he currently studies Music Business.

He's showing. Appropriately titled, the song \"Country\" is as much positioning statement as introduction. In three minutes and 16 seconds, it is almost precisely who he is in word and deed. The vocal delivery, storytelling, musicianship and reflections of his outdoor lifestyle \u2013 as well as faith, family and patriotism \u2013 offer a spot-on portrayal. Joined by early fan favorites \"Clean Up On Aisle Five\" and \"Come Do A Little Life,\" the song carves an unmistakably country yet completely fresh groove for the genre. In short, it sounds like nothing else, but absolutely belongs.\n\nTo paraphrase the song, a life in music isn't a place on a map; it's a place in Mo Pitney's heart. \"I just love music,\" Pitney says, exhibiting atypical maturity for someone still in their early twenties. \"It has never been about praise. Playing the Grand Ole Opry was an amazing experience, but I have just as much fun sitting on my bed playing along to an old record. It's always been that way.\"\n\nThat music-centered outlook is already generating the unsought acclaim of which he speaks. Perhaps the best example is the aforementioned Opry performance. \"Everybody asked me if I was nervous, but I don\u2019t think I was,\" he says. \"I definitely thought about it a lot more than I normally do. My respect for that stage and the circle is great.\n\nFor his first song, he selected \"Clean Up On Aisle Five\" and eyed one goal: to sing his heart out. \"I didn't feel like anybody was sucked into the song at all, but when it was over I stepped back from the microphone and people erupted,\" he says. A standing ovation approaching a full minute ensued. \"After about 30 seconds, I stepped forward to say something because I thought I heard them dying down, but they just got louder. I lost it. It took me about a week to come off that feeling.\"\n\nThat pivotal moment capped a journey that started in the red brick town of Cherry Valley, IL, where Mo grew up loving the outdoors. \"Right out my back door was a lake about a mile away,\" he says. \"I'd ride my bike there with a fishing pole on each handlebar, like two tridents sticking out in front of me.\"\n\nMusic was a family affair, and Pitney picked up the drums at six and guitar at 12. \"I learned how to play with a cast on my arm by laying a rag over my dad's guitar so it wouldn't get scratched,\" he says. \"Johnny Cash At San Quentin was my introduction to playing music. I learned the whole album.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, he played two Cash songs at an open mic night \u2013 his first public performance. \"After I played, I saw a guy backstage playing a banjo, so I picked that up for a couple of years. By age 15, I grabbed the guitar again playing lead acoustic, my brother played bass and we had a friend who played mandolin.\" His affection for bluegrass led him to Keith Whitley. \"When I heard him sing it helped me bridge over into country music. I started hearing great country songs, songwriters and singers ... and I just fell in love.\"\n\nEncouraged to move to Nashville by a songwriting friend, Pitney was the uncommon arrival who receives early interest from record labels. He signed with Curb and began working on bringing his songs and sound into alignment with his musical vision. One of the lynchpins was connecting with his producer, Tony Brown (George Strait).\n\n\"Instead of trying to put some songs together to come out of my mouth and create an artist with my face, Tony said, 'I want to find out who you are, pull it out of you and put it on tape.' It wasn\u2019t just the way he said it, it was in everything he did. Realizing I can create a record the way I want to and use the musicians I want was an eye-opening experience. We recorded my vocals while I was sitting on a stool and playing guitar at the same time, so it\u2019s a live record in a lot of ways. My hands were untied.\"\n\nAs music lovers become exposed to his music, rousing receptions may be something he'll become accustomed to seeing. But they won't change Mo's core motivation. \"Even if this thing doesn\u2019t go huge, I believe that I can make a decent living playing music,\" he says. \"And I always knew that I could do that. When I was younger, my plan was bluegrass. I used to buy and sell cars, I did body work and I trained bird dogs. I figured I would just kind of piddle around, doing different things around the music.\n\n\"People who have done this for a long time think there's a place for my music, and I hope that's the case. My eyes are set on being successful, but success is not number one for me. If I can make a comfortable living and have a career making music and keep my head on straight, that\u2019s my goal. And I think that I have a great opportunity to do that if I don\u2019t get ahead of myself.\"\n\nAnd that kind of seasoned perspective isn't often heard from someone of his generation. \"I\u2019m a God-fearing man,\" he says. \"I love simple things. I love simplicity in songs because I love simplicity in life. But I\u2019m also very deep, which is weird. I\u2019m a thinker. And I go so deep, a lot of times I just confuse myself and get frustrated, but when I come home and my dog runs and jumps up on my lap, that does something to my spirit. I love to hunt and fish. I love the outdoors. I love my family. I try to live pretty morally square. Pretty clean guy. I\u2019ve got my problems, but I try to stay pretty straight.\"\n\nPerhaps the best expression of how Mo Pitney has created his own definition of country music success is found in \"Behind This Guitar,\" a song by Don Sampson and Phil O'Donnell that may not even make the album. \"People tell me I can\u2019t cut it because the chorus says, 'Behind this guitar there\u2019s just a boy who had a dream in his heart, behind this guitar there\u2019s just a guy that can\u2019t believe he got this far.' And they point out that I haven't gotten anywhere yet, so save it for the second album. But I remember sitting on my bed with the dream of just making music the rest of my life. It wasn\u2019t that I had to be on radio or even make a living doing it. I just loved music. Now I\u2019m on the Opry. I have a record deal. And I\u2019m loving the music that I\u2019m making. I can't believe I got this far!\n\n\"I\u2019m probably just going to cut the song.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Vegabonds ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10389435.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Jam Rock, Blues, Country, Americana, Roots Rock, Blues-rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Some might assert that The Vegabonds sound is Americana, while others may consider them to be true rock \u2018n\u2019 rollers.

The uber catchy tune was written by songwriter and Emerson Drive member Danick Dupelle, who came in and played a little groove on his guitar and Lynae said, \u2018that sounds like quicksand.\u2019 So along with songwriter Patricia Conroy, they played around with some 'oohs' for the melody, then focused on relationships that feel like you're stuck and sinking in quicksand.\n\n\"I think we all have stepped into 'quicksand' at one time or another when it comes to relationships, so we figured, why not try to save someone a little heartache,\" said Lynae.\n\nHowever, Lynae\u2019s career is in anything but quicksand. She is morphing at warped speed as a well-rounded force after recording her eponymous self-titled debut which dropped in April 2014. She has been touring across the country performing with some of country music's most celebrated artists including Keith Urban, The Band Perry, Maddie & Tae, Kelsea Ballerini and many more.

I\u2019ve been co-producing with Jamie (O'Neal) and I\u2019m focusing on all things sonically. When I\u2019m writing I\u2019m thinking about everything from the background vocals to special effects to how the song will be arranged. I think about the solo parts on a track. I\u2019m learning how to be a well-rounded musician. What I want to make is ear candy without it sounding too busy kind of like how Shania and Mutt Lange did it.\u201d\n\nLynae can\u2019t help but hark back to when Shania ruled the pop and country chart. Lynae waxes about an era when love songs were in vogue, which is a stark contrast in this era, which toasts conspicuous consumption and frivolity.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re starting to miss the \u201890s and early 2000\u2019s,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cThat was when country music had so many stories that touched on deeper parts of life. However, the recent trend is party songs, which have their place. But there\u2019s something about love songs. That\u2019s what I love to write most. Love is something everyone can relate to. If you\u2019ve never been in love, you yearn for it. If you found love, it\u2019s the most amazing thing that has surpassed anything you\u2019ve ever experienced. Or you could have had love and been crushed beyond your wildest imagination. I think it\u2019s time for love songs to return and for ladies to be on top again.\u201d\n\nLynae will be blazing the way with her big black boots and empowering songs. Like her music, Lynae\u2019s fashion is a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll. \u201cThe way a performer dresses is another form of expression,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cI have that rocker thing going on but I still incorporate the country. I might wear my boots and then have some fringe to blend country and rock, like my sound.\u201d\n\nUnlike many 20-somethings, Lynae understands the art of live performance and delivers onstage like a grizzled veteran. Lynae engages the audience and is often at her best when living in the moment.\n\n\u201cThe more you prepare for a show, the more spontaneous you can be when you perform,\u201d the sage Lynae said. \u201cWhen you have it all down, you can step outside the box. During a recent show in Seattle a microphone literally fell apart. Instead of losing it up there, I just poked fun at the situation. Everyone laughed. I dealt with what happened and the audience left with a memorable concert moment.\u201d\n\nLynae, who has the composure of a Taylor Swift and the charm of the aforementioned Twain, naturally connects with her fans. \u201cI just love to talk with those who come out to see me,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me being me up there. I think if I\u2019m having fun, it gives the audience permission to have fun. The fun is infectious. For me, it\u2019s about getting real and personal. That way every show is different. I don\u2019t follow the same exact formula every time I get onstage. So, I just embrace the imperfections, love to joke around and do what I can to connect with everyone that comes through the door.\u201d\n\nThe fashionable Lynae is light years from the girl who grew up in Alaska. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a name brand was. I didn\u2019t get the concept of it. I was wearing sweat pants back then but Alaska definitely helped shape who I am. It\u2019s an incredibly creative, independent and wild state. Coming from there has had an impact on my music. I\u2019m all about taking chances and making the best music that I can. I\u2019m not the same person I was when I was growing up in Alaska or even when I made my first album. I\u2019m growing and evolving and so is my music.\u201d", "otherInfo": "I am beyond excited to invite you to my (Virtual) Album Release Party!!

A longtime sailor, Legg also notes that \u201ca lot of my childhood memories are of me and my dad on this little tiny boat, cruising around the New England coast. I spent countless hours just sailing and listening to music, and the feeling of that experience has stayed with me really heavily over the years.\u201d Throughout the album, Goldroom reveals his deep-rooted affinity with the ocean by sculpting expansive arrangements and instilling each song with a serene yet kinetic energy.\n\nThat energy\u2019s partly sourced from Goldroom\u2019s ingenuity in interlacing live guitar, bass, and percussion into electronic soundscapes to form a sound both forward-pushing and timeless. On West of the West, he further shapes that glossy but groove-heavy sound by tapping into sensibilities of early French house music. \u201cI don\u2019t feel all that influenced by producers on a day-to-day basis\u2014songwriting is what\u2019s important to me, so I\u2019m usually thinking about guys like Tom Petty or Curtis Mayfield\u2014but there\u2019s an innocence to what producers like Daft Punk and Alan Braxe do that appeals to me,\u201d says Legg. And just as those artists show an intense fascination with the pop landscape of the early \u201980s, Goldroom steeps West of the West in its own nostalgia. \u201cI\u2019ve always used music as an escapist device, as a way to try to get back to that feeling of when you were younger and everything was a little more pure and uncomplicated,\u201d he points out.\n\nOn the album-opening \u201cSilhouette,\u201d for instance, Goldroom brilliantly channels the breezy and bass-powered feel of classic French touch music. Slow-building and warmly intimate, the song bittersweetly muses on \u201cwhat it means to be far away from someone you love and feeling like part of you is missing without them,\u201d as Legg explains.\n\nFrom start to finish West of the West sustains that dreamy melancholy, a mood informed by Legg\u2019s solo touring as a DJ in recent years. \u201cBeing alone on the road for long stretches of time is a pretty unique experience,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s this dual thing of loving that lifestyle of constantly being in motion, but also missing my family and my friends and feeling pulled back home. That\u2019s definitely something I kept coming back to as I was writing for this record.\u201d Trading off vocals with Irish singer/songwriter Rooty throughout West of the West, Goldroom brings a nuanced emotionality to songs like \u201cBack to You\u201d (a sweetly shimmering feel-good track), \u201cLying to You\u201d (a darkly propulsive number with all the cinematic intensity of an \u201980s pop gem), and \u201cRetrograde\u201d (a gorgeously urgent anthem driven by Rooty\u2019s powerful vocal performance).\n\nIn creating West of the West, Goldroom aimed to \u201cdig really deep and come up with something more honest and meaningful than what you usually see in dance music.\u201d Aided by his graceful grasp of songcraft, that honesty manifests itself in a spirited vitality also abundant in Goldroom\u2019s energetic live show. (Featuring a full band setup, the Goldroom live set finds Legg backed by a bassist, drummer, and fellow singer as he alternates between guitar and keys.) \u201cIt\u2019s a lot different from older Goldroom stuff, where my primary concern was whether or not the song was going to work on a dance floor,\u201d Legg adds in reflecting on West of the West.\n\nDebuting with the Angeles EP in 2011, Goldroom emerged soon after the dissolution of Legg\u2019s former band NightWaves. \u201cI\u2019d been writing all these songs but had no outlet for them, so people suggested I start a solo thing,\u201d recalls Legg, who borrowed the name Goldroom from a dive bar in Echo Park (\u201ca good place to get drunk and find answers to all of life\u2019s hardest questions\u201d). Though Goldroom was born from his then-burgeoning infatuation with the electronic world, the project drew closely from Legg\u2019s near-lifelong experience in making music. Raised in Wellesley, Massachusetts, he learned to play cello and guitar as a child and soon started writing his own songs and self-recording on a four-track. At age 15 he had a major musical awakening while teaching sailing on Cape Cod, where a group of college kids turned him on to the \u201960s/\u201970s rock and folk artists who would eventually guide his own songwriting. After heading off to study at the University of Southern California, Legg discovered Air, Daft Punk, and other electronic artists whose music \u201cmade me feel things I didn\u2019t know that I could feel.\u201d He then began his journey toward crafting boldly inventive electronic music with a classic-pop songwriting structure at its core.\n\nFor Goldroom, the main thrill of West of the West is his success in \u201cmaking a record where I could sit down with an acoustic guitar, play the album all the way through, and still make it work.\u201d But while each song is strong enough to stand unadorned, West of the West\u2019s lush and luminous production ultimately lends the album an even greater emotional depth. \u201cThere\u2019s something really incredible about beautiful chords being played using a stack of nicely tuned synthesizers,\u201d Legg says in discussing his passion for electronic music. \u201cAnd with a drum machine, you can make a kick-drum sound that\u2019s more impactful than any real kick drum. There\u2019s a whole world out there with electronic music, and the thing that gets me most excited as a musician is finding new ways to paint with those palettes while still telling a very human story.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join us for this episode of Music Lives ON, an on-going series that will happen every Friday night on LiveXLive.

Instead it was his dad that helped shape his musical palate as father and son first farmed together and then worked side by side building custom motorcycles, motors and restoring classic cars, all to dad\u2019s soundtrack of Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Dr. Hook.\n\nDustin attended college ultimately earning a Master's degree and landing a job in corporate banking. In the end, his career took him far from the finance world as he became the owner of his own business building muscle cars for six years, but even the need for speed didn\u2019t give him what he truly wanted.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to play music,\u201d says Olson. \u201cEven when I was working in racing and had my shop, I would always go see live music and wish I could do that.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2009 that Dustin mentioned to his brother Jared how he wished he could play. Remembering that conversation Jared, a guitar player himself, gifted Dustin a jet black Stratocaster. Dustin dove in but like most guitar students, got frustrated and within a few months he put the guitar down, opting instead to run sound for a local country band. That led to Dustin hosting open mic nights at a local bar which reignited his desire to play, so much so he walked into a local guitar shop and walked out with his new best friend, an acoustic Taylor guitar.\n\nFrom that point his sole focus was learning to play, eventually learning enough chords to play George Strait\u2019s \u201cTroubadour.\u201d Excited he showed his brother who immediately insisted on dragging Dustin onstage to perform it with him that night. That night turned into another night, and another, until Dustin formally joined his brother and Melissa Olson to become a full-fledged acoustic trio performing gigs all over the area as The Olson Band.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Olson formed his own band, the Blue Collar Rebellion. Playing many of the same bars, Olson performed primarily covers but introduced his newfound fans to the likes of \u2018red dirt\u2019 country. Artists like Cross Canadian Ragweed, Pat Green, Bart Crow, Randy Rogers, Charlie Robison filled his set lists and began to lay the groundwork for the songwriter Dustin was becoming.\n\nWhile he became more and more comfortable onstage, it was the loss of his mother in October of 2013 that solidified his belief in himself. On the day of her memorial service he and his brother strapped on their guitars and performed their mom\u2019s favorite song, Eric Church\u2019s \u201cLike Jesus Does\u201d and likewise played it again at their show that night. Understandably the second time around was too much but Dustin got through the tears, the song and the show because he knew that\u2019s what his mom would want him to do.\n\nBy 2015 Dustin was taking regular trips to Nashville. The visits got more frequent and Nashville got harder and harder to leave to the point he eventually gave in to his heart, selling his business and in early 2016 making the move to Music City.\n\n\u201cIt was exactly where I wanted to be and scary as hell all at the same time. I don\u2019t think I played out live for the first nine months I lived in Nashville because everyone is so good.\u201d\n\nThe days of self-doubt are now a thing of the past as Olson has forged a number of friendships and writing partnerships with some of Nashville\u2019s songwriting elite, some even considering him in that circle as well. Now with a fully loaded band behind him the time has come to pack up his guitar, load up his growing list of songs and take it all out where it needs to be to breathe \u2013 out on the road.\n\n\n\nThe Music\n\nAfter countless hours of songwriting and the production brilliance of Marc \"Butter\" Fortney (Trailer Choir) Dustin's debut EP, \"Prayer Of A Simple Man,\" was released in November of 2017. The album reached as high as #14 on the iTunes country Pre-Order chart and debuted in the top 100 on the iTunes country chart on release day. Since its release the songs of \"Prayer of a Simple Man\" have gathered nearly 25,000 streams and racked up over 20,000 music video views in 2018 alone.\n\n\n\nMoving forward 2019 is already shaping up to be a big year with a whole bunch of new music and new tour locations already on the calendar. Dustin's next single, \"Memories We Didn't Make,\" is set to release on March 1st and is a complete change of pace from the fun party songs that made up his debut EP. This new single, inspired by a breakup, shows a softer more fragile side of Dustin that we have not previously seen. Dustin is planning on releasing at least two more songs by the end of the summer and using all of that forward momentum and new material to take his touring and music to the next level throughout the year.", "otherInfo": "\ud83d\udce3NEW MUSIC ALERT! 05.08.20 Pre-Save \"Make You Fall\" Today! https://ffm.to/makeyoufall.opr\n\nThen join me for a first listen on May 8th.

Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become.

They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed.

With Jazz as the anchoring foundation, P\u00e9rez\u2019s Global Jazz music is a blend of Panamanian roots, Latin American folk music, West African rhythms, European impressionism \u2013 promoting music as a borderless and multidimensional bridge between all people.\n\nBorn in Panama in 1965, P\u00e9rez started his musical studies when he was three years old with his father, a bandleader and singer. By age 10, he was studying the European classical piano repertoire at the National Conservatory in Panama. After receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics in Panama, he studied jazz composition at the prestigious Berklee College of Music. While still a student, he performed with Jon Hendricks, Terence Blanchard, Slide Hampton, Claudio Roditi and Paquito D\u2019Rivera. Quickly established as a young master, he soon toured and/or recorded with artists such as Dizzy Gillespie United Nations Orchestra from 1989-1992, Jack DeJohnette, Steve Lacy, Lee Konitz, Charlie Haden, Michael Brecker, Joe Lovano, Tito Puente, Wynton Marsalis, Tom Harrell, Gary Burton, and Roy Haynes.\n\nIn 1993, P\u00e9rez turned his focus to his own ensembles and recording projects, releasing several albums as a leader, earning Grammy\u00ae and Latin Grammy\u00ae nominations for Central Avenue (1998), Motherland (2000), Across The Crystal Sea (2008), and Providencia (2010). In 1996, he was signed by producer Tommy Lipuma to join the Impulse label and recorded Panamonk, a tribute to Thelonious Monk which according to DownBeat magazine is one of the most important piano albums in the history of jazz. P\u00e9rez\u2019s album Central Avenue, featured mejoranera music (a style of Panamanian folklore singing) and was chosen as one of the 10 best recordings across genres by TIME Magazine in 1998. A collaboration between P\u00e9rez and the prolific composer and arranger Claus Ogerman, 2008\u2019s Across The Crystal Sea was praised by The Guardian as, \u201cSo ultra-smooth it achieves something like a state of grace.\u201d Ogerman said, \u201cThis is a record I wanted to make before I leave the planet.\u201d P\u00e9rez made his Mack Avenue Records debut in 2010 with the release of Providencia. The album was nominated for a 2011 Grammy\u00ae Award in the category of Best Instrumental Jazz Album.\n\nP\u00e9rez joined the Wayne Shorter Quartet in 2010 with John Patitucci and Brian Blade. This latest iteration from Shorter has been known as a unique and predominant force in improvisational music both at their historic live performances and on several recordings. In 2018 Blue Note records released the highly anticipated EMANON from the Wayne Shorter Quartet which won a Grammy\u00ae in the category of Best Jazz Instrumental album in 2019.\n\nFor several years P\u00e9rez has also been touring with his trio \u2013 featuring Ben Street and Adam Cruz \u2013 and with Children of the Light, a collaboration with fellow Wayne Shorter Quartet members John Patitucci and Brian Blade. Mack Avenue released the Children of the Light album in 2015 to great critical acclaim. P\u00e9rez\u2019s current touring project, the Global Messengers, spreads the idea that music can serve as a natural remedy to unfortunate situations, providing an uplifting message, connection, and common ground. The ensemble features musicians from diverse cultural backgrounds, coming together to build community through music.\n\nAs a composer, P\u00e9rez has been commissioned by The Lincoln Center, Chicago Jazz Festival, and Imani Winds Quintet, among others. His octet for members of the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela was commissioned by Carnegie Hall. In 2014, the Banff Centre commissioned P\u00e9rez to write a piano quintet for the Cecilia String Quartet titled \"Camino de Cruces\" and he also composed the music for the Museum of Biodiversity in Panama, designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry. In 2015, P\u00e9rez premiered another two new compositions: \u201cExpeditions \u2013 Panamania 2015\u201d was premiered at the Panamerican games in Toronto and his \u201cDetroit World Suite \u2013 La Leyenda de Bayano\u201d was premiered at the Detroit Jazz Festival. P\u00e9rez returns to the Detroit Jazz Festival in Fall 2019 for the world premiere of a new piece written for his Global Messengers ensemble and co-commissioned by the Detroit Jazz Festival, London Jazz Festival, National Forum of Music Wroclaw, and Koerner Hall at Royal Academy of Music Toronto.\n\nP\u00e9rez, who served as Goodwill Ambassador to UNICEF, has received a variety of awards for his musical achievements, activism and social work efforts. He is a recipient of the United States Fellowship 2018, and the 2009 Smithsonian Legacy Award. He currently serves as UNESCO Artist for Peace, Cultural Ambassador to the Republic of Panama, Founder and Artistic Director of the Panama Jazz Festival, and the Berklee Global Jazz Institute in Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music.", "otherInfo": "On Friday, May 22, SFJAZZ presents the first of a four-part celebration of legendary saxophonist Wayne Shorter featuring the world premiere of a 2019 all-star tribute concert at the SFJAZZ Center, featuring Kamasi Washington, Terrace Martin, Danilo P\u00e9rez, John Patitucci, and Brian Blade.

A fusion of these genres can be heard in most of their songs as well as covers.\n\nThe String Cheese Incident has been described as a democratic ensemble rather than a band, since all of the members contribute their own original compositions to the group's burgeoning library and share the vocal burden on a number of cover versions as well as their own songs.

A reminder of the darker period of Bob Dylan, and it\u2019s that good, that memorable...\u201d\n\nIn 2018 his charming Christmas song \u201cFly Possum Fly\u201d (featuring county singing sensation EmiSunshine) was both a radio single and a children\u2019s book.

She has collaborated and shared the stage with countless celebrated artists including the Avett Brothers, Langhorne Slim, Drew Holcomb & The Neighbors and the Secret Sisters, and her music has been featured on Grey\u2019s Anatomy, The Good Wife, Nashville, Wynonna Earp and American Idol.

She explores the isolation and joy of motherhood, the loss not of a lover, but a partner, the experience of growing older in a world that expects you to stay young forever. With co-producer Lucas Morton and help from friends including Grammy winning songwriting duo Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk, Natlie Hemby and Andrews\u2019 Hush Kids bandmate Peter Groenwald, Thirties is at once profoundly intimate and artfully infectious, evocative of greats Lucinda Williams, Chrissie Hynde and Brandi Carlile.\n\nAndrews lives in Nashville, Tennessee with her children Nico, Falcon, and husband, Jerred.

Williams made it to the top 4 on ABC's Rising Star. In addition, further proof can also be found on her YouTube channel, where Williams has garnered thousands of views offering soulful takes on songs by Shawn Mendes, Lana del Ray and Rihanna. Her cover of Lorde's song 'Team' was championed by America's golden boy Ryan Seacrest! Her channel also sets the stage for duets with fellow musicians Gavin Turek, Jessie Payo and actress/musician Leighton Meester among others.\n\nHaving given fans a teasing taste last year with her debut single, ironically titled, 'Keep Me Waiting', Williams finally released her 5-track 'The Lonely One EP' in March 2014.", "otherInfo": "Live Performance"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "HuDost ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7815276.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Neo-folk-world-rock, Eastern Fusion, Rock, Folk, Country, Sufi-kirtan", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The music of HuDost, the Neo-Folk-World-Rock Ensemble from Montreal and KY, weaves a seamless tapestry of sound that renders tears and laughter in listeners, cultivating the nameless longing that abides somewhere in all our hearts and invoking total celebration. HuDost\u2019s core musicians are Moksha Sommer and Jemal Wade Hines. Having toured the US, Canada, and Europe constantly since April 2006, HuDost has grown and expanded, travelled rocky and glorious terrain and marveled at all they can learn and explore. Moksha and Jemal Wade, in this time have grown as artists, as seekers, as a couple and as a family. In 2013 their amazing son was brought into the world. Since 2015 they have also been highly engaged activists, doing advocacy work as KY Congressional District Representatives for ONE (a non-profit organization working to end extreme poverty and, specifically, the sexism of poverty).\n\nHuDost is currently in the studio recording a new album with Vance Powell who is a top tier producer/mixer who\u2019s worked with artists such as Jack White (White Stripes), Chris Stapleton, Pearl Jam, Willie Nelson, Buddy Guy, Beyonce, Beck, Alicia Keys, Melissa Etheridge, Kings of Leon and a slew of others. And, to add to this excitement, Dan Haseltine from the Grammy winning band Jars of Clay has been on board to help with production! This album will be released in early 2019.\n\nHuDost functions as a duo (with the core musicians Moksha Sommer and Jemal Wade Hines) or as a band, including guest musicians of varying sensibilities and backgrounds, and often including dance in their shows. As a duo their instrumentation includes vocals, harmonium (Indian Pump-Organ), NORD Keys, guitars, Dulcinet, percussion, and a slew of sonic ambient effects. Their music is a rich, eclectic blending of Pop and Rock with traditional Sufi music, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian and Balkan folk music, Farsi, Turkish, Arabic, and Folk. Their sound crosses all borders and barriers, taking the listener on a journey they will never forget.\n\nHighlight Performances Include Bonnaroo, Resident band at FloydFest, BhaktiFest, World Caf\u00e9 Live, Blissfest, The ARK, Alex Grey\u2019s CoSM, the Salvador Dali Museum, Beloved Festival, headlining The Islands Folk Fest (Vancouver), The Levitt Pavilions, WoodSongs at the Kentucky Theater (on PBS), Nashville\u2019s Bluebird Caf\u00e9, Music City Roots, Tim Robbins\u2019 WTF?!

In 2008, Moksha went through a painful process of brain surgery due to a tumor. The healing from this included re-learning language skills, losing and regaining proper sight, and experiencing seizures. This could have been staggering but instead served as learning that has fueled a potent desire to bring healing through sound. It is through music that the losses and gains, pains and triumphs, and excruciating beauty of life can be given a voice of empathy to the synonymous lives of all people.

He quickly moved from playing soul and rock to blues, jazz and classical music. His eclectic tastes caused him to explore all types of music as a player and a composer. John studied classical bass at San Francisco State University and Long Beach State University. In 1980, he continued his career in Los Angeles as a studio musician and a jazz artist. MVP As a studio musician, John has played on countless albums with artists such as B.B. King, Bonnie Raitt, Chick Corea, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Michael Brecker, George Benson, Dizzy Gillespie, Was Not Was, Dave Grusin, Natalie Cole, Bon Jovi, Queen Latifah, Sting, and Carly Simon. In 1986, John was voted by his peers in the studios as the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences MVP (Most Valuable Player) on acoustic bass. As a performer, he has played throughout the world with his own band, and with jazz luminaries Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Stan Getz, Wynton Marsalis, Joshua Redman, Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Freddie Hubbard, Tony Williams, Hubert Laws, Mulgrew Miller, James Williams, and scores of others. Some of the many pop and Brazilian artists he has played with include Sting, Aaron Neville, Natalie Cole, Carole King, Milton Nascimiento, Astrud and Joao Gilberto, Airto and Flora Purim, Ivan Lins, Joao Bosco and Dori Caymmi. John has worked with film composers Jerry Goldsmith, Ry Cooder, James Newton Howard, Dave Grusin, Henry Mancini, John Williams, Mark Isham, Michel Columbier, Carter Burwell, and Howard Shore. AT THE FOREFRONT Since 1985, his association with Chick Corea has brought him worldwide acclaim and put him at the forefront of the jazz world. His many recordings with Chick Corea's Elektric Band and Akoustic Band, his six solo recordings for GRP Records and his subsequent recordings have brought him two Grammy Awards (one for playing and one for composing) and over fifteen Grammy nominations. In addition, his first solo recording, JOHN PATITUCCI, went to number one on the Billboard Jazz charts. He arranged and produced his own records as well as those of other artists. In1996, he signed with Concord Jazz and has released five records on their label: One More Angel, Now, Imprint, Communion and Songs, Stories and Spirituals. The two most recent recordings were nominated for Grammy Awards in the composition category. John has won many magazine polls for his electric and acoustic bass playing, including Best Jazz Bassist in Guitar Player Magazine's 1992, 1994 and 1995 Readers' Poll and Best Jazz Bassist in Bass Player Magazine's 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996 Readers' Poll. He has taught many seminars on playing and composing at prestigious music schools worldwide and was formerly the Artistic Director of the Bass Collective, a comprehensive school for bassists in New York City. John is also regularly involved with The Thelonius Monk Institute of Jazz and has taught at the Betty Carter Jazz Ahead program in Washington, D. C. in 2000. INTO XXI CENTURY In 2002, John began teaching at The City College of New York upon the retirement of Ron Carter from his teaching duties there. In 2003, John was appointed Associate Professor of Jazz Studies at City College. After exploring many different writing styles on his own records and those of Chick Corea's, John continues to compose for many mediums. In 1994 he was commissioned to write a piece for six-string electric bass and string orchestra for the Italian chamber orchestra Suono e Oltre in Pescara, Italy. With John as soloist, the piece was performed in March of 1995 in Italy and in August of 1995 with the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in Tokyo. John was also commissioned to write a piece for the Turtle Island String Quartet, a group fluent in both classical and jazz music. Since moving back to the New York area in 1996, John has continued to work with his own group, as well as many others. He has toured the world with his group, The John Patitucci Quartet. He was the featured Jazz Bassist at the 1999 International Society of Bassists convention. In 1998, John was a part of the Roy Haynes Trio, along with Danilo Perez on piano. This trio recorded a critically acclaimed album for Verve Records and has toured throughout the world. In the Fall of 2001, John toured the United States as member of an all-star quintet called Directions in Music led by Herbie Hancock and featuring Michael Brecker, Roy Hargrove and Brian Blade. Subsequently they released a live CD entitled Live at Massey Hall which became a Grammy Award winner. 2000-2004 In the year 2000, John had begun working again with the legendary Wayne Shorter, touring the world in a new quartet featuring Danilo Perez on piano and Brian Blade on drums. This group released a live recording, Footprints Live, that was the result of their Summer 2001 World Tour and it was nominated for a Grammy. Following that, a studio recording was released in 2003 entitled Alegria which won a Grammy. Also in 2003, John took part in a commission project by the string quartet Elements entitled Snapshots. His string quartet composition was performed at Merkin Hall alongside works by composers John Corigliano and David del Tredici. In January 2004, the Wayne Shorter Quartet played with the Orchestra de Lyon in Paris under the direction of the talented David Robertson (new musical director of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra) for a week of concerts in various formations. The quartet then took part in a residency with the BBC Radio Orchestra in London. Other highlights in 2004 include recording with legendary pianist Hank Jones, a summer reunion tour of Europe with Chick Corea, taking part in Michael Brecker's Grammy award winning recording Wide Angles, performing with pianist Kenny Barron at Orchestra Hall in Detroit, playing on the soundtrack of the remake of The Manchurian Candidate starring Denzel Washington, performing the Mendelssohn Sextet and a Bach Brandenburg Concerto on a chamber music concert at Concordia College featuring violist Lawrence Dutton of the Emerson String Quartet, touring with his own group and teaching seminars. Also in 2004, John recorded on Herbie Hancock's latest project (not yet released) and performed in concerts with The John Scofield Trio and Roy Haynes' Birds of a Feather group featuring Kenny Garrett and Nicholas Payton. 2005 In 2005, John has recorded and/or played with Jack DeJohnette, Danilo Perez, Kenny Barron, again with Hank Jones and Steve Khan. At this year's Chamber Music concert at Concordia College, John premiered a piece he wrote for his friend Larry Dutton for viola and piano entitled Gardens and Pools, which was a commission work inspired by the painting of artist Sedar Arat. John also performed on a recording with his friend Jeremy McCoy, Assistant Principal Bassist with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra entitled Dialogues with the Double Bass on Bridge Records. He recorded two original pieces and the Bottesini Duetto No. 3 for Two Basses with Jeremy on this recording. Also this year, John has continued to be busy with the Wayne Shorter Quartet, which recently performed again at Carnegie Hall as part of the JVC Jazz Festival and released a new recording entitled Beyond the Sound Barrier. John has also begun touring with his new guitar trio featuring guitarist Adam Rogers and a revolving drum chair that can feature the likes of Brian Blade, Clarence Penn and Nasheet Waits.

Instead it was his dad that helped shape his musical palate as father and son first farmed together and then worked side by side building custom motorcycles, motors and restoring classic cars, all to dad\u2019s soundtrack of Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Dr. Hook.\n\nDustin attended college ultimately earning a Master's degree and landing a job in corporate banking. In the end, his career took him far from the finance world as he became the owner of his own business building muscle cars for six years, but even the need for speed didn\u2019t give him what he truly wanted.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to play music,\u201d says Olson. \u201cEven when I was working in racing and had my shop, I would always go see live music and wish I could do that.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2009 that Dustin mentioned to his brother Jared how he wished he could play. Remembering that conversation Jared, a guitar player himself, gifted Dustin a jet black Stratocaster. Dustin dove in but like most guitar students, got frustrated and within a few months he put the guitar down, opting instead to run sound for a local country band. That led to Dustin hosting open mic nights at a local bar which reignited his desire to play, so much so he walked into a local guitar shop and walked out with his new best friend, an acoustic Taylor guitar.\n\nFrom that point his sole focus was learning to play, eventually learning enough chords to play George Strait\u2019s \u201cTroubadour.\u201d Excited he showed his brother who immediately insisted on dragging Dustin onstage to perform it with him that night. That night turned into another night, and another, until Dustin formally joined his brother and Melissa Olson to become a full-fledged acoustic trio performing gigs all over the area as The Olson Band.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Olson formed his own band, the Blue Collar Rebellion. Playing many of the same bars, Olson performed primarily covers but introduced his newfound fans to the likes of \u2018red dirt\u2019 country. Artists like Cross Canadian Ragweed, Pat Green, Bart Crow, Randy Rogers, Charlie Robison filled his set lists and began to lay the groundwork for the songwriter Dustin was becoming.\n\nWhile he became more and more comfortable onstage, it was the loss of his mother in October of 2013 that solidified his belief in himself. On the day of her memorial service he and his brother strapped on their guitars and performed their mom\u2019s favorite song, Eric Church\u2019s \u201cLike Jesus Does\u201d and likewise played it again at their show that night. Understandably the second time around was too much but Dustin got through the tears, the song and the show because he knew that\u2019s what his mom would want him to do.\n\nBy 2015 Dustin was taking regular trips to Nashville. The visits got more frequent and Nashville got harder and harder to leave to the point he eventually gave in to his heart, selling his business and in early 2016 making the move to Music City.\n\n\u201cIt was exactly where I wanted to be and scary as hell all at the same time. I don\u2019t think I played out live for the first nine months I lived in Nashville because everyone is so good.\u201d\n\nThe days of self-doubt are now a thing of the past as Olson has forged a number of friendships and writing partnerships with some of Nashville\u2019s songwriting elite, some even considering him in that circle as well. Now with a fully loaded band behind him the time has come to pack up his guitar, load up his growing list of songs and take it all out where it needs to be to breathe \u2013 out on the road.\n\n\n\nThe Music\n\nAfter countless hours of songwriting and the production brilliance of Marc \"Butter\" Fortney (Trailer Choir) Dustin's debut EP, \"Prayer Of A Simple Man,\" was released in November of 2017. The album reached as high as #14 on the iTunes country Pre-Order chart and debuted in the top 100 on the iTunes country chart on release day. Since its release the songs of \"Prayer of a Simple Man\" have gathered nearly 25,000 streams and racked up over 20,000 music video views in 2018 alone.\n\n\n\nMoving forward 2019 is already shaping up to be a big year with a whole bunch of new music and new tour locations already on the calendar. Dustin's next single, \"Memories We Didn't Make,\" is set to release on March 1st and is a complete change of pace from the fun party songs that made up his debut EP. This new single, inspired by a breakup, shows a softer more fragile side of Dustin that we have not previously seen. Dustin is planning on releasing at least two more songs by the end of the summer and using all of that forward momentum and new material to take his touring and music to the next level throughout the year.", "otherInfo": "\ud83d\udce3NEW MUSIC ALERT! 05.08.20 Pre-Save \"Make You Fall\" Today! https://ffm.to/makeyoufall.opr\n\nThen join me for a first listen on May 8th.

Shorter has recorded dozens of albums as a leader, and appeared on dozens more with others. Many of his compositions have become standards.\n\nShorter was born in Newark, New Jersey, and attended Newark Arts High School. He was encouraged by his father to take up the saxophone as a teenager (his brother Alan became a trumpeter). After graduating from New York University in 1956 Shorter spent two years in the US Army, during which time he played briefly with Horace Silver, and after his discharge from the army with Maynard Ferguson.\n\nIn 1959 Shorter joined Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers. He stayed with Blakey for five years, and eventually became musical director for the group. In 1964, Miles Davis persuaded Shorter to leave Blakey and join the Miles Davis Quintet alongside Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams. Davis had been searching for a saxophonist to replace John Coltrane for some time, and the new quintet is considered by many to have been Davis's strongest working group. Shorter composed extensively for Davis (\"Prince of Darkness\", \"ESP\", \"Footprints\", \"Sanctuary\", and many others; on some albums he provided half of the compositions).\n\nHerbie Hancock had this to say of Shorter's tenure in the group: \"The master writer to me, in that group, was Wayne Shorter. He still is a master. Wayne was one of the few people who brought music to Miles that didn't get changed.\" Davis said: \"Wayne is a real composer. He writes scores, write the parts for everybody just as he wants them to sound. He also brought in a kind of curiosity about working with musical rules. If they didn't work, then he broke them, but with musical sense; he understood that freedom in music was the ability to know the rules in order to bend them to your own satisfaction and taste.\"\n\nSimultaneously with his time in the Miles Davis quintet, Shorter recorded several albums for Blue Note Records, featuring almost exclusively his own compositions. He also recorded occasionally as a sideman (again, mainly for Blue Note) with Donald Byrd, McCoy Tyner, Grachan Moncur III, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, and band mates Hancock and Williams. Until 1968 he played tenor saxophone exclusively; by the early 1970s, however, he chiefly played soprano saxophone.\n\nShorter remained in Davis's band after the breakup of the quintet in 1968, playing on early jazz fusion recordings including In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew (both 1969). His last live dates and studio recordings with Davis were in 1970.\n\nIn 1970, along with keyboardist Joe Zawinul (also a veteran of the Miles Davis group), Shorter formed Weather Report. Other original members were bassist Miroslav Vitous, percussionist Airto Moreira, and drummer Alphonse Mouzon. Shorter and Zawinul co-led the group until late 1985 with a variety of other musicians, and separately wrote most of Weather Report's material. Shorter also recorded critically acclaimed albums as leader, notably Native Dancer, which featured Brazilian composer and vocalist Milton Nascimento, and Atlantis.\n\nAfter leaving Weather Report, Shorter continued to record and lead groups in jazz fusion styles, and contributed to several albums by Joni Mitchell. He has also maintained an occasional working relationship with Herbie Hancock, including appearances on several of Hancock's albums, the VSOP band (essentially a revival of the 1960s Miles Davis quintet with Freddie Hubbard substituting for Davis), and a tribute album recorded shortly after Davis's death with Hancock, Carter, Williams and Wallace Roney.\n\nShorter formed his current band in 2000, the first permanent acoustic group under his leadership. The quartet is composed of pianist Danilo Perez, bassist John Patitucci, and drummer Brian Blade. Two albums of live recordings featuring this quartet have been released (Footprints Live (2001) and Beyond the Sound Barrier (2005)). The quartet has received great acclaim from fans and critics, and the musicians have come to consider themselves family on and off stage. Shorter's 2003 album Alegria received a 2004 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Jazz Album; it features the quartet with a host of other musicians, including pianist Brad Mehldau, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington and former Weather Report percussionist Alex Acu\u00f1a.\n\nShorter's wife Ana Maria and their niece Dalila were both killed on TWA Flight 800 in 1996, and he married Carolina Dos Santos, a close friend of Ana Maria, in 1999.

Dedicating their 1996 debut 'Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi' to bossa nova pioneer Antonio Carlos Jobim, the Washington, D.C.-based duo have spent nearly two decades creating boundary-warping, complexly crafted electronic music partly inspired by bossa nova\u2019s intricate rhythms and lush textures. Now, with their seventh studio album 'Saudade,' Thievery Corporation present their first release devoted entirely to the Brazilian-born genre that first connected them. \u201cWe always try to progress into something different and stretch our musical chops, and taking a whole album to dive into this one sound seemed like a really great way to do that,\u201d says Hilton. Adds Garza: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a departure for us, but at the same time these are our roots, this is what brought us together. It\u2019s us coming full circle from electronic music back to something organic before we move on to our next chapter.\u201d\n\nReleased on their own label ESL Music, 'Saudade' borrows its title from a Portuguese word meaning \u201ca longing for something or someone that is lost, a contented melancholy, or, simply, the presence of absence.\u201d \u201cSaudade is the essence or feeling of true bossa nova,\u201d explains Hilton, who names \u201cthose warm, soulful, melancholic vocals\u201d as one of the elements of bossa nova that\u2019s most alluring to him. Drawing influence from classic Brazilian performers like Antonio Carlos Jobim, Gal Costa, and Luis Bonf\u00e1\u2014along with Serge Gainsbourg, Ennio Morricone, and more modern artists like electro-samba pioneer Isabelle Antena\u2014Saudade achieves its delicate yet deeply sensuous sound with the help of more than a dozen guest musicians. With each track sung by one of five female vocalists (including longtime Thievery cohort LouLou Ghelichkhani, newcomer Elin Melgarejo, Nouvelle Vague singer Karina Zeviani, Argentine chanteuse Natalia Clavier, and former Bitter:Sweet singer/songwriter Shana Halligan), the endlessly mesmerizing album also features such guests as U.N.K.L.E. drummer Michael Lowery, Argentine singer/songwriter Federico Aubele, and master Brazilian percussionist Roberto Santos.\n\nAlthough Thievery Corporation stay true to traditional bossa nova\u2019s elegant fusion of samba and jazz all throughout 'Saudade,' the album is rich with strange and wonderful flourishes that revel in the duo\u2019s hyper-inventive tendencies. Opening with the dusky \u201cD\u00e9collage,\u201d 'Saudade' glides from the smoldering and string-drenched \u201cQuem Me Leva\u201d to the hushed and mysterious \u201cSola In Citta\u201d (an Italian-sung nod to the legendary sound tracks of Ennio Morricone, featuring Wurlitzer electric piano by Enea Diotaiuti) to the sweetly ethereal \u201cNo More Disguise\u201d (a dream-like piece laced with orchestral strings and bolero rhythms). With the instrumental title track serving as its gently stunning centerpiece, 'Saudade' also offers the sultry and spacey\u201cClaridad\u201d (a swaying Latin number propelled by analog organ beats) and the French lullaby of \u201cLe Coeur\u201d (featuring the sublime saxophone work of Frank Mitchell, Jr.). And on the final track \u201cDepth of My Soul,\u201d Halligan delivers a haunting vocal performance that merges with the song\u2019s swirling symphonic soundscape to hypnotic effect.\n\nOver the years, Thievery Corporation have given nods to their bossa-nova influence on individual album tracks, slipping those quietly enchanting songs into recordings that reveal the duo\u2019s careful studying of everything from Jamaican dub reggae to punk to vintage film soundtracks to psychedelic space rock. After coming up with sketches for several bossa-nova-style numbers while recording their last studio album (2011\u2019s Culture of Fear), Garza and Hilton considered releasing an EP showcasing a handful of Brazilian-inspired songs. \u201cThe more we worked on those songs, the more we got into the vibe of that vintage, organic sound,\u201d recalls Hilton. \u201cMaking an album fully dedicated to that sound felt like a good idea, especially at a time when the electronic dance music world is so saturated and there\u2019s not much of a focus on musicianship.\u201d Rather than feeling hemmed in by the unfamiliar approach of creating music solely in one style, Thievery Corporation found a great deal of freedom in writing and recording the songs that make up 'Saudade.' \u201cIn a way it was really liberating to do something out of our wheelhouse, to put ourselves in a totally different mindset and immerse ourselves in this one particular genre,\u201d notes Garza.\n\nIntense musical exploration has always been essential to Thievery Corporation, a project hatched in 1995 when Hilton and Garza were introduced by a mutual friend at Washington, D.C.\u2019s Eighteenth Street Lounge\u2014a popular gathering spot for musicians that\u2019s co-owned by Hilton. Soon after making their 1996 debut with two underground hit vinyl singles(\u201cShaolin Satellite\u201d and \u201c2001 Spliff Odyssey\u201d) and 'Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi,' the duo became loosely associated with the trip-hop scene that had newly emerged in the UK. In 2000, they released 'Mirror Conspiracy,' which introduced live vocalists (including Bebel Gilberto and the late Pam Bricker) into the project\u2019s mix. Following 2002\u2019s 'The Richest Man in Babylon' and 2005\u2019s 'The Cosmic Game' (featured politically minded collaborations with Perry Farrell, Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne, and David Byrne), Thievery Corporation put out 2006\u2019s 'Versions' (a compilation of their remixes of songs by such artists as Sarah McLachlan, Astrud Gilberto, Anoushka Shankar, and The Doors). By then, Garza and Hilton were itching to evolve past their reputation as ambassadors of the downtempo scene, and began to conjure up more subversive recordings that reflected their passion for social activism, as heard on both 2008\u2019s 'Radio Retaliation' and 'Culture of Fear.'\n\nNow on 'Saudade,' Thievery Corporation are once again changing direction, trading the fiery energy of their last two albums for a wistful mood and summery spirit\u2014a shift that both members found highly refreshing. \u201cEven though we\u2019re very socially conscious, it\u2019s nice to take a break from the political theme and just concentrate creating some beautiful songs in the same vein as all these old records that we love,\u201d says Garza. And as one ofthe most influential and respected names on the electronic/dance music scene, Thievery Corporation also discovered their own breed of rebellion and innovation in committing themselves to a time-worn genre on 'Saudade.'\u201cWe\u2019re still chopping up beats, but this time we\u2019re making them sound warm and vintage\u2014which is not at all what\u2019s happening in electronic music right,\u201d says Hilton. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is pretty traditional and timeless-sounding, and in that it\u2019s completely contrarian.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join our global community for a special event class led by Janet Stone, with live music by Rob Garza of the legendary electronic duo Thievery Corporation.

Among its many awesomely quirky attractions (beyond dope AF lobster rolls, of course), the mini-metropolis boasts the International Cryptozoology Museum and even served as the site of the nation\u2019s first chewing gum factory. Suffice it to say, the town possesses all kinds of character and charm. It also makes perfect sense as HQ for Weakened Friends. Three alternative rock wiseasses and snack food connoisseurs, the trio\u2014Sonia Sturino [vocals, guitar], Annie Hoffman [bass], and Cam Jones [drums]\u2014first congregated in their adopted hometown during 2014. Sonia had recently relocated from Toronto and holed up in a house with Cam and a bunch of other dudes before witnessing Annie play live and asking her to join the band. As they released two independent EPs, Gloomy Tunes and Crushed, they stirred up a palpable buzz (between consuming sour spaghetti and causing trouble). Gigs followed with everyone from CHVRCHES and Silversun Pickups to Beach Slang and Juliana Hatfield as they made their 2017 debut at SXSW and earned praise from Vanyaland, CBS, If It\u2019s Too Loud, and many more. A wiry, whimsical, and wild fusion of disarmingly pop hooks and fuzzed-out riffery that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on the Reality Bites soundtrack or in a modern Brooklyn bar fueled this quiet rise. \u201cIf something is ear catching and interesting, I\u2019m drawn to it,\u201d says Sturino. \u201cI love pop hooks, but I have this truly weird and shaky voice. I started to embrace that, and I think people connect to the sound.\u201d For the uninitiated, they\u2019ll definitely connect to the group\u2019s 2017 single \u201cHate Mail\u201d featuring J Mascis. On the track, a buzz of feedback slips into melodic guitar and an unshakable rhythm as the frontwoman captivates with the confessionally catchy refrain, \u201cI hate everything you\u2019re saying, get away from me. I hate everything we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s a waste of me.\u201d It\u2019s the perfect backdrop for an epic Mascis cameo. \u201cIt\u2019s about when I was miserable in this other band,\u201d recalls Sturino. \u201cThis is the most important thing to me. I don\u2019t live comfortably. I don\u2019t have a lot of money. I don\u2019t have a lot of free time, because I\u2019m putting all of my effort, passion, and self into music. So, it has to be the right situation. At the time, I just wasn\u2019t working with the right team. The song is about those corrosive relationships with emotionally abusive assholes. J is a guitar god for indie rock. He\u2019s an obvious inspiration, and he killed it.\u201d \u201cHate Mail\u201d hints at a lot more to come from Weakened Friends. For Sturino, the band brings everything full circle. In tow with her best friend Cam and wife Annie, she encodes a powerful message in the lyrics. \u201cA lot of times, you hear expressions like, \u2018Find your happy\u2019,\u201d she leaves off. \u201cI think you should find yourself. Our music is about self-awareness and finding that. Sometimes, you\u2019re having a shitty day. It can be hard, and that\u2019s beautiful in its own way. In the North American mentality, if you\u2019re depressed or sad, you have to just get rid of it. This is less about getting rid of that feeling and finding those things causing the feeling and dealing with them. It\u2019s self-awareness, believing in yourself, finding yourself, and defining how you feel. That\u2019s what this band is to me.\u201d We're three tall young adults making some songs and eating some snacks.

It is a pure country voice through and through. Blessed with a Johnny Cash baritone and the wit of Jerry Reed, Ray displays both over the 11 songs on his fourth album, the self-titled Ray Scott. A mix of roadhouse foot-stompers, stone-cold country ballads and the sing-speak songs for which he\u2019s become known, Ray Scott flashes with the energy and verve that defined Ray\u2019s earlier hits \u201cMy Kind of Music\u201d and \u201cThose Jeans.\u201d\nBut the album is also a reintroduction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reboot\u2014or a Ray-boot, if you will,\u201d quips Ray, who dubbed his last album Rayality. \u201cIt is an evolution, but I think people will hear it and know it\u2019s the same guy from \u2018My Kind of Music\u2019 and \u2018Those Jeans.\u2019 Lyrically, I tend to say things a certain way. You can always tell it\u2019s me.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s good reason for that, aside from that rumbling voice. Save for a few trusted cowriters here and there, like Mark Stephen Jones, Tony Mullins and Brandy Clark, Ray prefers to write solo. In this era of five-plus writers collaborating on a single song, Ray is a true lone wolf.\n\u201cCollaboration is fun and some of my favorite things have been written with other people, but at the same time, if you can write by yourself, you should,\u201d Ray says. \u201cThere was a time in Nashville when people wrote alone. Some of my favorite old writers, the people who got me interested in doing this in the first place\u2014Harlan Howard and Bob McDill\u2014wrote alone.\u201d\nThe results of such a writing style are pure, unfiltered songs, the undiluted vision of the artist.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always recorded my own material because it\u2019s almost impossible for me to sell a song that someone else wrote. I was more or less made to tell stories through my own window\u2014and the window\u2019s pretty smudged sometimes,\u201d Ray laughs. \u201cBut if I can entertain myself, I feel like other people might be entertained as well.\u201d\nThe tracks on Ray Scott are certainly entertaining. These are story songs that, instead of just repeating a catch phrase over and over, actually go somewhere. \u201cPapa n Mama,\u201d a loping blues number, is the tale of a son who stops his father\u2014 permanently\u2014from abusing his mother, landing himself in the pen. \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Gonna Be You\u201d is a defiant kiss-off to a cheating lover, promising she\u2019ll never break this guy\u2019s heart again. The cinematic \u201cLeave This World,\u201d however, is the polar opposite: a love song of devotion elevated by Ray\u2019s Male Vocalist of the Year-worthy performance, proof that Ray\u2019s bread and butter isn\u2019t just in the spoken word.\nStill, there is magic in those recitation numbers, especially in \u201cTijuana Buzzkill.\u201d A true tale of a disastrous, if humorous, south-of-the-border adventure that ended with Ray and his buddy in jail, the track exemplifies Ray\u2019s gift for wry storytelling.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just as much an art to recitation as there is singing. It\u2019s all in how you emote, your emphasis and how you tell a story,\u201d he says. And it helps if you have comic timing, which Ray does in spades. In songs like the hazy bonus track \u201cWhat Works for Willie\u201d and the take-one-for-the-team anthem \u201cThe Ugly One,\u201d he delivers the pay-off lines with the cadence of a comedian.\n\u201cThe songs end up being a little on the polarizing side,\u201d Ray admits. \u201cBut I love that. Everything I\u2019ve ever had any luck with was a song that made people turn their head and go, \u2018Well, that\u2019s different\u2019 or \u2018That pisses me off.\u2019\u201d\nProduced by Dave Brainard (Brandy Clark\u2019s 12 Stories, Jerrod Niemann\u2019s Free the Music), Ray Scott excels in the details\u2014the swampy harmonica of lead-off track \u201cCookin\u2019\u201d; the mariachi horns of \u201cTijuana Buzzkill\u201d; and the hypnotic rhythm of the white-trash nursery rhyme \u201cWheels on the House.\u201d In the end, no two songs sound alike, and Ray cements himself as a deft performer, able to toggle between those funny tunes and serious fare like the staggering \u201cI Miss the Days.\u201d\nA bittersweet ballad about being young, \u201cI Miss the Days\u201d is a slice of nostalgia, both in subject matter and production. Sonically, it recalls the 1970s and \u201980s sound of country music.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we were going for. If you listen to an old Waylon Jennings record or something from that time period, a lot of those songs had a \u2018Luckenbach\u2019 vibe to them,\u201d says Ray, who agrees that today\u2019s country music frequently borrows some of the bombast of late \u201980s hard rock. \u201cBut I\u2019m a little more Waylon and a little less Warrant.\u201d\nIn the end, Ray Scott furthers Ray\u2019s identity as a modern day outlaw, not in image, but in his approach to the music industry.\n\u201cAfter all these years in Nashville I\u2019ve never been willing to compromise my artistic vision as far as writing goes or the way things are recorded and produced. I don\u2019t chase trends, which is not necessarily your quickest road to riches by any means,\u201d he says.\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, I\u2019d like to walk outside my trailer, look up at the sun and say, \u2018I did it the way I wanted.\u2019\u201d Ray stops to laugh. \u201cWhen the cops come to serve the warrant, at least I\u2019ll have my integrity\u2014integrity and a beer.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Yall join us for another Man Cave Jam this Friday, May 22nd on the Official Ray Scott page at 7:30 cst!\n\nVirtual Tip Jars:\n\u2022Venmo: @ray-scott-music\n\u2022PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/rayscottmusic\n\u2022Official Site: http://www.rayscott.com/shop/10-virtual-tip-jar"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lukas Rossi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7956085.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Rock, current, Everything, Pop, Alternative, Current trendy music, Singer/Songwriter", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Lukas Rossi\u2019s musical gift began to emerge as a young musician in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. With his vocal range of seven plus octaves, ability to swing from a deep guttural baritone to soaring soprano riffs, knack for capturing life through lyrics, and commanding stage presence, he has carved a niche for himself in today\u2019s music world. A prolific songwriter, he has a large and varied catalog of songs ranging from heart-wrenching acoustic ballads to heart-pounding heavier rock. His music is published by EMI Music Publishing Canada (2004-present). Lukas first ventured onto the music scene with two Canadian bands, Cleavage (1995-2005) and Rise Electric (2005-2006), which helped prepare him for what was to come. He entered and won the competition television show Rock Star: Supernova (2006) which earned him front man status with Tommy Lee (Motley Crue), Jason Newsted (Metallica), and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). Their band Rock Star Supernova completed an album and a world tour of the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Following the tour, Lukas returned to Los Angeles and began writing and recording new music. The Love and Lust EP (June 2007) was released and he completed the solo acoustic Love and Lust Tour, making over two dozen stops throughout the United States and Canada. The new material was well-received by fans, and the band Stars Down was born (2008-present). After touring with his new band, Lukas began playing local gigs at such southern California hot spots as The Roxy, The Key Club, The Mint, and Viper Room. The year 2010 kicked off with a mini East Coast tour and Lukas working on his first full length album. Hollywood was released (July 2010) and debuted live at West Hollywood\u2019s famous Viper Room. The all acoustic Hollywood Stripped followed (August 2010). After moving to Nashville, in addition to local and out-of-town gigs, he wrote, recorded, produced, and released six additional recordings. The first three were Seed EP (December 2010), Story Teller (January 2011), and Super, Sex, Magic (February 2011). He also co-wrote, provided vocals, and recorded several music videos for a side-project, Switchblade Glory (April 2011). Lukas released Prophecy (November 2011) and Christmas Collection (December 2011) to complete a very busy year. But he wasn\u2019t finished, releasing the album 8 Days (April 2012) soon after. Lukas has appeared on many media outlets, including performing live at the 2006 Gemini awards, the CBS television series Rock Star: Supernova (18 million viewers worldwide), Ellen, Regis & Kelly, The Jimmy Kimmel Show, Entertainment Tonight, The Howard Stern Show, and ET Canada. In addition to his vocal talent, Lukas plays multiple instruments, is a songwriter, producer, actor, and vocal instructor. He currently resides with his wife Kendra in Nashville, Tennessee.

MPress, distributed worldwide by Caroline/Universal via SRG-ILS Group, also releases albums by Rachael Sage, Seth Glier, and A Fragile Tomorrow.\n\nGrace Pettis is an award-winning songwriter from Austin, Texas who is a noted member of the South Austin scene. A little bit folk, a little bit country/Americana and with a whole lot of soul, Pettis has released two DIY albums and the Dallas Morning News has hailed her as \"one of the most talented young singer-songwriters in America\".\n\nPettis first came to the attention of MPress founder and President Rachael Sage at a SXSW party in Austin, where her voice and presence, even totally unplugged in a crowded room, commanded the spotlight. Sage gushes, \"Grace Pettis is one of the best singers I have ever had the pleasure to hear. And when I say 'best', I don't mean that in a showy way -\u2013 although her voice is both powerful and beautiful. I mean that she can tell a story with her voice in a way that cuts right to the heart of our collective humanity, whatever the topic may be. Her songwriting is nothing short of masterful, and to see these timeless qualities in someone so young feels like discovering something akin to the magic of Loretta Lynn, Johnny Cash or perhaps, Brandi Carlile. MPress Records is thrilled to be working with Grace!\"\n\nPettis, who is repped by Chas Management, will be touring the southeastern US and Europe in winter/spring 2020. Her first release on MPress is expected later on in the year. In the meantime, she is eager to have found such a supportive new team. \"Signing a record deal sounds pretty daunting\", Pettis admits. \"It's not a decision to take lightly. But from the first conversation with Rachael Sage and her wonderful team, I've felt like I've finally found my way home. After a decade of releasing my own music, I couldn't be more thrilled to announce that I'm partnering with MPress Records, a label that has built its unique reputation on championing and supporting artists and putting music with integrity out into the world. I'm so proud to be a part of the MPress family.\"\n\nAs a card-carrying member of the south Austin scene, Grace Pettis has amassed bragging rights to spare. She is the winner of many of the nation\u2019s most prestigious songwriting contests, including NPR's Mountain Stage NewSong Contest, and has received grants from the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation. Grace\u2019s songs have been recorded by other esteemed artists, including Sara Hickman and Ruthie Foster and she added to her songwriting accomplishments in 2019 by signing a publishing deal with BMG.

A Thousand Tiny Torches, the singer-songwriter\u2019s new Indie Folk Americana collection, is a testament to her renewal of inspiration, the rekindling of dreams, and the redemptive power and connective compassion that defines her artistry.\n\nHer rich, expressive alto voice frames expansive melodies that echo the American heartland. Now based in Los Angeles, Arielle knows this geography well. A performing itinerary transported her from Club Passim in her adopted hometown of Boston to venues including Eddie\u2019s Attic in Atlanta and Nashville\u2019s 12th & Porter, plus stops to the Southwest, as she steered a vegetable oil-fueled vehicle across Texas to Abilene, Odessa and Austin.\n\nTen years ago, with three well-received releases accompanied by national tours, she lost sight of her future as an artist. \u201cThough my heart still ached to write songs and sing, I found that I couldn't do it anymore,\u201d she recalls.\n\nArielle moved to the City of the Angels. She divorced and remarried, taught yoga philosophy, and worked behind the scenes in the music industry. She penned and published essays and poems, and was nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best New Poets. She baked innumerable pies. After being rejected for a PhD program, she constructed a blue \u201cshe shed\u201d in her backyard. And it was in this rustic space \u2013 surrounded by 47 volumes of her journals \u2013 that she rekindled her love for music and dedicated herself to writing one song per week.\n\nThe result is A Thousand Tiny Torches. Produced by Shane Alexander, the project is propelled by the masterful playing of a sterling cast of players with credits from Lady Gaga to KT Tunstall to Lukas Nelson: Denny Weston Jr., drums; Carl Byron, keyboards; Darby Orr, bass; Jesse Siebenberg, steel guitar; and Mike Mullins on mandolin. Michael Gehring tracked the project at Secret World Studios in Los Angeles in the famous Sound City Studios complex, and GRAMMY-winners Brian Yaskulka and Hans DeKline mixed and mastered, respectively. A loyal group of supporters funded the recording through a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nA consummate storyteller, Arielle\u2019s narratives crosscut exacting details with universal themes. On the lead single \u201cWhat Really Matters,\u201d she recalls a harrowing season in Southern California as gunshots ricocheted through a country bar and the surrounding hills ignited with apocalyptic wildfires.\n\nIn contrast are incandescent songs with characters and conversations etched in fine lines and deep empathy. Vivid imagery glows with headlights, porch lights, lighthouses, bolts of lightning, fireflies, and stars that have been shining for ten billion years.\n\nAfter launching her return with a holiday single, Arielle is now back onstage at house concerts and listening rooms, including the fabled Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Hollywood. Plans are underway for West Coast tours and upcoming dates in Boston. This time, she says, she is doing it for the right reasons. \u201cWhen I was younger I was performing,\u201d she confirms. \u201cNow, I\u2019m connecting.\"\n\nArielle Silver says that when she made her break with music, her ambition for everything stopped. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see the future.

Their follow up single (a soft, House track titled \"Can Be Beautiful\") was released on December 21st, 2018, and has since been featured on Billboard Sound and AXS.\n\nStarting a YouTube channel in August of 2013 and making their debut as Elvis Presley's daughter (Lisa Marie Presley)'s supporting act that same year, together they have since begun to take the music world by storm.\n\nThe duo boast a long list of live touring accomplishments and come equipped with a catalog of over 200 original songs. Their outstanding, solid fan base is made up of an array of live audiences, the YouTube community, and social media; where their popularity is ever increasing. Posting covers of both popular and original songs, live performances, v-logs, and behind-the-scenes videos weekly, their YouTube channel has recently reached an impressive tally of over 3 quarter million views overall.\n\nThe sibling duo regularly perform and tour nationally and have frequented venues such as LA's El Rey Theatre, San Juan Capistrano's The Coach House, and (just recently) have played the House of Blues in Anaheim (twice just in 2018), Bar 20 at the Grafton Hotel in Beverly Hills, the Simi Valley fireworks celebration (with over 20,000 people in attendance), at the Gibson theater in Beverly Hills, at Pickwick's Pub in Woodland Hills, a headlining show at Monterey Court in Tucson, AZ, and much more. Nicole & Scotty are currently booking for 2019, and inquiries can be emailed to ulomag28@sbcglobal.net.\n\nThey continuously entertain radio and television appearances; a few of which have included Los Angeles' Hot 103.9 Move to the Music, KHTS 98.1 FM, New York station Gold Star Radio, Las Vegas' 702 ROX, and the TV Entertainment segment Michelle's Corner. Their music is played regularly on a rapidly growing list of stations world wide, proving that the duo are not only rapidly garnering global recognition, but are also vastly appreciated and loved by their fans from all over the world.\n\nThe siblings also dabble in acting; with Scotty having co-starred in an episode of HBO's popular comedy series \"Vice Principals\", which aired October 8th, 2017.\n\nNicole & Scotty have also been featured in several major entertainment publications; including the international music trade magazine, \"Music Connection\" and the entertainment review, \"What's REALLY Going ON\", (where Nicole occasionally writes her own column and where the sister/brother duo were featured front cover in April of 2015).\n\nFrom playing shows with touring musicians who've accompanied major bands and artists (such as The Four Seasons, Barry Manilow,or John Mayer), to garnering attention from well respected industry folks, (such as producer Teddy Riley), making connections and long lasting relationships in the industry are extremely important to Nicole & Scotty.\n\nPerforming for charities and worthy causes they strongly stand for is also a passion of theirs; the siblings having played shows to raise breast cancer awareness, raise funds for youth programs, and entertain schools in the past.\n\nWhen asked, the siblings cite their brand of Pop music as \"current, energetic and brutally honest\". Their sound is indeed uniquely sincere in a genre where it is crucial to uphold the integrity of new and innovative music.

The vocal performance by band co-founder Serena Pryne was so gut-wrenching and so emotionally draining, mining the very depths of her soul that she practically collapsed into the arms of superstar producer GGGarth Richardson when it was over. That vocal take and the similarly powerhouse performances from her bandmates, came to be the template and benchmark for the rest of the album. \u201cI knew it was a powerful song with a lot of emotion behind it and I was a little intimidated to record it\u201d said Pryne. \u201cHe let me do my thing and just pour everything I had into the microphone. He said I would know when I was done.\u201d From that moment on, that song set the tone for the rest of the record. \u201cI don\u2019t know if GGGarth knew it ahead of time and planned it with that song, because he would always reference Don\u2019t Ask if we were struggling at any other moment. He set the entire tone based on that track,\u201d said guitarist and band co-founder Nick Lesyk. The entirety of Windows and Stones is just as creatively, spiritually and emotionally intense and takes the listener on an aural and experiential journey that they won\u2019t soon forget. This too is emblematic of The Mandevilles\u2019 \u2018leave it all on the floor\u2019 approach to writing, recording and especially performing the music live. And it\u2019s music that couldn\u2019t be more straightforward and unpretentious in its approach and delivery. No studio trickery, experimental flights of fancy or self-indulgence - just rock and roll. \u201cBeing a Canadian, I think it\u2019s funny that I describe it as American rock and roll. I say that because it\u2019s reminiscent of Tom Petty, John Mellencamp, Bob Seger and Bruce Springsteen - all rolled into one. Our music comes from the same place.\u201d said Lesyk. Pryne and Lesyk are the creative nucleus of The Mandevilles and have been musical partners for nearly 15 years, although both bring significantly different musical influences to the table. \u201cSerena\u2019s influences are steeped more in the roots of rock and roll whereas mine are a little more contemporary. But there are a lot of commonalities: we love Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. And then there are newer songwriters like Ryan Adams and Jason Isbell,\u201d said Lesyk. As the frontwoman for the band, Pryne is the focal point and centre of attention for the band for both her force-of-nature stage presence and her amazingly dynamic and unmistakably authentic whisky-soaked voice. \u201cI played in a blues band when I was a kid. That definitely shaped the sound of my voice. Even though I don\u2019t listen to blues records all the time there is just something about it that I gravitate to \u2013 it was natural for me,\u201d Pryne said. \u201cAnd oddly enough I didn\u2019t really dig into a lot of female artists until I was in my mid-20s. Until then, Robert Plant was more of an influence on me. When I started to discover women in music it was Tina Turner initially. And Bonnie Raitt is huge. I just love the tenderness in her voice, which she can also turn into a real raspy growl.\u201d The Mandevilles is the latest incarnation of Pryne and Lesyk\u2019s musical merger, which began around the turn of the millennium in the Niagara Region of southern Ontario. After playing in cover bands separately and then together, the duo started penning their own material and formed the hard rock outfit Oliver Black. Soon thereafter they were courted by an American record label that soon went bankrupt, leaving the band at loose ends, and living in the United States. After moving to Europe for a short time, the band released an album under the name Serena Pryne and The Mandevilles which saw them begin an ongoing songwriting collaboration with Nashville-based Niagara Falls transplant Dave \u201cDwave\u201d Thomson. But with a revolving door of musicians and a yearning for something fresh, Lesyk and Pryne decided to return to Canada and reboot the band. Only guitarist Taylor Laslo was kept, and long-time friend Brett Bendo was brought in to play drums a couple of month before the band was set to fly to Vancouver to work at Richardson\u2019s The Farm Studios. After auditioning a number of prospective bassists, Waylon Glintz blew his future bandmates away and got the gig \u2013 three weeks before recording was to begin. Alongside Don\u2019t Ask, Windows and Stones features infectious, melodic rock tunes like the lead-off track, Hangovers, which as evidenced by the name, encapsulates the unpleasant result of an evening of overindulging. \u201cWe visit our friend Dave (Thomson) a couple of times a year in Nashville. During one visit he had a massive blow up with his then fianc\u00e9. But then they reconciled and we decided to have a party to celebrate. We bought several litres of rum and drank it all in one night. I think we almost killed him! The next day he didn\u2019t wake up until well into the evening and he looked like death. When he woke up we wrote the song in about 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d said Lesyk with a hearty laugh. A more blues-rock fueled version of the traditional country break-up song is I Stole Your Band. \u201cI was working as a seamstress and I was bored one day and kept singing this line \u2018I stole your band when you broke my heart. It was just one of those funny little anecdotes where I\u2019m saying to a fictional boyfriend \u2018if you do something stupid, I\u2019m going to steal your f***ing band,\u201d said Pryne. While The One was another defining moment for the Mandevilles as it was a song that truly brought all five members into the creative process. \u201cWhen we were in pre-production we had a magical moment which I never would have expected. It was in a completely different style when we first brought it to GGGarth, just a happy little folk song. He said it was good but didn\u2019t really go anywhere,\u201d Pryne explained. \u201cWe said let\u2019s take five minutes and work on it a bit. All of a sudden we just started playing and all five of us together created this whole new song. It was one of those inexplicable crazy moments. It\u2019s kind of a heavy song about death, but ambiguous as to what has died \u2013 a person, an idea, a dream a relationship \u2013 it means different things to different people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all us on this record. There are very few tricks, no Auto-tuning of the vocals, and we\u2019re all playing real instruments on every track,\u201d said Pryne. With this remarkable, well-crafted album that manages to be tight in its musicianship but loose in its vibe, The Mandevilles have taken one giant, definitive leap for rock and roll.

Some other music highlights include working on records with Bootsy Collins, Rihanna, Disclosure and Kevin Saunderson, as well as a few #1 and #2 hits on Beatport. His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world. He continues to innovate and curate new events with a 2 additional multi-day festival mirroring his Birdhouse radio show in Chicago, and his record BBQ event series that has been going since 2003!\n\nVonStroke also loves art; most notably pop-surrealist artwork that he has commissioned for the last 7 years on Dirtybird for all of the releases. Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude.

This is due to his well-known ability to work with any genre of music, or combination of multiple genres at one time, to produce dynamic and high energy music sets. In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture. As the resident DJ since 2004 of some of Vegas\u2019 hottest clubs and lounges including Rum Jungle, Jet Nightclub & Koi Nightclub inside of the Planet Hollywood. Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip. Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cFRIDAY NIGHT HYPE\u201d EVERY FRIDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

Zane began honing his chops in LA's vibrant music circuit on his 12th birthday and later refined his style at USC's prestigious Thornton School of Music, becoming one of the most in-demand guitarists on both coasts in the process. Possessing an exciting and extremely rare combination of creativity and virtuosity, along with an audiophile's ear for guitar tone and an extraordinary ability to sightread, Zane has been referred to as \"The best guitarist in NY and LA\" by Bono of U2. More recently, John Mayer handpicked Zane to play guitar on his current world tour and latest album, sans audition, after Mayer discovered Zane's fiery performances online. But with his newfound passion for writing and singing his own material, Zane is quickly gaining significant attention as a lead vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. While Zane's guitar playing has been described as daring, passionate, soulful, and jaw-dropping - tremendous labels for a young man many are proclaiming to be the next great guitar hero - Zane is now rapidly accumulating equally praiseworthy descriptions about his compositions and vocal abilities. As people witness Zane's evolution from gunslinging guitarist to full-fledged frontman, comparisons to the early days surrounding the release of John Mayer's debut EP \"Inside Wants Out\" have even been serendipitously drawn. Bob Lefsetz has raved about CARNEY - where Zane began his meteoric rise as a lead guitarist - likening the band's sound to \"a mysterious trip into the heart of darkness.\" But, Zane's original songs lean slightly away from the raw and brooding Rock and Roll that defined CARNEY as they gravitate towards his roots in Jazz, Blues and Pop. His songwriting style is grounded in visual storytelling, honesty, surrender and hope and his melodies, while imaginative and adventurous, are irresistibly catchy and instantly familiar. Zane's lyrics have been likened to those of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray LaMontagne, and his voice has been compared to singing icons Jeff Buckley, Damien Rice, and Jimmy Gnecco. This unique combination of masterful guitars, unforgettable hooks, and emotively provoking lyrics - all expressed with his profoundly moving and honest voice - is what makes Zane such a one-of-a-kind talent; one that seems poised to join not only the greats of his generation, but those who've come before him. Live performance is where Zane's most inherent gift shines; his undeniably infectious charisma - one that captivates the audience the instant he takes the stage.

He\u2019s remixed everyone from Whitney Houston to Basement Jaxx and continues to run the legendary Subliminal Records house music empire. On his debut album he collaborated with Puff Daddy and Boy George alike.\n\nFor over a decade now, Erick has remained one of the most in-demand and instantly recognizable DJs in the world. From the instant success of his weekly \u2018Sessions\u2019 parties in New York, to hosting events like the annual road-blocking Subliminal Sessions parties in Miami at Winter Music Conference, to his coveted residency at Ministry of Sound (he\u2019s still one of the only American DJs to ever hold one) and of course his now legendary Subliminal Sessions parties at Pacha Ibiza, Morillo just doesn\u2019t stop. His non-stop DJing schedule at one point saw him straddling the globe playing up to a whopping 30 gigs a month, particularly in the summer months where he\u2019ll play from Rome and Mykonos to London. He\u2019s also become a familiar television personality through his appearances on MTV and MTV Ibiza two years in a row whilst starring in a seven part series for UK TV station Channel 4.\n\nRaised in Colombia, then New Jersey, Erick was weaned on a musical diet of Latin rhythms, reggae and hip-hop. He started DJing at the age of 11 and after securing himself DJ sets at several local gigs decided to take a studio engineering course at the local Centre of Media Arts. He was soon inducted into the house fraternity through his friend Marc Anthony (the Salsa King), whilst he was working with the now legendary Louie Vega and Kenny \u201cDope\u201d Gonzalez on \u201cRide On The Rhythm\u201d. \u201cLouie\u2019s watched out for me since the beginning,\u201d he says of the Masters At Work legend. One minor detail: in the booth at Pacha last time they played together was a certain supermodel called Naomi Campbell and beside her was one of Erick\u2019s musical heroes, the legendary Quincy Jones. \u201cCan you believe it? Quincy Jones came to my party,\u201d he says, still in shock. \u201cWhen we saw him there, Louie and I decided to play a bunch of his classics, like Michael Jackson\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop Til You Get Enough\u2019. He told me he loved my bass lines,\u201d smiles Erick. \u201cOne of the proudest days in my life.\u201d\n\nIn 1997, after spending almost a year of meticulously planning everything from logos to packaging, Morillo took it that one step further and launched Subliminal Records with his production partners Harry Romero and Jose Nunez. Guided by Morillo\u2019s ear and studio presence, the brand has gone on to become synonymous with a funk-fuelled, soulful house sound. And in 2004 Erick released his first artist album worldwide, entitled \u201cMy World\u201d it featured heavyweight collaborations from the likes of Puff Daddy, DJ Rap, Boy George and even a reunion with the Mad Stuntman. The lead single \u2018Break Down The Doors\u2019 featured The Audio Bullys, and in the years that followed, further singles and club tracks followed. After \u2018Live Your Life\u2019 and \u2018Stronger\u2019 came Erick\u2019s collaboration with Skin and Eddie Thonieck, \u201cIf This Ain\u2019t Love\u201d, quickly followed by \u2018Elephant\u2019 featuring Alexandra Burke, a Top 5 UK smash. The global touring continued, as did his dominance at clubs from Pacha Ibiza and Ministry Of Sound in London.\n\nAfter a well-documented break from the scene, Morillo returned to his spiritual home of Ibiza in 2014. But unlike previous seasons, he only took on one show, at Space: \u201cI decided to take a step back and I really got to see the industry changing. I did one party at Space for their 25th birthday, two sets, one outside and then I did the last 4 hours of the terrace, which brought back a bunch of memories! I loved playing and it was a great statement to make.\u201d Fast-forward to the summer of 2015 and things are right where he wants them to be, with Subliminal re-launching in the digital sphere with a whole raft of new ideas and remixes planned for the start of 2016. Tracks like \u2018Welcome To The Jungle\u2019 and \u2018Shiny Disco Balls\u2019 are ripe for remixing, but Erick promises that the focus will remain on the new as much as the classic catalogue. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great music from house to techno \u2013 a little bit of everything,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be releasing lots of records from different people.\u201d\n\nWith a super-successful summer spent in and out of Space, Ibiza with Luciano\u2019s Cadenza party, as well as key shows from Marquee in New York and LIV in Miami to Avalon in LA and back, Erick is firing on all cylinders. He has several original productions and key collaborations that have now dropped, including \u2018Something For Carl Cox\u2019, a fun techno jam that Erick made for, well, guess who, a searing deep house club track called \u2018The Restorer\u2019 and another with Harry Romero called \u2018Going To LA\u2019. And he also has a solo double-header dropping on Subliminal Records in November 2015. \u201cI\u2019m releasing a two part EP titled Limitless which will consist of a track titled \u2018I Want You\u2019 followed by \u2018Trapped\u2019 - both great records,\u201d he nods. And the label is also gearing up for some major moves at the start of 2016. A-List artists such as Kolsch and The Martinez Brothers will be remixing the very best of the classic catalogue. Erick, meanwhile, is happy to be living in LA. \u201cLA is the place to be, not just because the record industry is there but also the artists. It\u2019s a great place to be and a great place to network.

Stratovarius soared to great heights becoming the leading pioneers in progressive power metal. This monumental achievement included 7 world tours, 3 consecutive gold discs in Finland and selling almost 3 million records.\n\nThe recent break up of Stratovarius came about because Tolkki felt that the relationships in the band very very badly contaminated and also because everything that was to be said with that band with those members had already been said and to continue would be simply repeating the same form. He also wanted to be able to concentrate on other things, explaining that:\u201cThere\u2019s just a time for everything in life and Stratovarius came to the end of a road and there was nowhere to go anymore\u201d. During the composing process of his upcoming solo album \u201cSaana-Warrior of Light\u201d he found many new interests in the form of photography, graphics design and video editing. \u201cIt was like a new world to me and I knew I had found something that would determine the course of the rest of my life regarding my art. Now I have these amazing tools available to me to create things I did not know was possible. Lot of studying, but it\u2019s really a lot of fun, which brought me into many different areas in music. On the other hand I can do a production of a dance artist, or a metal artist. Or anyone who I think is real and has it. I rarely do productions outside of my own production company anymore. I am really into finding new talents and developing a project together with an artist, while using enough time for it. Because time is gold in music. I have everything I need here to create a perfect musical and visual experience. Music is the Universal language. Its primary function is to awaken emotions in us. We have no choice. If something doesn\u2019t move me, I know it is not for me\u201d.\n\nTimo is currently running his own Goldenworks production company and has established a comfortable working suite in Helsinki with the latest technology. He calls his place \u201cSanta\u2019s Workshop\u201d. Timo is actively looking for singers and artists who dare to explore the boundaries of themselves and take the step to the unknown.\n\nHe is ready to release his new solo album \u201cSaana-Warrior of Light Pt1\u201d. It is a groundbreaking release in many ways. It will only be available from the shop from his Official website http://www.timotolkki.com that is powered by TheGround.com so you will not find it in record stores. Tolkki is happy about these new opportunities to interact directly with his fans and to offer them products at a much better cost.\n\nSince Stratovarius break-up, he has formed a new Power Metal band that continues the legacy of Stratovarius. This band is called \u201cREVOLUTION RENAISSANCE\u201d and its debut album \u201cNew Era\u201d will be out on 6.6.2008 featuring Michael Kiske and Tobias Sammet on vocals.\n\nTimo Tolkki is looking forward to new musical endeavours and to the exciting new and fresh future in his art. 8.", "otherInfo": "Timo Tolkki Livestream Show.\nTimo Tolkki, ex-L\u00edder y Guitarrista de la Era Cl\u00e1sica de Stratovarius, tocar\u00e1 en vivo el pr\u00f3ximo viernes 22 de mayo a las 22:00 de Chile.Con su guitarra y voz, Timo Tolkki ofrecer\u00e1 un show de covers a Stratovarius y otros cl\u00e1sicos del Rock, como The Beatles y U2, entre varios otros.

He emerged at Papunya in 1980 as a founding member of the pioneering Warumpi Band, which over three albums (Big Name No Blankets, Go Bush and Too much Humbug) and twenty years of performing thrust contemporary indigenous music into mainstream Australia. Yielding such classic songs as My Island Home, Blackfella Whitefella, Fitzroy Crossing, Jailanguru Pakarnu, Stompin Ground, From The Bush and Waru.\n\nHe has since become one of Australia\u2019s finest singer/songwriters, enjoying a solo career since 1989. He has released a remarkable string of albums - the latest being Blood & Longing.\n\nHis song writing is diverse- from the rollicking Good Light in Broome, the prayerful Native Born, and healing Myall Creek, the roots groove of Long Grass Band and Eddie Mabo, the journeyman monologues of Lights of Hay and Where My People Go, the contemplation of place in Burrumbeep Hill and Whispering Casuarina to the recent Cry My Darling and Byjantic Man.\n\nCollectively, Neil's work has done much to deepen Australia\u2019s contemporary music heritage.\n\nIn 1995, Neil Murray was awarded the APRA song of the year for My Island Home - originally written for the Warumpi Band and re-recorded by Christine Anu. My Island Home featured in the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the opening ceremony of the recent 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth games.\n\nIn 2007, Jailanguru Pakarnu- (Out From Jail) a song he co-wrote with Warumpi Band guitarist Sammy Butcher in the indigenous Luritja language- was honoured by the National Film and Sound Archives, Sounds of Australia series, as a significant recording in Australia\u2019s heritage. Credited as the first commercially released pop rock single in an indigenous language. In 2016, My Island Home, as recorded by Christine Anu, received the same honour.\n\nIn recognition of his influence, Neil Murray was awarded the 2017 Port Fairy Folk Festival Artist of the Year.\n\nNeil Murray\u2019s songs have been recorded by Mary Black, Jimmy Little, Missy Higgins, Liz Stringer, Christine Anu, Peter Denahy, Carus, Adam Brand, Amy Saunders, Powderfinger, The Tiddas, Ursula Yovich, Peter Brandy, Emma Donovan and the Warumpi Band.\n\nIn 2019, he is performing nationally for his Blood & Longing tour.\n\nWhispering Casuarina video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/etiA4IsaAD0\nneilmurray.com.au\nyoutube/neilmurraymusic", "otherInfo": "Neil Murray Live Streamed as part of The Saltwater Music Festival.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thesaltystage\n\nPLEASE NOTE THE TIME DIFFERENCE!\n2pm for WA, 4pm for Eastern states and 3.30pm for Central states!\n\nPAY WHAT YOU CAN - https://www.paypal.me/bulukbaraman"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SHIBA SAN ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8455386.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Electronic, House, Teckno, Bass House, Tech House, Minimal House, Deep House", "Time": "6:10 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "There\u2019s much more to Shiba San than what meets the first listen.

With releases out on labels known and loved for their irresistible tunes like Dirtybird and Suara, as well as his own imprint Basement Leak, he\u2019s since seen his career launch off far and beyond the city limits of Paris.\n\nStaying quiet on the public front, Shiba San remains a curious enigma to his international fan base, allowing the music to do the talking for him. In between releases and time spent concocting in the studio, the Miami-based producer remains a mainstay on the nightlife circuit, hitting iconic festivals including Coachella, EDC Las Vegas, Movement Detroit, The BPM Festival in Mexico, The\nWarehouse Project, Stereosonic, Spring Awakening as well as milestone venues like Output in New York, Ministry of Sound in London, Sankeys in Ibiza, Exchange in Los Angeles and The Mid in Chicago.\n\nEnding last year with two impressive Dirtybird releases \u2018Up & Down\u2019 and \u2018You Know What?\u2019, Shiba San began 2017 with a hearty compilation release on his own Basement Leak label featuring his standout tune \u2018Drop It\u2019 before embarking on a North American co-headlining tour with the esteemed MK.

Powderfinger are winners of nearly every major award in Australia \u2013 including the ARIA (Australian Record Industry Awards) for Album of the Year, Best Rock Album and Song of the Year.\n\nTheir musical style would simply fall into the Rock catagory, guitar driven rock featuring radio friendly hooks and enigmatic vocals. The band has featured prominently in Australian premier youth station, Triple J, winning the most popular song of the year on a number of occasions.\n\nThe band has released six studio albums and a \"best of\" collection, despite being a still functioning band, having released their most recent album \"Dream Days at the Hotel Existence\" in 2007. They are set to release another album in 2009. Despite their overwhelming popularity in native country Australia, Powderfinger have yet to take the world by storm. Frequent tours across Australia are sold out rapidly and live shows do not disappoint the large number of fans who share the passions of a passionate group.\n\nThey toured with Silverchair on the \"Across the Great Divide\" Concert, from August to October 2007, raising awareness for the indigenous people of Australia.\n\nTheir official website is www.powderfinger.net.", "otherInfo": "POWDERFINGER\nREGROUPS FOR \u2018ONE NIGHT LONELY\u2019\n7.00pm AEST, Saturday 23 May\nexclusively on Powderfinger\u2019s YouTube channel\n\nAfter a decade long hiatus, iconic Australian band Powderfinger is tuning up and preparing to bring a little happiness to fans during these challenging days.\n\nPowderfinger will reform for one night only on Saturday 23rd of May with an exclusive performance from their respective home studios, titled One Night Lonely.\n\nThe title signifies the one off nature of this event and points towards the very important charities the band are supporting, Beyond Blue and Support Act.\n\nStreaming exclusively on the band\u2019s YouTube channel from 7.00pm AEST, the set will feature a medley of their biggest hits.\n\n\u201cThe five of us have been meeting regularly over the past few months to organise some Odyssey Number 5 anniversary releases. The idea came up of playing together again in this unusual format which we all thought would be fun. The past few months has been a very strange time for us all and difficult days for many. We really just want to bring a smile to some people\u2019s faces and along the way raise some funds to help our music industry mates and people who are currently experiencing mental health issues,\u201d said the band.\n\nSupport Act provides crisis relief, mental health and wellbeing services to Australia\u2019s music industry community and has been inundated with requests recently from artists, crew and music workers who have been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBeyond Blue provides information and support to help Australians achieve their best possible mental health, whatever their age and wherever they live. In the past four weeks, Beyond Blue has experienced a 59 per cent increase in the number of people contacting its support services compared to the same period last year.\n\nRuuben van den Heuvel, Head of Music Content Partnerships (South East Asia, AU/NZ), YouTube said, \u201cAt YouTube, we believe great music, combined with the reach and scale of the internet, makes the world a better place.

In 1995, his remix for Everything But The Girl\u2019s Missing became a worldwide smash, giving the British duo their first ever hit.

Two years in the making \u2018We Resonate\u2019 out on Talitres (UK/EU) and Sweetdreams Press (Japan), is an uplifting celebration of life and by far her most collaborative. It sees Rachael joined by Laura Marling\u2019s sideman Marcus Hamblett, experimental Japanese multi-instrumentalist ICHI, Alessi Laurent-Marke of Alessi\u2019s Ark, Rozi Plain, Emma Gatrill of Sons of Noel and Adrian, and Thomas Heather of Woodpecker Wooliams. Born from the richness of Rachael Dadd`s semi-nomadic lifestyle, partly recorded live in a studio followed by playful overdubbing in Rachael\u2019s front room, \u2018We Resonate\u2019 carves out a niche of its own, crossing genres from folk, through pop and experimental. Pulsing with poly-rhythms on prepared-piano, homemade xylophone, voice, clarinets, typewriter, boxes of matches, steel drum, tap-dancing, clapping, and even the heartbeat of Rachael\u2019s baby in the womb, it reveals that her love of African field-recordings www.rachaeldadd.com \u2000 R A C H A E L D A D D W E R E S O N AT E and the spirit embodied within them has seeped into the diverse mix of influences, along with Steve Reich, Tune Yards, and the Japanese underground/ improv scene. \u201cBeing a travelling musician is a furnace for making music. Witnessing how people build things together, watching the changing landscapes from city to wilderness and back to city, becoming connected to other people\u2019s cultures, it all makes it easier to go against the grain of what you grew up with. I feel at home using the pentatonic scale. I veer towards leaving behind the wash of guitar mid-frequencies that I think dominate so much of modern western music.\u201d Rachael\u2019s songwriting hones in on themes of communication, collaboration, nurture and optimism, but the worth of living is emphasized in even greater magnitude within the album\u2019s moments of desolation (unanswered walkie-talkies on a song about flood victims), in its moments of questioning (\"I see you`re flexing the muscle of these modern machines but are you sure you\u2019re fit to drive them?\"), and in its moments of protest (an overblown clarinet and a salute to Ivor Cutler calling \"all the women of the world take over!\"). Overall though optimism spreads its warm sunbeam and sets with a golden light over the ebbing and swelling of \"let it rise, let it fall...\" \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have light and dark to make something truthful, to make something resonate. I was living in Japan when the tsunami hit and the Fukushima nuclear plant blew up. Witnessing the Japanese people\u2019s strength, positivity and collaboration in the face of threat influenced my songwriting. During this time I saw a photograph exhibition of Ama-san, the diving women who work in teams holding their breath for 2 minutes, to dive for sea creatures without scuba gear. The essence of those beautiful and powerful images stayed with me throughout the making of the album and are what the artwork by Betsy Dadd is based on.\u201d Rachael has performed to audiences of up to 3000 and in recent times has taken to the stage at countless festivals including Glastonbury, End of The Road, Green Man, Wilderness, No Direction Home, Truck, Boomtown, Ouvre La Voix (France), Mandstock (Italy), and is gearing up to play Woodford (Australia) after a month tour of Japan. Outside of festivals, Rachael has played numerous headline tours in the UK, Europe, and Japan, and has also toured in the company of David Thomas Broughton, Alessi\u2019s Ark, Francois & The Atlas Mountains, This Is The Kit, and Rozi Plain. She is an experienced collaborator and organiser: she co-curated The Local\u2019s SHHH festival in Bristol, achieving her goal to be inclusive of many cultures and forms of expression; she programmed 'Rachael Dadd and Friends' at King\u2019s Place - a fundraiser for Japan's Tsunami victims; and she\u2019s curated a group exhibition 'DIY is all you need' with fellow musicians and artists. Having graduated from art school with first class honors, Rachael is also a practicing and exhibiting artist always putting emphasis on the record sleeve and often making handmade limited editions, thinking conceptually and regularly collaborating with RCA graduate animator and sister Betsy Dadd.

Eine hannoversche Band mit authentisch eing\u00e4ngigen Songs und der geh\u00f6rigen Portion WUMMS f\u00fcr alle Liebhaber des gepflegten Rock\u2019n\u2019Rolls. Getragen wird der \u201eGrove- Sound\u201c von Eves herausragender Powerstimme, denn sie beherrscht die leisen T\u00f6ne genauso souver\u00e4n wie das R\u00f6hren & Growlen. Ihr Gesang und die Band bilden eine emotionale Einheit, sodass Ihre eigenen St\u00fccke tief ber\u00fchren, aber auch m\u00e4chtig rocken k\u00f6nnen. Mit dieser grandiosen eigenst\u00e4ndigen Mischung hat sich die Band bereits in die Herzen ihrer Zuh\u00f6rer gespielt. Grove \u2013 setzen einfach pure Emotionen frei. They groove, they have a stunning dynamics, lyrics written in German and English, tunes inspired by world weariness, love, anger, bliss, and pain. That\u00b4s GROVE. A keen sense of authentic and catchy songwriting attracts the audience like a magnet; these five Hanoveranians definitely know how to rock. GROVE\u2019s sound is carried by Eve\u2019s amazing, clear, pure and powerful voice which masters soft, low tones as perfectly as roaring and growling. Her singing melts into the clear rhythm of GROVE\u2019s accompanying musicians, and stirs up emotions that any true Rock\u00b4n\u00b4Roll-soul could wish for. With their stunning and distinct mixture of deeply touching and rocking songs GROVE accomplishes to capture their listeners\u2019 hearts. GROVE \u2013 emotion unleashed! Alles begann Anfang 2008 mit einem Spontanjam zwischen Robert \u201cGrobi\u201c Radeka (ehem. Hate Squad) und Eve H\u00fcbener (ehem. Castaway, Mobster) auf dem Zytanien Open Air. Schnell war klar, dass das gemeinsame Potenzial voll ausgesch\u00f6pft werden musste. Mit Unterst\u00fctzung von Alex (ehem. Loungefly) am Bass, fanden die ersten gemeinsamen Akustik-Konzerte statt. F\u00fcr die perkussive Begleitung sorgte seinerzeit Hannes Weber, Drummer der Phunkas Symatrix. Weil sich die Rock \u00b4n\u00b4 Roll Seele langfristig nicht nur mit gediegenem Akustik-Sound zufrieden geben kann, wurden im Sommer 2009 die gute alte Paula und die druckfreudige Ricki entstaubt ;) und ihrer eigentlichen Bestimmung zugef\u00fchrt: dem dr\u00f6hnenden Fr\u00f6nen \u00fcber die guten alten R\u00f6hren. Aber \u201cOhne Drummer kein vern\u00fcnftiges Gitarrengejammer\u201c, so stie\u00df Stefan Reese (ehem. Sonic Front, Mindwise) am Schlagzeug hinzu, um dem bisherigen und zuk\u00fcnftigen Repertoire seinen Soundstempel aufzudr\u00fccken. Es entstehen u.a. die Songs \u201cEssenziell\u201c und \u201cInfancy, Maturity & Uncertainty\u201c, die mit Unterst\u00fctzung von Lars Oppermann (Eat No Fish, Superstarfuckers, Dan Hiob Experiment, High Speed Karmageddon) in 2010 dann die ersten Tracks auf ihrem aktuellen Demo werden. 2011 wird Martin als zweiter Gitarrist angeheuert um den Grove-Sound auch LIVE noch fetter zu gestalten. Pressestimmen: \u201cMan w\u00e4hnt sich in der Flower-Power-\u00c4ra. Sp\u00e4te Sechziger, Singer-Songwriter-Rock mit politischer und gesellschaftskritischer Aussage. Aber immer entspannt. Man riecht imagin\u00e4re R\u00e4ucherst\u00e4bchen, auf die B\u00fchne werden aber gro\u00dfe Seifenblasen geschickt, davor tanzen einige Fans gl\u00fcckselig, w\u00e4hrend die Band einen intensiven, immer aber sehr lockeren Auftritt hinlegt.

Yet the common thread that runs through Craig\u2019s broad musical canon and creative projects is a resounding fascination with futurism. Carl Craig has cultivated a unique path as an artist, entrepreneur and civic leader, guided by his tendency toward forward\nthinking.\n\nCraig released his first track in 1989. One of his earliest mentors and first collaborator was Derrick May, whose imprint Craig also released some of his early music on.\n\nIn 1991, wanting pure artistic freedom, Craig set up his own label Planet-E and released \u20184 Jazz Funk Classics\u2019, under the moniker 69, as the label\u2019s first release. From here his wild exploration of sound intensified\u2026\n\nA Gemini true to form, with a mind that never sits still, Craig has released a diverse range of experimental and groundbreaking music under a plethora of aliases including 69, BFC, C2, Innerzone Orchestra (\u2018Bug in the Bassbin\u2019 was credited as the spark that inspired the evolution of drum\u2018n\u2019bass), No Boundaries, Psyche, Paperclip People, Tres Demented, Urban Tribe and many more. He has also produced albums for the legendary Detroit Jazz collective Tribe as well as orchestrator / pianist Francesco Tristano and French producer Agoria.\n\nLive he has collaborated with Les si\u00e8cles orchestra at Cit\u00e9 de la Musique in Paris. A meeting of techno and classical music, the concert was described as \u201chistorical\u201d, Craig went on to repeat the formula in Milan and Germany. He regularly performs live as experimental outfit Trio with Moritz Von Oswald and Francesco Tristano, sometimes as Narod Niki alongside Villalobos, Luciano, Richie Hawtin, Zip and others, and regularly does part live and part DJ with Luciano. Additionally he\u2019s\ntaken to occasionally bringing keyboardists like Mike Banks (UR), Amp Fiddler and Tristano into the DJ booth with him for special one-off gigs. He also improvised live to an Andy Warhol film at the Unsound Festival in New York. In 2011, Craig went live as 69 for the first time ever, fusing masks, darkness and the music of 69, Craig created 69\u2019s own entity and previewed the show to a few select festivals and clubs around the world.\n\nHis remixes discography boasts some of the most desirable names in music \u2013 LCD Soundsystem, Hot Chip, Junior Boys (nominated for a Grammy Award), Gavin Russom & Delia Gonzalez, Theo Parrish, Tori Amos, Can, Goldfrapp, Friendly Fires, Caribou, Tiga, Unkle, Yello and more.\n\nAs well as an outlet for his own productions, his Planet-E imprint has given a home to a wide range of Detroit-based artists including Francesco Mora Catlett, Naomi Daniel, Flexitone, Jason Hogans, Kenny Larkin, Monty Luke, Moodyman, Mike Agent X, Oliverwho Factory, Ezana Harris, Recloose, Reference, Kevin Saunderson, Big Tone, Tribe, Urban Tribe, and Chaz Vincent.\n\nStaying strong to his Detroit roots, where he still lives today, Craig helped launched the Detroit Electronic music Festival in 2000 and remains a strong force at the festival today. He has also created and launched his non-profit 501-C3 Carl Craig Foundation: \u201cThe concept is to find ways to re-educate kids about what\u2019s interesting musically that you can\u2019t get on the radio\u2026 To develop a new music scene that follows the legacy of Detroit music being diverse and interesting, to spot out the most talented young musicians coming out of high school and lend small financial grants to encourage music education at a higher level.\u201d\n\nWhen Craig explains his philosophy, his wry sense of humor seeps into his explanations of far-reaching concepts that merge worlds together. \u201cI have a very special career. When I feel that I\u2019m tired of going on the road I can go in the studio. When I\u2019m tired of concentrating on the studio I can go on the road. I can work with concert pianists, jazz musicians or rock guys. Very few people\nhave that range of interests. Very few people juggle a career that they choose specifically.\u201d No one else can pull it all together quite like Carl Craig.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Blankenship Family ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8721945.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Gospel", "Time": "2:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Traveling and Telling About The Wonderful Love Of Jesus!", "otherInfo": "The Blankenships Live for 30 minute concert."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Two Things One ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9009275.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Aaron David and Amanda Joy", "Time": "3:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Music.

From early works such as the synth-driven \u2018Moscow\u2019, the legendary \u2018Bigfoot\u2019 to recent crowd favorites such as \u2018God Is A Girl\u2019, \u2018Long Way Down\u2019 and \u2018Rave Culture\u2019, their productions are championed by the likes of Hardwell, Armin van Buuren, Ti\u00ebsto, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, David Guetta and more for their magnitude, diversity and massive appeal to multiple audiences.\n\nAs DJs, W&W have been dominating dance floors and festivals across the globe for years on end.

They also curate music for their brand-new label, Rave Culture, which includes hosting their own bi-weekly radio show on Dutch broadcasting station SLAM!, which has gained them over 300,000 listeners per show plus coverage across North America via SiriusXM.\n\nNow shifting into a new phase with a tidal wave of new productions and incinerating live sets, the rise of their new Rave Culture label and the impact of their NWYR alias, W&W are cementing their place amongst dance music\u2019s top acts in signature style: transcending boundaries and never looking back.", "otherInfo": "We're working on a special XR Livestream from the Rave Culture City.

They were later joined by Tony to become Above & Beyond.\n\nAnjunabeats was formed when Jono Grant and Paavo Siljamaki met at Westminster University and discovered a mutual love of electronic music. The pair kicked off the label in 2000 with \u2018Anjunabeats Volume 1\u2019, a massive club success which instantly ear-pricked the likes of Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold and Paul van Dyk. The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label. It provided the perfect outlet for their numerous production projects \u2013 Oceanlab, Aalto, Freestate, Nitromethane, POS, Rollerball and Tranquillity Base \u2013 and every release was warmly received by elite DJ\u2019s and club-goers across the globe.\n\nIn late 2002 James Grant joined the Anjunabeats management team and the label began to expand its output, signing a series of fresh artists. The first external track to be released was Rusch and Murray\u2019s much talked about \u2018Epic\u2019 \u2013 a track made entirely across Internet forums by two producers who\u2019ve never met \u2013, with subsequent signings including Finnish trance maestro Super8 (who later joined forces with DJ Tab), talented UK duo Smith & Pledger and Dutch Deep Tech Genius, Stephen J.Kroos.\n\nSince then, the roster has expanded to over 30 artists and Anjunabeats has earned a reputation as one the most consistent dance labels in the world, with its releases proving to be essential tools for many of the world's top DJs. In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

Truthfully, it embodies an ironclad creative bond, familial brotherhood, and a lifelong commitment to fans. At this point, it goes without saying the band means everything (and more) to the Kalamazoo, MI bluegrass mavericks.\n\nSo, with a wink and a smile, they offer up a cleverly titled seventh full-length, All For Money, in 2019.\n\nHoffman dispels the obvious first: \u201cClearly, we aren\u2019t a band all for money. We did it for romantic reasons such as love, catharsis, and because it mattered to us and the listeners. We wanted to have fun with the paradox of the title though. We\u2019re truly blessed and humbled to have our dreams come true and do what we do. However, it would be easy to make decisions based on our needs to eat or the desires of others, but that\u2019s not doing it for love. We love what we do, and we\u2019re grateful for the love we receive in return from the people listening.\u201d\n\nAs time goes on, the guys continue to do things for the \u201cright reasons,\u201d and that mindset resonates louder and louder amongst a growing fan base. A live force of nature renowned for bringing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll showmanship to high-energy bluegrass, the group has sold out hallowed venues such as Red Rocks Amphitheatre and the legendary Ryman Auditorium in addition to igniting stages everywhere from Bonnaroo and New Orleans Jazz Festival to Austin City Limits and Outside Lands. Their unpredictable performances remain the stuff of legend attracting diehard devotees who typically travel far and wide to experience multiple gigs. In 2014, If Sorrows Swim bowed at #1 on the Billboard Top Bluegrass Albums Chart, while the 2016 follow-up Shouted, Written Down & Quoted cracked the Top 3. Along the way, they have also earned praise from Billboard, AXS, Westword, and more.\n\nOn All For Money, Greensky once again aimed to progress. This time around, the musicians kept the show top of mind as they composed the music.\n\n\u201cWe have a motto where we want every show to be harder, better, longer, and faster,\u201d admits Hoffman. \u201cWith All For Money, I felt like we were serving the performance more by writing and arranging material in a way we would intend to play it on stage. We tried to incorporate a lot of what we already do live, which is different for us in the studio.\u201d\n\nThey recorded March-May at Echo Mountain Sound in Asheville, NC. In the studio, they worked with longtime friend Dominic John Davis as producer. According to Hoffman, Davis offered a fresh perspective on \u201chow to balance the studio and concerts.\u201d Amplifying the sonic palette, signatures such as dobro tone, bass grooves, and banjo took the spotlight.\n\nThe first single \u201cDo It Alone\u201d feels equally at home on a festival stage as it does blaring through your soundsystem. Backed by a robust groove, the song transforms traditional bluegrass instrumentation into a rich sonic backdrop highlighted by a mandolin awash in a trio of effects as well as rich echoed vocals and emotive lyrics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been trying to write a windows-down rock \u2018n\u2019 roll tune for a while,\u201d explains Hoffman. \u201cI got out an old guitar of mine, re-strung it, and immediately spit the song out. It\u2019s meant to be an anthem. I ask myself, \u2018Why do I do it alone?\u2019 It\u2019s because I\u2019ve got a whole room of thousands singing at the top of their lungs with me. Whenever I write something emotional that might be difficult to sing, I\u2019m reminded of the fact the crowd is there. Hopefully, it\u2019s a reminder for other people as well and we all have something to chant together.\u201d\n\nHot on its heels, the intriguing and irresistible \u201cMurder of Crows\u201d takes flight on kinetic performances as it delivers an emotionally charged message and provocative narrative. \u201cThis is a song that Aaron and I wrote about disconnection, drifting apart, loss, and remorse,\u201d Dave Bruzza reveals. \u201cIt also touches on a cry for help and how it was not heard in time. A friend told me crows had funerals. He explained that farmers used to nail a crow to the fence or barn door to get rid of them eating the crops. Thee birds would gather, pay their respects, and fly off never to\nreturn. It was interesting. I began to think why people disappear in our lives. It came together with the mysterious letter someone received, and it all made sense to turn this into a story.\u201d\n\nAlso originally penned by Bruzza, \u201cIt\u2019s Not Mine Anymore\u201d\u2019 illustrates the group\u2019s virtuosity with a \u201cmetal\u201d spirit. Elsewhere, \u201cWish I Didn\u2019t Know\u201d hinges on a trance-y Mandolin passage that proves instantly hypnotic, and \u201cDo Harm\u201d taps into an upbeat bounce by way of an an off-kilter rhythm. Meanwhile, the title track spirals into psychedelic territory during a head-spinning two-minute midsection before culminating on an important statement.\n\n\u201cIt feels liberating to be honest about it,\u201d he remarks. \u201cWith the title track, we were asking more of the listeners than we ever have, but the line \u2018If you need a voice, I\u2019m yours friend\u2019 is meant for them.\u201d\n\nIn the end, all the right reasons continue to drive Greensky Bluegrass.\n\n\u201cAs songwriters and musicians, we have a need for people to be on board, and we\u2019re not just regurgitating the same shit,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cWe\u2019re pushing ourselves every time. I hope they want to listen to the record and hear the songs live. I hope they know we\u2019re doing this for us and them.\u201d", "otherInfo": "We'll be airing sets from years past and celebrating the spirit that you all bring to this event!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Billy Strings ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9112978.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Guitar Virtuoso, Americana, Folk, Bluegrass, Jam Bands", "Time": "4:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Billy Strings has been hailed as the future of bluegrass, transcending tradition and genre with his high velocity, flat-picking guitar technique and intense, confessional songwriting.

Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cleggy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10362994.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Pop, Rock, Alternative", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Cleggy is an English musician, songwriter, and live performer.

The band's moniker is a twist on the name of a second cousin of singer and guitarist Brendan Bayliss named Humphrey McGee.\n\nIn late 2004, the band was declared by Rolling Stone Magazine to be the successors to the jam band throne previously held by Phish.\n\nThey are much more influenced musically by progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, Yes, Dream Theater, and Genesis, as well as heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden. The band also \"identifies The Police, The Beatles, The Monkees, Nick D'Virgilio, and Led Zeppelin as primary influences with a reverence the members describe as 'Biblical.'\" [2] However, there really isn't a style of popular music that Umphrey's does not cover. Artists covered in concert by Umphrey's range from Lionel Richie to Metallica to Toto to Snoop Dogg to James Taylor.\n\nFormed at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two popular Notre Dame rock bands. Early concerts consisted of both originals and cover songs, including Guns N' Roses's \"Patience\" and Vince Guaraldi's Peanuts theme \"Linus and Lucy.\"\n\nIn mid-1998, after only 8 months together, the band released their debut album complete with a tongue-in-cheek title, Greatest Hits Vol. III. The group decided to record an album immediately because it was easier to get live gigs with an official CD. Long out of print, the album contains many of Umphrey's future concert warhorses, such as \"Divisions\" and \"All in Time.\"\n\nShortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. By 1999, the band had gained notoriety outside of Indiana, especially with the release of the live album Songs for Older Women, which featured live tracks recorded over a two-night stand in November 1998.\n\nThe addition of Jake Cinninger in September 2000 helped bring the band's musical dynamic to a new level. Cinninger, an accomplished guitarist, brought a distinct heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar).\n\nThe band released another live album, One Fat Sucka, which contained live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.\n\nAround 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive jam sessions took place in a hotel in the \"Jimmy Stewart Ballroom\" during the wedding of fan/website designer Jeremy Welsh. Therefore, the band began to call their onstage improvisational excursions \"Jimmy Stewart.\" This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers and has been extensively outlined by \"McL\" in the \"Jimmy Stewart writeup\" on the fan message board known as \"The Bort\" at www.umphreaks.com.\n\n2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK. That summer, the first annual Bonnaroo Festival took place in rural Manchester, TN, and featured over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people. Umphrey's played to their largest audience to date. They would go on to play Bonnaroo in 2004 and again in 2006.\n\nThe band almost ended in late 2002 when drummer Mike Mirro announced he was leaving the band to attend medical school. After hundreds of tapes were reviewed by percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers, who has a masters degree in jazz drumming from DePaul University.\n\nIn 2004, the band released the critically acclaimed Anchor Drops, and released Safety in Numbers two years later in April 2006.\n\nIn April, 2007, Umphrey's released their fifth studio effort, The Bottom Half, an album of leftover tracks from the Safety in Numbers sessions. The album was supported with tours of the USA, Europe, and Japan.\n\nBrendan Bayliss is also working on a studio album with Jeff Austin of Yonder Mountain String Band.", "otherInfo": "We're teaming up with Live From Out There to bring you Summer Camp Virtual Festival: A 20 Year Retrospective featuring live music, throwback performances, interviews, unique moments, giveaways, and a virtual gathering you won't soon forget...

Inspired by such visceral singers as Janis Joplin and Tina Turner, she left school at sixteen to follow her own dreams. Dilana soon found herself with a promising music career in Holland, becoming one of the country's most coveted live acts. Recording and releasing the album Wonderfool in 2000 yielded five singles, four videos and a string of touring and festival gigs throughout the region, celebrating her natural talents as a songwriter and performer.\n\nBy way of Houston, Dilana arrived in L.A. and auditioned to compete on TV's \"Rock Star Supernova.\" Quoted in the Hollywood Press, \"The moment she stepped on the Mayan Theatre stage for Episode 1 and performed 'Lithium,' Dilana instantly became the show's frontrunner.\" Her powerful vocals and commanding stage presence amassed legions of new fans from around the world. That acclaim inspired Dilana to further pursue her musical passions with characteristic tenacity.\n\nDilana has performed with rock's biggest legends including Tommy Lee and Mick Mars (M\u00f6tley Crue), Dave Navarro (Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). In 2007, she won over the masses with opening slot performances for Aerosmith and Beth Hart. She launched two solo tours spanning North America and Western Europe that both consistently sold out and earned stellar reviews in the press and in 2009, Dilana ended a third successful year performing by touring her native South Africa.\n\n\nFollowing the release of seven singles, Dilana spent much of 2008 in the studio. In November 2009, she unleashed the album Inside Out, featuring 12 original tracks and her first full-length album in nine years. As new opportunities presented themselves, Dilana jumped at the chance to venture into film acting. The singer/songwriter won the BEST ACTRESS award at the Action On Film International Film Festival as well as winning both the BEST ACTRESS award and the BEST MUSIC award at the American International Film Festival for the 9 songs she wrote and performed in the rock drama: Angel Camouflaged.\n\nDuring her extensive world touring, Dilana performed in Afghanistan for the troops in 2009 and 2010. She was a part of the Go Army Concert Series tour in August 2011, sharing the stage with Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Doobie Brothers as well as touring Holland, South Africa, and across the USA.\n\n2012/2013 brought fans news that Dilana would be welcoming two new creations to the world. One, the studio release of her studio album titled Beautiful Monster, in which she went on tour where she opened for Puddle of Mudd and also for Saliva, and the other, Dilana's best creation EVER - a beautiful daughter named River. Both officially released in 2013.\n\nIn 2016 her fifth album was released, called Dilana / Angel Camouflaged, the soundtrack of the movie with the same name.\nIn the same year her first live (acoustic) DVD was also released.\nIn 2016 Dilana was invited to be part of The Voice of Holland...", "otherInfo": "Dilana and NIHZ.

Buy LP/CD from http://www.juliajacklin.com or stream online.\n\nThe second full-length album from Australian singer/songwriter Julia Jacklin, Crushing embodies every possible meaning of its title word. It\u2019s an album formed from sheer intensity of feeling, an in-the-moment narrative of heartbreak and infatuation. And with her storytelling centered on bodies and crossed boundaries and smothering closeness, Crushing reveals how our physical experience of the world shapes and sometimes distorts our inner lives.\n\n\u201cThis album came from spending two years touring and being in a relationship, and feeling like I never had any space of my own,\u201d says the Melbourne-based artist. \u201cFor a long time I felt like my head was full of fear and my body was just this functional thing that carried me from point A to B, and writing these songs was like rejoining the two.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to her 2016 debut Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win, Crushing finds Jacklin continually acknowledging what\u2019s expected of her, then gracefully rejecting those expectations. As a result, the album invites self-examination and a possible shift in the listener\u2019s way of getting around the world\u2014an effect that has everything to do with Jacklin\u2019s openness about her own experience.\n\n\u201cI used to be so worried about seeming demanding that I\u2019d put up with anything, which I think is common\u2014you want to be chill and cool, but it ends up taking so much of your emotional energy,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cNow I\u2019ve gotten used to calling out things I\u2019m not okay with, instead of just burying my feelings to make it easier on everyone. I\u2019ve realized that in order to keep the peace, you have to speak up for yourself and say what you really want.\u201d\n\nProduced by Burke Reid (Courtney Barnett, The Drones) and recorded at The Grove Studios (a bushland hideaway built by INXS\u2019 Garry Gary Beers), Crushing sets Jacklin\u2019s understated defiance against a raw yet luminous sonic backdrop. \u201cIn all the songs, you can hear every sound from every instrument; you can hear my throat and hear me breathing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really important to me that you can hear everything for the whole record, without any studio tricks getting in the way.\u201d\n\nOn the album-opening lead single \u201cBody,\u201d Jacklin proves the power of that approach, turning out a mesmerizing vocal performance even as she slips into the slightest murmur. A starkly composed portrait of a breakup, the song bears an often-bracing intimacy, a sense that you\u2019re right in the room with Jacklin as she lays her heart out. And as \u201cBody\u201d wanders and drifts, Jacklin establishes Crushing as an album that exists entirely on its own time, a work that\u2019s willfully unhurried.\n\nFrom there, Crushing shifts into the slow-building urgency of \u201cHead Alone,\u201d a pointed and electrifying anthem of refusal (sample lyric: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be touched all the time/I raised my body up to be mine\u201d). \u201cAs a woman, in my case as a touring musician, the way you\u2019re touched is different from your male bandmates\u2014by strangers and by those close to you,\u201d notes Jacklin. On the full-tilt, harmony-spiked \u201cPressure to Party,\u201d she pushes toward another form of emotional freedom. \u201cWhen you come out of a relationship, there\u2019s so much pressure to act a certain way,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cFirst it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve gotta take some time for yourself\u2019\u2026but then if you take too much time it\u2019s, \u2018You\u2019ve gotta get back out there!\u2019 That song is just my three-minute scream, saying I\u2019m going to do what I need to do, when I need to do it.\u201d Crushing also shows Jacklin\u2019s autonomy on songs like \u201cConvention,\u201d an eye-rolling dismissal of unsolicited advice, presented in elegantly sardonic lyrics (\u201cI can tell you won\u2019t sleep well, if you don\u2019t teach me how to do it right\u201d).\n\nElsewhere on Crushing, Jacklin brings her exacting reflection to songs on loss. With its transportive harmonies and slow-burning guitar solo, \u201cDon\u2019t Know How to Keep Loving You\u201d ponders the heartache in fading affection (\u201cI want your mother to stay friends with mine/I want this feeling to pass in time\u201d). Meanwhile, on \u201cTurn Me Down\u201d\u2014an idiosyncratically arranged track embedded with hypnotic guitar tones\u2014Jacklin gives an exquisitely painful glimpse at unrequited devotion (\u201cHe took my hand, said I see a bright future/I\u2019m just not sure that you\u2019re in it\u201d). \u201cThat song destroyed me in the studio,\u201d says Jacklin of \u201cTurn Me Down,\u201d whose middle section contains a particularly devastating vocal performance. \u201cI remember lying on the floor in a total state between what felt like endless takes, and if you listen it kind of sounds like I\u2019m losing my mind.\u201d And on \u201cWhen the Family Flies In,\u201d Jacklin shares her first ever piano-driven piece, a beautifully muted elegy for the same friend to whom she dedicated Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win. \u201cThere are really no words to do justice to what it feels like to lose a friend,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cIt felt a bit cheap to even try to write a song about it, but this one came out on tour and it finally felt okay to record.\n\nDespite its complexity, Crushing unfolds with an ease that echoes Jacklin\u2019s newfound self-reliance as an artist. Originally from the Blue Mountains, she grew up on her parents\u2019 Billy Bragg and Doris Day records and sang in musicals as a child, then started writing her own songs in her early 20s. \u201cWith the first album I was so nervous and didn\u2019t quite see myself as a musician yet, but after touring for two years, I\u2019ve come to feel like I deserve to be in that space,\u201d she says.\n\nThroughout Crushing, that sense of confidence manifests in one of the most essential elements of the album: the captivating strength of Jacklin\u2019s lyrics. Not only proof of her ingenuity and artistic generosity, Jacklin\u2019s uncompromising specificity and infinitely unpredictable turns of phrase ultimately spring from a certain self-possession in the songwriting process.\n\n\u201cAs I was making this album there was sort of a slow loosening of pressure on myself,\u201d Jacklin says. \u201cThere\u2019ve been some big life changes for me over the last few years, and I just found it too tiring to try to cover things up with a lot of metaphors and word trickery. I just wanted to lay it all out there and trust that, especially at such a tense moment in time, other people might want to hear a little vulnerability.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Other Favorites ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10378400.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Folk, Classic Rock, Americana", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Other Favorites is the long time duo project of Carson McKee and Josh Turner.

Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sydney Blu ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9773418.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "House", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Sydney Blu\u2019s career can be considered a journey of evolvement.

Having enjoyed success through the late 90s and 00s producing house music under a variety of different aliases, Tim launched Satin Jackets as a vehicle to finally explore his lifelong love of disco.\n\nInspired by the clean productions of artists like CHIC and studio genius Trevor Horn, Tim set to reintroduce that polish and sheen back into the modern disco scene. \u201cI had always been fascinated by how glossy people like Nile Rogers made their music,\u201d Tim explains. \u201cIt always sounded like the musical equivalent of a fashion magazine\u2019s cover. I\u2019d been making more underground music for a while but really wanted to go in totally the other direction and create a really smooth, polished sound.\u201d\n\nThe result was \u2018You Make Me Feel Good\u2019, a sublimely laidback slice of Balearic House that introduced Satin Jackets to the world. Released on storied Belgian label Eskimo Recordings, who had previously helped launch the careers of artists like Aeroplane and Lindstrom, the single quickly established Tim as one to watch amongst the thriving nu-disco scene.\n\nFollowing on from this auspicious debut a string of acclaimed singles, and remixes for some of the genre\u2019s biggest names including Goldroom and Blank & Jones, would regularly emerge from Tim\u2019s remote forest studio. Whilst the face behind Satin Jackets may have remained a mystery his warm sound was fast becoming very familiar to music lovers around the world.\n\nFirmly established as one of Eskimo\u2019s flagship artists Tim would define the Satin Jackets\u2019 sound with his debut album \u2018Panorama Pacifico\u2019 in 2016. Featuring collaborations with artists including Scavenger Hunt, NTEIBINT and Marble Sounds the album won praise from the likes of Mixmag, DJ Mag and Groove, led to gigs around the world and to date has been streamed on Spotify more than 30 million times.\n\nNever one to rest on his laurels though Tim has continued to refine the Satin Jackets\u2019 sound. Following the success of \u2018Panorama Pacifico\u2019 he\u2019s steadily built up a close-knit family of collaborators including British singers David Harks and Emma Brammer and US vocalist Niya Wells, and continued to go from strength to strength with singles such as \u2018Northern Lights\u2019 and \u2018Mirage\u2019 all clocking up millions of plays.\n\nWith album number 2 scheduled for release in early 2019 Tim can\u2019t wait for people to hear the new record. \u201cEven in just the last couple of years I\u2019ve really made some big changes to how I produce music. Compared to the first album you could say that everything under the hood has changed,\u201d he explains. \u201cEvery day, with every production I\u2019m learning new things and when I listen to these new tracks, the depth in the mixes, the clarity, I like to think of the new album as Satin Jackets but in 3D. \u201c\n\nFrom wanting to recreate the sound of magazine covers to appearing on them, the past few years has been quite some journey for the still enigmatic producer, but despite the ever-growing army of fans from every corner of the world Tim remains grounded. Hidden away in the unlikely surroundings of one of Germany\u2019s ancient forests, out of sight but fully in control, Tim is producing music that reflects the glamour and glitz of 70s Manhattan, artfully updated for the 21st century.", "otherInfo": "Dance From Home brings you performances from world-class DJs while offering a simple way to make a difference in the current crisis.

After 13 albums and many top 20 hits, 29 American tours, 30 UK tours and various trips around the globe, Chris decided to stop the merry-go-round and test the waters. His debut solo album \"I Didn't Get Where I Am...\" was released in 2002. Songs like Tempted, Up the Junction, Cool for Cats and Black Coffee in Bed still find steady air-play on UK and US radio.\n\nIn June of 2005, Squeeze released The Big Squeeze, a compilation of singles and B sides that went straight into the UK chart at Number 8, proving the timeless appeal of their music. During time away from Squeeze, Chris has written with Elton John, Trilok Gurtu, Marti Pellow, Lamont Dozier, Willie Mitchell and many others. In his spare time, Chris organizes writer workshops, which have been an inspiration to everyone that has attended. Last year he hosted a Songwriter Webcast from his studio in Sussex with bands like Turin Brakes and The Webb Brothers. The Broadcast also featured Jane Birkin and Nitin Sawhney. Scripting the lyrics for the film Still Crazy; this won him an Ivor Novello Award, a proud moment for the mantelpiece. The film documented the insane life of a rock band in the 70s. Something he knew a little about! Image hosting by Photobucket Back in 1984, Chris, with his songwriting partner Glenn Tilbrook, wrote a musical called Labelled with Love. It ran for three months in London and this remains one of his fondest memories of working with Glenn. Most recently, Chris has been writing with Wet Wet Wet singer Marti Pellow for his 2nd solo album. This two-year project has given Chris the chance to bring together some of the finest writers, as he did on Marti's Martis first album, Smile. Together, Chris and Marti have composed over 150 new songs with people like Steve Booker, Adam Levy (Norah Jones' guitarist), Amy Wadge, Jim Watson and many more. Chris is working on various projects at the moment: a musical with Guy Barker - Jazz Trumpeter supreme and a record with his friend Matt Deighton from Mother Earth fame.\n\nIn August 2006 Chris released South East Side Story, an acoustic album and DVD that features reworked versions of classic Squeeze songs, and a live performance at the Albany Theatre. This Autumn he also embarks on a UK tour with Marti Pellow.

The band\u2019s seventh album, Wildness, their first in seven years, entered the UK charts at Number Two, went gold, and kept them on tour around the world for the best part of 18 months.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gigging time, but also a lot of thinking time.\n\n\u201cWhere did it all go right?\u201d echoes Lighbtody. \u201cNo idea!\u201d the singer and songwriter laughs. \u201cAfter 10 years of no success, no one \u2013 least of all us \u2013 expected us these last 15 years to sell 17 million albums, headline festivals and play to thousands of people all over the world.\u201d\nAdd to that: one billion global track streams, five UK platinum albums, an Ivor Novello award and Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominations. And, in the shape of Chasing Cars, a modern classic recently anointed by the PPL as the most played song on UK radio of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWhen we released Final Straw in 2003, I think there was general goodwill around us from the media,\u201d continues Lightbody, \u201cas people knew the story of the previous 10 years and were kinda glad for us to get a shot on a major label,\" he notes of their move from indie Jeepster (also original home of Belle and Sebastian) to discerning Polydor imprint Fiction. That \u201csea-change\u201d set in motion the next phase of the band\u2019s existence. Still, in music, as in life, nothing is a given. \u201cOf course the good grace of the press is hard won and easy lost, but radio kept on playing us. That\u2019s been the real key to our success, I firmly believe. Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. On those shows we did some of the songs close to how they sound on the Reworked album \u2013 for example, the new version of You\u2019re All I Have came directly out of playing those acoustic shows.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re All I Have is the opening track from 2006\u2019s Eyes Open, the album that also featured Chasing Cars. On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain. Iain came up with the beautiful, John Martyn-style guitar, and his version floored me when I heard it the first time. Iain\u2019s guitar playing has always been a joy to listen to and to have it feature so prominently on this album is just amazing.\"\n\nAlso presented in simple acoustic simplicity is Chocolate, the third single from Final Straw, and produced here in classy, \u201ctime-stopping\u201d style by McDaid. \u201cChocolate has been a live favourite since we released it. It\u2019s a song all Snow Patrol fans know \u2013 I can\u2019t attest that they all love it but they know it!\u201d its co-author laughs. \u201cAnd we wanted to rework the songs that the fans are the most familiar with. There's not much point in reworking songs people don\u2019t really know as there's not really a stark contrast.\u201d\nThat said, \u201cwe will be doing something with the first two albums before the release of Reworked as those two albums do not feature for that same reason,\u201d Lightbody teases.\nWhat of the recent Twitter \u201caccusation\u201d that SP have \u201cdisowned\u201d those albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It\u2019s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2001), because they don\u2019t play the songs live?\n\u201cNot true at all,\u201d he replies with a shake of the head. \u201cWe are very proud of them. It\u2019s just that when we play those songs live they negatively affect the atmosphere of the gig. And as Star Trek taught us: \u2018The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat need to entertain and surprise also informed the approach taken to Called Out In The Dark. The curtain-raiser from 2011's Fallen Empires now comes with an inventive synth throb that echoes the original.\n\u201cI had worried a little that the whole record was getting very downtempo,\u201d admits Lightbody. \u201cThe nature of recording in hotel rooms and dressing rooms is that things will invariably be low-key. Hard to rock out with a family of four in the next hotel room trying to sleep!\n\u201cSo when it came to some of the songs we recorded towards the end of the new album, we wanted to explore a slightly higher tempo \u2013 without, of course, leaning too heavy into the original version. Called Out\u2026 is certainly the closest to the original version of any song on Reworked, but I think distinct enough to warrant its place. It has an electro bent like the original but steers clear of any of its predecessor\u2019s tropes. I asked Iain to lift it up and he sure did.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the three new songs. First up, the lovely, heart-stopping Time Won\u2019t Go Slowly.\n\u201cJohnny and I wrote this in his house in LA. We\u2019re both massive fans of Frank Ocean, so we wanted it to sound like Frank Ocean crossed with Frank Sinatra. All the Franks! It\u2019s a classic crooner track. We just wanted to try something starkly different from anything we have done before.\n\"As for the lyrics, I guess I\u2019ve not written about love for a while and needed a fix,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI like the idea of the inherent tragedy woven into the fabric of time: time speeds up when we're having a great time and slows down when we're miserable. Although it\u2019s all perception, of course, not reality. And I like that, too. That distortion. Our minds are powerful and sometimes terrible things. I guess the song tries to wrap its head around that great cosmic joke. Also it\u2019s just a love song.\"\nThen there\u2019s I Think of Home, a folk-flavoured piano ballad with vivid, evocative and deeply personal lyrics. Lightbody wrote it in 2014, as part of a five-song contribution \u201cto a night dedicated to my greatest literary hero Seamus Heaney when he opened the Seamus Heaney Home Place in Magherafelt. They wanted me to play a few songs at the opening night.\n\u201cI set my own rules for the songs\u2019 content,\" he expands. \"They had to be inspired by what Heaney had been inspired by: home, family, Ireland, The Troubles, hope, the soil\u2026\u201d\nI Think of Home was later considered for inclusion on Wildness, but none of the versions the band tried out in the studio fitted.\n\u201cBut then we went on tour with Wildness and at shows in Ireland and Irish strongholds like Boston, New York, Sydney and Melbourne, I would play I Think Of Home acoustically on my own in the middle of gigs. It would always go down well.\n\u201cSo when it came to Reworked we had lived with the song enough to feel like we could do a great version of it. And Johnny produced a stunning version of it. I had been playing it a certain way for so long it was hard for me to hear it any other way. That can be dangerous \u2013 stagnation can set in. So when that happens you have to let someone you trust take it from you and remake it. So, in the spirit of what we were doing, it was great to get a reworked version of a song that had never even been released.\"\nThe third new song is Made Of Something Different Now, which is quietly sweeping, quietly epic and wholly devastating.\n\u201cOne of my favourite tracks we have done in ages,\" nods Lightbody. \"In keeping with the Reworked attitude of trying new things, it\u2019s unlike much of what we\u2019ve done before. Lyrically, it\u2019s the story of a dear friend\u2019s heartbreak. My own heart, having not been in a relationship in ten years, is unrisked so unbroken. A damning self-portrait if ever there was one! Writing this song \u2013 with Johnny \u2013 made me realise my own lack of bravery in that department. Hasn\u2019t effected any change yet, mind you, but it did start me thinking at least\u2026 Anyway, as us Celts say, it\u2019s a belter,\u201d he grins.\n\nThe final word should go to Take Back The City. Gary Lightbody\u2019s hymn to Belfast is the song that opens Reworked and is sure to be an emotive live highlight when Snow Patrol take Reworked on the road later this year. As he reflects on 25 years of Snow Patrol, how have his feelings about the city changed in the 11 years since the song was released?\n\u201cWell, as the song says, I love Belfast tonight and always. There are still things that drive me crazy about the place. But I think that's the same for everyone\u2019s home city \u2013 although my home town, of course, is Bangor.\n\u201cMy love has deepened though not waned. I see the conflict that still goes on in people\u2019s hearts, my own included, and yet there is this drive in most people \u2013 most people \u2013 to put the past behind us and move on. To lift each other up.\n\u201cWe need that now more than ever with the looming clusterfuck that is Brexit and the devastation it has the potential to bring to the whole of UK, but to Northern Ireland more than anywhere else. We need that will to put the past behind us and lift each other.\u201d\n\nHear, hear. Equally, with these 16 inspiring, enveloping tracks, this is also moment to embrace the past \u2013 and, like the man said, to use it to lift each other. This is Reworked. This is Snow Patrol\u2019s history, and their legacy.

The band\u2019s seventh album, Wildness, their first in seven years, entered the UK charts at Number Two, went gold, and kept them on tour around the world for the best part of 18 months.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gigging time, but also a lot of thinking time.\n\n\u201cWhere did it all go right?\u201d echoes Lighbtody. \u201cNo idea!\u201d the singer and songwriter laughs. \u201cAfter 10 years of no success, no one \u2013 least of all us \u2013 expected us these last 15 years to sell 17 million albums, headline festivals and play to thousands of people all over the world.\u201d\nAdd to that: one billion global track streams, five UK platinum albums, an Ivor Novello award and Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominations. And, in the shape of Chasing Cars, a modern classic recently anointed by the PPL as the most played song on UK radio of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWhen we released Final Straw in 2003, I think there was general goodwill around us from the media,\u201d continues Lightbody, \u201cas people knew the story of the previous 10 years and were kinda glad for us to get a shot on a major label,\" he notes of their move from indie Jeepster (also original home of Belle and Sebastian) to discerning Polydor imprint Fiction. That \u201csea-change\u201d set in motion the next phase of the band\u2019s existence. Still, in music, as in life, nothing is a given. \u201cOf course the good grace of the press is hard won and easy lost, but radio kept on playing us. That\u2019s been the real key to our success, I firmly believe. Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia.

On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain.

Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week.

A much darker and crazier affair, recorded with a band, reflecting changing times, hardship, moments of joy, loss of love, mental instability and drug abuse.. What a difference 2 years and a changing set of circumstances can have\u2026 This is my blues, my coping strategy for a very difficult time.. Music is the medicine.\n\nRemember folks, if you bought a ticket for The Medicine Show, you can watch again at any time, or if you didn\u2019t you can buy a ticket, watch anytime and get your free album download! This goes for all the shows and they will stay up on Skyroom Live forever..\n\nWith your support we can make it a regular thing, bring in some new elements, hopefully the band sometime soon and carry on even when we are back to touring again at some point.\n\nHave a lovely day and hope we see you again on the 23rd!\n\nIf you enjoyed the show, please tell your friends and we hope we can build this thing and have our part in changing the way we do things together.\n\nHOW TO BUY MY TICKET:\n\n\n\n1) Click BUY TICKET\n\n2) Log in if you have an account.

The music achieved critical acclaim and airplay across the country and into the US and even Europe. The first single from that album, \u2018Come Right Back To You\u2019 debuted on the iTunes Canada Top 200 RnB/Soul song chart at #23, while the album itself debuted at #11 on the Canadian iTunes Top 200 RnB/Soul chart.\n\nThe success of \u2018My Heart Away\u2019 led to the interest and attention of one of House music\u2019s hardest working artists from Sweden, StoneBridge. The Grammy award-nominated artist, Producer, and DJ has shared his talent on Billboard #1 hits for major artists like Ariana Grande, P!nk, Haley Joelle, Nelly Furtado & many others. One particular song from Avery\u2019s album, \u2018Pieces\u2019, captured the dynamic producer\u2019s imagination and \u2018Pieces \u2013 The Remixes\u2019, released in January 2020, with its already infectious melody and catchy hook, is being played in dance clubs and on dance radio all around the world. In fact, the song debuted on the Billboard Dance Club Song Chart at 50* and has quickly moved within the top 40, widening the appeal of this independent Canadian artist.\n\nThat achievement is merely one of many successes from this teenaged Contemporary Soul/Pop phenomenon. In fact, Canadian, recording artist Avery Raquel, started in the entertainment industry at a very young age. From television, for the likes of DreamWorks, to animation for Disney, voice-over work, commercials and radio, as well as a number of professional stage productions across Canada, Avery\u2019s passion for performing grew. All the while, Avery kept honing her craft as a vocalist of rare talent, which has led to an impressive list of career-accomplishments on her musical resume.\n\nThat talent caught the ears of award-winning Canadian producer/songwriter/musician Greg Kavanagh, in 2017, and their eventual collaboration of work has led to outstanding original songs that not only were featured on \u2018My Heart Away\u2019, but also on her second solo album, \u2018Without A Little Rain\u2019. That album debuted on the iTunes Canada Top 200 RnB/Soul album chart at #31.\n\nBeyond acquiring media attention, Avery\u2019s music consistently receives glowing reviews and continued airplay across Canada, and into the United States, affording her opportunities to perform her music across North America. From New York to Newport to Toronto and beyond, including venues and renowned music festivals, Avery continues to wow audiences with her fresh style and powerful vocal performances.\n\nAvery is compassionate as well, volunteering her time to regularly perform at sports, government, and charity events, donating her talents. She\u2019s even sung the anthem in front of 43,000 people at a Toronto Blue Jays Baseball game.\n\nOf course, she also has a passion for supporting causes close to her heart such as anti-bullying (going into schools talking and performing for students), and music education. To that extent, Heart of Indie Radio in the US, has named a scholarship in her honour. That scholarship, every year for the next 10 years, awards an individual in Canada, and one in the United States, with $500 USD towards their arts or music education.\n\nAvery continues to compose new music, challenging herself to appeal to multiple genres and audiences, and constantly performing and improving her craft. She also co-hosts an online radio show on heartofindieradio.com, talking about and playing music she loves from an era that still influences so many artists today.\n\nWhile constantly performing, and with new music always in production, especially with the support of successful artist-producers like Stonebridge and Greg Kavanagh, Avery is poised to be the breakout artist she is destined to become!", "otherInfo": "Join me this Saturday for another episode of Quarantini Cocktail Hour.

David Leon, as he is otherwise known, is the wildcard of Desert Hearts, the San Diego-bred crew of DJs and rabble-rousers tearing up the underground with deep, dark, and weird house and techno.\n\nA San Diego native, Leon was influenced early on by older brother Mikey Lion and dusty jaunts to Lightning in a Bottle and Black Rock City, but over the past two years, his renown as a DJ and chops on the decks have grown to match his larger-than-life personality.\n\nPorky leveled up his game performing in the mystical jungles of Tulum, the dusty expanses of Burning Man, and perhaps most notably, at the bi-annual Desert Hearts weekenders in Southern California. The group\u2019s ascent from a renegade rager to a dance music phenomenon that has been one of the most celebrated stories in dance music over the past couple of years, and Porkchop\u2019s standout sets and take-no-prisoners party attitude have been at the center of the whole whirlwind.\n\nIn a sea of black-shirted stoics, Porkchop pours himself into the DJ booth bursting with life and color. His hair and clothing melt into bright gradients and he smiles unpretentiously as he deals out techno obscurities and house crowd-pleasers alike. His sets are a reminder of why we\u2019re all on the dancefloor in the first place\u2013\u2013to party. And nobody gets the party started like Porkchop. He\u2019s noted for being one of the most versatile member of the Desert Hearts Crew. His ability for weaving narratives through genres is clear, and he has a knack for dropping tracks that become moments you remember.\n\nWith hair in technicolor and his USB filled at all times with dancefloor demolishers, bursting with love and positive vibes, Porkchop has developed into one of the most unpredictable, but dependable DJ\u2019s in the whole scene. He\u2019s earned his way onto stages with the likes of Lee Burridge, Justin Martin, and Tale of Us, played festivals like Symbiosis and Envision in Costa Rica, five-time veteran at Burning Man, playing iconic camps like Robot Heart and Distrikt, and all over North America with the hot-ticket City Hearts tour.

Big Samir weaves intricate rhythmic patterns with a bilingual French/English flow, displaying his street-smart credibility in both his lyrics and cool demeanor. This is beautifully complimented by Aja Black's confident delivery, diverse cadences, and unique vocal stylings. The two have an undeniable magical chemistry as they share more than lyrical abilities and stages; the couple shares a partnership in both music and life as Samir and Aja have been married for a decade.

But as anyone who's been to Nevada's Black Rock Desert will tell you, Burning Man years are like dog years, and by that measure, Blond:ish has been together for a lifetime. As a youngster growing up in Canada, Vivie Ann aspired to be a computer hacker. Equally unique in her goals, Anstascia sought the acceptance of nerds. Both say they failed miserably. Eventually, their broken-heart trails converged and they created a midweek party in Montreal. Every Wednesday, they would promote, party, and DJ at the nightclub Cherry. These days, Viv and Anstascia are savy travelers. Their original productions and DJ sets are inspired, in part, by their travels and spiritual encounters. Tribal dudes chant and hum on the duo's new track, \u201cMoonbow.\u201d Dave Gahan, lead singer of Depeche Mode, provides the vocals in Blond:ish's remix of the legendary English band's \u201cShould Be Higher.\u201d Plus, they're driven to share their passion with the world, one listener at a time. \u201cA lot of people have never heard of us. Some people don\u2019t take us seriously,\" Anstascia says. \"We\u2019re doing our best to show that our music speaks for itself.\u201d In 2015 they released their album \u2018Welcome to the Present\u2019 on Kompakt Records. The LPs journey of field recordings, traditional instruments and polyglot vocals results in a masterfully crafted, intoxicating soundscape unlike any other debut album out there.

Alongside Mikey Lion, Deep Jesus, Marbs, and Porkchop, Reynolds formed Desert Hearts and the rest is history in motion. Over the past three years of bi-annual renegade ragers and relentless touring, \u201cPapa\u201d Lee Reynolds has developed into the patriarch of the fastest growing and most visible cultural movement in all of stateside dance music.\n\n\u201cMy real role in Desert Hearts is more on a spiritual level, making sure we spread a positive message and do the right thing,\u201d says Reynolds. Wise words, maybe, but behind the decks, Reynolds is a maniacal presence as he channels his past lives, tastes, adventures, and perspectives into a dancefloor magic that captures you upon first beat and does not release: House, techno, acid, and breaks, they\u2019re all conjured up in a plume of purple haze and that little mad bastard is at the center of it all.\n\nDance music now is so often about fast rises and immediate gratification, but Lee Reynolds\u2019 story is a reminder that some beats taste better when slowly fried over the course of 25 years. \u201cI\u2019ve been obsessed with this shit forever and I\u2019ve always believed the madness was coming,\u201d says Reynolds. Well, the madness has commenced, and it seems like it\u2019s here for good\u2013\u2013and Lee Reynolds is conducting the score.\n- Jemayel Kh\u00e4w\u00e5ja", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Marbs ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8281145.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Techno, Tech House, House", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The sun fades, the last glitter trails of light hit the shimmering and spinning dusty desert disco ball. A throng of dedicated and debauched hard partying Marbie\u2019s Barbies hurtle their way towards center stage (really\u2026they\u2019re Barbies), educated party-goers make their way to the dance floor, no questions asked, while whispers of \"King of Darkness, crazy house and techno, psychedelic vibes\u201d spread through the new night sky. The first melodic notes travel the space, ethereal beauty pouring from the stacked Funktion speakers, waving its way through the crowd. Your eyes close, your body grooves to the sounds and the beats and the thuds of the tech house that is now expertly laid out for all to enjoy. Dark and driving, thumping techno is paired with mystical, beautiful, melodic house. That passionately and expertly paired genre bending style can only mean one thing. Marbs has taken the decks. Having grown up in Southern California with the now notoriously known motley crew called Desert Hearts, Marbs, an artistic kid, was primarily influenced by legends like Pink Floyd and Tool, while also listening to underground hip hop, reggae, and rock, displaying his no holds barred love for all genres from an early age. Flash forward to San Francisco's Love Fest, art cars roaming the city, house music spilling from speakers, and Marbs\u2019 musical tastes were forever changed thanks to ruler of the house music game and party guru, Lee Burridge. After years of djing the San Diego, LA, and Burning Man party circuits, the Desert Hearts crew took it upon themselves to throw their own kind of party. One built on love, acceptance, and strictly, House and Techno, their 2012 one time gathering of 200 people in the Mojave (the coldest one ever, we swear!!) has turned into one of the most talked about and adored boutique festivals in the US. None of which could be possible without Marbs, lovingly coined, \"Papa Bear\", he is truly the backbone of the project behind the scenes, where he runs most of the logistics with a steady hand and a humble heart. He\u2019s easily one of the nicest guys on the planet and is the most modest of the crew, which is insane given his endless barrage of talents beyond his musical endeavors. While Desert Hearts catapults successfully into the scene as a major player through their twice yearly festival, touring internationally throwing parties under the moniker City Hearts, and launching a (free!) record label, Marbs continues to hone his production skills and also blows the art game out of the water, hand drawing all of the label\u2019s artwork and inspiring tattoo artists everywhere. Marbs\u2019 musical talents and humble dj presence commands any dance floor with his sounds of mystical darkness and whimsical tribal rhythms; the night sky is the limit for this King of Darkness. With a sound like no other, a heart of gold, and a determination matched by few, Marbs is sure to lead this movement of love until the very happy end.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ricky Valido ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10390485.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "On Tour Now!\nVisit RickyValido.com\nhttps://twitter.com/RickyValido\ninstagram.com/RickyValido", "otherInfo": "Ricky Valido will be airing live this Saturday May 23rd for a Memorial Day Salute!

His focus on house music from the land of funk and disco, was triggered while playing the club and warehouse scene in San Francisco.\n\nAs one of the major players in laying the foundations of a strong West Coast dance scene, Doc has always been a master of mixing the crowd with the music. Neatly avoiding pigeonholing, while embracing a myriad of different styles, his set creates a warm unique vibe of empathy on the dance floor.\n\nDoc's legendary 8 hour sets at Flammable Liquid, Sunday Love, to the most underground lofts, and warehouse parties know no colors, age or sexual orientation. Not only does he regularly devastate dance floors in prestigious clubs like New York's Twilo and Liverpool's Cream, to the smallest loft parties, but he can also send a crowd of ravers into a euphoric groove. That's rare these days in a scene where there are sizable walls between the two ends of the dance music spectrum.\n\nWhile most star DJ's are one-note musicians sticking to a single subgenera of music, Doc' s live sets bring many styles of music as well as people together. In this age of specialized formats among DJ's and producers, what sets Martin apart from his peers is his ability to spin everything from deep house, acid, funk, tribal, and classics in a set, while having it all make sense. Doc is one of the most sought after DJs in America. Constantly touring, he can be found playing records everywhere from England to New Zealand, and everywhere in between. As the first West Coast DJ to ever hold many residencies in New York, he continues to spread the gospel according to Doc.\n\nNow residing in L.A. he has begun to spread his vibe through making music in the studio as well as playing it. Remixing The Mighty Dub Katz projects for Nervous Records, as well as original tracks for Moonshine, Shaboom, 99 North, and the ever growing Leaf Recordings to name a few.\n\nDoc's magic continues to grow, whether it is on the turntables or in the studio.

From The Wreckage glowed with a rootsy golden tone that encompassed everything from indie-folk, to alt-country to blues-rock to Southern psychedelia. Its creators, touring musician turned songwriter and producer Dwight Baker and singer-songwriter Patty Lynn, began making music together on a lark, never dreaming anything would come of it. Baker describes it as \u201ckind of like what happens when two friends hold hands and jump in a freezing lake just to see what it feels like.\u201d Thanks to the undeniable chemistry between the pair, the music took on a life of its own and The Wind and The Wave soon found themselves with a major-label record deal, embarking on U.S. headlining tours, having their songs appear in such TV shows as Grey\u2019s Anatomy, and racking up millions of plays on Spotify and Apple Music. The band also earned itself a rabid following, with fans especially enamored of Lynn\u2019s feisty vocals and brutally personal lyrics about challenging relationships with lovers and family members as well as her relationship with herself. \u201cPeople really treasure that album,\u201d Baker says. \u201cWe got tons of letters from people saying it saved their life. They\u2019re people who are conflicted and searching and they connect with Patty\u2019s lyrics more than anything.\u201d\n\nWhen it came time for The Wind and The Wave to make their second album, Baker says he and Lynn felt \u201csome bit of an obligation to deliver that again.\u201d The band definitely delivered on their sophomore album, Happiness Is Not A Place, and the result is the sound of a band that has stretched itself and grown. Lynn managed to dig a little deeper with her lyrics, exploring her difficult feelings on commitment, and family, while acknowledging her own frantic mind. And the band\u2019s sonic palette is nervier, thanks to the album being recorded live by producer Butch Walker. \u201cTo me, it sounds reckless with a rock and roll spirit and attitude, an \u2018I don\u2019t give a fuckedness,\u2019 if you will. I wanted it to make sense to our fans, but to feel like a step forward musically. And I think we accomplished that. It\u2019s really rough around the edges, and there\u2019s a lot of urgency and pent-up stuff that probably came from both Patty and my nervousness about making a record with an outside producer.\u201d\n\nAfter being dropped by two major labels, all expectations and second guesses went flying out the window. The band\u2019s third full length album, Human Beings Let You Down, was a record made in hotels and backstage dressing rooms across the US. \u201cGetting married was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d says Lynn, \u201cBut it also brought out a lot, good and bad, and therapy helped me work through it. That\u2019s what the song Neon Prayer Flags is all about.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotta tough to be Patty, or anyone in her life, because if something\u2019s amiss, she\u2019s going to write about it. And you\u2019re going to know it\u2019s about you, and you\u2019re going to feel weird about it,\u201d Baker says with a chuckle. \u201cEveryone\u2019s in the line of fire. Patty and I are two people who, while we strive to be joyful and positive, can be very much morose and negative, and that definitely comes out in the songs.\u201d\n\nThe band is currently working on their fourth album, and will embark on a series of acoustic mini tours in 2020, called The Feelings Club.", "otherInfo": "Hey friends and fam!

The San Diego-native has earned a dusty mystique over the past few years as the center of the Desert Hearts movement and as a house and techno provocateur with a stage presence that suggests he will ride this wave all the way to the top. If there's one thing Mikey does well, it's get the party started.\n\nLion has brought the mothafuckin' ruckus to the stages of Lightning in a Bottle, the dustiest storms at Burning Man, and The Do LaB at Coachella, earning nods from Claude VonStroke, Jamie Jones, and Green Velvet in the process. In doing so, Lion and his signature top hat have developed a boisterous voice in the House & Techno scene with strong tribal, hip-hop, and psychedelic elements.\n\nBut it all started with Wu-Tang and Daft Punk. Lion first found his way behind the decks as a thirteen year old kid, scratching underground hip-hop records religiously after school. At Coachella as a seventeen year old, he witnessed that legendary Daft Punk performance on the same night he tasted his first dose of psychedelics. The show had such a monumental impact on him, he gave up Hip-Hop and became a House DJ the very next day.\n\nAfter honing his craft with weekly marathon DJ sessions at Sala Razzmatazz in Barcelona, Mikey was introduced to Burner culture at Lightning in a Bottle, 2011. It was at his first Burning Man in 2011 that he found a community calling and merged forces with his brother Porkchop, life long friends Marbs & Deep Jesus, and the inimitable Lee Reynolds to form The Desert Hearts Crew.\n\nIn November 2012, Desert Hearts began as a seedy, 200-person renegade gathering deep in the Mojave Desert. The intrepid crew barely survived a set of extreme weather conditions and unfortunate circumstances, but that first party sparked a fire. The entire point of that first Desert Hearts was to create as much love as humanly possible, and now that same gathering has evolved into the darling of the West Coast house and techno scene. The Bi-annual festival is capped at 3500 attendees in order to create the best possible vibe. Built upon beautiful people getting as weird as possible to deep and trippy house and techno, Desert Hearts has already achieved iconic status in the North American Festival Scene.\n\nDesert Hearts has given rise to a family of thousands and it's safe to call it a bonafide movement of love. And while Desert Hearts Records launched in 2014 as a totally-free record label, pushes the sonic aesthetic of the scene, the crew\u2019s busy international calendar of bookings has the DH message spreading far and wide. At the center of it all is Mikey Lion, the dusty prince of desert hearts, a beacon of weird far and wide, and one of this generation\u2019s most compelling agents of love.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "RYBO ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9190795.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "House, Techno, Electronic", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DUNE (Official) ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8685085.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Harder Styles Of Dance, Happy Hardcore, Rave, Techno, Electronic", "Time": "8:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "www.dune.dance", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Stephen B Lawrence ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8490594.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "8:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-songwriter Stephen B.

In the club he mixes up the likes of new stars Dusky and Huxley with the next level, underground gems he sources from labels and producers across the world, crafted with the kind of experience that only comes from two decades of DJing. The same fervent, crate-digging attitude he\u2019s always been known for can also be found on his radio show, where he champions new talent and obscure tracks he picks up on his travels, having first roadtested them in the booth.\n\nHis label, UNDR THE RADR, launched in 2014 with his own \u2018Dangerous Thoughts\u2019 track (under his S-Man guise), also saw the collaboration \u2018Drop The Needle\u2019 with Man Without A Clue & Kevin Knapp. The collaborations with Huxley (\u2018The Calling\u2019) and Tough Love (\u2018In The Name Of Love\u2019) followed suit, continuing the theme of exploring new ground that was shown with his \u2018Amour\u2019 single for Riva Starr\u2019s Snatch label.\n\nFrom a humble beginning in NYC to multi-year residencies in Ibiza; from digging in dusty crates to headlining festival main-stages around the world, Roger is truly a self-made man and and dance music star. The crafting of Roger Sanchez, the DJ, started in the late 80s in Corona, Queens, where as a young man he was enticed by the early roots of hip-hop sprouting all over New York. Attending parties by the Bronx River and other jams as a break-dancer and graffiti artist, Sanchez was introduced to DJ\u2019ing through friends, trying his hand in an organic environment where his creativity behind the decks flourished from a few singles into an ambitious catalogue of over two thousand original productions and remixes.\n\nThese tracks have not always been under his own name, though. Roger has released music under a slew of monikers, including S-Man, Roger S., The Nu-Solution, Underground Solution, DV8, Ego Trip, El Mariachi, The Funkjunkeez, Tribal Infusion, Twilight, and Transatlantic Soul amongst others. Each new name has allowed him to push his music in unique yet blended directions, allowing him to carve parallel and weaving paths through the tastes of the times while enjoying opportunities to break out of the known.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s DJ\u2019d knows that you have to put in work, both to sharpen your skills and to find those unique cuts that no one else has. Early on, Roger became a dedicated crate digger, searching for obscure samples and break beats in influential NYC record stores like Rock & Soul and Vinylmania.\n\nFormerly a talented student of the arts who attended the Pratt Institute\u2019s School of Architecture, music culture grew to encompass Roger\u2019s life as he began to sell his own mixtapes on the sidewalks of Broadway in order to finance his earliest gigs. With encouragement from his father, an engineer, Roger put his thoughts about a career in architecture on hold and launched himself into music full-time. His first 12-inch, \u201cDreamworld\u201d, came out on the Outer Limits imprint in 1990 under the name Egotrip. It was around this time, that Sanchez began to take producing seriously as a compliment to his DJ\u2019ing. He soon released \u201cLuv Dancin\u201d for Gladys Pizarro on the iconic Strictly Rhythm records under the name Underground Solution, which led to his first tour.\n\nRoger hasn\u2019t stopped grinding since, using his decades of experience to build enticing remixes for a wide range of artists such as Michael Jackson, The Police, Diana Ross, Jamiroquai, Maroon 5 and even the So-Cal punk-pop outfit, No Doubt, for which he won a Grammy in 2003 for Best Remixed Recording with the song \u201cHella Good\u201d.\n\nAn early pioneer of podcasting, Roger was awarded the first-ever Best Podcast Award at the International Dance Music Awards in 2007. In addition to his bi-weekly podcast, he also hosts a weekly terrestrial and online radio show, which attracts over 10 million listeners across a worldwide audience. The Release Yourself Radio Show is broadcasted in 30 markets on every continent, including countries as diverse as Brazil, Russia, Mexico, the UK, Germany and Australia. In addition to broadcasting, he creates podcasts and mixes from the road, dominating a tour schedule that would exhaust even the most hardened of festival warriors. This man is on a mission to spread the musical word to every corner of the globe. In addition to his tireless touring, broadcasting and producing schedule, Roger has held prominent residencies on the island of Ibiza since the year 2000 at some of the biggest superclubs on The White Isle, including Pacha, Space and Amnesia; after taking a break in 2015 he\u2019ll return there in 2016. With a true international appeal, real fans look to house music leaders like Sanchez to keep music\u2019s honesty at the forefront of their vision. Furthermore, he has carefully assembled celebrated compilation albums under the Release Yourself title every year since 2002, showcasing his own work alongside tunes from both established and new talents.\n\nEver evolving on his hustle, always pushing himself, and others, to do better, the S-Man sums it up perfectly when he states: \u201cI\u2019m always moving forward, but never losing sight of where I\u2019ve been.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Krigar\u00e8 ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7621814.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Alternative, Pop", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Krigar\u00e8 is known for her strong imagery with intense storytelling lyrics.

He was heavily involved with the Occupy Oakland protests and expressed its rage and hope brilliantly in 2015's Wedgewood. This year, he followed up the album with his most intimate, and perhaps most singer-songwriter-y album to date: Kings Corner. The songs started (mostly) as much of his early, unrecorded work from over a decade and a half ago, that were never properly released. He intended to record these songs to give away to fans, but as he worked on it, he realized the songs could use work and be a legit album. These songs deal with drug addiction, death, grief, and overwhelming sadness.

Pianist Kenny Hensley learned to fly planes and enrolled in kung-fu training in China, while bassist Chris Zasche packed up a camper and went off the grid in the Canadian Rockies. Drummer Tyler Williams put down stakes across the country and immersed himself in the burgeoning music scene in Richmond, Va., while vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Charity Rose Thielen honed her compositional skills by writing for such legends as Mavis Staples.\n\nAfter his own cross-country trip to reconnect with family and friends, vocalist/guitarist Jonathan Russell traveled to Haiti and found inspiration working with the non-profit Artists For Peace And Justice. \"When I found out we were going to have a significant amount of time off, I saw it as an opportunity to touch base again -- to listen to what other people were saying and what they were going through,\" he says. \"I really wanted to make sure that I reconnected with a world that was starting to feel farther and farther away.\"\n\nWhen they regrouped last summer in Stinson Beach, Ca., to start writing together again, \"it almost felt like we were a new band, trying things we hadn't tried,\" Zasche recalls. \"We stayed at a bungalow on the beach. We'd wake up, have coffee and go boogie boarding. We were ready and excited to be back together.\"\n\nThat renewed sense of purpose can be felt throughout Signs Of Light, the group's first release for Warner Bros. Records. \"This album isn't about us now having achieved our dreams,\" says Thielen. \"The day we started being able to live off our art was the day we achieved our dreams, in my mind.

In all he does so with restraint, whether on country tinged acoustic ballads (the excellent \"Amen\") or aching confession-drenched numbers\"[1] \"Battered Wooden Body\" was recorded in Oxford, Mississippi at Tweed Recording Studio and was engineered by Andrew Ratcliffe whose discography includes (The Black Crows, The Damnwells, American Aquarium)\n\nIn 2012, Shallow left A Few Good Liars and started writing and recording songs that would later be released as his first solo self-titled album, Travis Shallow, to regional critical acclaim in the southeastern United States.\n\nShallow went back to Tweed Recording Studio with Andrew Ratcliffe engineering to record his solo debut album. This solo album was acoustically driven with an accompanying band to highlight the songwriting and lyrical prowess. \"Shallow is a singer whose vocal personality is ultimately a category unto itself, like a Willie Nelson, an Otis Redding. He could sing anything and make it sound great, make it well worth listening to. His self-titled album has seven songs like that.\"[2] Shallow's solo album has a maturity to it that catapulted Shallow into being a weathered musician's musician.\n\nAfter the release of his self-titled album in March 2016, Shallow took the show to the people performing intimate shows, stripped down with him and an acoustic guitar. Shallow also landed himself some national opening spots after releasing his debut solo album with legend Gregg Allman from The Allman Brothers, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real (son of legend Willie Nelson), Jerry Joseph, Todd Snider, and fellow native North Carolina band, American Aquarium.\n\n\"One look at Travis Shallow and you could be deceived. Long hair, blue jeans, worn cowboy boots and sunglasses, toting a guitar case, it makes you think he\u2019s always wanted to be a musician, swagger and all.\"[3]\nShallow is now writing for and fronting a new line-up, Travis Shallow & The Deep End, with a studio album titled, The Great Divide, released on October 31, 2017. This 8-song album is a mix of Americana, soul, and rock and roll, recorded analog to two-inch tape at Overdub Lane in Durham, North Carolina with Jason Merritt engineering.\n\nThe Great Divide was featured in Relix Magazine upon release. \"Emerging from NC- Travis Shallow & The Deep End dive into The Great Divide with their eyes wide open.

Drummer Tyler Williams put down stakes across the country and immersed himself in the burgeoning music scene in Richmond, Va., while vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Charity Rose Thielen honed her compositional skills by writing for such legends as Mavis Staples.\n\nAfter his own cross-country trip to reconnect with family and friends, vocalist/guitarist Jonathan Russell traveled to Haiti and found inspiration working with the non-profit Artists For Peace And Justice. \"When I found out we were going to have a significant amount of time off, I saw it as an opportunity to touch base again -- to listen to what other people were saying and what they were going through,\" he says. \"I really wanted to make sure that I reconnected with a world that was starting to feel farther and farther away.\"\n\nWhen they regrouped last summer in Stinson Beach, Ca., to start writing together again, \"it almost felt like we were a new band, trying things we hadn't tried,\" Zasche recalls. \"We stayed at a bungalow on the beach. We'd wake up, have coffee and go boogie boarding. We were ready and excited to be back together.\"\n\nThat renewed sense of purpose can be felt throughout Signs Of Light, the group's first release for Warner Bros.

It was a bit of good luck.\u201d\n\nThese grainy, absorbing images play over the exhilarating whirl of \u201cDivebomber\u201d, a song inspired by the World War II film of the same name, and one of several on his new album that evoke a sensation of sharp ascent, of giddy height, the free-fall thrill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rush, if you fly fast enough. With a rush of blood, you can bet you forget everyone.\u201d\n\nFinn did not set out on his third solo album with a theme in mind. But by the time he came to call it after another track on the record, \u201cDizzy Heights\u201d, it had become inescapable. \u201cIt crept up on me. I started noticing it in lots of places.\n\n\u201cYou start off with a number of different threads and angles and demos, and they dictate the terms of the record. It\u2019s only in the course of the process that you maybe get a feeling there\u2019s a type of song emerging, or an atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe cloud jumpers epitomise, too, the Finn creative process: an attachment to a work-ethic and prosaic rigour - \u201ca willingness to be disciplined, punctual and focused\u201d \u2013 but designed for the arrival of something more, \u201cto capture the little flashes of complete happenstance or good fortune that come your way \u2013 often from a mistake\u201d.\n\nAn indirect inspiration for the height motif is mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1953, five years before Neil was born. \u201cHilary had a huge impact on my generation of New Zealanders,\u201d says Finn. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the New Zealand DNA about trying to scale impossible heights. It\u2019s something that can be very positive, but also has its downside.\u201d\n\nAmid its vertiginous, richly melodic swirl, Dizzy Heights contemplates love (\u201cBetter than TV\u201d), loss (\u201cFlying in the Face of Love\u201d), ageing (\u201cRecluse\u201d) and allure (\u201cLights of New York\u201d). It peeks, too - in \u201cIn My Blood\u201d, for example - into the abyss.\n\nNeil Finn was 18 when he was invited by his older brother Tim to join the trailblazing art rock band Split Enz. His career since might be measured as a series of bounds, the best-known being Crowded House, which he founded with Paul Hester and Nick Seymour after the breakup of Split Enz in 1984. Four albums, among them Crowded House and Together Alone, brought the group popular and critical acclaim around the world.\n\nAlong the way, there have been a host of collaborations, including with brother Tim and wife Sharon, and an array of names from Johnny Marr, Ed O\u2019Brien, Eddie Vedder and most of Wilco. There have been two solo records, Try Whistling This and One Nil (or One All). And yet Dizzy Heights unmistakably marks a fresh leap.\n\nWith wife Sharon (bass) and sons Liam (guitar) and Elroy (drums), Finn travelled in two bursts to producer Dave Fridmann\u2019s Tarbox Road studio in upstate New York, to record songs composed at his Auckland studio, Roundhead. With Fridmann (Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips), and in collaborations with young New Zealand musicians Connan Mockasin and SJD, Finn has assembled a textured, heady sound, furnished and elevated by woozy strings and soaring vocals.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it a solo record in a stripped back singer-songwriter sort of way,\u201d says Finn. \u201cI had a feeling Dave would be good at adding some odd shapes to the music. Which I always welcome \u2013 making things a little more expansive ... He is good at subverting things, and making things sound a bit messed up and not as obvious, rather than being too tasteful, which is always a temptation.\u201d\n\nFinn remembers an important English teacher, from four decades ago at his high school in Te Awamutu, a small rural town in New Zealand\u2019s north island. His name was Ron Martin, and he raced them through the School Certificate syllabus in a matter of weeks, to clear space for reading, writing, arguing, making films (\u201cHe [later] gave me a Super-8 movie I\u2019d made in his class, and I\u2019d done a kind of dramatised version of the song \u2018Aqualung\u2019 by Jethro Tull ... I was dressed as a tramp with an old coat\u201d).\n\nSays Finn: \u201cWe had a very spirited debate one day in class about whether having big aspirations, big dreams, was a good idea given it can ultimately lead to disillusionment and isolation and at worst bitterness. There was quite a lot of variance of opinion, and I definitely came out for the, yeah, you\u2019ve got to have the big dreams and big aspirations and it doesn\u2019t matter, what the hell.\n\n\u201cI think of that sometimes when ambition, or having big dreams, seems slightly shallow and vain. Because the motivations they shift \u2013 imperceptibly sometimes ...\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like those boys, jumping off that cliff. I keep thinking back to the one who runs to the edge and stops twice, before leaping off. Life carries on being like that.\u201d\n\n- TOBY MANHIRE", "otherInfo": "Neil Finn is back for more Fangradio live audio streams on Mixlr, Tuesdays and Saturdays at 3pm PT.\n\n\"Tuesday will be broadcast from my place, more or less solo.

Claude VonStroke's 'Who's Afraid of Detroit?' was one of the biggest tracks of 2006 and the label it came out on is Dirtybird Records, the Bay Area brainchild of VonStroke and DJ/producer Justin Martin. VonStroke and Martin have been injecting avarian squelch, funk and swagger into the tech house template for just over a year now, but while VonStroke was 2006's unofficial best newcomer, don't be surprised if Martin doesn't fly the coop soon too.\n\nIt might be a fresh sound, but Martin is not exactly a spring chicken. He's actually been releasing records since 2003 \u2013 his first single was 'The Sad Piano' issued on Ben Watt's London label Buzzin' Fly. Its simplicity and groove made it a favourite of DJs along the lines of Derrick Carter, Pete Tong and Mark Farina, while Charles Webster\u2019s classic remix of the cut even found favour with the Germans, popping up on Steve Bug's 'Bugnology'. Since then Martin has racked up two more twelves on Buzzin' Fly and a couple of jacking house tracks and remixes on labels such as Classic and Freerange. He also promises an artist album in 2007.\n\nWhile San Francisco might not thought be thought of as a dance hotbed, there's always been enough going on to turn the most curious heads onto the culture. The early drum n bass scene turned Martin away from jazz and hip hop and onto the rave culture of the nineties, a short sharp shock which inspired him to take up DJing and producing. But the truth is Martin had always been musical \u2013 as a child he studied the saxophone and classical piano, a musicality which shows in both his productions and DJ sets. \"Justin started playing the pots and pans at the age of 2,\" his MySpace puts it. \"Now he is a DJ.\"\n\nMartin's rise has been prominent enough to even make an older tradition of West Coast house take notice. He's also a new face on Om Records, home to big West Coast househeads such as Miguel Migs, Andy Caldwell and Fred Everything. Martin\u2019s remix of Iz & Diz's 'Magnificent' is pretty slamming, and the label has also chosen him to mix a volume in their latest compilation series 'Om: Winter Sessions', on which he spins tracks and remixes from Switch, Jesse Rose, and Phonique.

Jeremy Sole is on a mission to show how music is a singular universal language, and that each culture\u2019s rhythms and melodies are no more than slang--different accents of the same mother tongue. His DJ sets, remixes and original compositions juxtapose world sounds and experimental beats into a sonic ritual - a celebration of life out loud. As a teenager, Chicago-born Jeremy Sole's loft parties were a culture clash of creative urban youth. Jeremy's upbringing was seeped in the rich Chicago history of Blues, Jazz, Disco and Funk - and he reveled in that sacred space where they all blend together. He matured as a turntablist in Jazz, Dub, and experimental hybrid bands. Meanwhile his obsession grew to include music from every corner of the world. In 2001 Sole moved to Los Angeles, and with his broad musical palette, felt right at home in the spiciest melting pot in the country. As Co-Founder and resident deejay of \"AFRO FUNK\u00c9\", Sole and his partners have drawn a loyal crowd every week for the past 9 years. This is his arena for Afrobeat, Latin, Brazilian, Indian, Jamaican and other authentic and remixed world rhythms. Hundreds of international guests have joined them, from deejays Chebi Sabbah and Cut Chemist to impromptu jam sessions with Zap Mama and Stevie Wonder. Collaborating with Eric \"Wiseacre\" Tucker, Sole returns to his underground roots with \"theLIFT\" - roaming monthly, all-night warehouse events with heavyweights like Bonobo, Nickodemus and King Britt gracing their stages. What started at his small downtown loft, grew to well over 1,500 people by their one-year anniversary. Since then, theLIFT has taken place in Miami, NYC, Palm Springs, Portugal, London, and San Francisco. Jeremy has had the honor of sharing the stage and the studio with hundreds of his creative inspirations, including Roy Ayers, Ben Harper, Tony Allen, Stevie Wonder, Seu Jorge, Fat Freddy's Drop, Parliament, Lee Scratch Perry, and Quantic. Gilles Peterson (BBC Radio1), widely known as the most influential tastemaker of our generation, listed Sole as \"#2 DJ OF THE YEAR 2011\" at Peterson's prestigious \"Worldwide Awards\". Sole's DJ performance at Coachella 2012 played a large part in further embedding his name as a pioneer in the burgeoning \"Global Bass\" scene. Sole was the last DJ to open for Ray Charles, deejayed for Sly Stone's birthday party, and had the distinct honor of mixing at the California Democratic Party's Election Night Celebration - playing for over 10,000 people at the exact moment when Barack Obama officially became the 44th President. Sole spent most of 2006 in the studio producing with Ms. Lauryn Hill. After hearing him mix, she asked if he had ever considered getting into radio, \"because this is the music the people need to hear\u201d. A few months later, KCRW called to ask him that exact same question, and he agreed to join the ranks of what New York Times dubbed the \"most influential radio station in the country,\". You can tune into Sole every Wednesday at midnight in Los Angeles on 89.9 KCRW (or worldwide, streaming and archived at www.kcrw.com/jeremysole). Sole has also produced official remixes for BECK (US), FEMI KUTI (Nigeria), NATURAL SELF (UK), NOVALIMA (Peru), JAZZANOVA (Germany), THIEVERY CORPORATION (US), ROCKY DAWUNI (Ghana), QUANTIC (Colombia) and others. In 2011, EMI enlist Sole to remix DAVID BOWIE'S \"Golden Years\". The result features Ticklah (of Antibalas and Amy Winehouse) with the Daptone musicians for an all-analog reworking of the 1976 classic. In Sole's most ambitious project to date, he enlisted some of LA's most sought-after musicians to birth an organic, turntable-led, 9-piece ensemble featuring steel drums, a 4-piece horn section, violinist and more. This massive undertaking he calls \"MUSAICS\", a musical mosaic of many genres interlaced into a spiritual dancefloor ritual. Their debut concert was held at the renowned Getty Museum, and a live album has been recorded to crystalize the improvisational style they embody.

Now, on their fourth studio album Crush, drummer Adam Deitch, guitarists Adam Smirnoff and Eric Krasno, bassist Erick \u201cJesus\u201d Coomes, keyboardist Neal Evans, saxophonist Ryan Zoidis, and trumpet players Eric Bloom and Rashawn Ross deepen that sound by channeling the sonic freedom and infectious energy oftheir incendiary live show.\n\nProduced by Lettuce and Co-Produced recorded/mixed by Joel Hamilton at Brooklyn\u2019s Studio G, Crush first came to life on the road, with the band developing new material and testing it out live as they toured. \u201cWe\u2019ve all noticed that our music goes into a lot of different directions onstage, and we wanted to capture that in a way that we never really have before,\u201d says Coomes, who names classic psychedelia and \u201890s hip-hop among Lettuce\u2019s key inspirations on\nCrush. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more wide-open in terms\nstyle, but it still stays true to the funk.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to 2012\u2019s Fly, Crush finds Lettuce brilliantly infusing their psychedelic and hip-hop sensibilities into bass-heavy funk. With its spidery guitar work and hypnotic beats, \u201cPhyllis\u201d is a delicately sprawling epic that embodies what Deitch refers to as \u201ca chill-hop vibe that\u2019s kind of the flip-side of all that powerful uptempo funk that people might expect from us.\u201d On \u201cGet Greasy,\u201d Lettuce give a nod to the\ngroove-fueled EDM subgenre known as future funk, building off its highly danceable rhythm with a blissfully loose and horn-laced arrangement. And on \u201cHe Made a Woman Out of Me,\u201d guest vocalist Alecia Chakour lends her bluesy growl to a scorching take on Bobbie Gentry\u2019s 1970 country-soul classic.\n\nWhether paying homage to Led Zeppelin on the fiery and guitar-driven \u201cSilverdome\u201d or delivering a deeply riveting and richly textured hip-hop medley with \u201cOresteia,\u201d Lettuce maneuver through Crush\u2019s kaleidoscopic sound with sophisticated ease and powerful synergy. \u201cMore so than any of the records we\u2019ve done before, this album is very much about the improvised grooves and improvised solos,\u201d says Krasno. \u201cInstead of going at it like, \u2018Here\u2019s a melody, now here\u2019s a guitar solo, here\u2019s another\nmelody, here\u2019s a sax solo,\u2019 everyone\u2019s leaning on each other in a way that\u2019s completely unspoken. It\u2019s all of us moving as one unit and creating this new sound together.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lettuce, that sense of unity and togetherness has much to do with a camaraderie that\u2019s only intensified over the lifespan of the band. Formed in 1992, when several band members attended a summer program at Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music as teenagers, Lettuce was founded on a shared love of legendary funk artists like Earth, Wind & Fire and Tower of Power. After returning to Berklee\nas undergrads in 1994, Lettuce started playing in local clubs and steadily built up a following that soon extended to cities across the country and then throughout the world. Releasing their studio debut Outta Here in 2002 and its follow-up album Rage!in 2009, the band dedicated the coming years to balancing their frequent touring with involvement in a host of other musical endeavors (including Evans and Krasno\u2019s role as founding members of acclaimed soul/jazz trio Soulive).\n\nIn recent years, Lettuce have watched their fanbase expand as they\u2019ve hit bigger and bigger stages and earned their name as a can\u2019t-miss festival act.

Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011. Elephant Mountain has just recorded their new album and will be releasing it Spring/Summer of 2013.

The band has been described as one which \"has learned from their predecessor's mistakes, taken their feet off their monitors, abandoned the rock poses, and ditched the apathy to create a montage of rock stylings that is from Gin Blossoms to Live and Sheryl Crow to STP.\" - Dave White, Face Magazine\n\nThe band's efforts have earned them numerous accolades, paving the way for them to successfully tour New England's club and tavern circuit. \"The fact that we don't limit ourselves to where we play helps us gain the positive exposure we need to bring the NOW sound to as many people as possible,\" says Alden. \"We've achieved a kind of zen of the bar band attitude towards these gigs. Given that we roll into places without the pretentious attitude that we only play 'club' shows helps us to break the 'original music ice' with new crowds, rock each place harder than the last, and sell numerous CD's at each performance.\"\n\nEach year seems better than the last for the band as their second full length effort, \"Days of Summer\" earns them airplay from regional radio and countless spins in fans' CD players, i-Pods, and podcasts from around the world. If this record is anything like their first CD, \"Transitions,\" which according to Portland rock critic Dan Short who describes this CD as a \"shockingly good record,\" it would appear that the successful future of Now is Now as one of Maine's premier rock & roll bands is one which is already set in stone.", "otherInfo": "A live performance streamed to Facebook featuring Mitch Alden originals and select cover tunes."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Julianne Ankley, Julianne Ankley & The Rogues ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8964403.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Julianne Ankley The Rogues: Brian Roscoe White, Anamaria Ylizaliturri, Roger Noonan and Rob Emanuel.", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Julianne Ankley's soulful country style hails from a small Michigan border town close to the shore of Lake Huron and within earshot of the musical influences of Detroit.\n\nWith seven Detroit Music Awards and 46 nominations, Julianne has been writing heartfelt songs and delivering electric performances, both solo and with her band The Rogues, for years.

She is also the founder of SBS Records.\n\nMalone was born and raised in Atlanta, GA by a musician mom with whom she toured in the summers. She grew up listening to her mother and grandmother sing in the church choir every Sunday when they werent on the road. She dropped out of high school at 16 to begin work on her rock and roll degree. After a few brushes with the law and some unsavory characters, Michelle decided to go back to high school and became the valedictorian for a small class. She attended Agnes Scott College with dreams of becoming a doctor, but was offered a record deal with Clive Davis at Arista Records, which looked alot more interesting to her than more school.\n\nWhen it came time to craft her own sound, she took those religious and secular roots, blended in enough folk, blues and rock to satisfy, and came up with a rootsy high-spirited sound that brings acoustic and electric slide and passionate vocals together harkening back to the lost recordings of Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi, and Lucinda Williams.\n\nAfter several major label releases, Malone is now an independent artist with 15 studio records to date and an impressive resume which includes hi profile performances with everyone from Gregg Allman to John Mayer, the Atlanta Symphony to Ellen Degeneres, various awards including best albums, 4x best singer, 3x best acoustic guitarist, and 2 Grammy ballot nominations. Her songs have appeared in such films as Bam Bam and Celeste, All Over Me, Shotgun Jesus and television programs True Blood, Dawson's Creek, Felicity, Brooklyn South. They have been recorded by Indigo Girls (for which she received both gold and platinum records), Antigone Rising, and Vistoso Bosses.\n\nMalone has always made time for philanthropic endeavors such as running the Paris marathon for Team In Training/The Leukemia Society, and cycling with Team Earth Challenge from Atlanta to Yucca Mountain, NV in protest of the nuclear waste dumping. In 2012 she started a college scholarship fund for girls in need. She currently contributes to various women's and children's non-profit organizations, and donates time to local Georgia music organizations and schools.\n\nMalone has performed for TedX Peachtree, sang the National Anthem for The Atlanta Braves and The Houston Comets, been honored with a Signature guitar slide modeled and named after her by Rocky Mountain Slides, was the keynote speaker at a SoCal high school graduation, has been the rhythm guitarist and mandolin player for Kristian Bush (Sugarland), a satellite member of the Indigo Girls, is endorsed by Supro USA Guitars and amps Reunion Blues, and Breedlove guitars and mandolins. Michelle's latest recording, Slings and Arrows, was released March 2018 and debuted at #8 on the Billboard Blues charts.\n\nFor tour dates, info and booking or, please visit www.michellemalone.com/contact", "otherInfo": "Join me for a Facebook live stream concert! 7pm eastern standard time at Michelle Malone Music!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Adam A Nelson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9036897.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Piano Rock, Pop", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Sprung from the fertile musical farms tended to by the Carpenters, the Apples in Stereo and Ben Folds, Adam A Nelson has been selling nostalgia in dueling piano clubs all over the country since 2008.

The reflective piano ballad \u201cFriend\u201d opens the album with Witt sifting through feelings of attraction for someone she knows should be just a pal and not a lover, while the aching vocal showcase \u201cConsolation Prize\u201d pairs torchy piano with taut electric guitar accents as Witt muses over the ways in which we edit our pasts to fit the present. Revisionary history, indeed \u2014 the album title comes from a lyric in that song.\n\n\u201cWe can constantly be revising how we remember things, and maybe that\u2019s not so bad,\u201d says Witt, whose TV credits include The Sopranos, Friday Night Lights and Law & Order: Criminal Intent. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s how we move on.\u201d\n\nProduced by Ben Folds, Revisionary History was years in the making. Some of the songs date back to the mid-\u201900s, which gave her plenty of time to hone them in concert before heading to Folds\u2019 studio in Nashville, where she recorded the album in two week-long chunks in the spring and late fall of 2013.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got such a unique and specific vision for how those songs should best be presented,\u201d Witt says of Folds. \u201cI had no doubt that he was going to bring to it his own vision for the sound of each song, but he also wanted it to be a truthful reflection of what I do. The record sounds very much like me.\u201d\n\nWitt credits Folds for digging into the essence of each song for musical arrangements that sometimes brought out their hidden sides: the folky stomp on \u201cBlind,\u201d for example, highlighted the rootsy touches in a song Witt had been performing for years, while the mournful trumpet and marching drumbeat perfectly captured the mood on \u201cDown,\u201d a tune inspired by the smart but troubled character Witt played on Season Five of the Emmy-nominated FX series Justified, featuring the Emmy-nominated New York rapper and actor T.O.N.E-z\n\n\u201cWhen I heard it all put together, it made me cry,\u201d Witt says. \u201cAt the end, when the trumpet comes in, it sounds like a soul making its way up.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the girl-power anthem \u201cAbout Me,\u201d which shows the influence of Folds and Billy Joel in the robust piano and Witt\u2019s defiant determined vocals; or the lush, sultry \u201960s-style pop tune \u201cTheme From Pasadena,\u201d which Witt wrote with Folds for the movie Cold Turkey (Witt starred opposite Peter Bogdanovich and Cheryl Hines in the indie drama, which was originally to be called Pasadena). In fact, Revisionary History boasts such an array of sounds and styles that there\u2019s no pigeonholing Witt as a musician.\n\n\u201cI love all different types of music, so the songs that I come up with and am drawn to when I\u2019m writing are naturally all over the place,\u201d says Witt, whose movie credits include 88 Minutes with Al Pacino and Two Weeks Notice with Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.\n\nWitt has been a music lover since she was a little girl growing up in Worcester, Mass. She began playing piano when she was 7, competing in international piano competitions into her teen years. After she moved to Los Angeles at 14, she supported herself by playing in the lobby lounge of the Beverly Wilshire hotel until she landed her first regular acting job on the CBS show Cybil when she was 16. It took a few more years before she began consistently writing her own songs, and it wasn\u2019t until 2008 that she started performing them. Her first gig was opening for Jimmy Webb at a benefit in New York. Moving from standards and show tunes to original songs was a big leap for Witt.\n\n\u201cThere was a considerable fear factor,\u201d she says. \u201cAs an actor doing theater and doing live television, it wasn\u2019t about performing for people. It was about performing my own music. That\u2019s incredibly vulnerable.\u201d\n\nWitt\u2019s fears that audiences wouldn\u2019t respond proved very much unfounded, and the vulnerability of opening up to strangers helped her make the all-important connection that turned them into fans. 'The most that I can hope for is telling these stories that are incredibly personal, but saying them in a way that somebody else can relate to their own experiences,\" says Witt.\n\nbio:\n\nAlicia Witt has had a 3-decade long career, starting with her acting debut in David Lynch\u2019s classic \u2018Dune\u2019.\n\nWitt was most recently seen on Season 4 of the Emmy-award winning Showtime series \u2018House of Lies\u2019 opposite Don Cheadle. This past season, Alicia also appeared on the new DirecTv series \u2018The Kingdom\u2019, on the hit CBS show \u2018Elementary\u2019, and in 2015 in the new TNT series \u2018The Librarians\u2019, a role which she will be reprising on Season 2.\n\nIn 2014, Alicia joined the 5th Season of Emmy-award winning FX series \u2018Justified\u2019 with Timothy Olyphant. Alicia played Wendy Crowe, the smart and sexy paralegal sister of crime lord Darryl Crowe (Michael Rapaport) who takes matters into her own hands to bring him to justice in the Season 5 finale. Last summer she appeared at the Geffen Playhouse in the Los Angeles debut of Tony-nominated Neil Labute play \u2018reasons to be pretty\u2019. The four-hander also starred Amber Tamblyn, Shawn Hatosy and Nick Gehlfuss, and was directed by Randall Arney, Artistic Director of the Geffen.\n\nTo viewers of the Hallmark Channel, Alicia may be best known for her Christmas films \u2018Christmas at Cartwright\u2019s\u2019 (2014) and \u2018A Very Merry Mix-Up\u2019 (2013), which have become their highest rated of all time.\n\nIn 2013, Alicia appeared opposite Peter Bogdanovich and Cheryl Hines in the independent family dramedy 'Cold Turkey', in a performance which NY Daily News critic David Edelstein hailed as one of the best of 2013, and garnered the headline \u2018See Cold Turkey For Alicia Witt\u2019s Performance\u2019 in the Village Voice. Also released in 2013 was the film 'I Do', which had a nationwide theatrical release after screening at 25 festivals worldwide and winning 10 awards. Alicia has two songs featured in this film as well.\n\nAlicia is an accomplished singer/songwriter. A classically trained pianist, for the past 7 years she has been performing her original piano-driven rock all across the world, and has opened for Ben Folds Five, Jimmy Webb and John Fullbright. Her newest album, \u2018Revisionary History\u2019, is produced by Ben Folds and released through Compass Records on May 5, 2015. Her self-titled first EP came out in 2009 and her Kickstarter funded album, 'Live at Rockwood' was released following a self-booked national tour in 2012. Her music can be found at www.aliciawittmusic.com.\n\nOther recent credits include the 2012 Samuel Goldwyn film 'Cowgirls n Angels', with James Cromwell, and Seasons 4 and 5 of the Emmy award winning Friday Night Lights on NBC. Alicia starred opposite Al Pacino in the 2008 feature film '88 Minutes' for director Jon Avnet. That same year she played Detective Nola Falacci opposite Chris Noth on NBC\u2019s 'Law & Order: Criminal Intent' for half a season, taking over for Julianne Nicholson while she was on maternity leave.\n\nOther roles include Paramount\u2019s 'Last Holiday' with Queen Latifah and Timothy Hutton, and New Line\u2019s critically acclaimed film \u2018The Upside of Anger\u2019, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, opposite Joan Allen & Kevin Costner. She also starred in Warner Bros\u2019 hit romantic comedy, 'Two Weeks Notice', opposite Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.\n\nWitt appeared on-stage in fall 2006 at London\u2019s Royal Court Theatre in Terry Johnson\u2019s 'Piano/Forte'. She made her West End debut with Neil LaBute\u2019s 'The Shape of Things'. She was also seen on stage in 'Dissonance' at the Williamstown Theatre Festival. In April 2015, Alicia took the stage at the Gramercy Theatre for the 24 Hour Musicals off Broadway, for the 4th time.\n\nIn 1994, Witt appeared in the critically acclaimed 'Fun', which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival. The film, directed by Rafal Zielinski, depicts a tale of two disturbed young girls whose quest for fun leads them to murder. Witt received the \u201cSpecial Jury Recognition\u201d Award at Sundance and a nomination for an Independent Spirit Award. In 1998, she starred in Columbia Tristar\u2019s hit horror movie, 'Urban Legend.\n\nOn television, Witt starred for four seasons as Cybill Shepherd\u2019s daughter Zoey on the hit CBS sitcom \u2018Cybill\u2019. She also guest starred on the phenomenally successful HBO series, \u2018The Sopranos\u2019, and the Emmy award winning \u2018Ally McBeal\u2019, in which she sang with Randy Newman. Witt combined her acting talents with her skills as a pianist in the romantic comedy, 'Playing Mona Lisa'.\n\nAlicia made her directorial debut with the short film 'Belinda\u2019s Swan Song', which she also wrote. The film premiered at the 2006 Rhode Island International Film Festival and was screened at 9 additional festivals around the world, including the Los Angeles International Short Film Festival.\n\nShe also appeared in 'Mr. Holland\u2019s Opus', opposite Richard Dreyfuss, as clarinet player Gertrude, as well as 'Four Rooms' (Miramax) with Tim Roth, Madonna, and Lili Taylor, and directed by Quentin Tarantino, Allison Anders, Robert Rodriguez, and Alexandre Rockwell.

Also known for their phenomenal live show, the Nashville-based duo are now gearing up to make their Rounder debut with a sophomore album showcasing their boundless energy and tremendous generosity as songwriters and performers.\n\nDespite the deep sense of communion that infuses their music, Michael and Tanya hail from wildly different backgrounds. Originally from just outside Washington, D.C., Tanya discovered her supreme vocal skills at a young age and promptly pursued a career in music and acting. Meanwhile, Michael grew up in Cleveland and D.C., spending part of his childhood in homeless shelters and later enlisting in the U.S. Army. While stationed in one of Saddam Hussein\u2019s palaces several years after 9/11, he gained access to a piano and quickly captivated his fellow troops with his powerful vocal presence. Soon tasked with writing and performing songs in memoriam to his unit\u2019s fallen soldiers, Michael cultivated a distinct songwriting voice that he further developed upon returning home. After he and Tanya shared the stage at a music festival, the two began creating music together, eventually marrying and forming The War And Treaty. Their EP Down to the River arrived in July 2017, and the duo made their full-length debut with Healing Tide\u2014a widely acclaimed effort. The Associated Press called them, \u201c\u2026a powerhouse R&B duo who sound as though they were born to sing together,\u201d while Billboard went on to claim that, \u201cThe music world\u2026has definitely shown that it\u2019s ready to love The War and Treaty.\u201d\n\nThe War And Treaty have shared two new tracks from their forthcoming album that bring even more depth and dimension to their music.

Each new release has brought an expansion of her voice and her art, and she has reached the level of absolute mastery. Her new record Me and the Ghost of Charlemagne is brilliant.

I nominate it for song of the year, and predict that this song will bring legions of new fans to Amy\u2019s work. Folk music doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d - Mary Gauthier\n\nA modern folksinger whose music nods to the genre's 1970s glory days, Amy Speace has spent two decades chronicling the high marks, heartbreaks, and hard roads of a life logged on the road. She's been a tireless traveler, chasing the dream from the coffeehouses of New York City to larger stages across the globe. Along the way, she's built an international audience without the help of a major label, relying instead upon a touring schedule whose milestones include the Glastonbury Festival, NPR's Mountain Stage, and a yearly average of 150 shows.\n\nMe And The Ghost Of Charlemagne finds Speace focusing on the other side of that so-called dream. The real side, filled with an ever-shifting balance of struggle and joy. Produced by longtime collaborator Neilson Hubbard and recorded during the final weeks of Speace's pregnancy with her first son, Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne captures Amy Speace at her most nakedly honest, with sparsely-decorated songs that double down on her larger-than-life voice and detail-rich songwriting. It\u2019s an album about the colliding of dreams and reality, full of characters making sense of their lives when something is lost and then found. Really, it's an album about the trials and triumphs of an artist's journey \u2014 a journey that's no longer focused upon the destination, but upon the actual trip itself.\n\nDiscovered and mentored by folk-pop icon Judy Collins during the early 2000s, Speace left her career as a classically-trained Shakespearean actress and, instead, kicked off a string of acclaimed albums, including Songs for Bright Street, The Killer in Me, and How to Sleep in a Stormy Boat. Championed by The New York Times, NPR and other taste-making outlets for her solo work, she received further acclaim as a member of Applewood Road, a harmony-heavy trio whose self-titled album became a critical success in the UK, earning a five-star review from The London Sunday Times.\n\nYears before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Speace was one of the genre's earliest champions, mixing the best parts of American roots music \u2014 gospel, alt-country, folk, classic pop \u2014 into her own songs. Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne follows in that diverse tradition, but it also shines its light on a new Amy Speace: a clear-eyed, reenergized songwriter who's done with chasing things that don't matter\u2026but isn't anywhere close to being done with her art.", "otherInfo": "Log on from the comfort of your own home!

A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee. Bandmembers from both Umphrey's and Bisco have further more found each other in The Brain Damaged Eggmen, a Pink Floyd and The Beatles coverband\n\n\nDiscography\n\n* Encephalous Crime (self-released, 1996)\n* Uncivilized Area (1998)\n* Bisco Lives (2000)\n* They Missed the Perfume (2001)\n* Se\u00f1or Boombox (2002)\n* TranceFusion Radio Broadcast Vol. 1-4 (2003)\n* Wind at Four to Fly (2006)\n* Rocket 3 (2007)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jeff Freling Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10159563.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jazz guitarist for hire.

An acoustic re-imagining of the songs from the rock record, the tracks are presented in stark, stripped-down contrast to its predecessors.\n\n\u201cOnce Upon a Hell of a Time... is a Saturday night record,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThis version is for the hangover on Sunday.\u201d\n\nRe-contextualizing the songs offers a new window into the lyrics. What he once described as a \u201cparty-rock record for the brokenhearted\u201d transforms into a reflective and beautiful dive into false escapism, grief, love, and loss. \"The stripped-down record lends clarity and depth to his already nuanced lyrics, revealing a deep thinker who seeks honesty in his craft, and in life.\" - Beatroute\n\nThe recording came amidst a particularly busy time for Matt Mays. During a period when he headlined his first Massey Hall concert and supported sold out shows with The Gaslight Anthem all over North America, Matt teamed up with co-producer Eric Ratz to record at studios around Toronto between touring commitments.\n\nTwice Upon a Hell of a Time\u2026 was originally conceived as a straight-up solo interpretation, similar to the iTunes Session recorded with Ratz in 2011. As the songs took shape, however, Matt decided to incorporate extra vocals and instrumentation. Tapping musicians Aaron Goldstein (Daniel Romano, Lee Harvey Osmond) on pedal steel, Anthony Carone (Arkells) on piano, and guest singers Andrew Rodriguez, Kate Dyke, and Melissa Payne, the album\u2019s arrangements are lush and large without straying from the \u2018unplugged\u2019 vibe he sought from the outset.\n\nLead track \u201cOla Volo\u201d is inspired by a Vancouver-based mural artist of the same name who also created the original album art for both records. \u201cHer paintings and drawings all have a theme that I picked up on,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nature. To me, it\u2019s from another dimension, a very curious dimension that draws me in. Her pieces are very edgy and real-life at the same time. I had this feeling that I\u2019d like to be in one of her paintings, to live in that world that she\u2019s created.\u201d\n\nAfter departing seminal alt-country collective The Guthries back in 2002, Matt Mays alternated between solo projects (his self-titled debut, the unfinished film soundtrack \u2026When the Angels Make Contact) and band projects (the eponymous Matt Mays & El Torpedo record and 2008\u2019s Terminal Romance). Following the dissolution of Matt Mays & El Torpedo in 2009, Matt released Coyote in 2012 to much acclaim, including a JUNO Award win for Rock Album of the Year.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "8 Ball Aitken ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8734612.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Swamp Blues", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "For more than a decade, multi-awarded global troubadour, 8 Ball Aitken, has flown the Australian flag on the international circuit performing more than two hundred shows a year, and is thrilled to be back in the place where his heart is.\nImpossibly dedicated to his six-string muse and absolutely devoted to his audiences, 8 Ball Aitken\u2019s funky, foot stomping energy and infectious blend of swampy blues-rock, have brought the party vibe to venues, festivals and high profile music events in the USA, France, Japan, Canada and Europe.\nHe has garnered numerous accolades, awards, rave reviews and recognition across genres with the single, (She\u2019s Going To Mexico) I\u2019m Going To Jail, reaching #1 on the Country and #2 on the Blues charts.\nThe international patron for the Airlie Beach Festival of Music is a prolific singer/songwriter and ace multi-instrumentalist, and brings his 9th self-titled album on the road for the Blazing Blues Summer Tour.\nAll video clips including his USA release, Sleepy, the achingly beautiful Girl In A Million, Seven Bucks An Hour in A Chicken Suit, Yellow Moon and Shut The Front Door may be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/user/8ballaitken.\n\n\u201cOutstanding.

A conformed church housed a bar in the front full of rogue townies, and a lounge in the back.\n\"Turn your phones off,\" the host of the lounge barked into the microphone. \"Turn them off, sit back, and pay attention. This guy is quiet, and he's going to tell you some stories.\"\nAnd my eyebrows raised when his hoarse voice breathed life into a quiet, rapt crowd. With his eyes closed, he sang songs - chunks of him offered up to a willing mass.\n\"I'm not a singer,\" he said eventually, looking down at his guitar. I leaned in to listen harder. \"I'm not a guitarist. I'm a song writer.\"\nIn his songs were stories and in his stories were words pushed together that took my breath away, and in his stories were words that oozed the Blood from the Before, and in his stories were ripped edges.\nI wanted to know it all. I wanted to know the names of the chunks and I wanted to inspect the hole in his chest and I wanted to know where those melodies come from and I wanted to know how he chooses the words.\nI wanted to know what he has written on the scraps of paper in his wallet and I wanted to know if his handwriting changes when he knows it's a good one.\nIt was a listening lounge, and we were supposed to be quiet and listen, but he played a song we all knew. And we sang the words with him. We couldn't help it - not one single person.\nA crooked grin formed behind the microphone and I'm fairly certain that's why he does what he does. Not for the lights. Not for the cheers. For sure not for the money.\nHe does it for the people that hear the story and say, \"Yes. Me, too. I have been there, too.\"\nIn a town out in the middle of the cornfields of Iowa, a group of people sang the words back to him that he had written. A melody chunked out of one disaster from his life, and sewn together with a rhyme, and\nmaybe that's how you heal the hurt.\n...\nVulnerability. Standing up on a stage when you'd rather be holding a pen.\nSure looks an awful lot like courage.\n\n\n- Rebecca Cooper, Author", "otherInfo": "It's Josh Morningstar's 37th Birthday!

Longtime friend Mike Bishop Smith (drums) completes the trio. With a unique blend of genres, thoughtful lyrics and superb musicianship, the band has garnered and vast and diverse following. Releases include 8 singles, 3 EPs and 1 full length album.\n\nIn mid-2019, The Powell Brothers changed shape. The band of four and five pieces became a fierce three piece power trio. As a power trio, the group\u2019s sound evolved from roots influenced Country/Americana to alternative influenced Country/Rock. On July 1, 2020, The Powell Brothers released their new single entitled \u201cHow It\u2019s Done.\u201d \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d is emblematic of the band\u2019s new hard hitting Country/Rock sound. The track has major attitude. Hot out of the gate, the listener is hit with powerful electric guitar riffs backed by a driving drum beat and gritty bass tones.\n\nThe story of \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d is based on a conversation between a young aspiring artist and an old man at a bar. The old man reflects on his life as a hardworking, blue collar laborer and the young artist shares his dream about \u201cmaking it\u201d in the music business. The old man tells the young artist that life is tough and the road is bumpy and long, but if he is willing to work hard enough he can accomplish anything. The chorus of \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d sings:\n\nStoke the fire and keep on diggin\u2019\nmake the most of what you\u2019re given\nit may seem cold and it may seem tough\neven steel will bend when you heat it up\n\nYou\u2019re on the road to better days\nif you can outlast the sun and outlast the rain\nand a lot of hard lessons made\nLet me tell you son, soon you\u2019re gonna show us how it\u2019s done\n\nThis track will be on The Powell Brothers\u2019 next EP set to release in the Fall of 2020. The new EP can be described as a pulse pounding, addictive musical elixir blending elements of County and Rock in a unique way that is unmistakably The Powell Brothers.\n\nThe group tours nationally, performing an average of 160 tour dates across 22 states every year. The brothers have been featured at major festivals and events like the Oregon Jamboree (Sweet Home, Oregon), Sweet Pea Festival (Bozeman, MT), Oyster Ridge Music Festival (Kemmerer, WY), Memorial Day Music Festival (Dallas, TX), Ziegenbock Music Festival (Corpus Christi, TX) and Merchants & Music Festival (Fort Thomas, KY) to name a few.\n\nThe Powell Brothers\u2019 music really comes to life in their high energy live show. Top country acts including Jon Pardi, Josh Tuner, Billy Currington, Lee Brice, Cody Johnson, Gary Allan, Granger Smith, Big & Rich, Montgomery Gentry, Randy Rogers Band, Mark Chesnutt, Suzy Bogguss, The Bellamy Brothers, Pat Green and Jack Ingram have selected The Powell Brothers to bring that energy to their shows as direct support.\n\nTaylor and Blake Powell have many interests outside of music, including sports. The brothers found a way to combine their passions for music and sports by performing at some of the largest collegiate and professional sporting events in the country, including the following:\n\n2019 World Series (Washington Nationals vs. Houston Astros)\n2019 NFC Wildcard Playoff Game (Seattle Seahawks vs. Dallas Cowboys\n2018 National Finals Rodeo\n2018 American League Championship Series (Boston Red Sox vs. Houston Astros)\n2018 NHL Draft\n2017-2019 Mitsubishi Las Vegas Bowl\n2017 & 2018 Valero Alamo Bowl\n2017-2019 AT&T \u201cRed River Showdown\u201d (Texas Longhorns vs. Oklahoma Sooners)\n2018 Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl\n\nAdditionally, the brothers have sang \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d before Houston Astros, San Diego Padres, Milwaukee Brewers, Texas Rangers and FC Dallas games.\n\nWhen asked about The Powell Brothers\u2019 explosive growth and what the future holds, Taylor Powell explains \u201cIt all boils down to this; good songs and good people. We are committed to the craft of songwriting. Our goal is to make every song and every album better than the last, and to surround ourselves with the best people.\" Blake Powell echoes his brother\u2019s thoughts and adds \u201cOur goal is to deliver recorded music and live performances worthy of the love and support we are so blessed to receive.\"\n\nFor more information on The Powell Brothers, including a full list of tour dates, links to recorded music on iTunes and Spotify, live music videos and more, please visit the band's official website at www.PowellBrothersmusic.com", "otherInfo": "\"Saturday Night Wine Down\" is The Powell Brothers weekly Saturday night live music series where you and the band get together for a fun night of live music and socializing on the internet!

This seeker of the life-changing novel and the perfect pair of beat-to-hell boots; this connoisseur of the cool classic movie and the greasiest dive-bar cheeseburger, disciple of the museum\u2019s masterpiece and the panhandler\u2019s wiliest street-pitch? This guy who lives it, loves it, takes it all in and pours out something so tight and right you just gotta hear it again and again? Well, let\u2019s just tell it straight: Rick Brantley is a singer-songwriter who can seriously, seriously write and sing; a rocker who can really, truly rock. A young man worth listening to. Rick Brantley was born and raised in the musical mecca of Macon, Georgia, a preacher\u2019s son, soaking up the strains of gospel music, fire-and-brimstone sermons and the echoes of musical legends: Blind Willie McTell, Otis Redding, The Allman Brothers. \u201cMy Dad dug the local heroes, and was big on pop/rock hitmakers of the 70\u2019s, too, like Three Dog Night. We had a little home recording studio; music was such a part of everything\u201d, Rick says. He was also inspired by singer-songwriters like Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel. \u201cYou learn from those guys and they lead you to Kristofferson, Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt,\u201d he adds. Brantley learned his lessons well: barely out of high school, his own songs and red-hot band performances led to a publishing contract and new home base in Nashville. Since then, his songs have been covered by artists ranging from Meat Loaf to country crooner David Nail, while he\u2019s continued honing his stage chops as both full-tilt rock-show frontman and acoustic solo performer, opening for acts as diverse as John Hiatt, Zac Brown Band, Better Than Ezra, and Steve Earle. It\u2019s the rock side that takes the wheel for Brantley\u2019s newest EP, Hi-Fi. The six-track musical meal leans into the wind, pairing his rock howl with hope and harmonica. Beginning with \u201cFine So Fine,\u201d Hi-Fi emits a warm optimistic glow \u2013 maybe, together, we\u2019ll all be okay. It\u2019s a sentiment that\u2019s echoed throughout the record: \u201cLittle Bit More\u201d is a love call to arms, while \u201cHoles\u201d sheds sunshine on imperfections. There\u2019s something vaguely familiar about Hi-Fi, a warm orange gospel that evokes bench seats and warm steering wheels and settles snugly between nostalgia for the glory days and joy at the potential of tomorrow. Then there\u2019s \u201cHurt People.\u201d The song, which leads the EP as a single, digs deep into the gritty, sometimes uncomfortable place born of knowing someone well. It\u2019s a testament to Brantley\u2019s ever-present need to understand the world around him: he\u2019s an acute listener, and he\u2019ll tell you that getting to know people at the merch table is his favorite part of every show. In \u201cHurt People,\u201d that richness comes to life, honed in the stark depth of forgiveness by way of understanding. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone that, like [Hi-Fi producer and co-writer Mark Selby], is such a method actor,\u201d says Tia Sillers, the award-winning songwriter who co-wrote five of the six songs on Hi-Fi. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to write a song about a person, we have to go back to birth. We have to know this person\u2019s second aunt, we have to know what happened to them in fourth grade, and we have to deliberate these things.\u201d \u201cOf course all of that can\u2019t be in the song, because it\u2019s a short form\u201d Selby adds, \u201cbut the back story of these people are all there in their minds, they\u2019ve been worked out.\u201d Listening to Hi-Fi, you may just feel like a bit of your story was woven in too. So back to our original question: what to make of this talented Rick Brantley? If enough of us hear him, see him, watch him own another stage. . . well, we might just make him a household name.

Since the 1970s, Lovano has been one of the world's premiere tenor saxophone players, earning a Grammy award and several nods on Down Beat magazine's critics' and readers' polls.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Ohio, Lovano was exposed throughout his early life to jazz by his father, Tony \"Big T\" Lovano. John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, and Sonny Stitt were among his earlier influences. He developed further at Berklee College of Music, and then served a big band apprenticeship with Woody Herman's Thundering Herd and the Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra.\n\n\"Big T\" Lovano, a fine Cleveland tenorman, was his first inspiration. He taught Joe all the standards, how to lead a gig, how to pace a set, and to be versatile enough to always find work. Joe started on alto at age six and switched to tenor five years later. He attended Berklee before working with Jack McDuff and Dr. Lonnie Smith. After three years with Woody Herman's Orchestra, Lovano moved to New York and began playing regularly with Mel Lewis\u2019 Big Band. This influence is still present in his solos. He often plays lines that convey the rhythmic drive and punch of an entire horn section.\n\nOne of the top saxophonists of the 1990s, Joe Lovano continues to grow and explore as a musician. He has a husky tenor tone based in the tradition, but an approach to improvisation that is modern and daring. In the early \u201880s he began working in John Scofield\u2019s Quartet and a bass-less trio with Paul Motian and Bill Frisell. Steeped in the tradition of Ornette Coleman, Motian\u2019s recordings show off Lovano\u2019s avant-garde abilities. Scofield\u2019s Quartet straddled the line between \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d. These recordings feature some of Lovano\u2019s best work.\n\nLovano has enduring musical partnerships with John Scofield and Paul Motian, having participated in some of their most noteworthy projects over the years.\n\nHe is currently a jazz artist on the international level. His live work, specifically Quarterts at the Village Vanguard, garnered a Down Beat \"Jazz Album of the Year\" award.

I loved Sergio Mendes\u2019 songs, liked John Hartford on the Glenn Campbell Show and really got into James Taylor and Joni Mitchell who I still consider my two main influences. I also loved the singer-songwriters of the time including Carole King and Laura Nyro and later fell in love with Steely Dan\u2019s music, and just wore out my copy of Hubert Laws\u2019 Rite Of Spring. I was completely self-taught, by llistening to records and playing them over and over, teaching myself tablature from a great James Taylor book and modal tunings from Joni Mitchell\u2019s For The Roses song book. I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit. Other long term members include drummer Ray Levier and keyboardist Peter Vitalone, both of whom have been with KJ since\u201998 and \u201899. I am always interested in stretching myself and performing my music in different ways. The Lucky 7 recordings feature some wonderful pairings of great players that I don\u2019t always get to tour with but who have appeared in with me at The 55 and are wonderful friends too.\nKJ manages between 120-140 performances a year. New music, places to play and new festivals are what she\u2019s about these days \u201c\u2026 so we can keep on performing for new audiences.

Releases include 8 singles, 3 EPs and 1 full length album.\n\nIn mid-2019, The Powell Brothers changed shape. The band of four and five pieces became a fierce three piece power trio. As a power trio, the group\u2019s sound evolved from roots influenced Country/Americana to alternative influenced Country/Rock. On July 1, 2020, The Powell Brothers released their new single entitled \u201cHow It\u2019s Done.\u201d \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d is emblematic of the band\u2019s new hard hitting Country/Rock sound. The track has major attitude. Hot out of the gate, the listener is hit with powerful electric guitar riffs backed by a driving drum beat and gritty bass tones.\n\nThe story of \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d is based on a conversation between a young aspiring artist and an old man at a bar. The old man reflects on his life as a hardworking, blue collar laborer and the young artist shares his dream about \u201cmaking it\u201d in the music business. The old man tells the young artist that life is tough and the road is bumpy and long, but if he is willing to work hard enough he can accomplish anything.

The brothers have been featured at major festivals and events like the Oregon Jamboree (Sweet Home, Oregon), Sweet Pea Festival (Bozeman, MT), Oyster Ridge Music Festival (Kemmerer, WY), Memorial Day Music Festival (Dallas, TX), Ziegenbock Music Festival (Corpus Christi, TX) and Merchants & Music Festival (Fort Thomas, KY) to name a few.\n\nThe Powell Brothers\u2019 music really comes to life in their high energy live show.

Sam is known for his unusual and distinctive voice. Career Llanas was one of the founding members of the roots rock band the BoDeans, which he formed with high school friend Kurt Neumann in Waukesha, Wisconsin. In 1985, after adding Guy Hoffman (drums) in 1984 and Bob Griffin (bass), the quartet signed a contract with Slash/Warner Records and shortened their name to the BoDeans. Under the guidance of producer T-Bone Burnett, they entered Hollywood's Sunset Sound Factory in October to record their first album. The critically acclaimed debut Love & Hope & Sex & Dreams was released in 1986. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the band had several singles in the top 40 \"mainstream rock\" charts. In the mid-1990s, the band had two top 10 songs in the \"Adult contemporary\" charts. The BoDeans took some time off in the late 1990s so Neumann and Llanas could record solo albums. Llanas founded Absinthe, with the help of Milwaukee musicians Jim Eannelli (guitars and bass) and Guy Hoffman (formerly of Oil Tasters and Violent Femmes).

It's the same kind of self-assurance the soft-spoken Rodgers displays on his second independently released EP, available January 19th. Produced by Mickey Jack Cones (Dustin Lynch, Joe Nichols) and Chris Farren, the five-song collection showcases him as both a talented writer and interpreter, merging the electrified rock he heard on the baseball diamond with the thoughtful lyricism of country. Well before he was singing for his supper, the Batesville, Mississippi native was an accomplished baseball player who was a scholarship athlete at Northwest Mississippi Community College. Raised in the midst of country's '90s commercial heyday \u2013 his first concert was Garth Brooks at the Pyramid in Memphis \u2013 Rodgers always had an inkling that he might end up living in Music City, he just didn't know how or when. \"I can remember in high school I would tell people \u2013 this was before I played guitar or anything \u2013 I would just be like, 'Yeah, I'm gonna move to Nashville one day,'\" he recalls. And so he did, departing Mississippi with one of his college buddies to see if he could make it in Music City. Through the countless open mic nights and lean years that inevitably followed, Rodgers was able to develop the songwriting voice that would eventually earn his first publishing deal with Combustion Music. \"I went into songwriting boot camp,\" he says. \"That's all I did. I hardly played any shows or anything. I just focused on writing.\" In the meantime, Rodgers scored his first cut on Florida Georgia Line's Dig Your Roots, with \"Wish You Were on It.\" He also released his self-titled EP, featuring the streaming hit \"Midnight Daydream.\" All that intense focus shows on his second self titled EP. Opening track \"Ain't Really Over\" depicts a man in the hangover stage of a rough breakup and trying to move on. Framed by surging, distorted electric guitars and Rodgers' bluesy howl, it sets the tone for his melody-rich, introspective style of songwriting. On \"Cold Case,\" Rodgers draws a line between himself and country's long tradition of clever wordplay. Bouncing off the title's suggestion of criminal investigations, he's popping tops and pining over a woman who's up and vanished from his life. His solution? Downing as many beers as he can handle. \"'Cold Case' was just one of those things \u2013 somebody started playing a guitar and one of us just spit it out,\" says Rodgers. \"It kind of fell out of thin air.\" Rodgers' clear sense of his artistic identity also shines through on the outside songs \"Like You've Been There Before\" and \"Some Girls.\" It's easy to envision Rodgers singing about a younger version of himself in \"Like You've Been There Before,\" a rebellious kid getting some sage advice from his father to play it cool whether he's knocking a fastball over the fences or cautiously taking his first trip around the bases with a young woman. He sings it with the easy confidence of a seasoned vet, or as he says in the chorus, \"like it ain't no thing.\" \"Some Girls,\" on the other hand, calls back to \"Ain't Really Over\" except this time he's ended things and she's not handling it well \u2013 talking behind his back and playing childish games on social media. \"Some girls make it easy on you,\" he sighs, \"and some girls never do.\" The female woes reach their apex in the Rodgers co-write \"Missing One,\" which flips the title phrase on its head. Initially it's a missing copy of the Eagles' Desperado that she took when she left, then a single smoke from a pack of cigarettes that she forced him to give up. But it turns out he's actually missing something else most of all. Rodgers wrote the tune with pals Smith Ahnquist and Hunter Phelps, taking months to get it right. \"We started it in January and we didn't finish it until May,\" he says. \"We knew it was gonna be a clever idea, but we had to get it right. It was a hard one, but a fun one.\" That dedication, coupled with Rodgers' finely-tuned ear for songs, makes him perfectly suited to lean forward into Nashville's ever-shifting winds while honoring his roots. \"I want to be known as the dude with good songs,\" he says. \"If a song gives you chill bumps or if it makes you cry or if it makes you happy, it's done its job.\" That may sound like a relatively humble mission for a performer with such promise, but hey, sometimes you just know.", "otherInfo": "Saturday Nights Live"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sammy Rae Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8845198.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "New York, New York", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "www.sammyrae.com", "otherInfo": "Join Sammy for some songs / a chance to go live with Sammy so she can interview YOU!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Wind and The Wave ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9810343.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Americana, Rock, Alternative, Folk, Country, Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "In 2014, The Wind and The Wave quietly released one of the best albums of the year. From The Wreckage glowed with a rootsy golden tone that encompassed everything from indie-folk, to alt-country to blues-rock to Southern psychedelia. Its creators, touring musician turned songwriter and producer Dwight Baker and singer-songwriter Patty Lynn, began making music together on a lark, never dreaming anything would come of it. Baker describes it as \u201ckind of like what happens when two friends hold hands and jump in a freezing lake just to see what it feels like.\u201d Thanks to the undeniable chemistry between the pair, the music took on a life of its own and The Wind and The Wave soon found themselves with a major-label record deal, embarking on U.S. headlining tours, having their songs appear in such TV shows as Grey\u2019s Anatomy, and racking up millions of plays on Spotify and Apple Music. The band also earned itself a rabid following, with fans especially enamored of Lynn\u2019s feisty vocals and brutally personal lyrics about challenging relationships with lovers and family members as well as her relationship with herself. \u201cPeople really treasure that album,\u201d Baker says. \u201cWe got tons of letters from people saying it saved their life. They\u2019re people who are conflicted and searching and they connect with Patty\u2019s lyrics more than anything.\u201d\n\nWhen it came time for The Wind and The Wave to make their second album, Baker says he and Lynn felt \u201csome bit of an obligation to deliver that again.\u201d The band definitely delivered on their sophomore album, Happiness Is Not A Place, and the result is the sound of a band that has stretched itself and grown. Lynn managed to dig a little deeper with her lyrics, exploring her difficult feelings on commitment, and family, while acknowledging her own frantic mind. And the band\u2019s sonic palette is nervier, thanks to the album being recorded live by producer Butch Walker. \u201cTo me, it sounds reckless with a rock and roll spirit and attitude, an \u2018I don\u2019t give a fuckedness,\u2019 if you will. I wanted it to make sense to our fans, but to feel like a step forward musically. And I think we accomplished that. It\u2019s really rough around the edges, and there\u2019s a lot of urgency and pent-up stuff that probably came from both Patty and my nervousness about making a record with an outside producer.\u201d\n\nAfter being dropped by two major labels, all expectations and second guesses went flying out the window. The band\u2019s third full length album, Human Beings Let You Down, was a record made in hotels and backstage dressing rooms across the US. \u201cGetting married was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d says Lynn, \u201cBut it also brought out a lot, good and bad, and therapy helped me work through it. That\u2019s what the song Neon Prayer Flags is all about.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotta tough to be Patty, or anyone in her life, because if something\u2019s amiss, she\u2019s going to write about it.

Since the 1970s, Lovano has been one of the world's premiere tenor saxophone players, earning a Grammy award and several nods on Down Beat magazine's critics' and readers' polls.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Ohio, Lovano was exposed throughout his early life to jazz by his father, Tony \"Big T\" Lovano. John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, and Sonny Stitt were among his earlier influences. He developed further at Berklee College of Music, and then served a big band apprenticeship with Woody Herman's Thundering Herd and the Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra.\n\n\"Big T\" Lovano, a fine Cleveland tenorman, was his first inspiration. He taught Joe all the standards, how to lead a gig, how to pace a set, and to be versatile enough to always find work. Joe started on alto at age six and switched to tenor five years later. He attended Berklee before working with Jack McDuff and Dr. Lonnie Smith. After three years with Woody Herman's Orchestra, Lovano moved to New York and began playing regularly with Mel Lewis\u2019 Big Band. This influence is still present in his solos. He often plays lines that convey the rhythmic drive and punch of an entire horn section.\n\nOne of the top saxophonists of the 1990s, Joe Lovano continues to grow and explore as a musician. He has a husky tenor tone based in the tradition, but an approach to improvisation that is modern and daring. In the early \u201880s he began working in John Scofield\u2019s Quartet and a bass-less trio with Paul Motian and Bill Frisell. Steeped in the tradition of Ornette Coleman, Motian\u2019s recordings show off Lovano\u2019s avant-garde abilities. Scofield\u2019s Quartet straddled the line between \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d. These recordings feature some of Lovano\u2019s best work.\n\nLovano has enduring musical partnerships with John Scofield and Paul Motian, having participated in some of their most noteworthy projects over the years.\n\nHe is currently a jazz artist on the international level. His live work, specifically Quarterts at the Village Vanguard, garnered a Down Beat \"Jazz Album of the Year\" award. Other releases include Trio Fascination and 52nd Street Themes.", "otherInfo": "Joe Lovano and Judi Silvano: At This Moment of Now - Expressions in Music and Art,\nJoe Lovano - woodwinds, gongs and percussion,\nJudi Silvano - voice, percussion and painting in real time"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Zach Matari ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9071729.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "R&b Soul", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Humble, kind, courteous and authentic are just a few of the words you will hear fans use to describe Zach Matari!\n\nZach Matari, the \u201cNew\u201d Jersey Boy, Pop/R&B singer/songwriter sensation & musician born and raised in North Jersey with musical talent that is far beyond his years.

It's a point that \"When I'm Gone\" drives home, as Morgan sings about living life with no regrets.\n\n\"I\u2019ve got a renewed energy with this record,\" he says emphatically. \"In fact, I'm at the pinnacle of my career \u2014 producing, singing and touring. And this song epitomizes that. It's about living to the fullest, and when people hear it, I know they'll relate it to their own lives.\"\n\nHis newest single, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home Soon,\u201d is an epic love song and one of many radio-ready hits on Morgan's highly anticipated project. He's written nearly half of the album's dozen tracks, and makes all of them his own. \"I'm That Country\" exudes Southern charm; \"Remind Me Why I'm Crazy\" showcases Morgan the crooner; \"I Can't Wait to Stay\" exults the joys of a small-town life; and \"A Whole Lot More to Me\" is a musical autobiography. The collection\u2019s \u201cWhen I\u2019m Gone,\u201d has already met critical acclaim with Music Row calling it a \u201cpowerhouse performance of a pile-driving song.\u201d Each highlights his artistic renaissance.\n\nMorgan laughs at that word, however: \"artistic.\"\n\n\"I have friends who are very artistic people, sometimes oddly so, and I never wanted to be that guy, to be so artistic that I'm odd,\" he says smiling. \"But it's good to know that I've evolved musically and, with this new record, I've created something with longevity.\"\n\nIndeed, Morgan's A Whole Lot More To Me, co-produced with Byron Gallimore (Tim McGraw, Sugarland, Faith Hill) and released via Black River Entertainment, is a timeless recording. As was their goal, Morgan and Gallimore, with whom he worked for the first time, succeeded in making music that will sound fresh a decade or more from now. These are songs that define a man.\n\nMorgan uses the honesty of the concert stage as an analogy for how he assembled what will be his seventh studio album. \"It would look funny if you went to one of my concerts and I stood out there in skinny jeans. I'm not 21 years old, and I shouldn't pretend to be,\" he says. \"But I also know this music will fit right in on country radio today. I'm singing music that is real and believable and at the same time relatable to all types of fans. That's hard to do, but you can do it if you stay true to who you are.\"\n\nAnd Craig Morgan knows exactly who he is, a man with many sides. Along with being an entertainer, he's an adventure junkie and hosts the popular Outdoor Channel series Craig Morgan: All Access Outdoors, entering its seventh season this summer. He's also a 17-year Army and Army Reserves veteran, a passionate champion of the military, a philanthropist and a celebrated motivational speaker.\n\nHe\u2019s a busy man with a knack for attention to detail. Carefully choosing each lyric on this album is no exception. There is not a single wasted verse \u2014 let alone word \u2014 on the follow-up to 2012's This Ole Boy. \"Every word is valid and relevant on this album,\" he says. \"It's a quality continuation of what I've done in the past.\"\n\nThe most obvious bridge to Morgan's back catalog is the spiritually minded \"Country Side of Heaven.\" The song is inspirational country at its finest, with a soaring chorus that at once elevates both listener and artist.\n\n\"It has a very charismatic, inspirational vibe about it \u2014 but not preachy,\" Morgan says. \"The energy feels spiritual by the time you get to the end and there is an emotional attachment within you that makes you want to hear it again and again.\"\n\nMorgan says the song, as well as album tracks like the emotionally charged \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home Soon\u201d and the empowered-woman tale \"All Cried Out,\" act as a through-line, a path for fans to connect the dots of his career: \"You develop a fan base and they get acquainted with a certain thing from you, and they want that. This album is full of those.\"\n\nAnother standout on the project is \u201cHearts I Leave Behind,\u201d which features Morgan\u2019s gritty and poignant vocals with the soulful Christian rock band Third Day\u2019s lead singer, Mac Powell.\n\nThe hard-touring artist has already been testing out the songs on the road, to stellar results. \"When I'm Gone\" becomes a call to action; \"Country Side of Heaven\" is an audience sing-along; and \"Nowhere Without You,\" written by Michael McDonald, stands as an epic power ballad.\n\n\"It's such an emotional song, one that I can see being played at weddings for a long time,\" he says. \"I feel something in my chest when I hear it. It moves me \u2014 and that's what music is supposed to do.\"\n\nEspecially in the hands of an artist as gifted as Morgan, who can effortlessly toggle between the breezy fun of radio staple \"Redneck Yacht Club\" and the poignancy of \"That's What I Love About Sunday.\" He mixes both approaches in the album's standout track, \"A Whole Lot More to Me.\" A smoldering, jazz-influenced love song with an everyman attitude, it shines a light on a different side of the artist, and country fans in general \u2014 one that likes a fine Cabernet as much as a cold beer, and indulges in sushi by candlelight as regularly as barbecue by the bonfire.\n\n\"As a country singer, we sometimes get stereotyped as nothing but trucks and tailgates, but that doesn't mean that's all there is to us,\" he says, summing up the album. \"I want people to hear this record and go, 'Wow, there is a whole lot more to these country folks.'\"\n\nAnd in Morgan, those folks have no better messenger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mikaela Davis ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9062580.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Rock & Roll Is Here To Stay", "Time": "12:40 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cThis record is kind of about writing a record,\u201d Mikaela Davis says. The 26-year-old is home in her native Rochester, New York, reflecting on Delivery, her highly anticipated full-length album, as well as the hard journey the classically trained, defiantly original harpist had to travel to become the writer AND performer, she was meant to be.\n\n\u201cA lot of these songs came from feeling stuck and also like people were pulling me in a bunch of different directions,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cI wanted to say, \u2018Just wait for me. I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\nMikaela\u2019s plea for patience\u2013\u2013a little bit sweet, a little bit angry and raw\u2013\u2013fed a fierce 10-song collection. A joyride that pulls from rock, 70s and 80s pop, and funk, Delivery manages to be both daring and comfortable, full of not just risks, but hooks.\n\nProduced by Grammy winner John Congleton (St. Vincent, Angel Olsen, David Byrne, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah), Delivery is a triumphant next chapter. \u201cJohn tries to find that moment instead of the perfect take,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cThat made it all sound really special.\u201d Childhood friend Alex Cot\u00e9 (drums, percussion) and Shane McCarthy (bass) play on the record - already close from years of touring. Recently, Mikaela\u2019s ensemble became a family affair with the addition of Shane\u2019s older brother Cian McCarthy on guitar.\n\nMikaela\u2019s unconventional path to working songwriter began before high school, growing up in Rochester. With plans to join a symphony, she studied harp performance at Crane School of Music, but halfway through, she decided the traditional harpist\u2019s path wasn\u2019t for her. Following graduation, Mikaela moved to Brooklyn, following in the footsteps of artists who\u2019ve come before her. But in the city, she could never quite find her footing. She kept busy, toured, and recorded an album that would eventually be shelved. Feeling confused and alone, she retreated back to Rochester, unsure of her next move.\n\nThen, the last place Mikaela wanted to be saved her. Rochester\u2019s artistic community embraced her, encouraged by bandmates including Alex Cot\u00e9 and the group Joywave, she hit her stride. Rochester became Mikaela\u2019s sanctuary.\n\nDelivery benefits from it all. \u201cNow, these songs kind of wonder what I should be doing\u2013\u2013it\u2019s me trying to get myself back to why I started writing in the first place,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cWriting made me feel better and safe when the world around me was falling apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust let my songs resonate with you somehow.

Hook, line, and sinker. Landon and Dan had no choice but to spend the rest of their pre-pubescent years crouched on the basement steps, not wearing earplugs. It didn\u2019t matter if the music was good or bad or too loud to tell. J. Mascis and D. Boon and Paul Westerberg were alive in that basement, cranked through budget amplifiers and out of tune.\n\nFast forward three decades and Landon and Dan are still making music together. Little Brazil is their most accomplished and longest running project - fifteen years. Over that time the band has built an impressive resume. They\u2019ve released four full lengths and done the national tours, both headlining and as support.\n\nThose credentials don\u2019t matter now though. What\u2019s important is the new record, Send the Wolves. It is the product of thirty years spent on basement steps, idolizing guitars; a reflection of what life is like when the initial thrill never goes away. When it\u2019s carried through adulthood. Through having children and marriage and bartending into bartending into bartending. That persistence of spirit lends a sincerity to Send the Wolves. It captures the feeling of going paycheck to paycheck, scrounging tips for the early tours, leaving with nothing and coming back with less. Those tours when the van breaks down on the side of the highway but it doesn\u2019t matter because you\u2019re out there doing it. Send the Wolves captures the triumphs, too. The packed shows. The reviews, features, interviews. The things that prove you\u2019re playing to something other than corn and soy and prairie. Throughout all the ups and downs, Landon and Dan have remained the same wide-eyed kids on the basement steps, just wishing they were big enough to pick up the instruments.\n\nSend the Wolves has been nine years in the making, with several members coming and going. The result is cohesive yet nuanced. There is a singular sound that is unique to Little Brazil, but Omaha\u2019s fingerprints are all over the album, with a handful of the city\u2019s finest adding guest contributions to the final cut. Those who helped shape Little Brazil over the years come from different musical backgrounds, age, and experience but they all have one thing in common: at a certain point when they were too young to know any better, they all fell in love with loud guitars in shitty basements. If you at all know the experience, Send the Wolves will punch you in the gut. And it\u2019s not a sucker punch. It\u2019s a good sincere uppercut, straight from the basement.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gina Gonzalez ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9316221.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Country, Alternative, Pop Rock, Rock, Indie", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Gina Gonzalez (guitar, vocals) has acquired quite a musical resume.

While they have been present and active for many years, a giant turning point for Downfall 2012 was teaming up with producer, engineer and videographer Jim Finley, who assisted in the creation and development of the music and video to \u201cEveryman for Himself\u201d a record initially broken into pieces and released as EPs in 2012-2014 (and is in the process of being compiled along with the remaining unreleased material to create one cohesive full length record/story to be released in Feb 2017). The team has also invited Houston graphic artist A.Tomic to compliment their music with a conceptual visual and comic books which accompany each release. The singles \u201cDivinity\u201d, \u201cHeckler\u201d, and \u201cFace to face\u201d are in rotation on a number of FM and Internet radio stations, and have corresponding conceptual music videos. Downfall 2012 recently released two additional singles \"Collide a scope\" and their signature cover of Johnny Cash's \"Folsom Prison Blues\" which have been added to several FM and internet radio stations as well. Downfall 2012 opened 2015 by jumping on the \u201cArt Saves\u201d West Coast tour headlined by OTEP. They joined OTEP again in the summer (June-July) on the \"Art of Fury Tour\". In 2016 Downfall 2012 joined AVATAR on \"The Feathers & Flesh Tour\" (US dates). The band has also shared the stage with: Limp Bizkit, Hollywood Undead, Ice Cube, The Offspring, Hed pe, Powerman 5000, Filter, Nothing More, Twisted Sister, Alice Cooper, ICP, and many more. Houston\u2019s leading rock station 94.5 the Buzz has awarded the band multiple \u201cTexas Buzz Awards\u201d in the span of recent years including \u201cBand of the year\u201d, \u201cBest live performance\u201d, \u201cBest Bass\u201d and Best Drummer.

During this time, he has also managed to release 4 artist albums and some of the most iconic house music tracks of the last two decades.\n\nMost people know Claude VonStroke for his smiling DJ persona touring every major city, festival, and basement after-party around the world. But Claude has also influenced the very fabric of the dance community, A&Ring an impeccable roster of acts like Justin Martin, Fisher, Shiba San, Catz n Dogz, Riva Starr, Tim Green, Breach, Eats Everything, Walker & Royce, Shadow Child, and countless others. (And even naming a few of these artists.) Today, his Dirtybird label continues to surprise and innovate in the underground dance scene, releasing an enigmatic combination of house, funk, dirty bass, and electronica.\n\nVonStroke has released four original artist albums, a remix album, and a live album recorded when he closed the famed Movement Festival in his original hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Some other music highlights include working on records with Bootsy Collins, Rihanna, Disclosure and Kevin Saunderson, as well as a few #1 and #2 hits on Beatport. His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world. He continues to innovate and curate new events with a 2 additional multi-day festival mirroring his Birdhouse radio show in Chicago, and his record BBQ event series that has been going since 2003!\n\nVonStroke also loves art; most notably pop-surrealist artwork that he has commissioned for the last 7 years on Dirtybird for all of the releases. Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude.

Ever since the central-Illinois songwriter released his lauded 2018 debut LP, Smokin\u2019 Drinkin\u2019 & Gamblin\u2019, he\u2019s been on tour almost constantly, playing upwards of 150 shows per year, including opening slots and festival support for top country and Americana artists from Tyler Childers and Paul Cauthen to Jamey Johnson and Cody Jinks, as well as a lengthy run with hard-rocker-turned-country-star Aaron Lewis.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of the road in this record,\u201d says Gerdes, who travels with his band and his wife Janel in the van. \u201cI love moving\u2014that part of traveling where you\u2019re actually rolling down the highway. It\u2019s when we feel most at home. Things are just different\u2014your sleep patterns and your mindset change. But the thing I love the most about being on the road is meeting different forms and facets of people\u2014talking to them and hearing their stories about where they come from and what they do. I find that intriguing. So there\u2019s a lot of that in this record, too. The title track and the album, when you boil \u2018em down\u2014that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. We wanted to speak to the people.\u201d\n\nFor Tough As Nails, Gerdes and his road band\u2014lead guitarist Jake Baxter, bassist Britton Wood and drummer Randy Noy\u2014hit St. Louis\u2019 Native Sound Studio revved up and ready to go, with producer/engineer David Beeman at the helm. Beeman had also worked with Gerdes on 2019 single \u201cTailgate n\u2019 Tallboys,\u201d a theme song commissioned by the festival of the same name, a six-day, 30+ band country concert, held annually in Peoria, Ill. \u201cTough as Nails was the first time that I was able to be like, \u2018Alright, boys, we\u2019re pulling off the highway and going into the studio for a week,\u2019\u201d Gerdes says. \u201cCapturing the energy of our live performances was crucial to me. So we just went in fresh off the road and banged out the meat and potatoes of it in three days.\u201d\n\nThe resulting LP\u2014spruced up by Robby \"Man of Steel\" Turner on steel guitar\u2014reeks of spilled Jack Daniels, truckstops, pool halls and tobacco-stained green rooms. Its second track, a hi-octane, four-on-the-floor cover of Roger Alan Wade\u2019s \u201cIf Guitars Were Guns,\u201d acts as a manifesto for Tough As Nails, a record that packs more grit and wallop than most of its country contemporaries: \u201cI play country music in my little cabin home in the hood, I play rock & roll because it makes me feel good / I play them ol\u2019 blues to take a load off my mind, I play what I please, out of tune and out of time.\u201d\n\nAs with any artist worth his salt, Gerdes\u2019 sound has been evolving since the last record. Smokin\u2019 Drinkin\u2019 and Gamblin\u2019\u2014anchored by Nashville pedal-steel icon Jim Vest\u2014was deeply indebted to the \u201970s country on which Gerdes was raised. But with Tough as Nails, he and his band just \u201clet it all go.\u201d \u201cWe approached it like we would a live performance,\u201d Gerdes says. \u201cI didn\u2019t put no reins on it or nothing like that. I just let it evolve into what it became. It\u2019s a mixture of all my different influences. With country music, the way I see it, it\u2019s a melting pot: rock & roll, Southern rock, rockabilly, the blues\u2014it all goes in there.\u201d\n\nThe new album\u2019s rock & roll leanings make sense when you consider the influences of the lineup that has solidified as Gerdes\u2019 backing band. Baxter, now in his 20s, has been playing guitar with Gerdes since he was a 16-year-old worshipping at the altar of Jimmy Page, Keith Richards and Duane Allman. And it\u2019s a similar story with drummer Randy Noy. \u201cOttawa, Ill., the part of the state Randy\u2019s from, is pretty blue collar, pretty rock & roll,\u201d Gerdes says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really know much about country music when he joined the band. His biggest influence is John Bonham, which is cool because I always wanted that kick, that drive to my sound. When we started playing together, I was like, \u2018Don\u2019t hold back just because you think we\u2019re playing country. Play them drums like they owe you money, brother.\u2019 We were able to capture that kind of energy on the new record.\u201d\n\nSit with him for five minutes and you\u2019ll know that Gerdes is a natural-born storyteller. Really, Tough as Nails is a documentary in album form. It deals with real people, real places and real struggles, collected along the Interstate as Gerdes and his band play an endless parade of one-night stands. The record is about family, community, honesty, tragedy, travel, the fleeting nature of existence, even silent visitations from the ghosts of our loved ones. Above all, though, Tough as Nails confronts the elusiveness of the American Dream in the 21st century, giving voice to the plight of the working poor, brought to life by an ex-steel worker from Pennsylvania, an out-of-work coal miner from Alabama, a suicidal veteran wrestling with PTSD in rural Ohio, and a teenage girl from god knows where trying to shake herself free from the grip of heroin. Track after track, it\u2019s a testament to fighting for your ideals, taking your blows and doing your damnedest to press on in the face of adversity.\n\n\u201cAll the stories in these songs are true,\u201d Gerdes says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the people. I wanted the album to speak directly to them, to things they\u2019ve gone through. In my mindset, country music has got to be real.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, with this same spirit of authenticity and connection in mind, Gerdes launched a weekly, hour-long Facebook live series called The Gatherin\u2019. \u201cJanel had the idea that we could reach people who couldn\u2019t make it to my shows,\u201d he says. \u201cWe do it every Tuesday night\u2014either from the road, or at home in my garage, interacting with people as we go. I play songs, they make requests, but most importantly, there\u2019s a back and forth. We talk about what\u2019s going on in their lives. And we try to help in any way we can.\u201d\n\nGerdes refers to the people who tune in regularly not as fans, but kinfolk. Many of them have started to identify as \u201cThe Gatherin\u2019 Family.\u201d Through this community, lasting friendships have been made, with Gerdes and Janel, the band members, and with each other. \u201cLife can be tough and we all need each other,\u201d Gerdes says. \u201cMusic is a great vehicle for that. If that\u2019s a way we can bring people together, that\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do\u2014make a difference in their lives through the music, and bring them together around a common passion.

Although he is a versatile musician, having dabbled in a mesh of genres including folk, rock, and jazz, he considers himself a blues player at heart. Quinn started his musical journey in Delaware, where he was born and raised in a very musical family.\n\nQuinn\u2019s first instrument was trumpet, then the piano, and finally he became hooked on the common twang of the guitar at age 15. He continued his musical career all throughout high school, later moving to California to earn a degree in music. It was at this time that he became serious about songwriting, and began to hone his talent. This hard work and determination lead to the creation of his all-original, self-titled, debut album: \u201cQuinn Hedges\u201d (Circa 2006).

Thus \u201cThe Quinn Hedges Band\u201d, came to be in 2009. The band release \u201cStep Outside\u201d in 2012, and eventually split in 2013.\n\nFrom 2013 through 2016, Quinn teamed up with his cousin, John B Hedges, and released his finest album to date, \"Slightly South of Stormy Clouds\" (Mixed by Grammy Award Winner Tim Sonnefeld & Mastered by the legendary Bob Ludwig).\n\nQuinn currently performs in the dynamic Sacramento-based rock band, \"The Outcome\", who recently released an EP titled, \u201cI\u2019ll Take It\u201d.\n\nSince 2003, Quinn has been playing in restaurants, dive bars, wine bars, wineries, clubs, theaters, weddings, private events, opened for numerous national touring acts, and even performed the national anthem at a Sacramento Kings vs. Los Angeles Lakers game.\n\nA renowned artist who is known for the truth and wisdom behind his lyrics, Quinn creates soulful and relatable music, which touches a wide array of audiences.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Noah's Ark Was A Spaceship ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Rock, Alternative", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Noah's Ark Was A Spaceship and Little Brazil will stream live sets from the Main Room at Slowdown on May 23."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rodg ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9005063.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Trance And More, Trance, Progressive Electronic, Dance -, Trance & Progressive, Electronic", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "In a world jam-packed with one-hit wonders, extremely consistent producers of dance music have always been sought-after.

Since, he has put out a slew of genre-defying cuts, changing the game entirely through massive collaborations and solid remixes for artists such as Paul Oakenfold, Armin van Buuren, Solid Stone, Cosmic Gate and Ruben de Ronde.\n\nThanks to extensive support from a gamut of top-tier performers (e.g. Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Above & Beyond, Markus Schulz, Gareth Emery, Nicky Romero, W&W, Andrew Rayel and even Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and David Guetta), Rodg has been getting the recognition he deserves, even touted \u201cOne of the best producers of 2016\u201d by Armin van Buuren.

After countless collaborations with long-time friend and production partner Ruben de Ronde, on came a collaborative effort that dropped jaws and pushed their sound to an even higher level. With their joint album called \u2018Togetherr\u2019, Rodg and Ruben de Ronde emerged with a body of work that serves as a testament to their consistent high-quality output and became Mixmag\u2019s \u201calbum of the month\u201d with a 9 out of 10 rating.\n\nOn the live front, the Rodg sound has become inseparable from Armin van Buuren\u2019s live sets and the Dutchman himself has since brandished his own sonic blend at A State Of Trance shows in Utrecht, Ibiza, and Mexico, Armada Nights, and various other unforgettable shows at H\u00ef Ibiza, Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival and more.

Seamlessly blending folk, rock, and blues, the 19-year-old songstress draws listeners in with a charismatic yet vulnerable stage presence - not to mention an undeniable energy! Born and raised in small town Fergus, Ontario, she infuses her music with rustic, earthy tones, reaching back to pay homage to the genre\u2019s greats while crafting a sound and identity all of her own. Imagine Janis Joplin jamming with Neil Young while Joni Mitchell looks on proudly!\n\nMadison began pursuing her passion for music from a young age. Growing up in rural Ontario, she discovered a love of nature, community, and roots music, which continues to inspire her art today. At age 6, she began classical piano training, eventually advancing through conservatory programs and voraciously delving into the world of music theory and appreciation. However, it wasn\u2019t until she picked up a guitar at age 12 that she discovered her true calling and began pouring out original songs. Drawing inspiration from her upbringing, current issues, and environmental concerns, she started to shape her signature sound and identity as an artist.\n\nSince, Madison has released a 5-song EP entitled \"Who Knows Where\" and has built a reputation as a road warrior, touring relentlessly as a solo performer, duo, or with her band, The Mud Guppies. She has played hundreds of shows, including notable performances at the Mariposa Folk Festival, Riverfest Elora, Toronto Redpath Waterfront Festival, and Ottawa\u2019s Bluesfest while opening for renowned artists such as 54-40, Ron Hawkins (Lowest of the Low), The Sadies, and Alysha Brilla, making a name for herself as a must-see act!.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "David Ramirez ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10390310.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Folk, Indie-americana", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "We\u2019re Not Going Anywhere: At a historical moment of immense political, social, and ecological uncertainty, those four simple words comprise both a promise and a protest, a comforting reassurance of inclusion as well as a hearty cry of defiance. It\u2019s a statement that offers no small sense of hope, in that sense matching the music contained on the album. On these vividly imagined and passionately performed songs David Ramirez takes in the world from his unique perspective: \u201cBeing half white and half Mexican has made this current political climate especially interesting. So many cultures in this country are being viewed as un-American and it breaks my heart. My family have raised children here, created successful businesses here, and are proud to be a part of this country. Most of what I've seen as of late is misplaced fear. I wanted to write about that fear and how, instead of benefiting us, it sends us spiraling out control.\u201d The album that bears that title marks a departure for Ramirez, who builds on the rootsy sound of his early albums to create something new, something bold, something anchored in the here and now. Scouting out unexplored music territory, these songs bounce around energetically, toying with new ideas and experimenting with new sounds, as barbed-wire guitars and retro-futuristic synths grind against his anguished vocals and evocative lyrics. \u201cWe flipped script a little bit and went in with a pretty specific vision: lots of keyboards and some out-of-the-box guitar sounds. I took a lot of notes from the indie bands I\u2019ve been listening to and from the bands I loved growing up in the \u201880s, like the Cars and Journey. Let\u2019s just live in this spacy world for a while and see what comes out of it.\u201d What came out of it isn\u2019t just Ramirez\u2019s most adventurous album to date, but a record that captures the mood of the country in its music as well as in its lyrics. While he does tackle some new subjects, Ramirez grounds these songs in his own perspective, which means every song remains both human and humane, outraged and generous. There are some break-up songs on here, sober and self-castigating: first single \u201cWatching from a Distance\u201d thrums with iridescent synths and a tight backbeat that sounds like lines on the highway measuring the widening rift between lovers. \u201cPeople Call Who They Wanna Talk To\u201d is Ramirez at his catchiest, marrying a playful earworm hook to a somber realization about romantic irreconcilability: \u201cDon\u2019t blame it on the distance, don\u2019t blame it on the booze\u2026 people call who they wanna talk to.\u201d A simple line, but completely devastating. \u201cThis is the first album I\u2019ve had properly produced,\u201d says Ramirez, who either produced or co-produced all of his previous efforts. For We\u2019re Not Going Anywhere, he hired Sam Kassirer, who has helmed albums by Josh Ritter, Lake Street Dive, Bhi Bhiman, and many other artists. \u201cI needed to evolve and change things up a bit, which is why I chose Sam. He pushed me in a way I hadn\u2019t been pushed before.\u201d Kassirer challenged Ramirez to simultaneously simplify and complicate his songwriting, to find new ways to tell his stories. \u201cHe said, I want you to try to tell a story but use fewer words and more space. In other words, let\u2019s not make a singer-songwriter record. Let\u2019s make a band record. Once he said that, my mind just opened up in a way it never had before. It was fun to just be more straightforward lyrically. It left a lot of space for the music.\u201d In January 2017 Ramirez and his band decamped to the Great North Sound Society, an eighteenth-century farmhouse in rural Maine that serves as Kassirer\u2019s studio. Especially in the winter, when the trees are bare and snow blankets the ground, the setting proved inspiring. \u201cIt\u2019s very secluded, which was part of the appeal. We were able to get out of our touring headspace and stay completely involved with the record and what we were doing.\u201d That allowed the band to concentrate on the music, to pursue ideas without distractions and misgivings, but it also removed them from the world during a momentous event. We\u2019re Not Going Anywhere turns that distance into a big-picture perspective\u2014 engaged and informed, compassionately political but not necessarily partisan. \u201cWe\u2019d take breaks during the day and watch the news and see all the rallies and marches and the disruption and the out-of-control feeling that was everywhere then\u2014and, frankly, still is now. We were looking around and no one was around us. The closest house was a mile away, so it was just us. We were grateful just to retreat from that social tornado for a while and create something that we hoped would be very beautiful.\u201d Looming over every song is the ghost of Ramirez\u2019s great-grandmother, who inspired \u201cEliza Jane,\u201d a deeply poignant and personal tune near the album\u2019s conclusion. In gracefully plainspoken lyrics, Ramirez describes how she and her brothers left Oklahoma during the Great Depression, heading northwest to Oregon, where she played piano in a country band. \u201cMy mom was telling me this story and the song was writing itself. I wish I had known her, because I\u2019m curious what drove her. I know what drives a lot of my musician friends, but I really want to ask a family member: Why did you do this? Was it just for fun? Was it a passion so deep-rooted that you couldn\u2019t not do it?\u201d While he may describe the creative process as fun, Ramirez obviously has inherited a deep-rooted passion\u2014one that will continue to drive him well into the future. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be so afraid to take risks in the future, like I have been in the past. I\u2019ve been so stressed and concerned with every detail, but I learned to let that go. Let\u2019s just have fun. Let\u2019s get weird. I\u2019ve never felt that way about my work. I still respect my older stuff, but I just didn\u2019t want to be afraid anymore.

With his vocal range of seven plus octaves, ability to swing from a deep guttural baritone to soaring soprano riffs, knack for capturing life through lyrics, and commanding stage presence, he has carved a niche for himself in today\u2019s music world. A prolific songwriter, he has a large and varied catalog of songs ranging from heart-wrenching acoustic ballads to heart-pounding heavier rock. His music is published by EMI Music Publishing Canada (2004-present). Lukas first ventured onto the music scene with two Canadian bands, Cleavage (1995-2005) and Rise Electric (2005-2006), which helped prepare him for what was to come. He entered and won the competition television show Rock Star: Supernova (2006) which earned him front man status with Tommy Lee (Motley Crue), Jason Newsted (Metallica), and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). Their band Rock Star Supernova completed an album and a world tour of the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Following the tour, Lukas returned to Los Angeles and began writing and recording new music. The Love and Lust EP (June 2007) was released and he completed the solo acoustic Love and Lust Tour, making over two dozen stops throughout the United States and Canada. The new material was well-received by fans, and the band Stars Down was born (2008-present). After touring with his new band, Lukas began playing local gigs at such southern California hot spots as The Roxy, The Key Club, The Mint, and Viper Room. The year 2010 kicked off with a mini East Coast tour and Lukas working on his first full length album. Hollywood was released (July 2010) and debuted live at West Hollywood\u2019s famous Viper Room. The all acoustic Hollywood Stripped followed (August 2010). After moving to Nashville, in addition to local and out-of-town gigs, he wrote, recorded, produced, and released six additional recordings. The first three were Seed EP (December 2010), Story Teller (January 2011), and Super, Sex, Magic (February 2011). He also co-wrote, provided vocals, and recorded several music videos for a side-project, Switchblade Glory (April 2011). Lukas released Prophecy (November 2011) and Christmas Collection (December 2011) to complete a very busy year. But he wasn\u2019t finished, releasing the album 8 Days (April 2012) soon after. Lukas has appeared on many media outlets, including performing live at the 2006 Gemini awards, the CBS television series Rock Star: Supernova (18 million viewers worldwide), Ellen, Regis & Kelly, The Jimmy Kimmel Show, Entertainment Tonight, The Howard Stern Show, and ET Canada. In addition to his vocal talent, Lukas plays multiple instruments, is a songwriter, producer, actor, and vocal instructor. He currently resides with his wife Kendra in Nashville, Tennessee.

The name of Victor Wainwright\u2019s new band \u2013 and the sleeve image of their debut album \u2013 is also the most fitting of metaphors. In music folklore, the train might have associations with the freight-hopping bluesmen of yore, but with this restless boogie-woogie innovator stoking the furnace, this latest project is a charging locomotive \u2013 surging forward, crashing through boundaries of genre, sweeping up fresh sounds and clattering headlong past the doubters. As the man himself hollers in the ivory-pounding title track: \u201cIf you wanna boogie get aboard this train/Get yourself a ticket or get out of the way\u2026\u201d\n\nAt a sweet-spot in his career, where most established stars would rest on their laurels, Victor Wainwright & The Train instead rips up all that has gone before. These twelve tracks are originals in every sense, written by Wainwright, pricking up ears in a sterile music industry and stretching the concept of roots in bold directions. \u201cI wanted to write this new music mostly on my own,\u201d he explains, \u201cas it was coming and speaking to me. I believe that for roots music to grow, and reach out to new audiences, we have to push it forward.\u201d\n\nThe result is an album that walks a tightrope between scholarly respect and anarchic irreverence. You\u2019ll hear Wainwright twist boogie-woogie tradition on barrelhouse thrillers like Healing and Boogie Depression, both driven by his visceral piano style. But you\u2019ll also hear him fearlessly explore the gamut of genre, from the Latin flavors and New Orleans horns of Wiltshire Grave, to the mellow near-psychedelia of Sunshine.\n\nIt\u2019s a musical cocktail served up by Wainwright\u2019s inimitable gravel-flecked vocal. His words can be hilarious, as on I\u2019ll Start Tomorrow, on which he postpones his doctor\u2019s clean-living advice. But they can also be heartfelt, on the gospel-tinged kiss-off of That\u2019s Love To Me. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to write songs that remind us to love ourselves,\u201d he considers. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who voted for who, what your religion is, who you love\u2026\u201d\n\nOn this white-knuckle ride, only The Train could keep the material on the tracks. \u201cI ended up with a hit-squad of downright amazing musicians,\u201d he reflects, \u201cthat shared my curiosity for all corners of the roots genre. We wanted to capture how we feel performing, right smack-dab on this record, and I believe we\u2019ve done that. Now I just try to keep up.\u201d\n\nIn truth, Wainwright has always been an artist that sets the pace. Born into a musical family in Savannah, Georgia, the formative influence of his father\u2019s vocals and grandfather\u2019s rolling boogie-woogie piano compelled him into a life of music. By 2005, he\u2019d announced his talent with solo debut, Piana\u2019 From Savannah, while his central role in Southern Hospitality and partnership with Stephen Dees in WildRoots has seen him ignite stages and stereos for over a decade. \u201cLooking back on your career is a tough thing to do,\u201d he says. \u201cChallenges are many, and frequent, but when you get it together, it can also be extremely rewarding.\u201d\n\nA man of many talents, Wainwright is a composer, producer, vocalist, piano player and award-winning entertainer. A long-standing leader of the boogie-woogie pack, he could refer you to his BMA and Blues Blast trophies, or a catalog that has repeatedly hijacked the Billboard Top 10. But rather than dine out on past glories, this questing artist would rather you joined him for the ride ahead. \u201cOf course, I still have songs on this album that are just about kicking ass and taking names, like The Train,\u201d he laughs. \u201cBut if you listen to the lyrics, what I\u2019m really saying is, we got to get on the train and move forward together\u2026\u201d\n\nMusicians\n\nVictor Wainwright\n\nvocals, piano, B3, electric piano, mellotron (1), lapsteel (4), belly tambourine (10)\n\nBilly Dean\n\ndrums, percussion, vocals (2, 5, 12), baseball bat (2), knife (2), bicycle bell (2)\n\nTerrence Grayson\n\nbass, vocals (2, 5, 12)\n\nPat Harrington\n\nguitar, vocals (2, 5, 12)\n\nFeaturing special guests:\n\nMark Earley\n\nbari & tenor sax (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11), flute (11)\n\nDoug Woolverton\n\ntrumpet (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11)\n\nReba Russell\n\nvocals (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)\n\nNick Black\n\nvocals (1, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12)\n\nDave Gross\n\nambient guitar (2), baritone guitar (9), tambourine (8, 9, 10), percussion (2), thump (6)\n\nGreg Gumpel\n\nlead guitar (4), wah guitar (5), vocals (5)\n\nJosh Roberts\n\nlead guitar (9), rhythm guitar (7)\n\nMonster Mike Welch\n\nlead guitar (6)\n\nPatricia Ann Dees\n\nvocals (6)\n\nJeff Jensen\n\nacoustic guitar (12)\n\nTRACKLIST\n\n001 Healing 00:05:01\n\n002 Wiltshire Grave 00:04:30\n\n003 Train 00:03:35\n\n004 Dull Your Shine 00:05:35\n\n005 Money 00:04:21\n\n006 Thank You Lucille 00:05:10\n\n007 Boogie Depression 00:03:33\n\n008 Everything I Need 00:05:09\n\n009 Righteous 00:04:45\n\n010 I'll Start Tomorrow 00:04:21\n\n011 Sunshine 00:07:02\n\n012 That's Love To Me 00:08:37", "otherInfo": "\u201cOnly on Can't Stop The Blues!

His insatiable interest in music discovery, sheer love for entertaining and curiosity have led him all around the world, and the resulting perspective is a reflection of his passion for entertaining and creating progressive roots music in an effort to move the art-form forward. Composer, producer, vocalist, and award wining entertainer and piano player; Victor Wainwright is a raucous high-octane, dynamic performer and crowd pleaser with soul to spare.\n\nThe name of Victor Wainwright's band - and the sleeve image of their albums - is also the most fitting of metaphors. In music folklore, the train might have associations with the freight-hopping bluesmen of yore, but with this restless boogie-woogie innovator stoking the furnace, Wainwright is a charging locomotive - surging forward, crashing through boundaries of genre, sweeping up fresh sounds and clattering headlong past the doubters.\n\nAs the man himself hollers in the ivory-pounding track, The Train: \"If you wanna boogie get aboard the train/Get yourself a ticket or get out of the way...\" At a sweet-spot in his career, where most established stars would rest on their laurels, Victor Wainwright & The Train instead rips up all that has gone before, pricking up ears in a sterile music industry and stretching the concept of roots in bold directions.\n\n\"I believe that for roots music to grow, and reach out to new audiences, we have to push it forward,\u201d Wainwright explains. The result is original music that walks a tightrope between scholarly respect and anarchic irreverence. You'll hear Wainwright twist boogie-woogie tradition on barrelhouse thrillers driven by his visceral piano style. But you'll also hear him fearlessly explore the gamut of genre, from Latin flavors and New Orleans piano to near-psychedelia. It's a musical cocktail served up by Wainwright's inimitable gravel-flecked vocal.\n\nOn this white-knuckle ride, only The Train could keep the music on the tracks. \"I ended up with a hit-squad of downright amazing musicians that shared my curiosity for all corners of the roots genre. We wanted to capture how we feel performing, right smack-dab on the records we make, and I believe we've done that. Now I just try to keep up.\"\n\nIn truth, Wainwright has always been an artist that sets the pace. Born into a musical family in Savannah, Georgia, the formative influence of his father's vocals and grandfather's rolling boogie-woogie piano compelled him into a life of music. By 2005, he'd announced his talent with solo debut, Piana' From Savannah, while his central role in Southern Hospitality and partnership with Stephen Dees in WildRoots has seen him ignite stages and stereos for over a decade.\n\nAmong his numerous accolades: Wainwright has won six total Blues Music Awards, charted #1 on the Top 10 in the U.S. Billboard and was Nominated for a 2019 GRAMMY.\n\n\"Looking back on your career is a tough thing to do,\" he says. \"Challenges are many, and frequent, but when you get it together, it can also be extremely rewarding.\" A man of many talents, Wainwright is a composer, producer, vocalist, piano player and award-winning entertainer. A long-standing leader of the boogie-woogie pack, he could refer you to his BMA and long list of Blues Blast trophies, or a catalog that has repeatedly hijacked the Billboard Top 10. But rather than dine out on past glories, this questing artist would rather you joined him for the ride ahead. \"Of course, I still play and write songs that are just about kicking ass and taking names,\" he laughs. \"But if you listen, what I'm really saying is, we got to get on the train and move forward with our love of roots music, together.\u201d\n\nPRESS\n\n\u201cWainwright serves as an electrifying guide to a good time-spinning tales, telling his listeners how to beat the blues, and meticulously conjuring raw soul and energy out of his acoustic piano. He displays a sharp sense of humor and a knack for storytelling... every track is brilliant.\" -Living Blues Magazine\n\n\"Victor Wainwright is a world champion piano player, two times over! Not only is Victor one of the greatest blues piano players in the business, he\u2019s also a world class entertainer and vocalist.\" - Blues Revue Magazine\n\n\u201cVictor Wainwright, winner of this year\u2019s Pine Top Perkins Piano Player Award at the BMA\u2019s, is a force to be reckoned with on a piano. He IS honky-tonk and boogie, with a dose of rolling thunder. Wainwright\u2019s playing is simply beautiful madness.\u201d -American Blues Scene\n\n\u201cSavannah, GA native Victor Wainwright is all about boogie woogie piano, deep soul, and a voice that recalls Dr. John at his best.

Since 2014, the Chicago-based duo have bootstrapped a subtle rise on their own terms, self-releasing several EPs and mapping multiple tours with Midwestern grit. A multicultural collaboration between producer Na\u2019el Shehade and vocalist Via Rosa, the project plays to the complementary dynamics of their unlikely pairing, blurring the lines between R&B and dance-pop, heartbreak and bliss.\n\nRosa grew up in a musical household; her parents played in a reggae band, they toured as a family, homeschooling Rosa into her early teens, limiting her listening primarily to Sade, oldies, Brazilian and Afrobeat music. After moving to Chicago, she connected with hip-hop collective THEMPeople. Born in Chicago, Shehade fell in love with DJ culture as a kid and took up music production and engineering; his interest eventually led to professional opportunities, including studio work with Chance the Rapper, Kanye West, and music projects for MTV and Bravo.\n\nIn early jam sessions the chemistry was clear; Rosa\u2019s soulful delivery interlocked with Shehade\u2019s chic Chicago house-infused production style. A lovesick sound emerged over two EPs \u2014 Gallows in 2016 and Lies After Love in 2018 \u2014 and caught the ear of Ghostly International.

Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bear Axe ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Soul-punk, Rock, Metal, Jazz Fusion", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Seattle rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band, BEARAXE, is torrential.

The album that resulted from our month-long musical journey together in Bombay Beach, CA evolved into a full blown concept album, complete with field recordings captured while living in this fascinating tiny town. It is a tip of that hat to the bygone era of psychedelic rock & roll records, which were meant to be consumed from start to finish, uninterrupted. To promote this deep listening experience, Xina put together a montage of scenes from acid western classics. Your eyes can feast upon bizarro imagery while soaking in our reverberations and tonal madness. It's quite a lovely pairing, if we do say so ourselves.\n\nThis is a LIVE EVENT. No recordings will be published, so please be punctual if you want to catch the whole thing.\n\nThe album is set to release June 1, 2020.

Before touring the globe and amassing millions of hits online with his series of beloved tracks and mixes, the young man came up as a true disciple, absorbing hip hop and RnB culture since his childhood and finding ways to make the music his own. Since the age of fourteen, when he first began to DJ and the following year when his brother introduced him to music production software, his output has been relentless. As he explains, \u201cafter he showed me the basics, from that day on I couldn\u2019t stop making beats,\u201d pumping out a beat a day for the next couple of years and soon after self-releasing a series of EPs and beat tapes that quickly began to expand his reach. Official releases on HW&W and Jakarta Records soon spread his name like wildfire and some instant-classic remixes by the likes of Missy Elliot, Janet Jackson, TLC, Danny Brown and others have cemented his reputation and his sound; an undeniable swing of the drums comparable to Dilla\u2019s, a signature soulful touch in the melodies, and a healthy dose of funky bass lines. In the past year, he was approached by Brodinski to drop the single \u201cFree Things In Life\u201d on the hotly-tipped French label Bromance, has headlined tours in Europe, Australia and North America, and released his newest single and video \u201cAt All\u201d which has already conquered dance floors worldwide and introduced his face to the world with an unforgettable video. Now, as he continues to bridge the gap between the dance world and hip hop/RnB, he is prepping a solo album for 2015 and a series of high profile collaborations that will confirm his position as one of the most important producers in today\u2019s musical landscape.

The album comes after extensive touring of over 20 countries in Europe and North & Central America since their last album, and heavy rotation on alternative dancefloors with their most recent release \"On Blackened Wings\" hitting #1 in the DAC (German Alternative Charts) in 2015.\n\nAt the core of SHIV-R are Pete Crane (vocals & music) and Ben Bulig (music), driven by the need for self-expression and pushing for musical evolution. The music hits PRODIGY-style depth charges and EBM club elements on its way to IAMX-style expressiveness and vocal hooks that wouldn't sound out of place if sung by MARILYN MANSON. Presented with a provocatively dark, lace-filtered visual style, the group is altogether monstrously seductive.\n\nThe 12 songs on \"Requiem for the Hyperreal\" weave a dark, dynamic tapestry that varies from the industrial drive of \"Malediction\" to the musicbox slither of \"Milk and Honey\", with Pete Crane's lyrics describing a personification of fear over swampy textures in the song \"Here in the Dark\" and carving out a manifesto for self-creation over the heavy, broken beats of \"Something to Say\".\n\n\"Cheshire Grin\" will be the first single from the album dropping on August 25. Otherwordly sound design billows against hard-hitting industrial structures in the darkly maddening title song. Inspired by the laudanum-fuelled and reality-fluid Alice in Wonderland, the single also features remixes by Grammy Award Winner CHRIS VRENNA (Nine Inch Nails/Marilyn Manson and composer of the score of American McGee\u2019s Alice videogame), LEAETHER STRIP and AMBASSADOR 21, and artwork created by the equally fantastical and renowned Natalie Shau.\n\nFar from a dream, \u201cRequiem for a Hyperreality\u201d will hit the real world digitally and physically September 29 2017.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "opiuo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9326393.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Electronic, Bass Music", "Time": "5:55 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ever wanted some extra funk in your life?
