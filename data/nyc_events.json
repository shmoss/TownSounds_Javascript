A bandleader, musical educator, composer, and electric and acoustic bassist, Ben was the winner of the 2009 Thelonious Monk Institute International Jazz Competition, a prestigious and important award that has propelled many a promising career. Working with New York\u2019s finest jazz musicians even before graduating from Juilliard, Williams showcased his band, Sound Effect, at The Jazz Gallery in New York, receiving an enthusiastic New York Times review. Writer Nate Chinen stated \u201cWilliams took several long solos in his first set at The Jazz Gallery . . . and each one felt more like an entitlement than an indulgence.\u201d Williams has recorded and performed regularly as a member of bands led by saxophonist Marcus Strickland, pianist Jacky Terrasson, and vibraphonist Stefon Harris. He\u2019s led his own groups at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, Harlem Stage, Rubin Museum of Art, Tribeca PAC in New York City, and SPAC in Saratoga Springs, NY. State of Art signals Williams\u2019 emergence as a prominent voice in the greater jazz community.\nGrowing up in an artistic family of musicians, visual artists, and rappers, young Ben Williams didn\u2019t plan on being a bassist and bandleader. He wanted to be a rock star. His heroes were Prince and Michael Jackson, not Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus. Once again, a chance meeting altered his future.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been playing piano by ear, but I wanted to play guitar,\u201d Williams recalls. \u201cMy middle school offered a strings class where figured I could learn guitar. Then I got there and it was all violins and cellos - no guitars. So I choose the coolest instrument I saw, the bass. It just looked right.\u201d\nWilliams was a natural. He excelled on both bass and piano, and once enrolled at the Duke Ellington High School of the Arts, he became a star student, performing in jazz band, gospel choir, and orchestra, as well as extracurricular gigs. Williams graduated with honors and a Best in Instrumental Music Award. He garnered scholarships from the Fish Middleton Scholarship Competition of the East Coast Jazz Festival, the International Society of Bassist\u2019s Competition, the Steans Music Institute, the Duke Ellington Jazz Society, the International Association for Jazz Education (IAJE) and DC Public Schools City-Wide Annual Piano Competition. Williams received his Bachelor\u2019s in Music Education at Michigan State University in 2007, and his Master\u2019s in Music from the Juilliard School in 2009.\n\u201cIn high school I dedicated myself to the bass and to jazz,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI knew this could be a profession, and if I could do what I love for a living -- man, what is better than that? You always feel like a student playing jazz, there is so much to learn. There\u2019s never a point where you think you\u2019ve arrived. I am trying to get better every day. Even Roy Haynes, when you see him play you get a sense that he is still trying to find new things.\u201d\nLike many self-aware jazz musicians, Ben Williams has myriad influences, from \u201cWayne Shorter, Stevie Wonder and Duke Ellington\u201d to \u201chip-hop and gospel, Little Dragon, Billy Joel, Marvin Gaye.\u201d And like his colleagues in the new guard of jazz, Williams is constantly looking ahead, seeking the music\u2019s potential and his place in it.\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with Stefon Harris\u2019 Blackout for the past few years,\u201d Williams cites. \u201cHe has definitely been a huge influence in my concept of playing music. We have a similar viewpoint to music and jazz. He\u2019s very much about addressing modern times and not rehashing old material. To really interpret what is happening right now, a lot of jazz musicians are into hip-hop and R&B, but they don\u2019t put that into their music. We keep up with the times and we\u2019re not afraid to put that into our music.\u201d\nTo other musician\u2019s music Williams brings his great natural skill and determination to explore, to expand boundaries while sustaining tradition. State of Art is a mature statement stamped with his voice, the next step in Ben Williams\u2019 evolution.\n\u201cI wanted to make an album that regular nine-to-five people could enjoy,\u201d Williams says; \u201cand to make a deep artistic statement as well. I like music that grooves, and I make sure that my music feels good.\n\u201cI always bring a certain energy to whatever the musical situation is,\u201d the soft-spoken musician adds. \u201cI try to be a team player and be supportive, but also, I try to add my voice to the situation. It\u2019s a fine balance between putting your stamp on things and being supportive. I\u2019ve found that balance pretty well. The diversity of my musical upbringing has allowed me to be comfortable in many different musical situations. I don\u2019t try to sound like anyone else, I just try to be honest musically and bring a youthful spirit.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Morgan James", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9814141.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Wed Mar 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-25", "Genre": "R&b, Pop, Soul", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Stageit Livestream", "moreBioInfo": "One voice is all it takes. The right vocalist can make you fall in love at first listen, elicit tears, or bring you back to a different era altogether. A microphone and a stage remain the only necessities. That holds true for New York-based singer and songwriter Morgan James. On her full-length debut for Epic Records, Hunter, she casts an unbreakable spell with a powerhouse voice equally inspired by smoky soul, swaggering R&B, theatrical swing, and a virtuosic classical poise.\n\nThe Idaho native discovered her passion for music early on and pursued it\nwholeheartedly at the prestigious Juilliard School. While in the midst of the institution's rigorous academic program, she soon realized that her path would diverge from the classical world. \"I didn't want a career in opera, but Juilliard still shaped me,\" she confesses. \"The traditional training really made me a disciplined singer. I carry that with me to this day.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Morgan spent the next few years facing the proverbial struggles of being a young artist in New York. Low on money, she bounced back and forth between bartending and restaurant gigs while fighting to survive. Immersed in classic sixties and seventies soul records, she concurrently experienced a pivotal revelation. \"Out of that frustration came this other voice,\" she says. \"It was my true voice, and I feel like I discovered it in the middle of so much hardship just trying to be heard. I embraced who I was at that very moment.\"\n\nSoon, she would be heard in a big way. In 2008, Morgan booked her first Broadway show\u2014appearing in The Addams Family alongside Nathan Lane, as well as in prominent and leading roles in Wonderland, Godspell (Turn Back, O Man), and Berry Gordy's Motown The Musical as Teena Marie. The latter set the stage for her to\nproperly launch her solo career. Gordy recognized the vocalist's immense talent, and introduced her to Doug Morris and L.A. Reid, opening the door for a deal with Epic Records in 2012.\n\nAround the same time, Morgan booked a landmark show at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, where she paid tribute to Nina Simone with a set of songs that were closely associated with the legendary artist. The incendiary show was recorded and released as the critically acclaimed Morgan James Live on Epic Records. It also proved to be the perfect segue for her first studio album, released in June of 2014.\n\n\"I always knew to make a neo-soul pop record,\" Morgan says. \"The foundation is all real ingredients, and those roots of soul and R&B are pretty strong. It's the culmination of my musical life up to this point. The painful songs are straight out of a bad relationship with someone from my past. The joyful moments are wonderful memories. It's all coming from me. I've lived every one of these stories, and I love the genres I'm representing. It's one point-of-view\u2014mine.\"\n\nThe title track and album opener \"Hunter\" boasts a seductive hook with cinematic noir flair. Flaunting the singer's immense delivery and dynamic presence, it's an undeniable and classy come-on that proves as animalistic as it does magnetic. \"From a woman's perspective, it's such an empowering and sexy song,\" she smiles. \"It totally makes me feel like a warrior! Music is so sensual and life-affirming. That's what I look for. You don't often see a girl take this position, and that's what I love about it!\"\n\nMorgan assumed co-writing duties on eight of the collection's fourteen tracks and even performed all of her own background vocals and harmonies. From the empowering farewell of \"Fed Up On You\" to the mournful rumination of \"You Never Lied\", she continually bares it all\u2014both emotionally and musically. \"I sing like I'm never going to sing ever again,\" Morgan affirms. \"I wanted to capture that power and passion every time. At some moments, it might sound flawless; at others, it might sound like it's going to break. I'm revealing something about myself with\nevery song. You've got to do that. My favorite artists, whether Joni Mitchell or Michael Jackson, are and were, always honest.\"\n\nThere's a unique structure to the album. The first five songs boast electronic elements, while the last six don't have any. \"There's a gradient of the record that goes down,\" she says. \"By the time you get to the last song, it's just piano and voice. It starts with a song about power and ego, and it ends on one about surrender and selflessness. I have all of that in me. Maybe we all do.\"\n\nUltimately, her honesty permeates everything that Morgan James does, and it's why you'll always remember her voice. \"I want people to walk away from this album feeling fulfilled. That's the way it used to be. Often, I think I'm from another time,\u201d she says, her voice trailing off. \u201cI just want to bring back the power of the singular legacy voice.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Dario Chiazzolino", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9166210.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Wed Mar 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-25", "Genre": "Progressive Jazz, World Fusion, Jazz", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Jazz Masterclass", "moreBioInfo": "Internationally acclaimed artist Dario Chiazzolino is deemed as one of the most considerable today's jazz guitarists.

Feyer constructs his unique sound by combining personal yet theatrical lyrics with a classically influenced melodic and instrumental style, coupled with electronic-rock production. Key components of Feyer's style are the merger of retro and futuristic sounds and the incorporation of visual elements into the mix, drawing great influence from nostalgic cartoons, video games, and live projections.\n\nBorn in New York City and raised in the surrounding suburbs, Feyer began piano lessons and composing instrumental pieces at a young age. Several years after the initial lessons, Feyer had taken up drums and was singing, playing guitar, and writing songs. During his time as a student, Feyer became an instrumentalist in various rock bands, performing frequently at talent shows and band showcases. Simultaneously, he began recording and producing in his bedroom, beginning to shape his own style.\n\nFeyer relocated upstate and attended Bard College for music composition and production. He also studied orchestration, vocal and instrumental performance, multimedia scoring and musical acoustics/engineering. He studied with many composers and professional musicians and performed as a choir vocalist at international venues under the direction of renowned musical directors. In his final years at college, Feyer solidified his interests and skills in songwriting and production and graduated with a fully produced album ready for release.\n\nIn early 2017, Feyer released his debut album, Signals Internalized. The music was described as energetic, exciting, thought-provoking and risk-taking by a number of online publications like Music Connection, Impose and Pure Grain Audio. Spawned from the album are several music videos, in collaboration with numerous emerging filmmakers and visual artists. Now based back in NYC, Feyer has showcased this music at many of the city's well-known venues such as Mercury Lounge, Bowery Electric, Knitting Factory, and Sunnyvale.\n\nWhen he is not working on his own music, Feyer can be found involving himself with other projects with a number of different artists and bands all across the music world. This includes recording, producing, and remixing other artists, songwriting collaborations, and composing and sound designing for films, shows, video games, commercials, and audiobooks.\n\nFeyer's new single, \"Stuck in a Video Game,\" is now out on all platforms, in partnership with Kobalt's AWAL.

Singing old style hymns in a church where no musical instruments were allowed, living down a rural road where electricity and running water weren't available until she was in high school, Bradley learned the hardships and the joys of a way of life that had more in common with that of earlier generations than the experiences of her contemporaries in today's bluegrass scene. \"It was very different. It was not easy,\" she says. And even as a girl, she knew she wanted more. \"When you go up on one of the mountains there, it's breathtakingly gorgeous -- but I was so sure I was never going to be able to leave.\"\n\nShe was sure of something else: her love for music. An uncle who'd been part of the Appalachian migration to Detroit city brought country music tapes back with him when he came to visit, opening her ears to music beyond church hymns. Bradley began to claim her own right to music as a teenager, borrowing her uncle's guitar to play and sing at school events. Eventually that love for music would take her out of the mountains and into the top ranks of bluegrass stars.\n\nWomen are reshaping the bluegrass sound, and Bradley, with her mountain pure soprano, her knack for storytelling, and her true-life roots, is one of those creating that exciting music. Steeped in the past and present of the bluegrass way of life, she is equally at home with a contemporary country song turned high lonesome as she is with a mountain ballad.\n\nThat's clear through the range of music she's chosen for Catch Tomorrow, her third solo album. \"I want this record to be thought provoking,\" Bradley says, \"Maybe it will make people take a second look at how we view the world, walk in somebody else's shoes a little bit.\"\n\nBradley turned to GRAMMY award winning banjoist and Compass Records co-founder Alison Brown to produce Catch Tomorrow. Sitting in with Bradley and Brown is an all-star cast of roots music's finest including Jim Lauderdale, Tim O'Brien, Jeff White, and Steve Gulley (Mountain Heart). Stand out tracks include an exquisite gospel duet with Larry Sparks on Pass Me Not, a traditional country duet with Marty Raybon (Shenandoah) on Holding on to Nothing, and a collaboration with Irish super group Lunasa on When the Mist Comes Again. She also delivers some hard driving bluegrass on the self-penned Run Rufus Run, Julia Belle, and the soon to be classic Rita Mae with the help of her past and current band mates including Michael Cleveland, Jesse Brock, and longtime co-writer Vicki Simmons.\n\nBradley offers heartfelt storytelling and tackles not so bluegrass songs, including Texas tunesmith Billy Joe Shaver's Live Forever and rock icon Kris Kristofferson's Me and Bobby McGee. She makes them her own. When she first heard bluegrass music, \"it hit me so strong,\" Bradley recalls, \"I thought, this is the genre that can do it all.\"\n\n\"When you've got the desire to write and sing, it's who you are,\" Bradley says. That desire pulled her from the hardscrabble life she knew as a teenager in rural eastern Kentucky all the way to a nod as Traditional Female Vocalist of the Year from SPBGMA, a 2006 IBMA nomination for Female Vocalist of the Year, and to her current status as one of the most respected musicians in bluegrass. Along the way she lent her voice to the famed Renfro Valley Barn Dance and The New Coon Creek Girls, and saw her solo debut, East Kentucky Morning, chosen as an editor's pick at Billboard. Longtime fan Alison Krauss comments: \"Dale Ann Bradley is one of the most gifted vocalists bluegrass and country music has ever heard.

Hailed as \u201cthe reigning queen of avant-garde cello\u201d by The Washington Post, she has been called a \u201ccello rock star,\u201d by Rolling Stone and praised as \u201ca force of nature,\u201d by The Boston Globe.\n\nRaised in the Galilee Mountains in Israel, by her Argentinean father and French mother, Maya spent her early life surrounded by the music and rituals of Jews, Muslims, and Christians, while studying classical cello repertoire.

His string of hit singles, millions of albums sold, and a 28-year recording career aside, Stigers\u2019 commitment to artistic growth, and to bringing new tunes to the Great American Songbook, has become unparalleled in modern music.\n\nBarnstorming concert halls, festivals and clubs everywhere from Moscow to Manhattan, accompanied one night by his quartet, another by big band or orchestra, Stigers continues to release new work nearly every year, frequently collaborating with his musical heroes. Along the way, this musician who began his career playing standards in a Boise hotel lobby while moonlighting as drummer in a punk rock band has redefined the constitution of contemporary jazz singing.\n\n\u201cI was the kid who worshipped songs and the musicians who wrote and recorded them,\u201d he remembers. \u201cBack then, pop radio played everything from Aretha Franklin to Led Zeppelin, Marvin Gaye to Willie Nelson, Joni Mitchell to Elton John. I loved it all, and I studied it.\u201d Often euphoric and always elegant, Stigers possesses a curator\u2019s knack for hearing a song, framing its heart, and making it his own\u2014be it the work of Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Wilco, or The Kinks.\n\nStigers\u2019 repertoire is a reflection of his appreciation for the fundaments of tone and craft, and for quality\u2014the progression of his work is both organic and practical. \u201cJazz songs used to be pop songs. Jazz has always been about reinvention,\u201d Stigers notes.\n\nPerhaps because he has penned so many notable songs himself, as well as writing with the likes of legends like Carole King and Barry Mann, Stigers has come to recognize the small, perfect things that are a great melody and lyric, and how to capture them. That songwriting talent also led to an Emmy nomination for co-writing and singing the theme song to the wildly successful TV series Sons Of Anarchy.\n\nIt is his rich singing voice, however\u2014singular, balletic, and at turns both mournful and playful\u2014that has landed him on records with the likes of Al Green, Shawn Colvin, in studios with venerated producers like Larry Klein, Danny Kortchmar, and Glen Ballard, and on stages and concert bills with a plethora of legends, including pop and rock greats Eric Clapton, Elton John, Bonnie Raitt, Prince, Rod Stewart and The Allman Brothers, and jazz giants Nancy Wilson, Al Jarreau, Gerry Mulligan, Randy and Michael Brecker, Chuck Mangione, Toots Thielmans, Wynton and Branford Marsalis, Kurt Elling, Diana Krall, John Scofield, and many more.\n\nAfter being mentored in his early years by legendary jazz pianist Gene Harris, and by the great jazz singer Mark Murphy, his unique talent was recognized by music business impresario Clive Davis, who signed Stigers to a record deal after hearing him in a New York restaurant.

Simple as that. The Jacksonville, FL based 10-piece has been roaming stages along the southeast for the last four years delivering the goods wherever they turn up. Recent tours have taken them to New Orleans, Atlanta and Savannah, while festival hits are becoming more and more the normal for them. \u201cThe dressing rooms are getting nicer,\u201d says lead vocalist Josue A. Cruz. \u201cAs in now we have some.\u201d Recent opening slots for Santana and Trombone Shorty have also worked to expand their reach to new ears and new dancers.\n\nThe group is now ready to take a larger bite of the music sphere. They recorded and are preparing to release Sin Parar, their debut album comprised of nine original compositions that range from the intricate to the downright jaw-dropping salsa songs. The album is sure to catch the ears, and feet, of the seasoned salsa aficionado and the novice alike.\n\nIn June 2015, LPT made its debut in a small coffee shop in the Riverside neighborhood of Jacksonville. The space was just big enough to hold the then septet. The show was a hit from the downbeat, with the standing-room-only crowd requesting the next date immediately. The band set up a monthly standing Thursday night gig in the back room of Rain Dogs in Five Points and played there until the room no longer held the crowds that showed up. Some astute, early fans started posting about strategic places to stand and dance during an LPT show because the room go so packed and so hot.\n\nLPT eventually grew to a full ten-piece orchestra and, while still able to squeeze into the tight stage at Rain Dogs, bigger stages came calling and continue to do so today. With some of Northeast Florida\u2019s most talented musicians in the melee now, LPT has not stopped making every show an unforgettable experience for all who attend. Post-show social media lights up with first-hand accolade as soon as the last note rings out. LPT says that the energy from the audience has been a motivator from the first show.\n\nLPT is now growing out of the borders of Jacksonville; the energetic performance has made its way to St. Augustine and Gainesville, as of late, and inquiries from further and further away are starting to surface. While moving a ten-piece around is not the simplest of tasks, LPT understands and accepts that they are becoming the new ambassadors of Salsa music in the Southeast, using the music to bridge gaps between cultures. Dancing and joy has no owner and LPT is well-poised to reinforce that freedom, love and inclusion is at the heart of Salsa music and in the hearts of all that enjoy the shows.\n\nAs for what the name LPT stands for, well, it remains a bit of a mystery. Some members say it is simply three letters that stand side by side. Others offer more surreptitious and hilarious definitions. Regardless of what the name stands for, the group will continue to stand up for Salsa music and the roots of the Afro-Cuban sound.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Haley Gold", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9903948.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Wed Mar 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-25", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "21 Year Old Singer / Songwriter", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "241 E 24th St, New York, NY 10010", "Artist": "Brendan Fitzgibbons", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9956621.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.980868, 40.738845], "Date": "Wed Mar 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-25", "Genre": "Brooklyn, New York", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "New York Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "Brendan Fitzgibbons is an actor, writer, stand-up and host living in New York and Los Angeles with his dog Willoughby.

Lord teamed up with Smith to produce and write for Mik Howard, Will Downing and many more.\n\nWhen the group became known as The Family Stand, they also added a third member with Sandra St. Victor. Victor had attended the University of Kansas and, upon moving to New York, was in high demand as a vocalist, working with Freddie Jackson and Chaka Khan.\n\nThe group's first album, Chain, scored a hit with the track Ghetto Heaven which reached #3 on the R&B charts.\n\nIn 1991, the group released a second LP, Moon in Scorpio. However, the album tried to go in to many directions at once and often fetaured more rock than R&B. As such, the album failed to register with its urban audience and did not perform well.\n\nIn 1998, the group replaced Victor with Jacci McGhee after Victor left the group to go solo. During the same year, they released a new album, Connected. The album returned to the sounds of soul and highlighted the group's talent in writing and production.\n\nThe world according to The Family Stand is full of funk, love, rage and introspection. Formed by the powerhouse triple team of vocalist/keyboard wizard Peter Lord, vocalist multi-instrumentalist V. Jeffrey Smith and soul siren Sandra St. Victor in the early 90s, the band made the legendary \"Moon In Scorpio\" before going on hiatus in 1999. They have sustained a ravenous, excited following even in their absence. Largely this is because their dazzling live shows back in the day. Performances where impeccable musicianship, sizzling stage craft and volcanic energy left indelible imprints on the memory on their fan's hearts, feet and imaginations. They did what Great Black Music performances used to do on the regular--make you think hard about the world and your own inner life while you had a stomp down, sweaty, good time in the process. And in a community full of loving like-minded fellow travelers to boot. Built around the songwriting and production talents of Smith and Lord and the thermonuclear vocals of St. Victor, The Family Stand recombinated elements of rock, folk, soul, free jazz, hiphop, funk and hardcore gospel into a melodic amalgam rooted that's answered the musical question, What if Stevie Wonder ever sat in with Living Colour, Fishbone and Bad Brains? More than the sum of their influences though, the group took on social issues with a fury rare for a contemporary band rooted in r and b. Family Stand classics such as \"Plantation Radio\" and \"The Education of Jamie\" are emotional rollercoasters that turn topical, political content into eargasms. At another end of the spectrum is their big club hit \"Ghetto Heaven\" which brought pure romance back to the hood with a soulfulness and a bounce that still can't be denied or easily duplicated. Not content to rest on their laurels, The Family Stand hasn't just reformed to resurrect old glory but has been in the lab cooking up a new mind body and soul throttling release for '07 called \"Super Sol Nova\". Here once again they are taking on the hot topics of day-9/11, the war in Iraq, fratricide in the music -- and on the streets -- with hard crunchy beats, loud and raunchy guitars, pyrotechnic vocalizing, sensuous horn and keys and a rock of ages sense of hope and redemption.

They also opened for punk bands The Stranglers and The Motors. They had a hit with the single \"On and On\", and refer to their music as \"Athletic Rock.\"\n\nFormed in Newcastle, England by brothers John and Mark Gallagher, Raven quickly set the pace for the burgeoning metal renaissance in the UK at the time. Raven began creating a sound which was rooted in British hard rock with progressive tendencies and a willingness to take musical chances . The band's highly energized live show and interaction between members developed an image and style of play the band described as \"athletic\". They began wearing guards, helmets and plates from various sports (hockey, baseball,etc...) and incorporating them into the playing of their instruments (for instance, elbow pads were used to strike cymbals for a unique performance angle). Eventually, the band signed with Neat Records, the legendary, low-budget metal label of the Northlands, releasing Wiped Out and Rock Until You Drop within a year's time and making an impressive showing on the UK charts a the time. Sufficient noise was made for the American market to take notice and New Jersey's Megaforce Records signed them, issuing their next recording in the States as All for One. The band came stateside in 1983 and toured extensively with Megaforce bands Metallica and Anthrax, both of whom would gain a place of prominence in the growing thrash metal movement. Manager/Megaforce founder Johnny Zazula believed that Raven were major label material and kept them touring constantly until the big labels noticed. The infamous Live at the Inferno recording was a product of one of those tours. Atlantic Records signed Raven to a worldwide contract after a minor bidding war (major label contracts would follow for Metallica and Anthrax in the following year). The band moved its permanent base from Newcastle to New York.\n\nStay Hard was released in 1984 and proved a minor hit on the strength of single/video On and On. The Atlantic years proved to be less-than-stellar for the band. A drastic shift in a more \"commercial\" direction came at the label's behest, with many diehard fans being alienated by the slick, lightweight production of The Pack Is Back (effectively marketing the band with their weird musical forays and confusing image was likely very difficult). However, the band recorded 2 LPs and the Mad EP before being let go by Atlantic. After touring behind the Life's a Bitch album, Wacko left the band to spend more time with his new wife and family. He would later pursue a career in audio production and engineering, eventually working with jazz greats Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick, Jr. Virginian Joe Hasselvander (ex-Pentagram) took over the drum set and the band dropped the outlandish image for a more conventional \"denim and leather\" look for their 1988 release Nothing Exceeds Like Excess. After the advent of grunge and the dissolution of their record label (Combat Records) led the band to concentrate on continental Europe and Japan, where they retained more of a following. The band recorded and toured until 2001, when a wall collapsed on Mark, crushing his legs. Raven went on hiatus for nearly 5 years while the guitarist rehabilitated. As of 2006, Raven is touring with a new release in the works.\n\n\n2) RAVEN is a Solo project by Terui Toshiyuki (\u7167\u4e95\u5229\u5e78), bassist of BLANKEY JET CITY and ROSSO. In 2003, RAVEN released one album, Kagirinaku aka ni chikai kuro (\u9650\u308a\u7121\u304f\u8d64\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u9ed2), most notably featuring Chiba Yusuke of Thee Michelle Gun Elephant and ROSSO on vocals for most of the tracks.\n\n\n3) Raven is Czech artist and multiinstrumentalist Vladim\u00edr Ku\u010dera (*1966), who's released four albums so far - Bubny a p\u00ed\u0161\u0165aly (1991), Salome a dal\u0161\u00ed p\u00edsn\u011b Karla Kryla (1993), Harmonie (2002) and Kamen\u00ed (2006).\n\n\n4) Raven was an influential band from Buffalo, N.Y., in the 1960s. Raven began as Stan Szelest's backing band in Stan and the Ravens, which featured Tom Calandra on bass and Gary Mallaber on drums. When Stan and the Ravens broke up, Calandra and Mallaber joined a band called The Rising Sons with vocalist Tony Galla, guitarist John Weitz, and pianist/keyboardist Jimmy Calire.\n\nRaven manager Marty Angelo, trying to book gigs for the band outside of Buffalo, met Jimi Hendrix at Steve Paul's Scene in New York City in 1967. Hendrix was so impressed with the tape he heard, that he convinced the club's owner to book Raven.\n\nLater that same year, Angelo sent the same tape Hendrix had heard to Beatle George Harrison. Harrison sent a letter back to Angelo which expressed an interest in signing Raven to Apple Records.\n\n\n5) Raven:\nGenre: Black Metal\nLyrical theme: Misanthropy\nOrigin: Norway\nFormed in: 1993\nLabel: No Colours Records\nLast known line-up:\nRune Vedaa (Forgotten Woods, Joyless)\nothers - unknown\n\nMember(s) of Forgotten Woods involved in this. Their demos were released under the name Ravn.\n\nRumours say that Raven is now a solo band, changed their name to Mengele, and is still making music, but not recording. Might, against all odds, release an MCDlater this year.\n\n\n6) Raven:\nA project of the German band Sleipnir.\n\n7) Raven :\nOhio heavy blues rock band from Ohio, who released one, ultra-rare LP, 1975's \"Back to Ohio Blues\".\n\n8) Raven :\nsee Shape of Despair.

The album was a follow-up to the psychedelic cult classic Judy Henske & Jerry Yester Farewell Aldebaran. Perhaps to its detriment, Rosebud was seen as a democratic enterprise, with all band members contributing songs and singing, broadly in a countryish soft rock style - rather than making the best use of Henske's remarkable voice and songwriting abilities. Following its release and a couple of live shows, the band split up, Henske and Yester divorced, and she and Doerge married.\n\nYester is credited as the producer of their lone album. The LP was released on the Straight/Reprise label; the CD re-release in 2004 is on Collectors Choice Music.\n\nYester, Henske, and Doerge have continued to produce and record music, and Judy Henske has recently returned to the studio and has been touring as well.\n\n\n\n2.)Rosebud is the jazzy side project of Jump, Little Children (Jump) frontman Jay Clifford.\n\nThe group released 2 records, Rosebud (1999) and Vespers (?).\n\n3.)

Following, they began working as a trio and in 1995, added Errol Viray and Lorenzo's cousin Andrey \"Drey\" Silva.\n\nOriginally named APEX, the group changed its name to Kai, an abbrevated version of the Tagalog word \"kaibigan,\" which means \"friendship.\" They were signed to HB Records, a local studio and began working on an album. Their debut single, \"Say You'll Stay\" was released shortly after and received strong radio play. This helped them get signed by Geffen in 1997. In 1998, they released their self-titled debut album on Geffen, making them the second Filipino American recording artist to release an album on a major record label (Jocelyn Enriquez was the first, releasing Jocelyn on Tommy Boy Records in 1997.). Their only charting single was the previously mentioned \"Say You'll Stay\" which reached #59 on the Billboard Hot 100. In that same year, they were also featured in an issue of Vibe Magazine alongside rap group The Mountain Brothers in an article promoting up-and-coming Asian American talent in the music industry.\n\nIn 2000, Andrew Gapuz left the group and was replaced by Johnny Misa, amidst a controversy that Misa was already slated to fill a vacated spot in the Los Angeles based a cappella group Ja'a. With Misa in the lineup, Kai released their second album, The Promise under C3D Records with with singles \"Every Little Thing\" and \"It Might Be You.\" They toured for the album with the backup band Deviation.\n\nIn a similar fashion to other Filipino American recording artists, both of Kai's albums were recorded in English and also featured many covers of songs which were prominent in the 1970's and 1980's. Also in similar fashion to their peers, they were known to sing Tagalog covers at their live performances, as well as other popular English covers that were more recent.\n\nThroughout their career, Kai also released exclusive songs not featured on their albums on various compilation albums. In 1998, \"Last to Know\" was featured on Serenade Volume 1, a compilation released by Filipino American record label Classified Records. Kai also contributed to two compliations released by popular social networking website AsianAvenue.com. A version of \"The Promise,\" which would later be modified before it became the title track of their second album, was released on AsianAvenue.com Plugged In Volume 1 in 1999 and a cover of Shai's \"Come With Me\" featuring Deviation was released on AsianAvenue.com Plugged In Volume 3 in 2001.\n\nIn 2001, Kai officially retired as a group. With the group's lack of a consistent webpage throughout their career and popular sites such as MySpace or Wikipedia which are typically used by recording artists and their fans to convey information to a wider audience not developed yet, the circumstances surrounding their retirement remain a mystery.\n\n\n\nkai is also DJ from israel\n:)", "otherInfo": "Accessible accommodations should purchase a General Admission ticket and will be taken care of at the venue day of event."}, {"Address": "599 Johnson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Fury", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9038552.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.923155, 40.709325], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "Hardcore Punk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Elsewhere - Zone One", "moreBioInfo": "Fury may refer to two bands: mostly a Washington DC Hardcore band, but possibly an Australian Thrash Metal band from Broken Hill now called The Harrowed.\n\nJay Flores was born on December 19, 1985 in Bristol, CT. Having a Philipino, French, Spanish and Italian background, his ethnic diversity served as almost a precursor to the music he would create years later. Coming from humble beginnings, Jay spent his early childhood growing up in a small Bristol housing project finding heroin needles in his own backyard, with his family trying best to get by. However, the struggles he experienced as a youth taught him to constantly work towards distant goals and reach out and grab his dreams, no matter how high the stakes. Constantly misunderstood by his friends and family, some even called him \u201ccrazy\u201d. When in the 7th grade, Jay adopted the name \u201cFury\u201d after a physical altercation involving a racist classmate. It was at age thirteen when Jay first discovered his passion for being a hip-hop artist. His ambition was evident from the start, as he recruited several friends to be at his side for the adventure he was about to embark on. What started as a pipedream slowly began to take shape, as Jay formed his own independent record label, \u201cLeathal Wreckords\u201d. Teaming up with a childhood friend and forming the now locally legendary recognized rap group Kapital Punishment, Fury with partner Ether recorded and released many projects together, including the professionally pressed album \"Lifes Work\", and released several other collaborative mixtapes and albums locally alongside his labelmates. Through constant street hustling and vigorous self-promotion, Jay\u2019s fanbase steadily grew into one of the New England region\u2019s most loyal underground followings. However, that was just the tip of the iceberg for the man known as Fury, as he set his sights on national recognition.\n\nStarting off playing at small, local venues, Jay and the LW camp eventually became mainstays at the Webster Theater in Hartford, CT. He has also played shows at the Living Room in Providence, RI and Peabody\u2019s in Cleveland, OH. Jay\u2019s resume grew as he performed alongside successful national acts Tech N9ne, Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid, Mindless Self Indulgence and The Pharacyde, just to name a few. However, his lifelong dream was realized the night he played a show alongside the Grammy-winning and Platinum-record selling Bizzy Bone of Bone Thugs \u2018N\u2019 Harmony. For Jay, playing a show with his childhood hero became the highlight of his fledgling career. Bizzy Bone and Jay had great chemistry both on and off-stage, and the two worked on several collaborations, as well as potential future projects and shows. Since then, Jay has shared the stage with Bizzy Bone on several more occasions.\n\nFollowing struggles with unmotivated group members and several other internal difficulties and setbacks, Jay decided to start anew. Fury broke away from the group Kapital Punishiment and was reborn as a solo artist. He then set out to make the impact he had always envisioned, even if it meant going at it alone. He went back to the drawing board and began to form the blueprint to what would be his debut LP as a solo artist. It was his \u201cPlan B\u201d, which was soon adapted as the album\u2019s name. Always regarded as a personal artist who holds nothing back from his fans, Jay spent the better part of two years grooming the record. Old songs were scrapped, new songs were written, new collaborations were recorded\u2026For Jay, it was all part of an on-going process to create his own personal masterpiece to share with the world.\n\nJay let his versatility and talent as an artist shine through on \u201cPlan B\u201d. As a self-taught producer with musical knowledge passed down from his grandfather and father who were both popular local entertainers, Jay did not hesitate in making up for lost time. Pouring his heart and soul into this project, he explored several different avenues with his music. His heartfelt poetry and raw emotion are felt on tracks such as \u201cBe Right Back\u201d, \u201cJay\u2019s Song 2006\u201d, \u201cBe Myself Again\u201d and the biographical \u201cIrving Street\u201d, which chronicles his rap career from the very beginning to present day. His fiery lyrical presence and strength as an emcee are showcased in songs such as \u201cPlan B\u201d, \u201cStep On You\u201d and \u201cFrom The Ashes\u201d. Jay sought out the best talent from both the underground and mainstream to add their creative input to the album. Aside from his LW labelmates, everyone from independent regional favorites Q Strange and Menacide to national superstars such as Gold-record selling gangsta rap legend Spice 1, Detroit hip-hop\u2019s own King Gordy, and childhood hero Bizzy Bone all contributed their talents to the project. Powerful, crisp and sensual production provided the perfect musical backdrop to the tracks which were recorded.\n\nAfter negotiations with several major labels fell through, Jay decided to release \u201cPlan B\u201d independently through his own Leathal Wreckords label. On Halloween 2006, the end result from years of blood, sweat, tears and countless months of hard work finally paid off, as \u201cPlan B\u201d was released nationally through several online retailers in a limited 1000 copy pressing. Old and new fans alike were treated to an incredibly diverse album, and many felt as if they knew both Jay Flores and Fury after listening to the record.\n\nSome independent artists seem content with catering to a local fanbase for the rest of their careers. Jay is quite the opposite, as he constantly sets his sights higher. While the release of \u201cPlan B\u201d can be considered the end of one journey, it is only the beginning of another, and Jay Flores is ready to take on any and every obstacle thrown his way with an unmatched FURY like no other\u2026...leave Fury some love here as well... or hit him up on aim at \"planbfurylw\"", "otherInfo": "ONSALE: FRIDAY 1/17 12PM ESTElsewhere is intended to be a safe space to enjoy music, art, expression, and free play.

Jazz bassist Dave Baron, lets his instrument do the talking. He has demonstrated his skills supporting such jazz luminaries as Eric Reed, Lew Tabackin, Mary Stallings, Peter Bernstein, Walt Weiskopf, Joe Lovano, Jimmy Greene, Bill Dobbins, Wycliffe Gordon, Bruce Barth, and Bill Evans (saxophonist), among others. Dave has collaborated with other artists in many countries including Italy, Australia, Russia, Korea, Grand Cayman, and Romania.\nDave moved to New York City in 2010 to attend The Juilliard School for his master\u2019s degree. Under the tutelage of the legendary bassist Ron Carter, Baron performed with Herbie Hancock at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center as part of a concert held for Carter\u2019s 75th birthday celebration. Prior to this, Dave Baron received his Bachelor\u2019s Degree from the Eastman School of Music. Dave was selected as one of fifteen semi- finalists from around the world for the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Bass Competition. There he performed with pianist Geoff Keezer, and drummer Carl Allen, at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Soon after, he was awarded second place at the International Society of Bassists\u2019 Scott LaFaro Jazz Competition. Baron participated in a professional development workshop with pianist Brad Mehldau, presented by the Weill Institute at Carnegie Hall. He also participated in workshops at the Banff Centre in Alberta, Canada where he worked with artists such as Dave Douglas, Scott Colley, and the ICP Orchestra.\nOriginally from Simsbury, CT, Dave grew up playing the cello in local youth orchestras where he gained an appreciation for classical music. Despite Baron\u2019s love for classical music through the years, he was drawn to jazz. Dave was first exposed to jazz at the age of 12 while he was a paperboy for the Hartford Courant. On rainy days, his father would drive him around the neighborhood along his paper route, with the likes of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong playing on the radio. He began pursuing jazz seriously when he was accepted to the Greater Hartford Academy of the Arts during his junior year of high school. There, he became a prote\u0301ge\u0301 of saxophonist Jimmy Greene, who introduced him to bassist Reuben Rogers, who he traveled to take lessons with in New York City. It was during this crucial time in his life that he decided to pursue creating music with a purpose.\nDave Baron is not only a performer in high demand, but also a well-rounded educator. He is currently a faculty member of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center\u2019s Jazz For Teens program where he teaches jazz ensembles, theory classes and bass students. Other teaching experiences include his time at Juilliard, when he was selected to join the Goldman Fellowship, working with students at Harlem School of the Arts. After graduating, Baron was hired by HSA as a faculty member. David has taught jazz workshops at The Trinity College in Melbourne, Australia, Snow College in Ephraim, Utah, and has presented master classes at numerous other institutions. In the fall of 2015, he released his debut album entitled \u2018Introducing Dave Baron\u2019.", "otherInfo": "Join us at the Birdland Theater for Nick Finzer's Cast of Characters Album Release show!"}, {"Address": "269 Norman Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11222", "Artist": "Deadbeat", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6614931.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.94218, 40.727844], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "Metal, Dub, Reggae", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Kingsland Bar & Grill", "moreBioInfo": "Though based in Montreal, Deadbeat and his ultra-textured ambient dub soundscapes made their way around the world, finding large audiences in Europe as well as in North America. Deadbeat producer Scott Monteith is a member of the same fertile Montreal scene that includes such luminaries as Akufen (Marc Leclair) and Algorithm (Jeff Milligan). Like his peers, he gained international acclaim in the early 2000s once the French-Canadian city became a hot spot for laptop techno (see the Montreal Smoked Meat compilation), thanks partly to the world-reknown Mutek festival as well as a wealth of Montreal-based record labels. Monteith debuted as Deadbeat in July 2000 with the Cesium Beam 12\" for Hautec Records and has since recorded for such labels as Revolver, Intr_version, Background, Force Inc., ORAL, Scape, Cynosure, and Clitekture. In addition, he has collaborated with Steve Beaupre as Crackhaus and also with Robert Henke (Monolake) as Atlantic Waves.\n\nMonteith moved to Montreal in 1995 and quickly became enthralled by the city's underground community of digital musicians and artists, eventually co-founding the multi-media collective Covert Ops. He began recording music as Deadbeat in early 1998 and released his first 12\" in 2000. A year later fellow Montreal producer Mitchell Akiyama released the debut Deadbeat full-length, Primordia (2001), on his Intr_version label, and another year later Stefan Betke (Pole) released the follow-up, Wild Life Documentaries (2002), on his Scape label. During the intermittent time, numerous other labels released Monteith's recordings as Deadbeat; most notably, Force Inc showcased the producer's work -- both as Deadbeat and as half of Crackhaus -- on its scene-encapsulating Montreal Smoked Meat (2002) collection. In addition to his recordings, Monteith has performed live at the Mutek festival (Montreal, May 2000), the Transmediale festival (Berlin, February 2002), and the Creative Time festival (New York, October 2002), as well as elsewhere.

They also accompany themselves on banjo, guitar, piano, kazoo, tambourine and various other percussion instruments. Although they grew up an hour from each other in Northeast Ohio, they didn't meet until attending college in Nyack, NY, while pursuing Vocal Performance majors. When they began collaborating in 2011, they wrote a flood of material. In 2014, they were married. Continuing pursuit of classical training, they received their M.A.s in Vocal Performance in 2017 from Montclair State University. The Wilhelm\u2019s have two recorded releases; full-length album, Floorboards (2013) and the single release, Passing the Time (2019). The unique style of Truth & I is a reflection of this duo's wide range of musical influences and interests, including folk, jazz, classical, bossa nova and classic rock.

To some, Glitterer seeed to manifest the parallel identity, something between an alter-ego and a superego, of Ned Russin, who wrote, sang, and played every note of the EP\u2019s eight songs. Ned Russin is a New Yorker, by way of Northeastern Pennsylvania, a 29-year-old bassist and singer who made his name in music by playing in a band called Title Fight.\n\nGlitterer features spartan instrumentation \u2014 bass, drum machine, synths, and a familiar voice \u2014 and its compositional ethos, such as the listener can grasp, lies in hyper-efficient deployment of discrete harmonic and melodic ideas, also known as verses, choruses, and bridges. The introspective but gnomic lyrics address the kinds of ontological, existential, epistemological, ethical, and moral questions one would expect might occur to a 20-something liberal-arts college student (which Ned was, at Columbia, at the time of Glitterer\u2019s release) all while wryly acknowledging the predictability of such heady questions\u2019 arising under such heady conditions.\n\nNot Glitterer, a five-song follow-up, appeared eight months later. As is suggested by the antinomic title, the newer EP is even more preoccupied with contemplating the exigencies and implications of regarding oneself and of regarding oneself regarding oneself and, of course, of regarding oneself regarding oneself regarding oneself. And, as with the first record, no song extends a second beyond what\u2019s necessary to deliver the minimally viable aesthetic and intellectual goods. One would be hard-pressed to name an artist that conveyed a higher concentration of stimulation and aural pleasure in 2017 and 2018.\n\nAt this point in the story, Glitterer was all but bound to be forced into certain boxes. Here we had what appeared, at a casual glance, to be an erstwhile rock musician\u2019s inevitable solo-electro project, consisting as it did of cleverly written songs whose principal subject was the very self that had conceived them. And this at a time when the most talked-about independent musicians were radically self-involved \u201cSoundcloud rappers,\u201d a time whose zeitgeist, engineered in large part by Silicon Valley\u2019s oligarchs and their data-harvesting social networks, produced and nurtured the most narcissistic individuals in the most narcissistic moment in the history of the most narcissistic society in the history of the world. In this context, Glitterer must be a low- or no-stakes novelty exercise in recreational solipsism. Or else one disingenuous man\u2019s cynical bid for a slice of the post-Lil Peep streaming-revenue pie. Or else a bit of self-serious critical-theory cosplay meant to flatter the intellectual vanity of budding coastal elites. Or maybe a toxic mix of all three?\n\nBut anyone harbouring such suspicions was disabused of them as soon as they saw Glitterer play live during this period. Recordings are plastic objects (in more senses than one) onto which listeners project their biases: A musician who tries to convey vulnerability, earnestness, or self-effacement solely through records is at the mercy of those who would superimpose onto them their own cynicism. (This is, after all the most narcissistic moment in the history of the most narcissistic society in the history of the world.) Live performance is different: A musician who goes out of his way to commune in good faith with people who themselves have gone out of their way to stand together in a room \u2014 such a musician is not so easily dismissed. And so it was that, accompanied only by a microphone stand and a Mac laptop perched on a stool like a standup comic\u2019s glass of water, Ned performed 42 U.S. shows from 2017 to 2019, mostly opening for punk and hardcore bands. His dad called it his karaoke act.\n\nBut the live show, too, was a contingency, a temporary means to an end that, like the EP\u2019s, occluded an essential paradox: Glitterer is a solo project, Glitterer is Ned Russin \u2014 but Glitterer is, and has always been, a band.\n\nHence Looking Through The Shades, Glitterer\u2019s debut full-length album, out on Anti- in summer 2019. Recorded in the cozy carpeted basement of the Russin family home, in Kingston, Pa., and co-produced by indie-rock prodigy Alexander Giannascoli and the Arthur Rizk (Code Orange, Power Trip, Sumerlands, the 2018 Grammy Awards), the album not only contains Glitterer\u2019s best-yet sonics and songs; it has been constructed in such a way as to evince a spirit \u2014 co-operative, semi-schizophrenic, greater than the sum of its parts \u2014 that is proper to rock bands and that is inaccessible to even the least self-involved Soundcloud rappers and bedroom artists.\n\nSimply put, Looking Through The Shade is the sound of a group of people playing music, together, in a room. Now we have live drums (Ned\u2019s brother Ben does the honours) and dopamine-releasing fuzzy guitars (Ned\u2019s other brother Alex contributes a solo) to go with the synths, the bass, and the voice. Now we have a 14-song-long thematic arc, carefully sequenced. Meanwhile, the lyrics are still reluctantly but rigorously self-aware, the choruses are still habit-formingly catchy, and the arrangements still carry not an ounce of excess fat. From the saturated distortion of the opener, \u201cThe Race\u201d (\u201cI wish I could look at your life and know it\u2019s mine\u201d), through the road-weary \u201c1001\u201d (\u201cI sang 1,000 songs / Didn\u2019t want to sing again\u201d) and the vox-and-bass-only Side B outlier \u201cThe News\u201d (\u201cI used to be original\u201d), listeners are invited to join the album\u2019s team of creators in wrestling with the defining psychological and social conditions of our age. And thus we discover that Glitterer invokes solipsism not to glorify or revel in it but to understand and rise above it, and that Glitterer knows that no individual can accomplish such a task alone, which is why Glitterer is a rock band and always has been, even when only one person\u2019s name was attached to it.\n\nGlitterer was born in August 2017 and now, with Looking Through The Shades, Gitterer has come of age.", "otherInfo": "ONSALE: FRIDAY 1/17 12PM ESTElsewhere is intended to be a safe space to enjoy music, art, expression, and free play.

Purchase & Stream at https://jeremyivey.ffm.to/thedream.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m riding on a booger in the sneeze of space. That\u2019s my bio,\u201d jokes singer/songwriter Jeremy Ivey. It\u2019s a tongue-in-cheek\u2014albeit oddly fitting\u2014description of the the Nashville-based performer, who has operated in the background for years, initially performing in bands like Secret Handshake and country-soul group Buffalo Clover with his wife, celebrated country-rock luminary Margo Price. But now, at 40, Ivey is ready to take a much-deserved step into the spotlight with a debut LP, The Dream and the Dreamer (Anti- Records).\n\n\u201cI want to prove that you can be in your 40s and be at the peak of your creativity,\u201d he says. \u201cNot a has-been, but as an \u2018is-being.\u2019\u201d\n\nRecorded in a \u201clittle bitty house studio\u201d in Nashville and produced by Price, the nine-song album hosts a collection of homespun, deeply introspective tracks. Ivey, who writes prolifically and ideally wants to release an album a year, cites everyone from the Beatles to Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and Bob Dylan as influences.\n\nPrice has also been an enormous supporter since the day they met when Ivey was 25 and she was 20. \u201cMy 20s were a mixed bag between learning to play, but also being told not to,\u201d he says, recalling an earlier relationship. \u201cI didn't go to college. I grew up very sheltered in a very religious home, and I wasn't allowed to listen to a lot of music. I was pretty green and na\u00efve.... And then when I met Margo, of course, she was a musician herself, and she was encouraging and telling me that I was good.\u201d\n\nUnlike his country-soul aesthetic in Buffalo Clover, which disbanded in 2013, Ivey\u2019s solo material is much more straightforward yet still travels through a wide spectrum of classic folk, gently frayed psychedelia, pop, and yes, even a bit of Southern rock and Americana. Piano-tinged opener \u201cDiamonds Back To Coal\u201d begins simply with open-chord strums but soon evolves into a multi-layered chorus of harmony and bouncy mid-tempo melody.\n\nBeneath its uptempo exterior, though, lies a deep preoccupation with the news cycle and problematic nature of Manifest Destiny. \u201cI wrote \u2018Diamonds Back To Coal\u2019 during a very frustrating week in America. It was the week that the Vegas shootings and the alt-right march happened,\u201d Ivey says. \u201cThe slogan \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 is an influence on the chorus. [Because] if anything, we're making the environment worse. When we came and infiltrated the Native Americans\u2019 way of living, we started reversing the beauty that this land had. It has to do with modern man being a trespasser.\u201d\n\nRegression is admittedly a difficult notion for Ivey, who moved away from his conservative Georgia home after high school and bounced around, primarily doing prep work in kitchens. The harmonica-accented \u201cStory of a Fish\u201d chronicles Ivey\u2019s personal diaspora, specifically relating to his upbringing. \u201cI\u2019m adopted, and I think that I always related with the story of salmon and how they\u2019re born,\u201d he reveals. \u201cThe idea of being born far from your home, you know? You were born here, but you gotta get elsewhere. That's the way I always felt. I always felt that I was born in the wrong place to the wrong people at the wrong time.\u201d\n\nEqually poetic is \u201cGreyhound,\u201d a twanging, Willie Nelson-esque cut that features Price on backing vocals and is an ode to, as Ivey calls it, \u201cthe lowest form of travel.\u201d \u201cIt's about one specific trip I took from Massachusetts down to Georgia,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cWe kind of treat [Greyhound bus passengers] like cattle. In a Greyhound, there's no hierarchy. Everyone's lower class. It\u2019s about seeing America, kind of living at that level of near-homelessness.\u201d\n\nThough he\u2019s far from anchorless these days, as a family man with one young son and a newborn, The Dream and the Dreamer is deeply indicative of Ivey\u2019s roving mind. Its piano-led title track, which closes out the record, seeks to recapture the idea of the American Dream.\n\n\u201cI wrote The Dream and the Dreamer in my sleep,\u201d comments Ivey. \u201c[Margo and I] were in Mexico. We both passed out kind of early and I woke up in the night and I had this dream about these two characters. One of them was a glowing green ball and the other one was a figure. The dream is a green ball and a figure was the dreamer\u2026 And then it turned out that it was a story is about America, and that the dream was the American dream. The dreamer was the exodus from England to find a new place.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ivey is invested in his own version of the American Dream\u2014specifically, offering up a melting pot of genres, ideas, and stories. \u201cThe best thing I could say is that I'm trying to fill the holes that I can see in the scene,\u201d he says. \u201cWhether it be Americana or country or rock or whatever. There's a certain type of song that isn't being written.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1272 Broadway,, Brooklyn, NY 11221", "Artist": "Carinae", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9076609.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.924884, 40.690956], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "Ham, Dirt Rock, Frog Lord, Wizard Core, Psychedelic Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "the broadway", "moreBioInfo": "Formed from the swirl and stellar dust of earlier psychedelic rock explosions, Carinae are aptly named for an unstable star that somehow survived a massive explosion.

Sui Zhen\u2019s third album, Losing, Linda, pairs her signature inquisitiveness with a surreal electronic pop that possesses a dreamlike quality: vivid, uncanny, and upon close examination, revealing of deep emotional and personal truths. It\u2019s an album that examines loss on multiple levels \u2014 from the death of our loved ones, to our widespread societal tendency to disappear within the ones and zeroes of modern life's tech-driven rush.\n\nLosing, Linda is the latest chapter in Melbourne artist Becky Sui Zhen's musical journey, which has, to date, included involvement in the Red Bull Music Academy, and spanned collaborations with dance and electronic artists like NO ZU, Retiree and Tornado Wallace (featuring on the producer\u2019s standout \u201cToday\u201d from 2017\u2019s Lonely Planet). She\u2019s also been commissioned for scoring and composition work in the ambient sphere, such as creating a \u201cspatially aware soundtrack\u201d to an exhibition at the Art Gallery of NSW, and providing the live score for Chris Marker's 1983 documentary Sans Soleil. This year alone will include performances at Dark Mofo, Meredith Festival, and Inner Varnika, plus collaborations with M\u00f8zaika and a track on an upcoming compilation for Munich\u2019s Public Possession label.\n\nSui Zhen released her debut album, Two Seas, in 2012. Beguiling and enchanting, the record proved to be an early indication of her fascinating melodic structures and compelling lyrical themes \u2014 but it was 2015's Secretly Susan that would be her breakthrough. Drawing on dub, lounge, and bossa nova influences, Secretly Susan presents as a synth-pop simulacrum, exploring digital life's myriad intersections with the real. \u201cBrilliant and uncanny,\u201d Pitchfork writes, the album \u201cradiates humor and charm.\u201d\n\nThe story of Sui Zhen\u2019s latest album, Losing, Linda, began in August of 2016, when she took up an artistic residency in Sapporo, a Japanese city on the northern island of Hokkaido. Sui Zhen originally came to the residency equipped with demos conceived in the wake of Secretly Susan \u2014 but real-life tragedy intervened, as her mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Sui Zhen\u2019s family insisted she continue with the residency as planned, but the experience proved indelible and she abandoned the demos to start anew.\n\nIn the process, a sense of overall mortality was unmistakably infused into the thematic structure of Losing, Linda. It\u2019s apparent across the lyrical sentiments of the swingy, bossa nova-laden \"I Could Be There,\u201d as Sui Zhen sings with straightforward zest, \"When you show me that you know all that's left to be/ That's the only way you knew to raise our family.\" It\u2019s a powerful sentiment turned askew, delivered with lightness over pitter-patter drums and rubbery bass lines; a characteristic duality of Sui Zhen\u2019s work. Elsewhere, \u201cMountain Song\u201d describes a traumatic and potentially fatal hiking expedition on Mount Asahidake \u2014 a memento mori, subtly and stealthily rendered with a bossa nova lilt and soft orchestration.\n\nAfter the residency came to a close, Sui Zhen's band members \u2014 instrumentalists Ashley Bundang (Zone Out, Hot Palms, Ciggie Witch) and Alec Marshall (Hot Palms, Emma Russack) \u2014 joined her in the Tokyo-adjacent city of Matsudo to track full-band demos for the material she'd written back in Sapporo. The new locale also inspired the gentle oscillations of \"Matsudo City Life,\" a throbbing synth-pop slice of effervescence that practically sounds like steam rising off of a nocturnal city street.\n\nSui Zhen eventually returned to Australia to be with her family, with work on the album becoming more sporadic as her mother's health declined, leading up to her passing in February 2018. \u201cLooking back it was pretty intense,\u201d Sui Zhen says. \u201cThere\u2019s moments that occurred that haunt me still. And some of those moments have been recreated in my video project \u2013 turned into art, memories of memories.\u201d\n\nAfter some time away from the album, Losing, Linda was completed near the end of 2018. \"I finally felt ready to return to the album,\" Sui Zhen explains. The resulting record pushes the fascinating sounds and ideas of Secretly Susan further and deeper, drawing equally from the plush realms of Sade, Japanese city pop, the early electronic music of the 1980s, and the mournful swing of Tracey Thorn's early work. Sui Zhen cites a range of forward-thinking artists from past and present as inspiration, from Lizzy Mercier and Laurie Anderson to Holly Herndon and Suzanne Ciani. The lush body-moving pop of \"Being a Woman,\" for example, finds Sui Zhen's personal experience colliding with her own self-investigation, as she sings about her relationship and struggles with femininity: \"When I grew up/ I thought I had to be/ Somebody's mother/ Or somebody's daughter.\" It's a striking example of the personal, political, and societal themes at the center of Losing, Linda, packaged as an infinitely listenable pop song.\n\nMuch as Secretly Susan was constructed around a titular character, on Losing, Linda Sui Zhen takes the theoretical form of \"Linda,\" a digital doppelga\u0308nger and avatar invoking the e-learning channel Lynda and its founder Lynda Weinman, as well as the humanoid robot BINA48. The character of Linda is personified on the album's cover by choreographer and colleague Megan Payne, whose literal embodiment of Linda interrogates the disembodiment of online life, and calls into question the possibility of death in the digital age. \"It\u2019s an album about missing people after they are gone and trying to pre-empt loss \u2014 not only loss of life, but memory and information,\" Sui Zhen explains. \"I see it mirrored in our increasing need for data storage. Why are we collecting and documenting so much, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a simple ghost story about being haunted by our other versions and our past selves,\u201d she continues. \u201cOur mothers, fathers, ancestors \u2014 that possibility that another may exist, intangible in the physical realm, but ever present in memory, so long as memory functions.\"\n\nThe album will also be accompanied by a digital ecosystem, aiming to create an online world for listeners where they can interact in real time with Linda. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere between a ghost, a memory, and a digital assistant\" Sui Zhen explains. In other words, a perfect evocation of what Losing, Linda represents thematically and musically: a trip through the real and the uncanny. Losing, Linda is a lovingly personal and humanistic document of our ever-changing world, the things we lose along the way, and the insights we gain from loss itself.", "otherInfo": "Banoffee & Sui Zhen co-headline @ The Dance"}, {"Address": "30 N Van Brunt St, Englewood, NJ 07631", "Artist": "John Mayall", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9619629.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.974796, 40.89516], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Bergen Performing Arts Center", "moreBioInfo": "John Mayall (born November 29, 1933) is a pioneering English blues singer, songwriter, guitarist, keyboard player and harmonica player.\n\nJohn Mayall's most well-know band is called John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers.

Peter Green, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, and Mick Taylor.\n\nJohn Mayall stands out for several reasons - his standing up for the blues, while experimenting with different approaches, his ability to attract the best of musicians; and perhaps most notably his willingness to work with musicians who far outshine him in sheer ability.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "25 Avenue A, New York City, NY 10009", "Artist": "Lonely Pirate Committee", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.985959, 40.722966], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Berlin Under A", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Dolly Spartans with Lonely Pirate Committee and Jamie-Lee Dimes at Berlin!"}, {"Address": "8809 River Rd, North Bergen, NJ 07047", "Artist": "FLAMENCOflavor", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8315112.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.993595, 40.803983], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "Latin, Flamenco, Urban", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Sabor Latin Bistro", "moreBioInfo": "FLAMENCOflavor is a percussive dance and music group that fuses latin urban music with sensual latin flamenco choreography.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee.

He also goes by the aliases Mighty Mos Def, The Freaky Night Watchman, Boogie Man, Black Dante, A White Man's Favorite Rapper and Pretty Flaco.\n\nRap career:\n\nMos Def began his performing career on the television show The Cosby Mysteries in 1994. In 1994, Mos also began his music career, forming the short-lived group Urban Thermo Dynamics with his younger brother DCQ and his younger sister Ces. Despite being signed to Payday Records, the group only released two singles and the group's debut album, Manifest Destiny, did not see the light of day until 2004 when released through Illson Media. In 1996 he emerged as a solo artist, working with De La Soul and da Bush Babees before releasing his own first single, \"Universal Magnetic\" which was a huge underground hit. After signing with Rawkus Records, he and Talib Kweli released a full length album under the band name Black Star, entitled Black Star. It was released in 1998, with Hi-Tek producing most of the tracks. Mos Def released his solo debut, Black on Both Sides, in 1999. Filled with tracks raving about his hometown, Brooklyn and his love for Hip-Hop, Black on Both Sides also deals with racial profiling of Black men in America, with the track Mr N**ga. Mos Def was also featured on Rawkus' influential The Lyricist Lounge and Soundbombing series compilations. After the collapse of Rawkus, Def along with Kweli signed on to Interscope/Geffen Records, who released his second album The New Danger in 2004. In early 2005 Mos Def was rumored to join Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella record label, but this was later denied by the artist himself claiming \"Jay-Z and Roc-A-Fella would never allow me to release songs I plan on putting out there. I ain't down with that commercial non-sense. I'm about to deal with the fake with my next album, from George Bush to 50 Cent.\" But, after making that comment, Mos Def was featured rapping on a SUV commercial, endorsing the GMC Denali. Mos Def is projected to release his last solo album on Geffen Records, The Undeniable Free Flaco in early 2006.\n\nImpact on hip-hop\n\nThe artistic boundaries of hip-hop and rap music had been redefined by artists such as Brand Nubian, De La Soul, and Public Enemy, whose music was more thematically sophisticated and socially conscious than that of their predecessors. By the early 1990s however, this brand of rap had been eclipsed in popularity by gangsta rap. Socially aware rap music (alternative hip hop) has experienced something of a renaissance in the late 1990s and now the 2000s, in part due to artists such as Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Common, The Roots and others. \"Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are \u2026 Blackstar\" Mos Def's collaboration with Talib Kweli was released during the aftermath of the deaths of 2pac and The Notorious B.I.G. sparking a rebirth of \"aware\" and \"intelligent\" hip-hop. Def's music often references his Islamic faith and his contention that black artists receive little credit for their role in the birth of rock and roll music.\n\nOn Mos Def's 2004 album The New Danger, the rapper took his penchant for experimentation to a new level. Most of the songs were more hip-hop flavored stylings of Blues and Rock, with few actual raps thrown in. This threw off fans who were expecting another full-blown rap album. The New Danger also featured the controversial song \"The Rape Over\", a parody of Jay-Z's The Blueprint hit \"The Takeover\":\n\nold white men is runnin this rap shit\ncorporate forces runnin this rap shit\nsome tall israeli is runnin this rap shit\nwe poke out our asses for a chance to cash in\ncocaine, is runnin this rap shit\n'dro, 'yac and e-pills is runnin this rap shit...\nmtv is runnin this rap shit\nviacom is runnin this rap shit\naol and time warner runnin this rap shit...\nquasi-homosexuals is runnin this rap shit\n\nThe lyrics would seem to have chafed with higher-placed executives, who made Mos take the song off of later releases of the album, supposedly for \"sample clearance issues\".\n\nIn September 2005, Mos Def released the single \"Katrina Clap\" (utilizing the instrumental for Juvenile's \"Nolia Clap\"), a critical reaction to the lack of response by the Bush administration to the Hurricane Katrina disaster. He probably chose the \"Nolia Clap\" instrumental because the rapper Juvenile hails from New Orleans, and the song was a hit in the New Orleans area before the hurricane.\n\nMos Def also collaborated with Kanye West on West's track named \"two words\" and appeared in the music video.\n\nActing career\nMos Def in blackface\nEnlarge\nMos Def in blackface\n\nThe first years of the 2000s have established Mos Def as a notable actor. His performances in Brown Sugar, Monster's Ball, and the HBO made-for-TV film Something The Lord Made have been particularly acclaimed by critics. Having been nominated for several awards, Mos finally broke through, winning Best Actor, Independent Movie at the 2005 Black Reel Awards for his portrayal of Sgt. Lucas in The Woodsman. He also landed the role of Ford Prefect in the long-awaited 2005 movie adaption of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Notably, in 2002 he played the role of Booth in Suzan-Lori Parks' Topdog/Underdog, a Tony-nominated and Pulitzer-winning Broadway play. He has also been a musical guest and participated in many skits on Comedy Central's Chappelle's Show.\n\nIn 2004, he hosted the MOBO awards in London, after the original presenter, Pharrell Williams pulled out at the last minute.\n\nHe has been the host of the award-winning spoken word show Def Poetry Jam since its inception. The show's fifth season aired in 2005.\n\nDiscography\n\n* 1998 Black Star (released with Talib Kweli under the name Black Star) Priority Records\n* 1999 Black on Both Sides Rawkus Records\n* 2004 The New Danger Geffen\no nominated for Best Urban/Alternative\nPerformance, 47th Annual Grammy Awards\n* 2006 True Magic\n\nSelected Filmography\n* Be Kind Rewind (2008)\n* Talladega Nights (2006) (a quick cameo)\n* Dreamgirls (2006)\n* Bobby (2006)\n* The Brazilian Job (2006) (pre-production)\n* 16 Blocks (2006)\n* The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005).\n* Lackawanna Blues (2005)\n* Something the Lord Made (2004)\no nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie, 56th Annual Emmy Awards\no nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television, 62nd Annual Golden Globe Awards\n* Chapelle Show (? year) - Black Delegation Rep for Racial Draft\n* The Woodsman (2004)\n* The Italian Job (2003)\n* Brown Sugar (2002)\n* Civil Brand (2002)\n* Showtime (2002)\n* Monster's Ball (2001)\n* Carmen: A Hip Hopera (2001)\n* Bamboozled (2000)\n* Where's Marlowe?

Her theatrical style and soaring vocals immediately gave the songs their identity and she joined the band fulltime, inspiring the name and the logo of the band Just Fabulous.\n\nThen, in a chance encounter at an East Village dive bar, they met Anna who joined the band to play bass. With the quartet now in place, they began playing at New York venues such as The Delancy, Pianos, The Deep End, Cobra Club, The Gutter, Our Wicked Lady, C'mon Everybody and The Bitter End. After several great shows, Just Fabulous recorded their first 4 song EP at Thunderdome Studio with Duane Lauginiger and mastered by Ryan Schwabe, entitled Don't You Know?\n\nShortly after, Anna moved from New York so the band asked Alanna to join up and play bass. Her high energy and Memphis blues musical background was a perfect fit for the band, picking up where they left off. With several new songs added to their repertoire Just Fabulous is doing what they love most, playing live shows while also planning to record an upcoming new single and B side as well as a full length LP at the end of the year.

Blues Music Magazine calls them \u201cthe best little big band in the blues.\u201d On record and on stage, Roomful of Blues\u2014led by master guitarist Chris Vachon for the past 22 years\u2014continues to deliver its bone-shaking mix of original songs and carefully chosen covers ranging from jump, swing and proto rock \u2018n\u2019 roll to funky, contemporary blues. Their impeccable musicianship and larger-than-life vocals have earned Roomful of Blues five Grammy Award nominations and a slew of other accolades, including seven Blues Music Awards. Twice, the prestigious DownBeat International Critics\u2019 Poll has selected them as Best Blues Band. And now, even after 18 previous releases and thousands of live shows, Roomful of Blues continues to evolve, as they return with In A Roomful Of Blues, their first new studio album since 2011.\n\nIn A Roomful Of Blues, the band\u2019s sixth release on Alligator Records, was produced by Vachon and features 13 wide-ranging songs, including nine band-composed originals\u2014more than on any previous Roomful album. Eight songs were written or co-written by Vachon (including one authored with vocalist Phil Pemberton) plus one each by sax player Alek Razdan and keyboardist Rusty Scott. From the rocking We\u2019d Have A Love Sublime to the funkified You Move Me to the closing-time lament She Quit Me Again to the up-to-the-minute Phone Zombies, In A Roomful Of Blues is filled with soaring blues, zydeco twists, late-night ballads, Latin-tinged funk and a touch of vintage, fifth-gear rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\n\nRoomful of Blues guitarist Chris Vachon first joined Roomful in 1990, and has been leading the band since 1998. Guitar Player says Vachon\u2019s guitar playing \u201cburns with explosive solos and a delightfully greasy sense of rhythm.\u201d The band has maintained its signature sound through great musicianship and a stellar horn section\u2014featuring tenor and alto saxophonist Rich Lataille, who first joined the band in 1970. Lataille\u2019s masterful playing can evoke either the fat-toned, honking sax of the glory days of early rock or the cool elegance of big band swing jazz.\n\nWhile Roomful of Blues has always been one of the tightest, most joyful blues ensembles in the world, they have never sounded fresher or stronger than with the current line-up. Along with Vachon and Lataille, the band includes vocalist Phil Pemberton, baritone and tenor saxophonist Alek Razdan, trumpeter Carl \u201cGeerz\u201d Gerhard, bassist John Turner, drummer Chris Anzalone and keyboardist Rusty Scott.\n\nThe long and winding road which leads to the Roomful of Blues of today can be followed all the way back to 1967 when a group of southern Rhode Island teenagers with a shared passion for the blues formed a straight-ahead Chicago-style electric blues band to explore the music of their heroes. They added a horn section (including Rich Lataille) in 1970 and released their self-titled debut album in 1977 on Island Records (reissued on Hyena Records), which brought them to the attention of fans and critics from coast to coast.\n\nRecording for Rounder Records\u2019 Bullseye Blues and Varrick labels between 1980 and 2001, the band cut nine albums that won them international fame and major rock radio airplay. They\u2019ve gigged with stars ranging from bluesmen B.B. King, Otis Rush and Stevie Ray Vaughan to rockers Eric Clapton and Carlos Santana. The band has performed in cities from coast to coast, and traveled abroad to 22 countries including Lebanon, Poland, Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Switzerland, Turkey and Russia.\n\nSince Roomful joined the Alligator Records family in 2003, their popularity has continued to increase. Their first Alligator CD was the Grammy-nominated That\u2019s Right! in 2003, followed by Standing Room Only in 2005, Raisin\u2019 A Ruckus in 2008, Hook, Line & Sinker in 2010 and 45 Live in 2013. All five albums received massive amounts of critical and popular praise and kept old and new fans lining up to see them perform. The New Yorker says the band brings \u201cthunderous performances that get feet stomping and hands clapping.\u201d\n\nWith In A Roomful Of Blues, the band has once again captured all of their frenetic energy and musical power in the studio. Roomful of Blues will be hitting the road and bringing the new material to their fans around the world, proving without doubt that this is a band built to stand the test of time. While keenly aware of the group\u2019s half century of history, Vachon is quick to note, however, that they are constantly looking forward. \u201cWe always keep things fresh and we keep the excitement level high. Playing this music is an immense amount of fun for us,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just as much fun for our audience.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "635 Sackett Street, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "Taylor Ashton", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8299666.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983337, 40.678441], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "R&b, Songwriter, Folk, Banjo, Rock", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "littlefield", "moreBioInfo": "Taylor Ashton is a Canadian songwriter and singer living in Brooklyn, New York, who is influenced by the ways that pop, traditional folk, and R&B can live together on the clawhammer banjo", "otherInfo": "NYC record release show for the Canadian singer-songwriter.

Built around the sweet and sour mix of vocalists Lisa Walker and Chuck Cleaver, Wussy came together in 2001 when the two singers and songwriters casually performed together at an event in their native Cincinnati, Ohio, and soon the duo expanded into a full band. In 2005, Wussy released their debut album, Funeral Dress, and while they toured and recorded at a casual pace, between excellent reviews and positive word of mouth, albums like 2009's Wussy, 2011's Strawberry, and 2014's Attica! found an audience as the band began to edge out of the indie rock underground towards the boundaries of mainstream recognition.\n\nWussy were formed by guitarist and singer Chuck Cleaver, who had enjoyed modest success in the '90s as a member of the Cincinnati-based band the Ass Ponys. After releasing the album Lohio in 2001, Cleaver decided to break up the band, believing he'd said all he had to say within their format. Not long after, Cleaver was asked to perform at a local music awards event, and he was nervous about appearing on stage alone; Lisa Walker, a fellow Cincinnati singer and songwriter, volunteered to perform with Cleaver, and they were pleased enough with the results that they continued working together. Adopting the name Wussy, Cleaver and Walker expanded the duo into a full band in 2002 with the addition of bassist Mark Messerly and drummer Dawn Burman. The group delivered its first album in 2005, Funeral Dress, which was released by Shake-It Records, an independent offshoot of a Cincinnati record shop. The celebrated rock critic Robert Christgau gave Funeral Dress an A rating in his column in The Village Voice, and became one of Wussy's most outspoken champions, in 2012 declaring \"Wussy have been the best band in America since they released the first of their five superb albums in 2005.\"\n\nIn 2009, around the time Wussy released their self-titled third album, Dawn Burman left the group, and Joe Klug became their new drummer. After the release of Strawberry in 2011, the group had become popular enough to stage short tours of the East Coast as well as playing regularly in the Midwest, and in 2012 they headed to the West Coast for the first time, as well as opening for the Afghan Whigs on their well-received reunion tour. (Whigs bassist John Curley also produced several albums for Wussy.) By this time, Wussy had grown into a quintet with former Ass Ponys guitarist John Erhardt joining in on pedal steel and keyboards. In 2014, Wussy released Attica!, their fifth studio album and one of their best-reviewed projects to date, which Christgau awarded a rare A+ rating, while Spin Magazine named it one of the 50 best albums of the year. It also became Wussy's first album to be released in the U.K., when Damnably picked it up for British distribution. In 2016, Wussy returned to action with the album Forever Sounds. For 2018's What Heaven Is Like, for the first time Wussy included two covers (\"Aliens in Our Midst,\" originally recorded by the Twinkeyz, and \"Oblivion,\" written by Kath Bloom) alongside eight fresh original songs. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "otherInfo": "Tickets on Sale Fri Jan 10\n\nDoors @ 8 / Show @ 9\nAdvance Tickets: $15"}, {"Address": "3898 Broadway, New York, NY 10032", "Artist": "Jamile Staevie Ayres", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9238883.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.93911, 40.83765], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "Brazilian Music, Jazz", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Penny Jo's", "moreBioInfo": "Emerging Jazz vocalist Jamile is a recent graduate of the inaugural Master's of Jazz Studies class at City College of New York.

Like Phish, Runaway Gin will never play the same show or jam the same way twice making every show a unique experience and every moment pure artistic creation.\n\nMEMBER BIOS:\nAndy Greenberg - guitar, vocals\n\nOriginally from Florence, SC, Andy began playing piano at the age of 5, receiving classical instruction and earning top ratings in the National Piano Guild. At the age of 12 he learned his first chord on the guitar and taught himself to play by ear. Andy started listening to Phish in 1992 while at summer camp. The first song he heard was \"Sparkle\" and it reminded him of one of his favorite bands at that time: They Might Be Giants. He proceeded to dive head first into the album Rift and soon Phish's whole catalog often stopping to figure out songs on both piano and guitar to satisfy his vehement musical curiosity. Eventually Phish would ride to the top of Andy's list of favorite bands a spot reserved for the likes of the Beatles and Led Zeppelin.\n\nHis first Phish show was a gift from his parents for his 15th Birthday- 7 days before his birthday:\n\nSaturday, 11/18/1995\nNorth Charleston Coliseum, North Charleston, SC\n\nSet 1: Dinner and a Movie > Bouncing Around the Room > Reba, Lawn Boy, Punch You In the Eye > Slave to the Traffic Light, I'm Blue, I'm Lonesome[1], Sample in a Jar\n\nSet 2: AC/DC Bag > Sparkle > Free, I'm So Tired, You Enjoy Myself, Contact > Big Black Furry Creature from Mars, Acoustic Army, Big Black Furry Creature from Mars, Cavern\n\nEncore: Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home?[2]\n\n[1] Acoustic.\n[2] Dr. Jack McConnell on vocals.\n\nTeases:\n\u00b7 Brick House jam in You Enjoy Myself\nSince 1995 Andy has been to well over 100 shows.

There's always a bigger Phish!\n\nBobby Hogg - bass, vocals\n\nBobby first discovered Phish as a tween in the early 90's when he stumbled across a tape of 4/16/92 Anaconda Theatre in his big sisters music collection. This exotic music was rather foreign to his underdeveloped ear, and seemed absurdly quirky at first taste. Upon playing the tape for his little brother, the two decided that they did in fact enjoy the sounds emanating from their tape deck, and were eager to keep listening. It is safe to say that over the next few years Bobby suffered irreversible ear damage whilst donning his headphones and cranking his Sony Walkman to full volume, rocking out to the music of Phish late into the night.\n\nBobby's first show was:\n\n12/30/1996\nFleetCenter, Boston, MA\n\nSet 1: Ya Mar, The Sloth, Llama, Gumbo, Reba[1], Talk[2], Funky B%@#$[3], Theme From the Bottom > Good Times Bad Times\n\nSet 2: Timber (Jerry) > Uncle Pen, AC/DC Bag, Guyute, Tweezer -> Lifeboy > Scent of a Mule[4], Slave to the Traffic Light\n\nEncore: Possum\n\n[1] No whistling.\n[2] Trey on acoustic guitar.\n[3] P.A. cut out.\n[4] Page/Mike Mule Duel and Steven Wright ringing a desk bell three times.\n\nSince that show Bobby has seen Phish around 50 times, and is eagerly anticipating many more shows to come!\n\nJohn Fitzgerald - keyboards, vocals\n\nJohn began his musical career at the age of fifteen playing shows in local Jersey Shore venues as a solo artist and with a variety of musical acts. He went on to earn his Bachelor's of Music from James Madison University.

I played everything from Grateful Dead tributes (Cosmic Charlie), Funk (The Secrets), and even some Bluegrass (Acoustic Syndicate).\n\nJohn focuses on the continual development of the craft and pursuit of his musical vision. \u201cCreating music is the catalyst for conjuring emotion. It is paramount. Music has the ability to tweak emotions and take a listener to other realms.

After enjoying years of traditional music business success, they have spent the last 10 years methodically moving away from the mainstream approach that put them on the map, opting to carefully steer their fans in a new direction, towards their new independent alternative electro rock project Julien-K \u2013 which sounds more at home with the likes of modern acts such as M83, The Kills, LCD Soundsystem, The Naked and Famous, Empire of the Sun, and even the Black Keys (see Derakh's sleazy electro-blues guitar playing on \"We're Here With You\").\n\n2009 saw the long-awaited release of their debut album Death to Analog, which included long-time collaborators Anthony \u201cFu\u201d Valcic and Brandon Belsky, with Belsky and drummer Elias Andra rounding out the live show. After Belsky and Andra\u2019s 2010 departure, Julien-K\u2019s studio line-up solidified as the trio of Derakh, Shuck and Valcic, while collaborations with electronic music innovators such as Bryan Black (Motor, Black Asteroid), Sharooz, Z-Listers, Vandal, and others revved up the writing phase of 2012\u2019s sophomore We\u2019re Here With You. The touring cycle that followed saw the band hit the south-west US and Europe \u2013 with festivals as far and wide as Hildesheim (Germany), Utrecht (Netherlands), and Vladivostok (Russia) \u2013 and many sold-out shows in their native LA.\n\nIn July 2014, Julien-K launched their third album cycle with a 3-song prelude to an ambitious double concept album / esthetic movement that they called \"California Noir.\" The CA_Noir spirit was given a visual representation in November 2014 with the release of the haunting video for the title track, showcasing the struggle to discover the meaning of the Californian dream.\n\nThe concept continued in 2015 and 2016 with two wildly successful Indiegogo crowdfunding campaigns and subsequent (self-)releases of the two chapters California Noir: Analog Beaches and Digital Cities and California Noir: Nightlife in Neon, which established the band as musical innovators, digital pioneers, and fully independent music entrepreneurs shaking up the underground scene.\n\nIn 2017, the band released Time Capsule: A Future Retrospective, a 4 disk, 64 song mega-package aimed at the band\u2019s core fanbase, which consisted of unreleased songs, b-sides, never heard before remixes, and live versions of some of their biggest hits.\n\nJulien-K has become a crowdfunding giant, with all 4 of their campaigns hitting and holding the #1 Indiegogo chart position for the duration of the campaigns.\n\nAfter a successful summer 2017 tour alongside PIG and Ghostfeeder, 2018 will see the band hit the stages around the world again on headline tours, as well as in support of their friends Bush, Stone Temple Pilots and The Cult. Being the workaholics that they are, Ryan, Amir and Fu are also already working on a new album, Harmonic Disruptor (this time with the addition of new collaborators Bidi Cobra and Alex Gonzales), that will see the band go back to their roots, while including some new aural surprises at the same time.

Later they incorporated more jazz and fusion elements into their music. They released four albums before disbanding in order to pursue other musical directions in 1994.\n\nPestilence started in the Netherlands in the mid 1986 as a thrash metal band. The lineup, consisting of Patrick Mameli (guitar, vocals), Randy Meinhard (guitar), and Marco Foddis (drums), recorded two demos before gaining the attention of Roadrunner Records. After the first demo, Martin van Drunen (bass, vocals) joined them. These two demos - Dysentery (1986) and The Penance (1987) - are raw, sounding mostly like a cross between Possessed and Schizophrenia-era Sepultura. After signing to Roadrunner Records, Pestilence released their debut album titled Malleus Maleficarum in 1988, further refining their approach to thrash metal. The new material was tighter and more focused than the demos. Shortly thereafter, guitarist Randy Meinhard left the band to pursue other musical goals in a new band named Sacrosanct.\n\nMeanwhile, Pestilence recruited a new guitar player by the name of Patrick Uterwijk. In 1989, the band released their second album Consuming Impulse, which was a turn toward to death metal. From a musical standpoint, things became heavier and more haunting. Vocally, Martin van Drunen moved away from cleaner vocals in favour of a more acidic growl. With its release, Pestilence gained international attention, highly regarded worldwide by death metal fans. But before a follow-up album was released, the lineup changed once again; vocalist and bassist Martin van Drunen departed to front Asphyx.\n\nPestilence were faced again with the challenge of replacing a member, being without a vocalist and bassist. So while recording their third album Testimony Of The Ancients (1991), they enlisted bassist Tony Choy, who at the time was playing with the technical death metal band Cynic and Patrick Mameli took over the vocal duties. With this lineup, they released the album Testimony Of The Ancients. The new material was not as abrasive as the previous albums, but the band's musicianship has obviously grown and the album had the best production job of the band's catalogue.\n\nHowever, Tony Choy was never a permanent member, and ended up going back to Florida to eventually play with Atheist. In the meantime, Pestilence enlisted the talents of Jeroen Paul Thesseling.\n\nOver the years, the Pestilence members were getting into other forms of music, primarily jazz fusion which, the band wanted to pair with metal. The band's fourth and final album, Spheres was released in 1993. With every album, Pestilence went through some kind of a change and Spheres was no exception. Pestilence mixed jazz fusion elements into their death metal style, and used guitar synths throughout the album.\n\nPestilence's popularity had risen with the release of each album, but unfortunately, so did tensions between the members. So after a short period of time, the band unanimously decided to split up, feeling they had reached their creative climax.\n\nIn 1994, Roadrunner released one last CD from Pestilence: a best-of titled Mind Reflections, containing tracks from all four albums, plus the rare song \"Hatred Within\" (originally released on the Teutonic Invasion Part II compilation) and six unreleased live tracks recorded in at the Dynamo Open Air Festival in 1992. In 1998, Displeased Records re-released the debut album Malleus Maleficarum (which was originally never officially released in Europe), and included both demo recordings from 1986 and 1987.\n\nIn 2006, Metal War Productions, working with Martin van Drunen, released Chronicles of the Scourge, containing two concert recordings and one unreleased bonus track. The two concerts are Live \"Kix Festival\" - Veghel, Holland (June 24, 1989) and Live Bochum, Germany (November 18, 1988). A bonus \"rehearsal disc\" was released with the first 1000 copies.\n\nPESTILENCE IS BACK!!! There is new line up: founder Patrick Mameli (vocals, guitar), well known Tony Choy (bass) and drummer Peter Wildoer (Darkane, Non-Human Level and others). Patrick is working on new great songs which style he describes as modern fusion of \"Testimony...\" and \"Spheres\", but even more technical (!!!) and more brutal.

HR and his brother, Earl, together with friends Gary \"Dr. Know\" Miller and Darryl Jenifer, began as Mind Power, a jazz fusion band, then formed Bad Brains in 1979. With unprecedented speed and precision, Bad Brains took the Washington, DC music scene by storm and quickly became the most influential band in American punk history. They created music that was about closing the racial divide and maintaining a positive mental attitude (PMA). This concept of PMA continues to inspire fans to this day.\n\nEarly in his career, after seeing Bob Marley in concert, HR became interested in reggae and the Rastafarian movement. These pursuits transformed him and he began to focus more on the spiritual nature of reggae than the fast lifestyle of the punk scene. Deeply inspired, in 1984 he formed the Human Rights band with his brother.\n\nHaving formed a friendship with his mentor, musician Ras Michael, a high priest of the Rastafarian movement, HR was baptized in the late 1980's and named Ras Hailu Gabriel Joseph I. Many people in his life began calling him \"Joseph\" or \"Joe\" at this time.\n\nCurrently, HR performs with Philadelphia musicians Ezekiel Zagar (original McRad), Josh Freshy, and Wesley Rast as HR & Human Rights: The New Gospel. The band has a refined yet organic energy that hasn't been felt since the early days of Human Rights.\n\nIn addition to working on a new solo album with Human Rights, HR has recently* been in the studio with Ty Dolla $ign and Vic Mensa, once again making music history.\n\nTo learn more, please see the documentary film \"Finding Joseph I\" and its companion book \"Finding Joseph I: An Oral History of H.R.

Even so, the prevailing assumption is that musicians working under this broad umbrella must be inspired by concepts equally as electrified as their equipment. Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith has demonstrated in her still-blooming discography that this notion couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, and that more often than not, rich worlds of synthesized sound are born from deep reverence of the natural world. Smith (who by no coincidence, cites naturalist David Attenborough as a contemporary muse) has embodied such an appreciation on The Kid in as direct and sincere a way as possible by sonically charting the phases of life itself. The album, which punctually follows up her 2016 breakthrough EARS, chronicles four defining cognitive and emotional stages of the human lifespan across four sides of a double LP.\n\nThe first side takes us through the confused astonishment of a newborn, unaware of itself, existing in an unwitting nirvana. Smith\u2019s music has always woven a youthful thread befitting of the aforementioned subject. Here she articulates it in signature fashion on the track \u201cAn Intention,\u201d which serves not only as a soaring spire on The Kid, but on her entire output. There is playfulness here, but it's elevated by an undertone of gravity into something compelling and majestic that is fast becoming Smith\u2019s watermark. The emotional focus of side two is the vital but underreported moment in early youth when we cross the threshold into self awareness. The subject is profound enough to fill an entire album, but rarely makes its way into a single track, indicating Smith\u2019s ambition to broach subtler and deeper subjects than the average composer. This side offers up another highlight in the form of \u201cIn The World But Not Of The World\u201d which serves its subject well with epiphanic, climbing strings and decidedly noisy textures over a near-Bollywood low end pulse.\n\nSide three emphasizes a feeling of being confirmed enough in one\u2019s own identity to begin giving back to the formative forces of one\u2019s upbringing, which is arguably the duty that all great artists aim to fulfill. This side ends with the exploratory album cut \u201cWho I Am & Why I Am Where I Am\u201d recorded in a single take without overdubs on the rare EMS Synthi 100 synthesizer. This humble piece of sound design serves as a contrast to side four\u2019s verdant orchestral moments, all written and arranged for the EU-based Stargaze quartet by Smith herself. This final side represents a return to pure being, the kind of wisdom and peace that eludes most of us until the autumn of life. On \u201cTo Feel Your Best\u201d this concept is voiced in the bittersweet refrain \u201cone day I\u2019ll wake up and you won\u2019t be there\u201d which Smith intended to be a grateful acknowledgement of life rather than a melancholy resentment of loss. The song has both effects depending on the mood of the listener, and both interpretations are equally moving.\n\nKaitlyn Aurelia Smith belongs to an ilk of modern musicians who are defined by their commitment to creating experiential albums despite the singles-oriented habits of modern listeners, and here she represents her kind proudly. The subjects on The Kid are not simple to convey, and yet through both emotional tone and lyrical content, Smith does just that. There is a similar gravity to both birth and death, and rarely is that correlation as accurately and enthusiastically mapped as it is here. As Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith explores her existence through music, she guides us in gleefully contemplating our own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "599 Johnson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Stello", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.923155, 40.709325], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Elsewhere - Zone One", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "All live shows on Fridays and Saturdays end promptly at 10PM while all live shows Sunday through Thursday end at 11PM unless noted otherwise.

The band features Avi Salloway (Bombino/Hey Mama/Avi & Celia) joined by an inspired cast of singular artists who have performed across five continents including concerts at the Coachella Music & Arts Festival, Newport Folk Festival, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Montreal Jazz Fest, Carnegie Hall, and Lincoln Center. From 2013-16, Salloway toured the globe with Bombino, the Tuareg guitar hero from Niger, Africa. While on the journey and since returning, Salloway wrote the material on the band\u2019s new album, Strike the Match (Sand & Gold Records, released 9.7.18).\n\nSalloway has been bringing these songs to life with the Wylder Family, a group of dear friends and musical kindred spirits. In between shows, the band spent ten days recording at Eyeland Studio in the Columbus Theatre, home of The Low Anthem. The music weaves together American folk and rock with sensibilities from the Sahara Desert: think Andrew Bird meets Ali Farka Toure, Pete Seeger and Talking Heads. Strike the Match expands on American musical traditions, building a bridge to their African roots and coloring the songs with experimental art-rock textures: gilded string lines, synthesizers, and angular guitars. Mother Earth is at its center, surrounded by stories of love, conflict, change and dreams.\n\nSalloway shares, \u201cThis album is a reflection of the world we\u2019ve been born into, one filled with supernatural beauty and incomprehensible struggle. My social and environmental activism work has taken me to territories that have been colonized and occupied in the Middle East, North and West Africa, the South Pacific and Standing Rock, here at home. I have experienced the creative spirit rise up in the face of darkness and adversity and it is the most life-affirming feeling I have witnessed. This record has become the artifact at the intersection of these moving events in my life.\u201d\n\nOn Strike the Match, Billy Wylder grapples with some of the most pressing questions of our time. How can we reorient ourselves to nature as a source of strength for resistance to the forces that seek to destroy and profit from it? How can we use music to move beyond capitalism and nationalism to a global society for the benefit of the earth and all living beings? How can we reconcile our painful history with hope and optimism for the future? The album calls the listener to engage with these questions and illuminates the path towards participating in the creation of a more just and sustainable world.\n\nThe band is named after Salloway\u2019s grandmother, Wilma \u201cBillie\u201d Hotaling.\u201d She was a prolific painter, author, musician, and educator. Billie wrote Count the Stars Through the Cracks, a harrowing historical fiction novel about a young brother and sister\u2019s escape from the Antebellum South along the Underground Railroad. Billie\u2019s writing was raw and fearless and her book delivered a powerful narrative about America\u2019s hard truths and the long journey to freedom. \u201cMy grandma Billie led by example, showing me what creativity looks like and how critical art can be as a form of love and resistance. She is part of me and part of the Wylder family,\u201d Salloway reflects.\n\nBilly Wylder hit the road this summer and fall to celebrate the release of Strike the Match. The band has been building their family of fans and friends from the ground up. In 2011, Salloway founded the Moonshine Music Series, a surreal concert and community experience that takes place on family run farms in Massachusetts and Vermont. The Moonshine is a unique gathering and lively opportunity for Wylder fans to come together, break bread, make art, dance and connect with the land and sustainable local food sources. Billy Wylder host the Moonshine Music Festival at Earth Sky Time Farm in Manchester, VT on Sept. 2 and the Harvest Moonshine Music Festival in Wrentham, MA on Sept. 22.\n\n\u201cRaised in a progressive home and taught to play by Pete and John Seeger, activism is a constant in Avi Salloway\u2019s life and art. During the past decade, he\u2019s performed in world crisis spots, from the Palestinian territories to Standing Rock, always delivering a message of music\u2019s power to heal and bring change.\u201d \u2013The Hippo\n\n\"Engaging mash-up of various strains of American folk and rock and Tuareg desert blues.\" \u2013The Boston Globe", "otherInfo": "We have had to cancel the March 27 show at the Upstream Gallery due to covid-19.

The band was officially formed in 1999, known at that time as Imagica. The band consists of Chibi (vocals), Rainbow (guitars and programming), Michael Falcore (guitars), Owen (keyboards), O.E. (previously drums, now bass), and Rhim (drums).\n\nTheir sound is mostly a fusion of retro electronica and dynamic contemporary songwriting. Elements of children's fiction and adult fantasy are combined with twisting distortion and euphoric melody to create a unique and original sound dubbed \"post-retro\". This sound is also affiliated with \"synth rock\" a rising genre influenced by elements 80's synthpop, industrial, and gothic rock.\n\nThe group originated in London, Ontario under the name Imagica. The group's original line-up consisted of: Chibi, Rainbow, Michael Falcore, and Aslan Osiris (bass). Dank played live keyboards and O.E. joined the group on live drums. A seven-song limited edition demo was released.\n\nIn 2001, Dank left the group, and the others relocated from London to Toronto, Ontario, to begin recording. There, they recorded another limited edition demo, this time with five songs.\n\nShortly thereafter, the band adopted the name The Birthday Massacre. In July of 2002, The Birthday Massacre independently released a limited edition CD entitled \"Nothing and Nowhere\". In 2003, Adm joined the band on live keyboards and Rhim on drums. On July 20, 2004, The Birthday Massacre released a nine song EP entitled \"Violet\" and at the end of the year, re-released \"Nothing and Nowhere\" with new sleeve artwork. Adm soon left thereafter to explore his own projects. In the fall of 2004, the band was signed to Repo Records in Germany, and released a remastered and expanded version of \"Violet\" in Europe, including updated album art in a digipak case.\n\nIn 2005 the band signed to Metropolis Records and released \"Violet\" in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and most of South America. Owen joined on live keyboards and in August, the band began a series of international tours taking them to Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Belgium. Also in August, a DVD consisting of a video for the song \"Blue\" was released. It also included behind-the-scenes footage, interviews, a studio performance of \"Nevermind\" as well as live performances of \"Violet\" and \"Video Kid\". The centerpiece of the DVD was the Dan Ouellette-directed video for \"Blue\".\n\nIn early 2006, the Birthday Massacre toured North America, playing across Canada, the United States, and Mexico on their \"Broken Minds\" tour. They also played Europe in the summer of 2006.\n\nIn June 2007, it was announced that the band was working on a new record with Canadian producer/engineer Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie (producer of many industrial acts such as Skinny Puppy, not to be confused with Kevin Ogilvie, frontman of Skinny Puppy) and that bass player Aslan Osiris had left the band for his own project.

In 1955, Carol married a Providence disc jockey named Charlie Jefferds, but divorced in 1958.\n\nCarol continued to sing in small bars and clubs until she met the road manager of the Les and Larry Elgart Orchestra, which was touring the amusement park ballrooms in the southern New England area. She auditioned for Larry Elgart, who then asked her to come to New York with his band. The brothers had recently split the organization, Les taking the territory west of Chicago, Larry to handle everything east of Chicago. Larry Elgart suggested she change her name to Carol Sloane.\n\nThe \"road years\" with the Larry Elgart band continued until 1960, when the road simply became too boring and too difficult for her. After two years on the road, she was still unknown, and there were no singing engagements to be had. She took various secretarial jobs booked through Manhattan temp agencies. She continued her working relationship with the former road manager of the Elgart band, who had become an agent in the office of the legendary Willard Alexander. This man, Bob Bonis, arranged for Carol to sing at a jazz festival in Pittsburgh in 1960, at which time she met Lambert, Hendricks and Ross.\n\nJon Hendricks asked Carol if she could learn the LH&R book in order to be prepared to take Annie Ross' place if that ever became necessary. Carol agreed to study the group's exacting material, and continued her secretarial gigs. Then, one night in early 1961, when attending a performance of LH&R at the Village Vanguard, Jon asked Carol to sing a couple of tunes on her own, after which the legendary proprietor Max Gordon asked her if she'd like to sing at the club the following August as opening act for Oscar Peterson.\n\nAnother auspicious move was quietly being made for Carol in 1961, without her knowledge: Jon Hendricks made a very persuasive argument to the producers that Carol should be included in that year's Newport Jazz Festival as part of the \"New Stars\" program. On the afternoon of that presentation, Carol had the use of the Ike Isaacs Trio which backed LH&R. The pianist, Gildo Mahones, didn't know the verse to the Rodgers & Hart song \"Little Girl Blue\" so Carol blithely suggested she would sing it a cappella, and did so. The New York press unanimously praised the young woman's talent, exceptional intonation and pitch, and she was also heard by a representative of Columbia Records. Her first album,\"Out of the Blue\" was recorded a few short months later, with arrangements by the legendary Bill Finegan, and an orchestra boasting Clark Terry and Bob Brookmeyer among the soloists.\n\nIn the 1960's, Carol Sloane sang in major clubs such as Mr. Kelly's in Chicago where she opened for Jackie Mason and the Smothers Brothers; at the hungry I in San Francisco where she opened for Bill Cosby, Godfrey Cambridge and Richard Pryor; she also opened for Phyllis Diller, Stiller and Meara and Jackie Vernon at the Blue Angel in New York; she appeared regularly on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and became a regular member of the radio cast on Arthur Godfrey's CBS weekly program. She continued to record and make club and concert appearances during this decade until the Beatles and rock 'n roll began to consume the popular culture, forcing some jazz venues to the edge of ruin. In 1969, Carol accepted an offer to sing in a club in Raleigh, North Carolina, found the atmosphere in that city very much less hectic than New York, with an audience eager to hear and support jazz artists. She relocated to the south at the beginning of 1970.\n\nCarol worked both as a singer and a legal secretary for the next several years, eventually returning to New York to begin a turbulent relationship with a legendary jazz pianist, Jimmy Rowles. Jimmy's reputation as a master accompanist and soloist was solid and undisputed, but his alcoholism made their situation often stormy. He did, however, pull himself together long enough to play for Ella Fitzgerald when Tommy Flanagan left after almost twenty years of accompanying the great singer. Jimmy's tenure was much shorter: only two years at the outside. He then decided to return to Los Angeles, and did so at the end of 1980. Carol also left New York, this time returning to her beloved New England.\n\nShe arrived in Boston in January, 1981, accepted a job in a prestigious law firm, and promptly threw away the idea of an \"ordinary\" life when a friend asked her to return to N.C. to help him in his new supper club recently opened in Chapel Hill. The venue was beautiful, comfortable and truly a perfect setting for any artist, and Carol booked her friends into the club: Shirley Horn, Joe Williams, George Shearing, Marian McPartland, Anita O'Day, Jackie & Roy, and of course, the great Carmen McRae. This club managed to last all of two years, a remarkable accomplishment. Carol also hosted a radio show at the NPR affiliate in Chapel Hill. In 1984, while singing in a Boston club, she met the man whom she would eventually marry.\n\nHer marriage to Buck Spurr took place in November, 1986, and Carol has lived in the Boston area since that time. She recorded two albums for Contemporary in 1988 and 1989, then signed with Concord Jazz in 1991, recording six solo albums and touring Japan many times as part of the Concord-Fujitsu Festival. Carol stayed busy making her debut with the Boston Pops Orchestra at Symphony Hall, Boston in 1998, then with the New York Pops Orchestra in 1999, and recorded a tribute album to Duke Ellington on the DRG label that same year. In March 2000, she began a second career in radio, hosting The Jazz Matinee, a four-hour jazz program, five days a week on WICN-FM, the NPR affiliate in Worcester, Mass. This jazz show took a full year's time to produce, until, in the spring of 2001, a heavy performance schedule made it necessary for Carol to leave WICN to resume touring and also record a new CD. In 2001, Carol signed a contract with the famous HighNote Jazz label which issued the first cd titled \"I Never Went Away.\" This has been followed by \"Whisper Sweet.\"\n\nCarol's most recent recording, \"Dearest Duke\", was released in April of 2007 on the Arbors label. Featuring Brad Hatfield on piano and Ken Peplowski on tenor sax and clarinet, this cd contains 15 tunes of Ellington material plus Billy Strayhorn's \"Day Dream.\"\n\nCarol Sloane's website: www.carolsloane.com", "otherInfo": "Join us at the Birdland Theater for Carol Sloane!"}, {"Address": "64 E 4th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Barbara Martinez", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7952074.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.990558, 40.726546], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "New York, New York", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Teatro Circulo", "moreBioInfo": "B\u00e1rbara MartInez grew up performing in New York City.

Later that month, the talents of Michael Basden were recruited for the band as a second guitar player.\n\nIn May of 1986 the band was approached by New Renaissance Records to appear on a pair of compilation albums, Thrash Metal Attack and Speed Metal Hell Volume 3, with two tracks lifted straight off the demo tape. Soon afterwards the band was forced to change their name, and so they did... now calling themselves BLOOD FEAST. In June of 1986, New Renaissance Records offered the band an album contract.\n\nThe band financed the budget for the recording of the first album themselves, and in February of 1987 the debut album from BLOOD FEAST entitled Kill For Pleasure became a reality. Even with an extremely rough production and very little promotion from the record company, the album quickly became New Renaissance's top selling release.\n\nIt was the band's musical talent, determination, and electrifying live performances (which always ended with a blazing cover of the Celtic Frost classic \"Into Crypts of Rays\") that gave them the recognition they deserved, not to mention their strong underground BUZZ and many favorable reviews in magazines and fanzines worldwide.\n\nRealizing BLOOD FEAST's potential, New Renaissance immediately sent the band back into the studio to record a four song mini-LP. In December of 1987, Face Fate was released and almost immediately outsold the debut album.\n\nIn June of 1988, BLOOD FEAST found themselves back in the studio to record a ten song demo, this time as a quartet, as Adam Tranquili was asked to leave the band. This demo was titled The Last Remains, and it was recorded on 24 tracks and indicated a tremendous growth in the band's songwriting and musical skills. The music is still aggressive and powerful as ever, but the addition of sheer professionalism and finesse brought their music to new heights.\n\nThere were some minor changes in the production of the album, such as new cover artwork and a name change. The title became Chopping Block Blues and was recorded in the summer of 1989 and released in February of 1990. Chopping Block Blues marked the band's greatest songwriting achievement, and is a concrete indication of their true potential and unique style, but unfortunately, became the band's last recording, as they broke up soon after it's release.\n\nAfter being disbanded for over 10 years, the band got back together for a one time only gig at the March Metal Meltdown in Asbury Park, New Jersey in 1999!! When they hit the stage, they took everyone back to 1987, because it seemed like you were seeing them in their prime!! They came out with all the raw intensity that the live show has to offer, even after all the years of being apart. A KILLER setlist of songs, played as tight as if they never broke up was offered up to the fans. It's safe to say, NO ONE left disappointed!!\n\nKevin Kuzma and Adan Tranquilli, the original drummer and original guitarist for Blood Feast REVIVED the name of Blood Feast in 2007 with members of Kuzma's band Annunaki serving in place of other original members, beginning with a gig at the Brooklyn Xecution Festival.", "otherInfo": "Possessed, Pestilence, W/ Special Guest The Black Moriah, & Metal DJ Alex Kayne"}, {"Address": "1288 Myrtle ave, Brooklyn, NY 11221", "Artist": "Brett Gleason", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9114499.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.924714, 40.698032], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Folk Rock, Folk, Acoustic, Alternative, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bushwick Public House", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "10 Columbus Cir, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "Ambrose Akinmusire", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6287237.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.982566, 40.768443], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Music & Art Performance", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Appel Room", "moreBioInfo": "A spiritual seeker in the grand tradition of musical aspirationalists, trumpeter/composer Ambrose Akinmusire refuses to rest on his already considerable laurels. Ceaselessly exploring new territory and expanding his personal sonic vocabulary, Akinmusire has from the beginning of his young but remarkable career staked his place at the vanguard of jazz and artistic expression.\n\nThe winner of both the 2007 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition and the 2007 Carmine Caruso International Jazz Trumpet Solo Competition, Akinmusire has proved himself one of the most vital and deft trumpeters of his generation. He was named Rising Star Jazz Artist and Rising Star Trumpet in DownBeat Magazine\u2019s 2011 Critics Poll, graduating to Trumpet Player of the Year in 2012. He earned the same title in that year\u2019s Jazz Journalists Association awards, as well as being awarded Germany\u2019s ECHO Award as Instrumentalist of the Year, International Brass.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal called Akinmusire \u201can exciting, original trumpeter who works in a diverse range of contemporary styles;\u201d Billboard declared him \u201cthe brightest beacon on the trumpet, the sharpest in a few decades.\u201d According to the Village Voice, \u201chis daring shapes the sound of his incessant searching,\u201d while the All Music Guide asserts that, \u201cEvery so often a trumpeter comes along who redraws the instrument's role within jazz: Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Clifford Brown, Chet Baker, Wynton Marsalis, Freddie Hubbard, etc. Ambrose Akinmusire has the potential to join that crowd.\u201d\n\nAkinmusire\u2019s two CDs, Prelude to Cora (Fresh Sound New Talent) and When the Heart Emerges Glistening (Blue Note), were both met with critical acclaim, marking him as a composer and conceptualist to watch. The latter album topped critics\u2019 lists including the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and Allmusic.com. NPR Music referred to When the Heart Emerges Glistening as \u201ca svelte and darkly modernistic disc highlighted by Akinmusire's clarion solos,\u201d while the New York Times hailed it as \u201cone of this year\u2019s standout jazz releases.\u201d The album earned Akinmusire France\u2019s Grand Prix l\u2019Academie du Jazz.\n\nThe nomadic trumpeter has traced a zigzagging pattern between coasts from his native California to the hectic jazz capital of New York. He can currently be found in Los Angeles, where he\u2019s teaching at University of Southern California\u2019s Thornton School of Music. He has played on stages around the globe, including in India, Vietnam, Australia, Turkey, Japan, and Brazil, and at international festivals such as the North Sea Jazz Festival, Copenhagen Jazz Festival, Umbria Jazz Festival, and Barcelona Jazz Festival.\n\nAkinmusire\u2019s forward-reaching compositions have earned him a commission from New York\u2019s Jazz Gallery and grants from the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s MAP Fund and Chamber Music America\u2019s French-American Jazz Exchange Program. In 2011, he debuted his star-studded Big Band on one of the world\u2019s most renowned stages, Carnegie Hall. The following year he was named Artist-in-Residence at the 55th annual Monterey Jazz Festival.\n\n\nThe son of a father from Nigeria and a mother from Mississippi, Akinmusire was raised in Oakland, California, where his spiritual and musical path was set during near-daily visits to church with his mother and grandmother. Every time they entered the building, young Ambrose would run to the piano, which his family accepted as a sign of his musical inclinations. He began playing piano at the age of three, switching to drums in the fifth grade and finally to the trumpet the following year.\n\nDuring middle school, Akinmusire attended a jazz camp run by local Bay Area musicians, which fully exposed him to the music whose expansive parameters were broad enough for his ambitious imagination. Through the connections forged there he had the opportunity to meet and play with greats like Billy Higgins, Sonny Simmons and Joe Henderson. At Berkeley High School he met Joshua Redman and Steve Coleman, who enlisted the young trumpeter to tour Europe with his band Five Elements.\n\nA full scholarship to the Manhattan School of Music led to Akinmusire\u2019s first move to New York, followed by a return to the west coast to earn his master\u2019s degree at USC and to attend the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz. After finishing school and winning the Monk competition, he returned to New York, where he\u2019s worked with a stunning array of jazz\u2019s finest musicians.\n\nAkinmusire\u2019s main outlet is his quintet with drummer and childhood friend Justin Brown, bassist Harish Raghavan, saxophonist Walter Smith III, and pianist Sam Harris. The band is skilled and flexible enough to evolve with Akinmusire and to follow his lead. The Los Angeles Times wrote that the band, \u201cdemonstrated a remarkably fluid, adventurous interplay and patiently imaginative way with melody that sounded as steeped in the music's history as it was hard-wired with the sound of something new.\u201d Alongside the group, however, he continues to branch into other avenues, necessary for an artist whose influences encompass Wayne Shorter and Bjork, Joni Mitchell and Pina Bausch, Ravel and Marina Abramovic.\n\nAkinmusire\u2019s music overflows with both beauty and rigor, profound personal feeling and fiery virtuoso playing. What one hears throughout his work is an artist plumbing the depths of himself and the world around him, coming to understand the workings of his own mind and the mysteries of nature. Both of those terrains are boundless, and Akinmusire is determined to follow them as far afield as they lead.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "183 W 10th St, New York City, NY 10014", "Artist": "Duane Eubanks", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8122713.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.002722, 40.734367], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Smalls Jazz Club w/ DUANE EUBANKS QUINTET", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "DUANE EUBANKS\nTrumpet\nABRAHAM BURTON\nTenor Sax\nGERALD CANNON\nBass\nCHRIS BECK\nDrums"}, {"Address": "183 W 10th St, New York City, NY 10014", "Artist": "Duane Eubanks", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8122713.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.002722, 40.734367], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Smalls Jazz Club w/ DUANE EUBANKS QUINTET", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "DUANE EUBANKS\nTrumpet\nABRAHAM BURTON\nTenor Sax\nGERALD CANNON\nBass\nCHRIS BECK\nDrums"}, {"Address": "315 West 44th St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Curtis Stigers", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7362777.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.989689, 40.759], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Blues-rock, Pop, Jazz, Saxophone Jazz, Soul Jazz, Adult Contemporary, Soundtracks", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Birdland", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cI\u2019ve made a conscious decision throughout my life not to be confined, musically,\u201d says Curtis Stigers. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about the song, about the story.\u201d\n\nFor the award-winning singer, songwriter, and saxophonist, the story keeps getting better. His string of hit singles, millions of albums sold, and a 28-year recording career aside, Stigers\u2019 commitment to artistic growth, and to bringing new tunes to the Great American Songbook, has become unparalleled in modern music.\n\nBarnstorming concert halls, festivals and clubs everywhere from Moscow to Manhattan, accompanied one night by his quartet, another by big band or orchestra, Stigers continues to release new work nearly every year, frequently collaborating with his musical heroes. Along the way, this musician who began his career playing standards in a Boise hotel lobby while moonlighting as drummer in a punk rock band has redefined the constitution of contemporary jazz singing.\n\n\u201cI was the kid who worshipped songs and the musicians who wrote and recorded them,\u201d he remembers. \u201cBack then, pop radio played everything from Aretha Franklin to Led Zeppelin, Marvin Gaye to Willie Nelson, Joni Mitchell to Elton John. I loved it all, and I studied it.\u201d Often euphoric and always elegant, Stigers possesses a curator\u2019s knack for hearing a song, framing its heart, and making it his own\u2014be it the work of Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Wilco, or The Kinks.\n\nStigers\u2019 repertoire is a reflection of his appreciation for the fundaments of tone and craft, and for quality\u2014the progression of his work is both organic and practical. \u201cJazz songs used to be pop songs. Jazz has always been about reinvention,\u201d Stigers notes.\n\nPerhaps because he has penned so many notable songs himself, as well as writing with the likes of legends like Carole King and Barry Mann, Stigers has come to recognize the small, perfect things that are a great melody and lyric, and how to capture them. That songwriting talent also led to an Emmy nomination for co-writing and singing the theme song to the wildly successful TV series Sons Of Anarchy.\n\nIt is his rich singing voice, however\u2014singular, balletic, and at turns both mournful and playful\u2014that has landed him on records with the likes of Al Green, Shawn Colvin, in studios with venerated producers like Larry Klein, Danny Kortchmar, and Glen Ballard, and on stages and concert bills with a plethora of legends, including pop and rock greats Eric Clapton, Elton John, Bonnie Raitt, Prince, Rod Stewart and The Allman Brothers, and jazz giants Nancy Wilson, Al Jarreau, Gerry Mulligan, Randy and Michael Brecker, Chuck Mangione, Toots Thielmans, Wynton and Branford Marsalis, Kurt Elling, Diana Krall, John Scofield, and many more.\n\nAfter being mentored in his early years by legendary jazz pianist Gene Harris, and by the great jazz singer Mark Murphy, his unique talent was recognized by music business impresario Clive Davis, who signed Stigers to a record deal after hearing him in a New York restaurant. A debut album sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide on the strength of self-penned hit singles like \u201cI Wonder Why,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re All That Matters to Me,\u201d and \u201cNever Saw a Miracle.\u201d A year later, Stigers contributed a cover version of Nick Lowe\u2019s \u201c(What\u2019s So Funny \u2018Bout) Peace Love and Understanding\u201d to The Bodyguard soundtrack, which has sold over 40 million copies worldwide. Multiple appearances on The Tonight Show, The Late Show With David Letterman, The Today Show, and countless international TV shows, put Stigers directly in the spotlight of popular culture. Stigers also made cameo appearances in the movie comedies Ted and Ted 2, written and directed by his friend, Seth MacFarlane.\n\nBorn in Hollywood, raised in Idaho and transplanted to Manhattan, he now resides, between concert appearances, back in Boise, where he\u2019s proud to help raise hundreds of thousands of dollars each year for the Interfaith Sanctuary Homeless Shelter.", "otherInfo": "SORRY THIS SHOW IS CANCELLED!"}, {"Address": "154 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "Pacifica Quartet", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9161473.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.979544, 40.765139], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Pacifica Quartet can \u201cproduce a sound that can sing exquisitely or throttle you with its grittiness and energy\u201d (The New York Times)\u2014qualities perfectly suited to this program.

In my attempts to be a better adoptive parent I found plenty of invaluable books and workshops that got that point across, but no songs! Music has this magical way of communicating emotion almost instantly, and allows human beings to synchronize with each other on so many levels. I set out to write songs that would resonate with other parents like myself. Songs about loneliness, exhaustion, beauty, abandonment, love, loss, and above all, hope.\u201d\n\nSchneckenburger\u2019s fans will be the first to tell you, the sonic tapestry of Thunder in my Arms is a sharp contrast with her previous recordings. Rooted solidly in a foundation of drums and bass, the songs swell with electric guitar, piano, and strings, and at times explode with brass and saxophone. Above it all rides Schneckenburger\u2019s expressive vocals, with the lyrics driving it all home.\n\nRaised in a small town in Maine and now living in Vermont, Schneckenburger grew up with music. She began playing fiddle at the age of six, inspired by her parent\u2019s interest in folk music. In 2001 she graduated from the New England Conservatory of Music with a degree in Contemporary Improvisation. She has been performing and teaching music around the world ever since.\n\n\u201cTo me, music creates community,\u201d Schneckenburger says. \u201cMusic is what people sing along to, dance to, fall in love to\u2026 music brings people together. These songs are part of all of us, and it\u2019s an honor to have had the chance to record them.\u201d", "otherInfo": "https://www.folkproject.org/troubadour/troubadour.shtml\n\nWe will reschedule this concert, check back soon for a new date"}, {"Address": "4210 Palisades Cte Dr A - 401, West Nyack, NY 10994", "Artist": "Vir Das", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9620811.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.96, 41.1], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "West Nyack Levity Live Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Two item minimum purchase required per person.

Their music is influenced by classic rock from the 1970s such as Led Zeppelin, mixed with pop overtones and at times folk and country elements. They originally formed at Bucknell University (Lewisburg, PA) in the late 1980s, with sisters Cathy (guitar) and Kristen Henderson (drums) as the primary force, and Penelope \"Peppy\" Kokines taking lead vocals. Later members would include Sue Obolsky (lead vocals), Agona Hardison (lead vocals), Terri Avella (bass) and Ann-Marie Stehn (bass).\n\nIn the mid-1990s in New York City, the Henderson sisters re-grouped and started playing gigs (initially in Bleecker Street venues including The Back Fence, Cafe Figaro and The Bitter End) with lead vocalist Cassidy, a self-taught singer who had previously sung in church and with a high school girl band, Jen Zielenbach on bass and Dena Tauriello on drums. They are the current lineup of Antigone Rising, which now reportedly performs 200 or more shows per year. The band is known for earning a dedicated fanbase very early on that follow them from concert to concert all along the East Coast and increasingly across the country. Fans refer to themselves as ARheads (pronounced airheads) or Risers, and to the band simply as AR or Antigone.\n\nTheir first four albums were recorded mostly with independent labels and financed through fan donations. In 2003 they signed up with Lava Records after label president Jason Flom spotted them playing at one of their gigs. In 2005, they became the first artists to be promoted in Starbucks' Hear Music Series, created to discover and spotlight new music. The high visibility, exclusive sale, in-store promotion and airplay at Starbucks across the country helped the band's acoustic EP From the Ground Up soar to over 450,000 records sold by the end of 2005. Their next album, provisionally titled Drama Club, will be their post-Starbucks studio nationwide debut release.\n\nAntigone Rising have shared the stage with Joan Jett, The Rolling Stones, moe., Rob Thomas, Aerosmith, The Allman Brothers and performed at Lillith Fair 1998 and SXSW 2005 and have co-written with Chris Trapper of the Pushtars and Rob Thomas.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "487 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "Wil Sylvince", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6375042.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.981649, 40.685861], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "EastVille Comedy Club - Brooklyn", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Wil Sylvince, and More!, No Drink Minimum - Exclusive"}, {"Address": "254 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023", "Artist": "The Grit", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/119559.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983844, 40.779378], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ashford & Simpson's Sugar Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Internationally known poet and live performance artist Alexander The Griot hosts some of his favorite working artists at Ashford & Simpson's Sugar Bar in New York City.

For 40 years, the Southern Rock legends celebrated triumphs, endured tragedies and survived legal nightmares to remain one of the most influential and best-loved bands of the genre. Now The Outlaws return with new music, new focus and an uncompromising new mission: It\u2019s about a band of brothers bound together by history, harmony and the road. It\u2019s about a group that respects its own legacy while refusing to be defined by its past. But most of all, it\u2019s about pride.\n\nIt\u2019s About Pride is the new album from The Outlaws, a record 4 years in the making and perhaps 20 or more in the waiting. And for original Outlaws singer/ guitarist Henry Paul, it\u2019s a hard-fought revival whose success can be measured in old fans and new music. \u201cBecause The Outlaws have been out of the public eye for so long, it\u2019s almost like starting over,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut because of the band\u2019s history, we\u2019re seeing this as a new chapter. We\u2019ve written and recorded this album on our own terms, and we\u2019re out to make a significant impression. What our fans loved then they still love now, because we are just as good or even better than we were. Most of all, they recognize the heart of what it is we still do.\u201d For co-founding drummer Monte Yoho, the journey is both bittersweet and jubilant. \u201cI still think about the friends we made when we first came into this industry, how we struggled to define this thing that became known as \u2018Southern Rock\u2019,\u201d Yoho says. \u201cThis new album embodies all the things we shared musically and personally, as well as the relationships we have with our fans to this day. It\u2019s about where we\u2019ve been, where we\u2019re going, and why we still love to do this.\u201d\n\nHistory lesson: Formed in Tampa in 1972, The Outlaws \u2013 known for their triple-guitar rock attack and three-part country harmonies \u2013 became one of the first acts signed by Clive Davis (at the urging of Ronnie Van Zant) to his then-fledgling Arista Records. The band\u2019s first three albums The Outlaws, Lady In Waiting and Hurry Sundown \u2013 featuring such rock radio favorites as \u201cThere Goes Another Love Song\u201d, \u201cGreen Grass & High Tides\u201d, \u201cKnoxville Girl\u201d and \u201cFreeborn Man\u201d \u2013 would become worldwide gold and platinum landmarks of the Southern Rock era. Known as \u2018The Florida Guitar Army\u2019 by their fans, The Outlaws earned a formidable reputation as an incendiary live act touring with friends The Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Marshall Tucker Band and The Charlie Daniels Band as well as The Doobie Brothers, The Who, Eagles and The Rolling Stones. Henry Paul left after the group\u2019s third album to form The Henry Paul Band for Atlantic Records, and later the multi-Platinum country trio Blackhawk. Over the next 20+ years, The Outlaws would experience rampant personnel changes, tonal missteps, ill-fated reunions and bitter trademark battles that left fans \u2013 not to mention Paul and Yoho \u2013 frustrated and saddened. And with the tragic deaths of co-founding members Frank O\u2019Keefe and Billy Jones in 1995, and especially vocalist/lead guitarist Hughie Thomasson in 2007, it was feared that The Outlaws\u2019 trail had come to an end.\n\n\u201cThe Outlaws were the one area of my career where I had regrets,\u201d admits Paul. \u201cMore importantly, I think it was the one area in my career where I thought I still have something to prove. I felt compelled to stick my neck out and take a chance of putting this band back together. I knew we would be judged, but I hoped we would be judged on our abilities.\u201d Along with founding members Paul and Yoho, the band features several of Southern Rock\u2019s most respected veterans: Lead guitarist and longtime Outlaw Chris Anderson is well known for his collaborations with artists that include Dickey Betts, Lucinda Williams, Hank Williams Jr., and Skynyrd. Co-lead guitarist Steve Grisham - who joined the band in mid-2013 following the medical leave of guitarist Billy Crain - is a former member of the Soldiers Of Fortune era Outlaws, a noted songwriter whose tracks include The Henry Paul Band's Top 40 hit \"Keepin Our Love Alive\", and a co-founder of the Southern Rock all-stars, Brothers of the Southland. Keyboardist/vocalist Dave Robbins is a co-founding member of Blackhawk and has written hit songs for artists that include Restless Heart, Kenny Rogers and Eric Clapton. Bassist/vocalist Randy Threet has performed with Pam Tillis, Trisha Yearwood and Blackhawk, and is familiar to TV audiences from USA Network\u2019s \u2018Nashville Star\u2019. \u201cFrom the very beginning, our band had a heart,\u201d Monte Yoho says. \u201cAnd a lot of people who come out and see this incarnation of the band respond to the exact same things we used to put on that stage in the \u201870s and \u201880s.\u201d\n\nOn that stage, the band burns hotter than ever: \u201cThe Outlaws helped define Southern Rock for me and for generations of fans,\u201d wrote music journalist Bill Robinson in June 2012 in The Huffington Post. \u201cSeeing them onstage with The Charlie Daniels Band, Marshall Tucker Band, Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd or countless others was, for a long time, one of the best experiences I could have. And so it was again when I saw The Outlaws play recently.\u201d The Outlaws\u2019 live shows \u2013 more than 150 per year \u2013 are blazing 2+ hour tributes to the band\u2019s rich history and fiery rebirth. Classic tracks and fan favorites from the first three albums \u2013 as well as The Henry Paul Band\u2019s definitive \u201cGrey Ghost\u201d \u2013 share the spotlight with songs from the new disc that are already being embraced by audiences. \u201cI think the new songs go back to those first three classic albums, when the band was proud of its influences from country, blues and jazz,\u201d says Billy Crain. \u201cPlus, Chris Anderson and I have honored and maybe even stepped up the legacy of the \u2018guitar army\u2019. Fans are coming away from shows feeling a part of the Outlaws experience.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s the new album \u2013 produced by Michael Bush and Henry Paul \u2013 that brings the experience home. The disc opens with \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Another Night\u201d, a scorching take on the band\u2019s history complete with monster harmonies and a killer hook. \u201cHidin\u2019 Out In Tennessee\u201d delivers classic Outlaws country/bluegrass energy. \u201cBorn To Be Bad\u201d is badass biker boogie and \u201cLast Ghost Town\u201d is kickass guitar rock. \u201cNothin\u2019 Main About Main Street\u201d is an affecting Springsteen/Seger style look at lost small-town life. \u201cThe Flame\u201d \u2013 Hughie Thomasson\u2019s nickname \u2013 is a potent tribute to the much-loved late Outlaw. Chris Anderson\u2019s \u201cTrail Of Tears\u201d electrifies via bitter history, intense vocals and searing guitars. \u201cRight Where I Belong\u201d, \u201cAlex\u2019s Song\u201d and \u201cTrouble Rides A Fast Horse\u201d could easily be lost tracks from any of the band\u2019s first three albums. The disc\u2019s closer, \u201cSo Long\u201d is a haunting re-recording of Henry\u2019s 1979 classic. \u201cIt was the first song on the first Henry Paul Band album, and it\u2019s the final song on this record,\u201d explains Paul. \u201cI wanted it to be a sort of coda to the new music, but I also want it to be a relevant part of the new Outlaws landscape. I think it\u2019s one of the best songs I\u2019ve ever written, and I think we\u2019ve done an admirable job of giving it a new personality.\u201d But the new album\u2019s true centerpiece is its title track, co-written by Henry Paul and Billy Crain. \u201cIt\u2019s About Pride\u201d is both tribute and testimony from a band that has lived it all, played it all, and returns to reclaim it all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be a part of something that started long ago,\u201d Henry Paul sings reflectively, \u201ca Southern band of brothers bound together by the road/They came from Florida, Georgia, Carolina and Tennessee/With old guitars, tattoos and scars, straight from the heart of Dixie/And our rebel pride.\u201d From its towering chorus to its searing guitar-onslaught finale, \u201cIt\u2019s About Pride\u201d is a fierce first-person anthem to the genre, delivered with the poignancy and power of absolute survivors. \u201cIt\u2019s a very emotional song,\u201d Paul says. \u201cDepending on my mood and the night, sometimes it\u2019s all I can do to get the words out without crying. It summons up a lot of images of people who are no longer with us, of times we shared standing tall together for the first time. When I first wrote the end of the second verse \u2013 \u201cThe reason \u2018Sweet Home Alabama\u2019 means so much to me/Is it\u2019s about pride\u201d \u2013 I knew that people would feel a lot of those same emotions. It\u2019s about an accumulated experience of separation, loss and success.\u201d Almost instantly, the song \u2013 and the entire album \u2013 is classic Southern Rock and classic Outlaws.\n\nRight now, The Outlaws are headed back on the road, back on the radio and back into the hearts of fans nationwide. \u201cI\u2019m seeing this thing we\u2019ve had for four decades be exposed to whole new audiences,\u201d Monte Yoho says. \u201cWe\u2019re having a second life as a band, and it feels better than ever. Best of all, I\u2019m still doing it with some of the same people I\u2019ve known for most of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want people to hear this album and see our show and realize that The Outlaws are back,\u201d says Henry Paul. \u201cOur goal is to unite the fans and bring the band back into the light. In a way, this is like a second chance at my first love. It\u2019s about finishing what we started.\u201d For Henry, Monte, Chris, Steve, Dave and Randy, it\u2019s about a band of brothers who love playing their own style of rock, and who 40 years ago first got the chance to take it from Florida to the world.\n\nFor The Outlaws, it\u2019s still about the music. And now more than ever, it\u2019s about pride.", "otherInfo": "Doors 6PM Show 8PM All Ages"}, {"Address": "15 Barrow St, New York, NY 10014", "Artist": "Sasha Dobson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8403203.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.002566, 40.732611], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Americana, Cool Jazz, Country Blues, Jazz, Country Rock, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Cafe Bohemia", "moreBioInfo": "Forthcoming EP, Simple Things, to be released April 15, 2020.\nRecorded at Bob Weir\u2019s TRI Recording Studios in San Rafael California September 24, 2019.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee.

He bought a loop pedal and began learning how to integrate it into his gigs, often sharing with concert-goers how he builds his backing band: himself.\n\nTaking inspiration from a wide variety of musicians and songwriters has helped Liberio create his unique sound.

As a student at Cass Technical High School she played string bass in the school orchestra, studied piano and voice on weekends, and sang in her church\u2019s choir. An elder brother introduced her to jazz, Cook chose voice as her instrument of choice, and she became a disciple of jazz icon Eddie Jefferson, founder of a singing technique called \u2018vocalese\u2019 where a singer sings lyrics to a famous instrumental solo. During this time she and close friend Regina Carter formed dreams of becoming jazz musicians; Cook as a singer, and Carter as a violinist. At Carter\u2019s urging she applied to and was accepted by Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. While at Northeastern she remained in close contact with Carter (who was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music and met Cyrus Chestnut, a jazz pianist studying at nearby Berklee School of Music. After graduating from Northeastern in 1985 Cook remained in Boston preparing herself for a career singing jazz in New York. In February of 1990 she moved to New York and supported herself as a school teacher and book seller during the day, and singing at night. After five years she traveled to Europe and from 1993-1994 Cook served as a guest vocal and ensemble instructor at the Jazzschule in Basel, Switzerland, and Jazz and Rock Schule in Freiburg, Germany. She returned to New York two years later and her work included singing with Lionel Hampton\u2019s Orchestra and George Gee\u2019s Make Believe Ballroom Orchestra. In 1998 she signed with MaxJazz, a fledgling music label, and that year she released her first CD, \u2018It\u2019s All About Love\u2019, to great acclaim, including a best jazz vocal Grammy nomination. Her second CD, \u2018Dem Bones\u2019 (a tribute to all the trombone players she\u2019d worked with in the Lionel Hampton and George Gee groups), released in 2001, was also a success, and received a glowing review from Down Beat magazine, the leading jazz publication.

The ensemble\u2019s insistently inventive program of traditional Afro-Peruvian music transformed by Gabriel Alegr\u00eda\u2019s highly personal synthesis of folkloric Afro-Peruvian rhythms, jazz, and other musical strains has led to a signature accomplishment: developing the band\u2019s patented blend of deep scholarship and playfulness into a touring experience that conveys a vast knowledge of the music and, perhaps more importantly, transmits black music from coastal Per\u00fa as a way of life to its audiences.\n\nEach member of the Sextet is not only a master musician but also a dedicated and experienced educator. During more than ten years on the road together, the mission of the band has incessantly been to spread the joy and love of Afro-Peruvian music around the world. This has happened both on the stage and through workshops, master classes, after-hour hangs and even cooking (as food and music are inseparable in Afro-Peruvian musical culture, the band is never shy to demonstrate!) As trumpet master Bobby Shew once commented \u201changing out with these people is a chapter in your life!\u201d\n\nThe Afro-Peruvian Sextet has produced five CDs, one DVD and one vinyl record to date. Their audiences come from all over the globe and include a legion of dedicated fans who work directly with the band on various projects including concert promotion, merchandise sales and most notably, Tour Per\u00fa, an innovative concept by which fans of the band literally join the musicians on the road in Per\u00fa once per year. With home bases in Lima and New York City, the band has been embraced by both cities. In 2015 Hot House Magazine awarded the band New York City\u2019s \u201cBest Ensemble of the Year\u201d award and the New York City Jazz Record \u201cBest Latin Jazz Album.\u201d\n\nThe band has successfully developed and consolidated a thriving \u201cscene\u201d around Afro-Peruvian jazz music. The Latin Jazz Network described the band in this way: \u201cEvery once in a while there comes a musician who, when playing his or her chosen instrument, seems to carry within a vital life-force that is irrepressible.\u201d\n\nAmidst the Afro-Peruvian Sextet\u2019s detailed fusion of Afro-Peruvian rhythms and jazz harmonies, lies a very demanding, authentic and honest interpretation. The New York Times writes \u201cthe Sextet knows its mission well and has the execution down to a science.\u201d \u201cPeruvian trumpeter Gabriel Alegr\u00eda champions Afro-Peruvian music,\u201d wrote Downbeat Magazine in a prominent review, \u201cthe hip asymmetrical bass line of Alegr\u00eda\u2019s El Norte is goaded by wonderful hand percussion and stickmanship on cajita from Hugo Alc\u00e1zar and Freddy \u201cHuevito\u201d Lobat\u00f3n.\u201d Latino Magazine described the music as \u201crhythm-saturated, orchestrally-enticing performances that are the definition of sonic joy\u201d while the Wall Stree Journal echoed with \u201ca highly sympatico blend of North American improv and South American beats.\u201d\n\nSupport for the band in their native Per\u00fa is also significant.

He grew up playing bluegrass in that grand old tradition of staying up late & singing real loud. Although he\u2019s since moved north, the humid south remains, lodged in his heart and sinus cavities.\n\nHeralded as \u201ca leading light of the New York bluegrass scene\u201d by the New York Times, Michael Daves has garnered attention for his work with Chris Thile, Steve Martin, Tony Trischka, and others in addition to his solo performances.\n\nDaves\u2019 most recent project is a two-album set, Orchids and Violence, released February 2016 on Nonesuch Records. Both discs are produced by Daves and have identical track listing of mostly traditional bluegrass songs. The first features straightforward interpretations of them and was recorded live to tape in a 19th-century church by Daves and a band of roots-music innovators: bassist Mike Bub, violinist Brittany Haas, mandolinist Sarah Jarosz, and banjo player and Punch Brother Noam Pikelny. The second disc was recorded in Daves's home studio and includes bass, drums, and electric guitar, mostly played by Daves, and takes a raw, experimental rock approach to the same old-time material. \"The identical track listing makes for a good comparison study,\" says the New York Times music critic Nate Chinen in his review, \"and to his credit, it can be hard to pick which version of a tune is best.\"\n\nDaves previously recorded bluegrass standards on Sleep with One Eye Open, a duo session with mandolinist Chris Thile (Punch Brothers, Nickel Creek) which was done live to tape over four days at Jack White\u2019s Third Man studio in Nashville. The album is a collection of 16 traditional tunes by bluegrass legends like The Monroe Brothers, The Louvin Brothers, Jimmy Martin, and Flatt & Scruggs. The duo makes for \"a rip-roaring partnership,\" says the New York Times. \"Bluegrass, in their hands, gets roughed up in the best possible way, with skill and fervor, and a touch of abandon.\" \u201cSleep With One Eye Open\u201d received a 2011 Grammy Nomination for Best Bluegrass Album.\n\nAlthough he is best known as a roots musician, Daves gravitated toward experimental music and jazz while studying at Hampshire College in Massachusetts. Relocating to Brooklyn more than a decade ago, he began to crave the social interaction and musical challenges of bluegrass: \"In Western Massachusetts, I was mostly doing jazz. By the time I moved to New York, I was ready to leave that behind, get back to my personal roots in bluegrass music. There were good jam sessions in New York and I was excited to reenter a regular jamming culture in the city. And I was getting back into rock music, too. The Brooklyn scene in 2003 and 2004 was pretty fertile. There was a lot of great, kind of raw, experimental rock music happening at that time, drawing me in, scratching an itch.\"\n\nSince 2006 Daves has maintained a weekly residency on Tuesday nights at The Rockwood Music Hall in Manhattan where he continues to draw a devout following, and uses the informal setting to showcase special guest appearances with a who\u2019s who of bluegrass musicians including Noam Pikelny, Chris Eldridge, Sarah Jarosz, and Aoife O\u2019Donovan.

His last commercial recording had been released in 1980 with the MSS/Capitol recording act, Jackson Highway, a southern rock group nurtured by Jimmy Johnson and David Hood of the Muscle Shoals Sound Recording Studios, the home of the Swampers, the group immortalized by Lynyrd Skynrd in the southern classic, Sweet Home Alabama. Russell\u2019s return to recording focused on the roots of the music that first influenced him, a mix of Americana that blends blues, soul, gospel, country, and rock and roll.\n\nGulley is now back at Johnny Neel\u2019s Straight Up Sound in Nashville recording his second solo CD, yet to be titled, but one that continues his journey into the \u201cacoustic swamp\u201d of blues, rock, and Americana. His brother and co-founder of Jackson Highway, Dennis is back in the producer\u2019s chair and is joined by guitarist Chris Anderson of the Outlaws on resonator, Johnny Neel on harp, and rounding things out, Russell\u2019s stage partner, guitarist\nDoug \u201cBlind Willie\u201d Jones.\n\nRussell continues to perform around the South appearing at festivals such as the Riverbend Festival in Chattanooga, the Eutaw Black Belt Folk Roots Festival, and venues that support roots, traditional, and original music. He also serves as a DANA trained teaching artist in residence for the Fort Payne City School System in his home town, and travels to schools\naround the state of Alabama presenting his arts-in-education program, Intro: Folk Music, Blues, and Tradition.\n\nDuring his hiatus from recording, Russell continued to be involved in his first love of songwriting and has had several \"cuts\" of his songs by artists such as Johnny Neel, former Allman Brothers band member, The Beatdaddys, a Malaco/Waldoxy recording group, and Carl Weathersby, the heir apparent to blues legend, Albert King.\n\nGulley originals, such as his current single, \u201cNo Holds Barred\" will make up most of the tracks on the new CD. \"I'm striving to contribute to the Muscle Shoals tradition,\" said Russell in a recent interview, \"a tradition of song writing that is non-pretentious, a tradition that truly has given Muscle Shoals its soul\".\n\nFor more information be sure to check out Russell's website, www.russellgulleymusic.com, go to Dick Wooley\u2019s King Mojo Records at www.kingmojo.com and catch him live, up close and personal, to take a musical trip \"Back to the Swamp\".", "otherInfo": "Russell brings his MY MUSCLE SHOALS to Freddy's along with the surf music of The Band of Others"}, {"Address": "337 Newark Ave, Jersey City, NJ 07302", "Artist": "Crazy and the Brains", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-74.051506, 40.724972], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "White Eagle Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Slackers potent mix of ska, rock'n'roll, reggae and soul will get everybody moving and grooving on a Friday night!"}, {"Address": "107 Macon St, Brooklyn, NY 11216", "Artist": "Open Mic", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6169637.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.947041, 40.681511], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Hiphop, Jazz, Jam, Blues, Rock, Hip Hop, Hip-hop, Acoustic, Country, Folk, Metal", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "BrownstoneJAZZ", "moreBioInfo": "In 1990, the Connecticut MC then known as \"Jedi\", got his start rhyming with partner in crime - P-Air, as a member of the Native Tongue-influenced duo, \"The Nobility\". Several demos, a few years, a new group name, and additional members later, the direction of the crew took its turn towards blending science fiction and conspiracy theories into rap songs, which at the time, was a rare take on hip hop music in the early 90s. In 1994, the early \"Demigodz\" group split up due to the ever-so-popular break up reason: \"musical differences\". However, it was through this transition that the Demigodfather met another fellow CT lyricist, Apathy. As the musical partnership between Open Mic and Apathy progressed, the two decided to rebuild the Demigodz name and take their aspirations to an entirely different level. After years of recording songs, mastering the ASR-10, co-hosting a radio show, and gaining ties with the likes of Alien Nation, Mothership aka Eternia, and Al T of Newcleus, Mic's dues were slowly but surely being paid. Along with Apathy, he also headed up a Connecticut based chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation and recorded the cassette-only \"Sureshot Affair\" EP, which was self-released in 1997 and sold throughout the underground circles of the North East. Shortly thereafter, Mic took a step back from the scene after getting married and becoming a father for the first time in his life... In 2000, the Demigodz became resurrected by Apathy and expanded into a military-like squadron of MCs and DJs. With that movement in motion, it couldn't have existed without the inclusion of its original creator, Open Mic, and once again he became immersed into the hip hop world. Since then, Mic has kept himself afloat by making appearances on wax, including \"Science of the Bumrush\" on UK-based Stonegroove Recordings and the Demigodz EP released on Ill Boogie Records in mid-2002, all of which received critical acclaim in such publications as XXL and The Source. Outside of the microphone realm, he has made quite a name for himself over the years as a professional graphic designer, in which his lengthy resume extends widely with the creation of many 12\" single, vinyl album, and CD covers for an extensive list of labels - beginning with Bronx Science Records (Apathy's first label), Raptivism Records, Domination Recordings and most recently Babygrande. In early 2006, after being reunited with early 'Nobility' member and co-founder of the first generation of the Demigodz, P-Air, Open Mic has begun work on a new duo project. Returning to his original group base from 1989-1990, and bringing back that boom-bap early 90's sound that hip-hop has lacked since it took a commercial nosedive, Open Mic is ready to deliver what many Demigodz fans have been asking for.... the real raw shit. Keep your eyes open for the debut of his new group the \"Megadonz\" in late 2007.\n\nFor more info on MEGADONZ check out their MySpace page at:\nwww.myspace.com/megadonzmusic", "otherInfo": "WE TAKE CAUTION UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE WE SHALL ENTERTAIN AN EVEN SMALLER AUDIENCE THAN EVER BEFORE.

The audience, however, is too busy dancing to the one-man acts layered guitar riffs, foot stomping percussion, blues harmonica, and emotionally charged lyrics to even think about looking away.\nThe New Jersey native is able to emulate the sound of a full rock band with his percussive fingerstyle approach to the acoustic guitar and an array of effects pedals. Kenny has even customized a vintage red suitcase which has been dubbed \u201cThe Big Red Suitcase\u201d to use as a kick drum, which has appeared with him on stage for over a decade of live performances.\nHis debut appearances at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park paved the way for Kenny\u2019s developing one-man band show and led him into the national touring circuit and beyond. Over years of honing his craft on the road, Kenny caught the attention of one of his guitar idols, Mickey Melchiondo, a.k.a. Dean Ween from WEEN. Melchiondo recently asked Kenny to tour opening up for his new band, The Dean Ween Group, and has gained him new fans around the United States. Kenny has also been spreading his music internationally with multiple tours throughout Europe and performances in SE Asia to raise awareness about unexploded bombs. In recent years he has shared the stage with the likes of John Butler Trio, Keller Williams, WEEN, The Dean Ween Group, Leon Russell, John Hammond Jr., New Riders of the Purple Sage and John Kadlecik (Further & Dark Star Orchestra). In January of 2016, The Eagles of Death Metal released Kenny\u2019s version of \"I Love You All The Time\" as a part of their Pay it Forward Campaign to raise money for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.\nOn his latest self-titled release, Kenny teamed up with three-time Grammy Winning Producer Justin Guip (Sound engineer for Levon Helm and current touring drummer for Hot Tuna) to create a record that expanded on his signature one-man band sound. The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks. With an influential voice that lies somewhere between Neil Young and Jack White, Kenny delivers clear and concise visions of dynamic musical deliverance. Combining a deep dive into tone, originality and believability, he ushers the listener into his brand new living room of roots riddled rock and roll.\nNever going for the standard attack, he flies far from the 12-bar blues, three-chord rock and Americana stereotype to land some place between a rock and a new place. The album illustrates a highly skilled writer who utilizes the same down-home approach in his music as he does with his day-to-day interactions with others. It\u2019s a combination that will continue to see Kenny reach exciting new levels as he helps future fans \u201csee the light\u201d of his musical message.\nTo hear his full discography, watch recent videos, and check out upcoming tour dates visit www.KeithKenny.com\n(Excerpt from John Pfieffer & Jessica Smith of The Aquarian Weekly)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "66 North 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "John Moreland", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9562999.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.96168, 40.71925], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Country, Alternative Country", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Music Hall of Williamsburg", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "John Moreland - POSTPONED"}, {"Address": "701 Lake Ave, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "junior klan", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/317874.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.012784, 40.215301], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "BINGO Community Center", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "20 W Park Ave, Long Beach, NY 11561", "Artist": "Category3", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8829543.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.66483, 40.588153], "Date": "Fri Mar 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-27", "Genre": "Hard Rock, Classic Rock, Alternative Rock, Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Junction Live Music Sports Grill", "moreBioInfo": "Category3 is a power trio rock band based on the south shore of Long Island.

While other children dreamt of being astronauts or building rocket ships out of mega blocks, Dan was ready to jam on stage with the greatest of the great.\n\nWhen he got a bit older, he accompanied his brother Michael to Sam Ash music store, where he needed to pick up a saxophone for middle school band. They may have been at the store for his brother, but that day will forever be the one where Dan\u2019s daycare dreams began to grow into a reality.\n\nThere, standing in the guitar department, Dan was encouraged to pick up and strum along to the beat inside his soul, and his passion began to take shape.\n\nAs years passed, Dan became more and more accustomed to the guitar, and fell more and more in love with performing. He surrounded himself with mentors from diverse backgrounds \u2013 Dennis DelGaudio (Billy Joel), Chris Justino (Broadway), Artie Blaurock (Sweet Revenge, Dorian Grey, Needulhed), & Rick Stone (Jazz Guitar at Hofstra University). Each of these amazing talents provided him with a unique perspective on guitar stylings and teachings.\n\nTaking that knowledge to the next level, Dan joined the likes of Indie/Alternative Rock band Face the King (CI Records) and performed across the continental US for a multitude of shows, including a full leg of Vans Warped Tour, Rockstar UPROAR Festival, the main stage at the CBGB Festival in Times Square, NY (with Billy Idol and Jane\u2019s Addiction!), as well as the world\u2019s largest music festival - Summerfest, in Milwaukee, WI.\n\nFace the King was chosen as a National Finalist for the Ernie Ball Vans Warped Tour competition alongside PVRIS, and are three-time winners of the Ernie Ball Battle of the Bands. Their full-length album, \u201cOnce More Is All I Am,\u201d was released in November of 2017.\n\nDan is also collaborating on songwriting and performing with two up-and-coming Alt/Indie groups, Don\u2019t Believe in Ghosts (Forward Thinking Records), and A Second Life. These bands have received high acclaim, as shown by their multiple plays on retail radio playlists and on Spotify, national plays on Sirius XM Radio, and a number of live shows including Bowery Ballroom, The Paramount, NYC Marathon, and an upcoming appearance at the world-famous South By Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, TX.\n\nIn 2017, Don\u2019t Believe In Ghosts released their debut full-length album, \u201cGive it Meaning\u201d, and A Second Life released their first four singles, \u201cCivil War\u201d, \u201cJust Whisper\u201d, \u201cBeautiful Distraction\u201d, and \u201cYou\u2019re Missing From Me\u201d.\n\nTo take a listen to the alt-vibes of Face the King, Don\u2019t Believe in Ghosts, and A Second Life, check them out on Spotify:\n\nFace the King: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Rg22QdAlQc1KrhWuNwGWq\n\nDon\u2019t Believe in Ghosts: https://open.spotify.com/artist/5uLKc9jyRkcyoTNF1JLWe1\n\nA Second Life: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1FJj42V3fVy1sdxs0OgTQ5\n\nAs a session musician, Dan has performed with countless artists from different Genres \u2013 Robbie Rosen (American Idol), MarissaAnn (The Voice), Alessandra Guercio (The Voice), The Frankel Sisters (X Factor), Julia Lambert, Nicoletta Slapo, Sammi Rae Murciano, The 00\u2019s Band, and with Hank Lane Music Productions for weddings in the tri-state area.

To steal a line from Dan\u2019s favorite movie, Forrest Gump \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know if we each have a destiny, or if we\u2019re just floating around accidental \u2013 like on a breeze. But I think maybe it\u2019s both.\u201d\n\nIn Dan\u2019s case, it is most definitely a touch of both. A destiny come true, thanks to years of training and mentorships, as well as a dream that started at the age of 5 and blossomed into today\u2019s amazing career.\nBut the dream doesn\u2019t stop here. Dan DelVecchio is always looking for new opportunities to expand his horizons in music, to follow the breeze and see where it takes him. Are you interested in learning from or playing with Dan?

The band set up a monthly standing Thursday night gig in the back room of Rain Dogs in Five Points and played there until the room no longer held the crowds that showed up. Some astute, early fans started posting about strategic places to stand and dance during an LPT show because the room go so packed and so hot.\n\nLPT eventually grew to a full ten-piece orchestra and, while still able to squeeze into the tight stage at Rain Dogs, bigger stages came calling and continue to do so today.

Trance consists of five songs that illustrate the pivotal dreams, nightmares, and episodes of insomnia that Lea has had in her lifetime. With it\u2019s orchestral instrumentation and whimsical, story-like lyrics, trance transcends anything that Lea B. has ever created thus far.", "otherInfo": "You are all cordially invited to a night of music and fun at the legendary Bitter End.

Orly discovered and even more awesome simpatico with her as a Violinist and co-writer. Together they formed The Mona Dahls with Robin Mitchell (Piano, Vocals, Melodica), Kevin Hummel (Bass, Vocals ), and Andrew Fleming (Drums). The Mona Dahls are: Orly Bendavid\u2019s tender, emotional vocal melodies, neatly composed folk chords, rootsy grooves, and bluesy riffs. Daniella Fischetti\u2019s heart wrenching sweeping violin aria\u2019s. Robin Mitchell\u2019s poignant, creative, and sensitive piano constructions. Kevin Hummel\u2019s incredible ability to play the bass as both a complicated rhythmic and melodic instrument. And finally, Andrew Fleming\u2019s talented, dynamic percussion skills.\n\nThe Mona Dahls knit the lyricism of the violin in conversation with the tender and terse cadences of Bendavid\u2019s own voice. At times upbeat and folksy, and other times absorbed in serious melody, they ground both plaintive and ebullient sounds alike in the rhythm of guitar, mandolin, and crashing bells. This pronounces a noise strangely earthly and cerebral all at once, yet above all, emotional. In 2013 The Mona Dahls began recording their first album with producer and engineer Anthony Krizan (The Spin Doctors, Lenny Kravitz). This untitled album will be released Spring 2014.\n\n* please note that many quotes were taken from Ray Baldino's article on Mona!

Her blend of rock, pop & soul is of the strong female caliber; like Bonnie Raitt and K.T. Tunstall\u2026but make no mistake\u2026Nicola is Nicola.\n\nShe is an accomplished singer, songwriter, guitarist, keyboardist, and dancer, who has spent the last 10 years as a professional busker and musician in the NYC underground (as part of the sponsored \u201cMusic Under NY\u201d program). She has found an intimacy that can only exist where the constant rumble of trains drowns out most conversations, where the largest and toughest audiences in the world rush by, where you have to be damn good or you don\u2019t get to come back. This power house of a woman, rocks the New York underground like no other, but she\u2019s been rocking big stages and arenas above ground too.\n\nBorn on the Lower East Side of NYC, Nicola grew up in the low-income projects, sharing toys with her baby brother. Her father was a mechanic, and her mother a nurse. Neither was musically inclined, but both shared their appreciation and love for all types of music with their kids. \u201cMusic was always playing in our house\u2026we grew up with the sounds of Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Joni Mitchell, The Beatles,\u201d she recalls. It definitely rubbed off. Nicola ended up with a guitar in hand at age 7, a piano at age 11, and attended The Fiorello High School of the Arts (\u201cFame\u201d School). She trained classically at Manhattan School of Music and Queens College while studying dance and acting on the side. It wasn\u2019t long before she landed roles in both the critically acclaimed Broadway and National Road Companies of Les Miserables.\n\nLeaving the theater to embark on a music career, Nicola started her own record label \u201cHot Cherry Records\u201d in 2002. She toured the country and spent time living and performing in Europe and South America. Having recently opened for Eve 6, Nicola has shared the stage with Ricky Martin & Muzz Skillings of \u201cLiving Color\u201d. Over the past few years and 4 independently released CDs, having sold over 50,000 units independently, and charted on over 200 national radio stations, Nicola with her hybrid brand of sultry pop/rock/soul music has racked up an impressive list of rock and pop credentials: she's been featured on ABC, CBS & NBC News, Oxygen\u2019s \u201cBad Girls Club\u201d, MTV, VH1, Women Who Rock Magazine, Songwriter Universe Magazine, EMI/Songcircle Music, National Songwriters Hall of Fame , and she's performed at Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium. While performing in the subway, Nicola was scouted by EMI, Sony and Billboard Magazine, and was featured and showcased twice in Billboard Magazine\u2019s \u201cUnderground LP\u201d section for Noteworthy Emerging Artists about to break. The lead singer of the popular band \u201cTOTR\u201d on Interscope Records heard her performing at Union Square not long ago, and asked her to sing on the album they were recording at that time. She was briefly signed with Star Crossed Artist Group (\"Third Eye Blind\") and opened up for \"Eve 6\" and Edwin McCain. Nicola is on the development as well as writing and performance teams for several original prospective Broadway-bound musicals, and is endorsed by Martin Guitars Artist Program, Lampifier Microphones and Dovetail Strings.\n\nNicola\u2019s 5th. album \u201cCanyons and Cathedrals\u201d, released October 2012, was a very complete tapestry of some of her most poetic soulful pop/rock music yet. A unique sonic journey from start to finish, the album contains 14 compositions and even includes 1 instrumental piece.\n\nNicola released her latest single \"Back in Pieces October 2017 which was co-written and co-produced by Matt Colligan.\nShe is Composer/Lyricist for a new original Broadway-Bound Musical called \"We are Ameena\" with A2K Productions.\n\nAbove or below ground \u2013 to experience Nicola live is to be drawn in completely by a high-energy pop/rock/soul mix of driving beats, melodies and intelligent lyrics. All this is anchored by her sizzling vocals and rhythmic guitar chops. Nicola\u2019s performances whether full band or \u201cunplugged\u201d reveal an innate ability not just to dazzle an audience with her fiery presence\u2026but to somehow make you part of it\u2026and that\u2019s just the beginning\u2026", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "199 Smith Rd, Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ 07054", "Artist": "The Cr\u00fcxshadows", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8284940.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.412247, 40.861754], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Darkwave, Gothic, Electronic", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Sheraton Parsippany Hotel", "moreBioInfo": "One of the most enduring acts of the entire Darkwave subculture is the Florida based group The Cr\u00fcxshadows. Originally formed in 1992, The Cr\u00fcxshadows have consistently delivered their positive message through the portal of synth pop hooks and dark electronics to a massive international fan base of followers. From their self-released debut, the 1993 album Night Crawls In, right through to the present, The Cr\u00fcxshadows have formulated their success out of old fashioned hard work. They have logged an impressive one thousand plus performances in over thirty countries via their many marathon-like tours.\n\nWith the release of the seminal Telemetry of a Fallen Angel (existing in a few incarnations prior to Dancing Ferret Discs\u2019 version in 1997), The Cr\u00fcxshadows enjoyed their first defining moment courtesy of the infinitely catchy dance floor anthem \u201cMarilyn My Bitterness.\u201d With additional strong releases including The Mystery of the Whisper (1999), Until the Voices Fade (1999) and Paradox Addendum (2000) backed by lengthy tours, The Cr\u00fcxshadows were able to build a legion of diversified fans consisting of everything from jarheads to gamers to anime & role playing enthusiasts.\n\nWhile the lineup has indeed changed over the years, one constant has remained the same; Rogue, the vocalist, leader and mastermind of The Cr\u00fcxshadows has directed his troupe towards an unconventional and lofty goal. \u201cI want to change the world with music, I want people to find hope within themselves. I want them to know that anything is possible if you believe and follow through. I think that music has the power to inspire and move people to do amazing things\u201d he muses. He is not alone in his belief. Their fans seem to believe it too. The bands motto \u201clive love be believe\u201d is everywhere, and many of their supporters will tell you that the lyrics have changed their lives in some way. This isn\u2019t exactly typical for a band most often identified as gothic or dark-wave. The Cr\u00fcxshadows are not concerned. \u201cGoth isn\u2019t about being a stereotype\u201d the front-man complains, \u201cits about being who you want to be... about not running from yourself or your emotions.\u201d The charismatic singer/songwriter/producer understands an audience and tends to deliver his dramatic croon right in their laps. Nothing they do is exactly new, but how they do it is completely unique. The lyrics are deep and meaningful, the stage show is dynamic and entertaining, and the music is hooky and inspired by pop. But pop it is not. It is a hybrid music that exists in a place just left of everyday, and just right of never-ever.\n\nThe band has maintained a surprising consistency despite the personnel turnovers that have plagued it in recent years. Jessica Lackey, a singer/dancer who married Rogue in 2007, and keyboardist Jen Jawidzik, who was once Rogue and Jessica\u2019s roommate, have stuck with it for the better part of the last decade. \"When we have to find someone new, I feel like sometimes they don't understand all the hard work that was necessary for us to get to that point\" Jessica states flatly, \"It is not difficult to under-appreciate everything the band has accomplished, so people move on because they have not invested the same energy into the project.\" While the shows and the music continues to get better, that magically 'permanent' combination of personalities has continued to elude them. The band has had a difficult time keeping guitar players and dancers in particular, but has seen turnover in almost every position. These days Cr\u00fcxshadows has Rogue backed by a mostly female band of new wave latex clad gypsies, and boasts an original mix of violins, dancers, guitars, and electronics.Tight and well-practiced, the seven performers interact on stage with clockwork like precision. The audience is captivated. Some of them scream. Some of them sing along. A few others stare at the stage dumbfounded.\n\nAlthough The Cr\u00fcxshadows maintain a strong fan base in their native United States, their most perceptible success seems to be focused in Europe. It is not uncommon for the band to share stages with the likes of Ladytron, Prodigy, The Cure, or even Bjork. The 2002 Tears EP topped the Deutsche Alternative Charts for months, a practice that has continued with all subsequent releases soaring to the DAC\u2019s Top 10. \"I don't think we're actually more popular there (In Europe)\" says Rogue, \"It just seems like there is more access to our fans. What we do has more acceptance by the powers that be. In America it feels like all of our victories are covered up or are unacknowledged by the media.\" 2002 also saw the release of their fifth full-length album Wishfire; a fan favorite that featured the Euro hit \u201cTears\u201d and a number of other dark dance mainstays. Similarly the follow-up album Ethernaut (released in 2003) brought the band what has become one of its most notable tracks, the European club anthem entitled \u201cWinterborn (This Sacrifice).\u201d\n\nRemixes and special versions of songs have kept there fans satiated when no new traditional album lay on the horizon. In 2004 Fortress In Flames was released featuring a cover by the popular American artist Chad Michael Ward. There The Cr\u00fcxshadows\u2019 material was remixed by peers like the Dutch legends Clan of Xymox and German industrial giants In Strict Confidence. Each year has seen some new disc from the band, and they come in a variety of formats. The year 2005 witnessed the release of their first DVD Shadowbox. The DVD is highlighted by a 2004 performance before a rabid crowd of 15,000 at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig Germany, where the \u2018call and response\u2019 raw energy the band delves out is served right back by an adoring audience.\n\nIn 2006 the band would seem to breakaway from their underground moniker. The addictive single \"Sophia\" impressively debuted on the Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales Charts in September at position #1, replacing Beyonc\u00e9 in the top spot while landing #7 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales Chart. \"We couldn't believe it, doors began to open. It was as if we couldn't be ignored anymore, after a decade and a half we seemed to be getting some respect. The local news in Florida even put us on the nightly news to get our take on the whole thing\", the frontman recalls. The following year was pivotal for The Cr\u00fcxshadows; in May the band successfully toured China performing at the Midi Open-Air Festival in Beijing, in the presence of many thousands of new fans. Later that year the band released the highly anticipated Dreamcypher album that contained yet another Billboard #1 Dance Single with the song \u201cBirthday.\u201d This time the band climbed into the #2 spot on the Hot 100 Singles Sales Chart. With Dreamcypher, The Cr\u00fcxshadows melded their fondness for 1980s Synth Pop/New Romantic sounds with modern Euro dance nuances into perfection. Dreamcypher joins the aforementioned shimmering \u201cSophia\u201d and \u201cBirthday\u201d with the guitar fronted \u201cDefender\u201d and the majestic sounding \u201cEye of the Storm.\u201d The infectious disc would become The Cr\u00fcxshadows\u2019 best selling album to date both in the United States and abroad.\n\nThe following year witnessed another single marching up the Billboard charts. \u201cImmortal\u201d continued the bands musical string of hits, despite the loss of violinist Rachel McDonnell. David Wood and JoHanna Moresco stepped in as an electric violining duo who not only safe-guarded the signature instrument of the band, but expanded it by way of rich layering and counterpoint melodies impossible in previous years. 2008 also saw the collapse of the band\u2019s label Dancing Ferret Discs, which undermined their ability to release a new full length album.\n\nWhile The Cr\u00fcxshadows spent most of 2009 touring in Europe, the band still managed to release yet another successful Billboard charting single in America. \u201cQuicksilver\u201d debuted just in time for their annual appearance at Atlanta\u2019s famed Dragon*Con Convention before an impressive capacity crowd of several thousand of their most loyal fans. \"I think the new single, and really the most recent releases in general, are our most polished and well written work\" says Rogue, \"but there are still those in the scene, and in the business in general, that just think the whole thing is just dumb luck.\" Seemingly too pop for many critics and too underground for the industry, the band has apparently found the perfect balance for the people who matter the most to them; their fans.\n\nThe Cr\u00fcxshadows have played by their own rules, and who is to say in a world of declining sales and illegal internet downloads that they haven\u2019t gotten the balance right. Time will tell. For now, The Cr\u00fcxshadows continue to defy as well as define the odds, and their dark yet positive machine continues to roll.\n\n-by Brian Rogers, for public use.", "otherInfo": "VampireFreaks Presents:\nDark Side of the Con 4\nNorth America's 3-Day Dark-Alternative Convention\n\nLive Performances by:\nThe Birthday Massacre\nCruxshadows\nsuicide commando\nGRENDEL\nDAS ICH BAND\nGod Module\nBella Morte\nEcho Black Ego Likeness The Gothsicles\nThe Rain Within Astari Nite Chmcl Str8jckt\nMethodical Devil-M DaGeist Ghostfeeder\n00tz 00tz Die Robot Cliff and Ivy Stoneburner\nAbbey Death Peter Turns Pirate Tragic Impulse\nThe Mary Lous Red Lokust\n\nFeatured Performers & Guests:\nDan Sperry Anti-Conjuror\nLive Bats by: The BATCAVE at The WILD Life!

Even so, the prevailing assumption is that musicians working under this broad umbrella must be inspired by concepts equally as electrified as their equipment. Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith has demonstrated in her still-blooming discography that this notion couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, and that more often than not, rich worlds of synthesized sound are born from deep reverence of the natural world. Smith (who by no coincidence, cites naturalist David Attenborough as a contemporary muse) has embodied such an appreciation on The Kid in as direct and sincere a way as possible by sonically charting the phases of life itself. The album, which punctually follows up her 2016 breakthrough EARS, chronicles four defining cognitive and emotional stages of the human lifespan across four sides of a double LP.\n\nThe first side takes us through the confused astonishment of a newborn, unaware of itself, existing in an unwitting nirvana. Smith\u2019s music has always woven a youthful thread befitting of the aforementioned subject. Here she articulates it in signature fashion on the track \u201cAn Intention,\u201d which serves not only as a soaring spire on The Kid, but on her entire output. There is playfulness here, but it's elevated by an undertone of gravity into something compelling and majestic that is fast becoming Smith\u2019s watermark. The emotional focus of side two is the vital but underreported moment in early youth when we cross the threshold into self awareness. The subject is profound enough to fill an entire album, but rarely makes its way into a single track, indicating Smith\u2019s ambition to broach subtler and deeper subjects than the average composer. This side offers up another highlight in the form of \u201cIn The World But Not Of The World\u201d which serves its subject well with epiphanic, climbing strings and decidedly noisy textures over a near-Bollywood low end pulse.\n\nSide three emphasizes a feeling of being confirmed enough in one\u2019s own identity to begin giving back to the formative forces of one\u2019s upbringing, which is arguably the duty that all great artists aim to fulfill. This side ends with the exploratory album cut \u201cWho I Am & Why I Am Where I Am\u201d recorded in a single take without overdubs on the rare EMS Synthi 100 synthesizer. This humble piece of sound design serves as a contrast to side four\u2019s verdant orchestral moments, all written and arranged for the EU-based Stargaze quartet by Smith herself. This final side represents a return to pure being, the kind of wisdom and peace that eludes most of us until the autumn of life. On \u201cTo Feel Your Best\u201d this concept is voiced in the bittersweet refrain \u201cone day I\u2019ll wake up and you won\u2019t be there\u201d which Smith intended to be a grateful acknowledgement of life rather than a melancholy resentment of loss. The song has both effects depending on the mood of the listener, and both interpretations are equally moving.\n\nKaitlyn Aurelia Smith belongs to an ilk of modern musicians who are defined by their commitment to creating experiential albums despite the singles-oriented habits of modern listeners, and here she represents her kind proudly. The subjects on The Kid are not simple to convey, and yet through both emotional tone and lyrical content, Smith does just that. There is a similar gravity to both birth and death, and rarely is that correlation as accurately and enthusiastically mapped as it is here.

The single to be released in January 2017 is a cry out for idle Christians to get back on the job of ministering the word of Christ.\nAs a faith-based rapper, Constant Battle knew that his calling extended beyond the secular world of hip-hop. His passion for music has evolved and constantly shows in the way he expresses others to enjoy Christ through song. While the single \u201cOn Our Job\u201d is the debut single released, listeners will get the chance to hear Constant Battle\u2019s desire for Christians to show love, grace, mercy and more.\nConstant Battle has aspired to inspire others through not only his music, but through his personal testimony. Working with local artists in Buffalo and even co-directing videos, his testimony shines through his crafty metaphors and slick lines. In 2009, Battle\u2019s first studio album \u201cAre You Ready Pt.1\u201d was released followed by a flux of mixtapes for his fans. His current project isn\u2019t just considered a follow-up, but more of a sigh of relief for the built up anticipation since album number one.\n\nFor more information about \u201cOn Our Job\u201d and Constant Battle, please visit www.constantbattle.net.\n###\n\nMedia Contact:\n(phone) 716-444-1129\n(Email) cbcore30@gmail.com\n(social media) @constantbattle1\n\n\nStay Connected with Constant Battle: www.facebook.com/ConstantBattle1 , www.twitter.com/ConstantBattle1 , www.youtube.com/cbda30, www.instagram.com/ConstantBattle1, www.noisetrade.com/ConstantBattle1, www.hulkshare.com/ConstantBattle1", "otherInfo": "Join Constant Battle, Serious Voice, Terrell Pitts Music and C.

As an artist, Southside Johnny first achieved prominence in the mid-1970s as the second act to emerge from the Jersey Shore music scene and be considered part of the Jersey Shore sound, following Bruce Springsteen. Southside's first three albums, I Don't Want to Go Home (1976), This Time It's For Real (1977), and Hearts of Stone (1978), were Stax-influenced R&B arranged and produced by the co-founder of the band and Springsteen confederate Steven Van Zandt and largely featured songs written by Van Zandt and/or Springsteen. The Van Zandt-written \"I Don't Want To Go Home\" became Southside's signature song, an evocative mixture of horn-based melodic riffs and sentimental lyrics. Other notable songs included \"The Fever\",\"Talk to Me,\" \"This Time It's For Real,\" \"Love on the Wrong Side of Town,\" and the definitive version of Springsteen's \" Hearts of Stone.\"\n\nSouthside has long been considered the Grandfather of \"the New Jersey Sound.\" Jon bon Jovi has acknowledged Southside as \"his reason for singing.\"\n\nIn 1982 the Rolling Stone Magazine voted the album Hearts of Stone among the top 100 albums of the 70's and 80's.\n\nCast under Springsteen's long shadow, national commercial success eluded Southside and the Jukes, and in 1979 they were dropped by their record company. Now working without Van Zandt, they released The Jukes in 1979 and Love is a Sacrifice in 1980. Neither of these achieved much success either. The band's first official live release also came out in 1980, the double album Reach Up and Touch the Sky.\n\nDuring the 1980s Southside Johnny's recording contracts continued to change almost by album, but he continued to release records: Trash It Up (1983), a disco influenced album written by Billy Rush and produced by Nile Rodgers; In the Heat (1984) an album trying to reach out to \"Adult Oriented Radio\"; and At Least We Got Shoes (1986) where guitarist and Jersey shore fixture Bobby Bandiera, who often plays a custom guitar built by First Act Guitars took over songwriting and guitar work from Billy Rush and led the Asbury Jukes back to their original sound. Songwriting credits on At Least We Got Shoes also contain a song co-written by Bandiera and singer Patti Scialfa, who was known as a Jukes collaborator since the 1980 album Love is a Sacrifice and who became a member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band in 1984.\n\nIn 1988 Southside Johnny released his first solo record Slow Dance containing ballads and love songs, but also \"Little Calcutta\" which is still discussed as Southside's most political song of his career, describing the life and environment of the homeless in New York City.\n\nMore record label switches, Jukes personnel changes, tours and club dates followed.\n\nHis recording career was re-launched with the album Better Days (1991), which featured production by Van Zandt, songs by Springsteen, and vocal performances from Van Zandt, Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi. With Bobby Bandiera driving the band, the Jukes were gaining new energy for a world wide tour supporting the album. But once again, Southside Johnny's bad luck with the industry was shown when the record label went bankrupt while the tour was still rolling.\n\nSouthside performed the theme song for the 1990s sitcom Dave's World, a cover of Billy Joel's \"You May Be Right.\"\n\nSouthside eventually relocated to Nashville taking a break from the music business. A few members of the Asbury Jukes would end up being part of The Max Weinberg 7 on the Late Night with Conan O'Brien television show, while some others went on tour and into the recording studio with artists like Jon Bon Jovi, Mink DeVille, Graham Parker, Robert Cray.\n\nIn 1998 Southside Johnny came back into the spotlight with an independent release titled Spittin' Fire, a live record with a semi-acoustic Jukes lineup released in France containing a 20 song set recorded during a series of 10 shows at the \"Chesterfield Caf\u00e9\" in Paris, France.\n\nAfter a decade without a record contract Southside finally founded his own record label in 2001 under the name of Leroy Records, and started releasing and distributing his new records fully under his own control: Messin' with the Blues (2000), Going to Jukesville (2002), Missing Pieces (2004), Into the Harbour (2005).\n\nSouthside continues to perform, and maintains substantial audience followings in some regions of the U.S., such as New Jersey, New York, northeast Ohio, and abroad, in the UK and continental Europe, as 2002's Live At The Opera House DVD, filmed at a sell-out performance in Newcastle upon Tyne, demonstrates. As of 2005, he resides on the Delaware Bay. His annual appearances at Springsteen's Asbury Park holiday shows draw as much crowd excitement as Springsteen himself.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "5 Seymour St., Montclair, NJ 07042", "Artist": "South Side Johnny", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-74.216499, 40.812501], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Wellmont Theater", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "5 Seymour St., Montclair, NJ 07042", "Artist": "the Asbury Jukes", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-74.216499, 40.812501], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Wellmont Theater", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "66 Park Ave, New York, NY 10016", "Artist": "Drummer Mike Clark", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7721160.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.979858, 40.749544], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Jazz - Funk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Jazz at Kitano", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cHe\u2019s a great jazz drummer\u2014and he hasn\u2019t lost any of the stuff that he brought from Oakland. So now he\u2019s totally free to do both, and he does. The solo he played on the album Thrust, on the song \u201cActual Proof,\u201d is one of the best drum solos on any of my albums. So many people have remarked about that solo, saying, \u2018Incredible.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n-Herbie Hancock\n\nMIKE CLARK DRUMMER / BAND LEADER\n\nMIKE CLARK gained worldwide recognition as one of America\u2019s foremost jazz and funk drummers while playing with Herbie Hancock\u2019s group in the early 1970\u2019s. Mike became known as a major innovator through his incisive playing on Hancock\u2019s Thrust album, which garnered him an international cult following.\n\nWhile often referred to as the \u201cTony Williams of funk\u201d, Mike considers himself a jazz drummer, and in fact has become one of the most vital to sit behind a set. He's performed with jazz greats such as Herbie Hancock, Chet Baker, Vince Guaraldi, Tony Bennett, Wayne Shorter, Joe Henderson, Eddie Henderson, Rob Dixon, Bobby Hutcherson, Woody Shaw, Donald Harrison, Larry Coryell, Jack Wilkins, Mike Wolff, Wallace Roney, Geri Allen, Billy Childs, James Genus, Bob Hurst, Chris Potter, Onaje Allan Gumbs, Bobby McFerrin, Al Jarreau, Dave Liebman, Nat Adderly, Oscar Brown Jr., Bill Doggett, Nicholas Payton, Christian McBride, Mose Allison, Maxine Brown, Gil Evans and his orchestra and many illuminating etceteras too numerous to list.\n\nBorn in Sacramento, CA, while growing up Mike had the benefit of traveling around the country with his father, a union man for the railroad. He was also a drummer at one time and had a keen ear, a killing record collection, and a great appreciation for music. This allowed the younger Clark to soak up the diverse regional music of the United States, which he credits as providing an invaluable education. Clark was a prodigy as well, picking up his first sticks at the tender age of five and sitting in--and getting \u201chouse\u201d --with bands in Texas and New Orleans when he was as young as 7 and 8.\n\nHe continued to play in a variety of blues, R&B, organ trios, and jazz bands, settling in Oakland, CA, until his introduction to Herbie Hancock and his recruitment into the Headhunters in 1973.\n\nAt the tail end of the 70\u2018s and in 1980, shortly before moving to New York City, Mike did a short but remarkable stint with Brand X, the acclaimed British fusion band founded by Phil Collins, doing two tours and recording their seminal Do They Hurt? and Product.\n\nThe winter of 2000 saw him diversifying his efforts with a foray into the popular jam band scene. His group Prescription Renewal electrified audiences across the country with an eclectic core of cross- generational multi talents, such as Charlie Hunter, Fred Wesley, Skerik, Robert Walter, and DJ Logic, and featured special guests such as George Porter Jr. of Funky Meters\u2019 fame, Kyle Hollingsworth of String Cheese Incident, Les Claypool, Will Bernard, Larry Goldings and fellow Headhunters alumni, Bill Summers, and proved a hit on the thriving young jam band scene. He followed that with several successful tours of the Roots Funk All Stars, another hot ad hoc association that married Mike with James Brown trombonist Fred Wesley, former Headhunter cohort and funk bassist legend Paul Jackson, Dr. Lonnie Smith and Robben Ford.\n\nNext to James Brown's drummer Clyde Stubblefield, Mike's beats with The Headhunters (most notably on \"God Make Me Funky\") are some of the most sampled in hip hop. Featured in Downbeat, Musician, International Musician & Recording World, Modern Drummer, Jazz Times, Guitar Player, Jazz Is and numerous jazz history and method books, Mike is a former faculty member of Drummers Collective, and is a popular and busy clinician around the country. His book Funk Drumming: Innovative Grooves & Advanced Concepts was published last year by Hal Leonard and is a best seller.\n\nHis numerous recording credits include albums with Herbie Hancock, the Headhunters, Brand X, Eddie Henderson, Jack Wilkins, Mark Puricelli, Mike Wolff, and Alien Army, a group led by guitar great Jack Wilkins. As a bandleader, his release Give The Drummer Some was very enthusiastically received, earning a rare four and a half stars in Downbeat, as was The Funk Stops Here, a joint effort with Hancock alumni Paul Jackson. In 2001, his solo CD, Actual Proof met with critical acclaim, as did the 2003 acoustic jazz release, Summertime, featuring Chris Potter and Billy Childs, which spent many weeks in the top ten charts.\n\nOther efforts included a compilation of his legendary, innovative funk beat samples, Mike Clark\u2014The Headhunter, a re-release of the widely acclaimed Thrust album, and, in 1998, The Return Of The Headhunters, featuring Herbie Hancock. Next came Herbie Hancock\u2019s Box Set, featuring Headhunters classics \u201cActual Proof\u201d and \u201cButterfly,\u201d from Thrust, a few choice cuts from Manchild, and also some historical tracks from the classic Flood, previously only available in Japan. The Headhunters\u2019 newest effort, Evolution/Revolution, released in 2003, featured the latest Headhunter configuration, with original founding members Mike, Bill Summers and Paul Jackson, joined by Donald Harrison, Victor Atkins (Los Hombres Caliente), and Nicholas Payton.\n\nHis 2009 release Blueprints of Jazz, Vol. I produced by Talking House Productions, which featured Christian McBride, Donald Harrison, Patrice Rushen, Jed Levy and Christian Scott, was received with critical acclaim and named one of the best recordings of the decade by Downbeat.\n\nHis latest effort, Carnival of Soul released June 11th by Owl Records and climbing the charts, was described by the Indianapolis Star as \u201ca jazz party with a kaleidoscopic array of players.\u201d Those players include guest turns by renowned country blues singer Delbert McClinton, fellow drumming icon Lenny White, tenor player Rob Dixon, and three separate organ-based ensembles offering up some delicious soul-infused jazz.\n\nA true original, Mike\u2019s work continues to delight and astound his fans around the world.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "627 5th Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Lee A.

Ceaselessly exploring new territory and expanding his personal sonic vocabulary, Akinmusire has from the beginning of his young but remarkable career staked his place at the vanguard of jazz and artistic expression.\n\nThe winner of both the 2007 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition and the 2007 Carmine Caruso International Jazz Trumpet Solo Competition, Akinmusire has proved himself one of the most vital and deft trumpeters of his generation. He was named Rising Star Jazz Artist and Rising Star Trumpet in DownBeat Magazine\u2019s 2011 Critics Poll, graduating to Trumpet Player of the Year in 2012. He earned the same title in that year\u2019s Jazz Journalists Association awards, as well as being awarded Germany\u2019s ECHO Award as Instrumentalist of the Year, International Brass.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal called Akinmusire \u201can exciting, original trumpeter who works in a diverse range of contemporary styles;\u201d Billboard declared him \u201cthe brightest beacon on the trumpet, the sharpest in a few decades.\u201d According to the Village Voice, \u201chis daring shapes the sound of his incessant searching,\u201d while the All Music Guide asserts that, \u201cEvery so often a trumpeter comes along who redraws the instrument's role within jazz: Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Clifford Brown, Chet Baker, Wynton Marsalis, Freddie Hubbard, etc. Ambrose Akinmusire has the potential to join that crowd.\u201d\n\nAkinmusire\u2019s two CDs, Prelude to Cora (Fresh Sound New Talent) and When the Heart Emerges Glistening (Blue Note), were both met with critical acclaim, marking him as a composer and conceptualist to watch. The latter album topped critics\u2019 lists including the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and Allmusic.com. NPR Music referred to When the Heart Emerges Glistening as \u201ca svelte and darkly modernistic disc highlighted by Akinmusire's clarion solos,\u201d while the New York Times hailed it as \u201cone of this year\u2019s standout jazz releases.\u201d The album earned Akinmusire France\u2019s Grand Prix l\u2019Academie du Jazz.\n\nThe nomadic trumpeter has traced a zigzagging pattern between coasts from his native California to the hectic jazz capital of New York. He can currently be found in Los Angeles, where he\u2019s teaching at University of Southern California\u2019s Thornton School of Music. He has played on stages around the globe, including in India, Vietnam, Australia, Turkey, Japan, and Brazil, and at international festivals such as the North Sea Jazz Festival, Copenhagen Jazz Festival, Umbria Jazz Festival, and Barcelona Jazz Festival.\n\nAkinmusire\u2019s forward-reaching compositions have earned him a commission from New York\u2019s Jazz Gallery and grants from the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s MAP Fund and Chamber Music America\u2019s French-American Jazz Exchange Program. In 2011, he debuted his star-studded Big Band on one of the world\u2019s most renowned stages, Carnegie Hall. The following year he was named Artist-in-Residence at the 55th annual Monterey Jazz Festival.\n\n\nThe son of a father from Nigeria and a mother from Mississippi, Akinmusire was raised in Oakland, California, where his spiritual and musical path was set during near-daily visits to church with his mother and grandmother. Every time they entered the building, young Ambrose would run to the piano, which his family accepted as a sign of his musical inclinations. He began playing piano at the age of three, switching to drums in the fifth grade and finally to the trumpet the following year.\n\nDuring middle school, Akinmusire attended a jazz camp run by local Bay Area musicians, which fully exposed him to the music whose expansive parameters were broad enough for his ambitious imagination. Through the connections forged there he had the opportunity to meet and play with greats like Billy Higgins, Sonny Simmons and Joe Henderson. At Berkeley High School he met Joshua Redman and Steve Coleman, who enlisted the young trumpeter to tour Europe with his band Five Elements.\n\nA full scholarship to the Manhattan School of Music led to Akinmusire\u2019s first move to New York, followed by a return to the west coast to earn his master\u2019s degree at USC and to attend the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz. After finishing school and winning the Monk competition, he returned to New York, where he\u2019s worked with a stunning array of jazz\u2019s finest musicians.\n\nAkinmusire\u2019s main outlet is his quintet with drummer and childhood friend Justin Brown, bassist Harish Raghavan, saxophonist Walter Smith III, and pianist Sam Harris. The band is skilled and flexible enough to evolve with Akinmusire and to follow his lead. The Los Angeles Times wrote that the band, \u201cdemonstrated a remarkably fluid, adventurous interplay and patiently imaginative way with melody that sounded as steeped in the music's history as it was hard-wired with the sound of something new.\u201d Alongside the group, however, he continues to branch into other avenues, necessary for an artist whose influences encompass Wayne Shorter and Bjork, Joni Mitchell and Pina Bausch, Ravel and Marina Abramovic.\n\nAkinmusire\u2019s music overflows with both beauty and rigor, profound personal feeling and fiery virtuoso playing. What one hears throughout his work is an artist plumbing the depths of himself and the world around him, coming to understand the workings of his own mind and the mysteries of nature. Both of those terrains are boundless, and Akinmusire is determined to follow them as far afield as they lead.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "627 West 51st Street, New York City, NY 10019", "Artist": "MC Mirella", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.99551, 40.767052], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Loft 51", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "66 E 4th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Marina Elana", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8419772.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.990441, 40.726497], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "La Mama Experimental Theatre Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "613 Main St, Boonton, NJ 07005", "Artist": "Hodera", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8071666.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.410548, 40.905068], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Matthew Smith (lead vocals and guitar), Doug Gallo (lead guitar), Scott Tilley (lead drums), Alek Mager (lead bass)", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "BoonTunes", "moreBioInfo": "collectively 616 in dog years", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "319 Frost St, Brooklyn, NY", "Artist": "Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8480779.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.938692, 40.719277], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Electropop, Ambient, Electronica", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Steel", "moreBioInfo": "In 2017, the musical term \u201celectronic\u201d is nearly obsolete given the ubiquity of computerized processes in producing music. Even so, the prevailing assumption is that musicians working under this broad umbrella must be inspired by concepts equally as electrified as their equipment. Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith has demonstrated in her still-blooming discography that this notion couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, and that more often than not, rich worlds of synthesized sound are born from deep reverence of the natural world. Smith (who by no coincidence, cites naturalist David Attenborough as a contemporary muse) has embodied such an appreciation on The Kid in as direct and sincere a way as possible by sonically charting the phases of life itself. The album, which punctually follows up her 2016 breakthrough EARS, chronicles four defining cognitive and emotional stages of the human lifespan across four sides of a double LP.\n\nThe first side takes us through the confused astonishment of a newborn, unaware of itself, existing in an unwitting nirvana. Smith\u2019s music has always woven a youthful thread befitting of the aforementioned subject. Here she articulates it in signature fashion on the track \u201cAn Intention,\u201d which serves not only as a soaring spire on The Kid, but on her entire output. There is playfulness here, but it's elevated by an undertone of gravity into something compelling and majestic that is fast becoming Smith\u2019s watermark. The emotional focus of side two is the vital but underreported moment in early youth when we cross the threshold into self awareness. The subject is profound enough to fill an entire album, but rarely makes its way into a single track, indicating Smith\u2019s ambition to broach subtler and deeper subjects than the average composer. This side offers up another highlight in the form of \u201cIn The World But Not Of The World\u201d which serves its subject well with epiphanic, climbing strings and decidedly noisy textures over a near-Bollywood low end pulse.\n\nSide three emphasizes a feeling of being confirmed enough in one\u2019s own identity to begin giving back to the formative forces of one\u2019s upbringing, which is arguably the duty that all great artists aim to fulfill. This side ends with the exploratory album cut \u201cWho I Am & Why I Am Where I Am\u201d recorded in a single take without overdubs on the rare EMS Synthi 100 synthesizer. This humble piece of sound design serves as a contrast to side four\u2019s verdant orchestral moments, all written and arranged for the EU-based Stargaze quartet by Smith herself. This final side represents a return to pure being, the kind of wisdom and peace that eludes most of us until the autumn of life. On \u201cTo Feel Your Best\u201d this concept is voiced in the bittersweet refrain \u201cone day I\u2019ll wake up and you won\u2019t be there\u201d which Smith intended to be a grateful acknowledgement of life rather than a melancholy resentment of loss. The song has both effects depending on the mood of the listener, and both interpretations are equally moving.\n\nKaitlyn Aurelia Smith belongs to an ilk of modern musicians who are defined by their commitment to creating experiential albums despite the singles-oriented habits of modern listeners, and here she represents her kind proudly. The subjects on The Kid are not simple to convey, and yet through both emotional tone and lyrical content, Smith does just that. There is a similar gravity to both birth and death, and rarely is that correlation as accurately and enthusiastically mapped as it is here. As Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith explores her existence through music, she guides us in gleefully contemplating our own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "66 E 4th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Marina Elana", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8419772.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.990441, 40.726497], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "La Mama Experimental Theatre Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "341 St Nicholas Ave, Ridgewood, NY 11385", "Artist": "Los Diablitos del Vallenato", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.909658, 40.700579], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "El Manaba", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Los Diablitos del Vallenato en Concierto"}, {"Address": "613 Main St, Boonton, NJ 07005", "Artist": "Hodera", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8071666.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.410548, 40.905068], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Matthew Smith (lead vocals and guitar), Doug Gallo (lead guitar), Scott Tilley (lead drums), Alek Mager (lead bass)", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "BoonTunes", "moreBioInfo": "collectively 616 in dog years", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Jonny G", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Noah Gundersen w/ Jonny G - Rockwood Stage 2"}, {"Address": "289 10th Ave St, New York, NY 10001", "Artist": "Lost Frequencies", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10027767.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.002675, 40.750051], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Lost Frequencies", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Marquee New York", "moreBioInfo": "Felix De Laet, better known by his moniker Lost Frequencies, has soared to success in the international music industry over the past half-decade.

His string of hit singles, millions of albums sold, and a 28-year recording career aside, Stigers\u2019 commitment to artistic growth, and to bringing new tunes to the Great American Songbook, has become unparalleled in modern music.\n\nBarnstorming concert halls, festivals and clubs everywhere from Moscow to Manhattan, accompanied one night by his quartet, another by big band or orchestra, Stigers continues to release new work nearly every year, frequently collaborating with his musical heroes. Along the way, this musician who began his career playing standards in a Boise hotel lobby while moonlighting as drummer in a punk rock band has redefined the constitution of contemporary jazz singing.\n\n\u201cI was the kid who worshipped songs and the musicians who wrote and recorded them,\u201d he remembers. \u201cBack then, pop radio played everything from Aretha Franklin to Led Zeppelin, Marvin Gaye to Willie Nelson, Joni Mitchell to Elton John. I loved it all, and I studied it.\u201d Often euphoric and always elegant, Stigers possesses a curator\u2019s knack for hearing a song, framing its heart, and making it his own\u2014be it the work of Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Wilco, or The Kinks.\n\nStigers\u2019 repertoire is a reflection of his appreciation for the fundaments of tone and craft, and for quality\u2014the progression of his work is both organic and practical. \u201cJazz songs used to be pop songs. Jazz has always been about reinvention,\u201d Stigers notes.\n\nPerhaps because he has penned so many notable songs himself, as well as writing with the likes of legends like Carole King and Barry Mann, Stigers has come to recognize the small, perfect things that are a great melody and lyric, and how to capture them. That songwriting talent also led to an Emmy nomination for co-writing and singing the theme song to the wildly successful TV series Sons Of Anarchy.\n\nIt is his rich singing voice, however\u2014singular, balletic, and at turns both mournful and playful\u2014that has landed him on records with the likes of Al Green, Shawn Colvin, in studios with venerated producers like Larry Klein, Danny Kortchmar, and Glen Ballard, and on stages and concert bills with a plethora of legends, including pop and rock greats Eric Clapton, Elton John, Bonnie Raitt, Prince, Rod Stewart and The Allman Brothers, and jazz giants Nancy Wilson, Al Jarreau, Gerry Mulligan, Randy and Michael Brecker, Chuck Mangione, Toots Thielmans, Wynton and Branford Marsalis, Kurt Elling, Diana Krall, John Scofield, and many more.\n\nAfter being mentored in his early years by legendary jazz pianist Gene Harris, and by the great jazz singer Mark Murphy, his unique talent was recognized by music business impresario Clive Davis, who signed Stigers to a record deal after hearing him in a New York restaurant. A debut album sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide on the strength of self-penned hit singles like \u201cI Wonder Why,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re All That Matters to Me,\u201d and \u201cNever Saw a Miracle.\u201d A year later, Stigers contributed a cover version of Nick Lowe\u2019s \u201c(What\u2019s So Funny \u2018Bout) Peace Love and Understanding\u201d to The Bodyguard soundtrack, which has sold over 40 million copies worldwide. Multiple appearances on The Tonight Show, The Late Show With David Letterman, The Today Show, and countless international TV shows, put Stigers directly in the spotlight of popular culture.

First and foremost, I was a fan, being fortunate to see them play live many times over the last ten years (yes ten years!! Where did that go?) and continually they astonish at how much they give. Playing each and every time as if their lives depended on it. If you\u2019ve never seen them live, I urge you to please make the effort. Trust me, it\u2019ll stay with you forever.\n\nSimply, they\u2019re four funny, generous and extremely grounded blokes who still can\u2019t believe their luck and who continually strive for brilliance, but now a decade in it\u2019s time for us to take stock and celebrate just how much their music has shadowed and enriched our daily lives. Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, I give you, the wondrous Keane.\u201d\n\n----\n\nNot many British bands these days have more than one big-selling album, let alone five. Fewer still manage to replicate - and maintain - that success outside the UK. And only a tiny number are able to continually develop their sound as their career progresses. But, in the last decade, Keane have achieved all of those things and a whole lot more. After selling over 11 million copies of their five consecutive Number One records, with their four award winning albums and their 8 track EP \u2018Night Train\u2019, it is no exaggeration to say that Keane are firmly established as one of the world's most successful, innovative and cherished bands.\n\nWhen Keane first got together all those years ago, three of the bands they most admired were the Beatles, Radiohead and Blur. What made all of those acts special was that although nobody could ever predict what they'd do next, you knew it would be worth hearing. Over the release of their five albums that's an exclusive club to which Keane have surely now gained membership.\n\nTracklisting for \u2018The Best Of Keane\u2019 below, revealing the story of one of the biggest bands of the decade;\n\nTrack 1. Everybody\u2019s Changing\n\n1997, Battle, Hastings, seaside small-town England. Keane, a struggling trio from the aptly-named Battle, take five years to be discovered \u201covernight\u201d in December 2002 at the Betsey Trotwood pub, east London, by Simon Williams, founder of the atom-sized though astronomically influential Fierce Panda label. Signed in 2003, that year is dominated by America, a glitzy showbiz caterwaul of Black Eyed Peas, Beyonc\u00e9, Avril Lavigne, Justin Timberlake, Eminem and Christina Aguilera. The quintessentially British Keane, by comparison (also championed by Radio 1's Steve Lamacq) wear their hearts on their vulnerably-fraying sleeves and release debut independent single \u2018Everybody's Changing\u2019 in April 2003 before signing to the mighty Island major and releasing world-class epic piano-rock anthem \u2018Somewhere Only We Know\u2019 in early 2004. Debut album \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019 follows, an instantaneous, British rock phenomenon, a soaring rapture of euphoric melancholy which swathes the planet. A UK No.1 album, Keane bloom in a brand new landscape, a post-Britpop era of emotional sensitivity, which dominates the rest of the decade.\n\n\u201cWe're the post-OK Computer generation,\u201d notes Tim Rice-Oxley, Keane's gifted songwriter, lyricist and pianist, of the '97 Radiohead classic. \u201cFor me, that was the album of our generation. We've grown up appreciating the power of a song that can unlock you. And we're all men, I guess, who probably wouldn't otherwise let go. That's our cornerstone. It's just good to feel you're not alone.\u201d\n\nTrack 2. Somewhere Only We Know\n\n2006-2012, four more albums, four heroically different directions. Post \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019, Keane detonate their own blueprint. Like Blur and Radiohead, they've the confidence to diversify: through \u2018Under The Iron Sea\u2019 (2006, portentous document of splintering inter-band relationships), \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 (2008, ambitious experiment in conscience-rock and glittering electro-pop, recorded in Berlin), the \u2018Night Train\u2019 EP (further sonic experiments and lyrical ennui, recorded on the road) and \u2018Strangeland\u2019 (2012, piano-rock progressions on a rousing, reflective sojourn through human relationships and what it means to be 30-something men). \u2018The Best Of Keane\u2019, therefore, is more than just a greatest hits (and there's plenty of them): a compendium of Classic Keane Anthems plus band favourites, fan favourites, live favourites and two new tracks (\u2018Higher Than the Sun\u2019, \u2018Won't Be Broken\u2019), featuring the stunning hymnal \u2018Hamburg Song\u2019 and the glorious reverie \u2018My Shadow\u2019. To date Keane have sold over 11 million albums worldwide, their five albums to date consecutive UK No.1s.\n\n\u201cI'm very proud of the variety on the \u2018Best Of\u2019,\u201d notes Tim. \u201cYou've got the Keane anthems, then something like \u2018Hamburg Song\u2019 which is deeply emotional. \u2018Atlantic\u2019 is weird, sonically ambitious. Same with \u2018Spiralling\u2019 (voted 2008 Song Of The Year by Q magazine). \u2018Silenced By The Night\u2019 covers my craving for American open highway epic rock songs. It's hasn't just been \u2018Somewhere Only We Know\u2019 times sixteen. There's a lyrical reflection of our lives and the way they've changed, in a really true way.\u201d\n\nTrack 3. Bend and Break\n\n2012, Brazil. Tom Chaplin, a man whose astonishingly powerful archangel vocals puncture the human heart with a shard of purest yearning, awakes in a hotel bed. He's poleaxed, once again, by the malady which typifies the global touring colossus Keane have long become: stratospheric jet lag. \u201cI had literally no sense of self,\u201d he boggles. \u201cI couldn't have told you what my name was, what day it was, what year it was.\u201d\n\nTrack 4. Bedshaped\n\n700 shows in over 40 countries worldwide. Keane have now played in over forty individual countries: America, Russia, South America, Indonesia, Asia, the Middle East, Australia, Japan, all across Europe, over and over again. In South Korea they're known as The Autumn Band with all the wistful melancholy, melodic richness and emotional metamorphosis that implies. Their fans unfurl 'Welcome' flags in trees outside their hotels, tattoo their art-work and lyrics on their bodies, hold birthday parties in their honour, in Brazil (when they're not even in Brazil) and send lengthy letters saying their music has \u201csaved my life\u201d. Keane are a universal soul band.\n\nTrack 5. This Is The Last Time\n\n2004, Glastonbury. Newly back from their inaugural tour of America, Keane had left a Britain where their biggest-ever show was at The Forum, Kentish Town (capacity 2,000). \u201cWe got to Glastonbury and 20 thousand people were singing all our songs, it was electrifying,\u201d beams Tim. \u201cBefore that, we had no sense whatsoever what it was like for our music to be everywhere.\u201d\n\nTrack 6. Atlantic\n\n2005, Madison Square Gardens, New York City. Keane support U2 over five nights and Larry Mullen Jnr, shows Keane drummer Richard Hughes how he sets his kit up (with a view to minimising injury). \u201cOne of my absolute heroes,\u201d marvels Rich. \u201cAnd I'm sitting at his drum kit, at Madison Square Gardens. Mind-blowing.\u201d\n\nTrack 7. Is It Any Wonder?\n\nAt the core of Keane lies a precious creative affinity, a vocal gift which interprets emotional music with a stunning synchronicity. \u201cIt's very rare,\u201d notes Tom, \u201cthat both a singer and song-writer have that, together.\u201d Tom feels he can sing like this because he battles, as all proper singers do, \u201cinsecurity, vulnerability and fear of the world, coupled with the ability to stand in front of thousands of people and pour it all out: those two extremes are the beating heart of most singers\u201d. No wonder fellow artists love them: Paul McCartney, Pharrell Williams, Bono, Lily Allen, John Mayer, Nicole Scherzinger, Chris Martin, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gwen Stefani, Zach Braff, novelist Brett Easton Ellis, Kanye West and Snoop Dogg.\n\nTrack 8. Nothing In My Way\n\nApril 2013, BBC Radio 2, London. \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019 is voted No.2 in the 100 Favourite Albums Of All Time by listeners of the UK's mighty Radio 2. Nothing stands in their way (apart from Coldplay at No.1), beating their all-time heroes: Simon & Garfunkel, Bruce Springsteen, The Beatles, REM, U2, Abba...\n\n\u201cTen years down the line and our vulnerability has been our saving grace,\u201d decides Tom. \u201cIt's something that can't be affected by changing fashions. Because that's a human truth.\u201d\n\nTrack 9. Hamburg Song\n\n2008, Germany. Keane love Germany, especially Berlin. \u201cA city which has picked itself up time and time again is so inspirational,\u201d says Tim. \u201cIts history, its creativity, its innovation, its spirit of reconciliation, is also the spirit of the band.\u201d They recorded third album \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 at Teldex Studios in Berlin.\n\nTrack 10. Crystal Ball\n\n2006 onwards, everywhere. As well as old-school universal songwriters, Keane are new-school pioneers: one of the first bands ever to release a single on a USB stick (\u2018Nothing In My Way\u2019, 2006): an acoustic gig on the Great Wall of China (in conjunction with the innovative Burberry, 2011): the first band to stream a 3D live show. \u201cNot bad,\u201d notes Rich, \u201cfor a band who started out playing The Crypt in Hastings.\u201d\n\nTrack 11. A Bad Dream\n\n2005, Helioscentric Studios, Rye, Sussex. Keane record second album \u2018Under The Iron Sea\u2019, lyrically much of which is political and social comment on the modern world, songs such as \u2018A Bad Dream\u2019 and \u2018Is It Any Wonder?\u2019 question the heroics of war. These themes are also present on some of the following album \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 in songs \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 and \u2018Better Than This\u2019 for example. In 2007 the band become War Child ambassadors and curate a night at Brixton Academy in aid of the charity, featuring Pet Shop Boys, Lily Allen and Guillemots amongst others.\n\nTrack 12. Try Again\n\n2012, Japan. Tom knows more than most what it's like to try again. \u201cThe good old days didn't really work for me, \u201cI didn't really appreciate how brilliant everything was, in the beginning,\u201d muses the ever-philosophical Tom. \u201cI don't think I was grown up enough, then.\u201d he laughs, over breakfast in Japan. \u201cBut now I feel the happiest I've ever felt. In my whole life.\u201d\n\nTrack 13. Spiralling\n\nFrom the very beginning. Of a decade's extraordinary moments, Tim cherishes the ones with his band mates most. \u201cI've a photo on my sitting room wall where we're in Brazil just completely pissing ourselves, basically,\u201d he smiles. \u201cThat for me is the ultimate. Such a simple thing. Being with my friends, laughing, a lot.\u201d\n\nTrack 14. Perfect Symmetry\n\nArt, always. Keane know how to collaborate, choosing dazzling minds to enhance their singular vision: novelist/force of nature Irvine Welsh (director of the foreboding Atlantic video, 2006), graphic designer Sanna Annukka (the dynamic swirls of the Under The Iron Sea art-work), artist Osang Gwon (the life-size, photo-montage sculptures for the Perfect Symmetry art-work). They've met a myriad heroes on what Tom calls \u201cThe Celebrity Thrill Ride at Disneyland\u201d. In 2011, a \u201cbabbling\u201d Tim met all-time hero Paul Simon two nights in a row, \u201cand his security guard clearly had me earmarked as a potentially dangerous nutter\u201d. In 2011 in Glasgow, they had a backstage photo-op with Paul McCartney, Tim\u2019s greatest hero other than Paul Simon. \u201cWe were stood in line and I thought, I'll let Tim stand next to him,\u201d remembers Jesse Quin, Keane's live bass player turned full-time member in 2011. \u201cAnd Paul McCartney shoved him out the way, pulled me next to him and said (comedy Liverpudlian) \u201cus bass players have gorra stick together, man!\u201d. \u201cTim won't let me forget it.\u201d In 2010, Tom sang with Queen at the Albert Hall, introduced by Brian May with the words: \u201cNo-one's sung this song since Freddie sang it, because they haven't been able to.\u201d\n\nTrack 15. My Shadow\n\n2004. Novelist William Boyd (currently penning the new James Bond novel) has enjoyed, in Keane, a curiously symbiotic connection: in their early years Keane wrote the song \u2018Any Human Heart\u2019, inspired by Boyd's novel of the same name. Never released, word filtered back to the writer anyway who was newly besotted with \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019, beguiled by Tom's \u201cethereal, plangent voice\u201d and Tim's \u201cmelodic generosity that was astounding in contemporary British rock\u201d. William and Tim became friends, by 2012 both individually plundering East Sussex/West Kent for creative inspiration, for the \u2018Strangeland\u2019 album and the \u2018Waiting For Sunrise\u2019 novel. A short story ensued, named after the \u2018Strangeland\u2019 single \u2018Sovereign Light Caf\u00e9\u2019 (published on the deluxe CD sleeve-notes). \u201cKeane,\u201d wrote Boyd in a celebratory appraisal in the Guardian in 2012, \u201care a great British band.\u201d\n\nTrack 16. Silenced By The Night\n\n2006/7, Under The Iron Sea Tour, everywhere. Rich sits behind his drum-kit, transfixed, as Tom sings \u2018Try Again\u2019, the staggeringly plaintive piano dreamscape which doesn't require much drumming. \u201cAnd every night I would almost forget to come back in because I was lost, listening,\u201d he remembers. \u201cTom just does it night after night, absolutely beautifully. A remarkable singer.\u201d\n\nTrack 17. Disconnected\n\n\u201cIt sounds pretentious but the whole culture of Keane, to a lot of people, is a vitally positive thing,\u201d decides Tim. \u201cIt's definitely something real. We're brave and honest in our songs and people respond to that. Whether it's teenagers grappling with adulthood, people getting divorced, people stuck in war zones, they find, somehow, inspiration and comfort in our music.\u201d\n\nTrack 18. Sovereign Light Caf\u00e9\n\n1980s. As kids in the 80s, the boys who would be Keane drank fizzy drinks in the Sovereign Light Caf\u00e9, Bexhill-on-Sea. As men in 2008, they drank fizzier drinks in Schwarzes Caf\u00e9, Berlin, the 24-hour bar where Keane relaxed most nights, sometimes 'til 6am. For the first time in his life, Tim felt he was truly \u201cliving the dream\u201d.\n\nTrack 19. Higher Than The Sun\n\nNovember 2013, everywhere. Keane's first-ever \u2018Best Of\u2019 is released this November, both a glorious celebration of one of Britain's best-loved bands and a soaring testament to the power of melodic rapture. The jury is in: from the magical, perennial alchemy of melancholy and beauty, this is undeniable evidence of Keane's considerable contribution to the sum of human happiness.\n\n\u201cIt's a classic thing in music, isn't it?\u201d decides Tim. \u201cAll the people I love, most of their songs have a melancholy tint, if not very dark. And yet their music makes you happy. People can get very serious about music. But at Keane gigs, everyone's smiling. Even if you're singing about heartbreak, confusion and desperation. Being able to connect with people, that's really all we care about.\u201d\n\nTrack 20. Won't Be Broken\n\nThe Future. As Keane's five No.1 albums attest, they've never faltered. Tim Rice-Oxley remains ambitious, focused, hungry.\n\n\u201cI think there is an undeniable quality to what we've achieved so far,\u201d he decides. \u201cBut it's in my nature to also feel that there's more we could do. One of those great albums of all time which you don't appreciate until you're older, with the extra wisdom you don't have when you're young. I've had my own ups and downs and feel like I'm just approaching the point where I could write an album like that. The richness is beginning to come through.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we all just want to feel connected, don't we?\u201d concludes Tom, of the power of Keane's singularly emotive music. \u201cTo the world. To each other. I hope if we've done anything we've given people a sense that the world is not such a huge scary place as it can sometimes seem. That we are all in it together. To the end. So you might as well try and understand what it is to be a human being, while we're all here.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "340 Summit Ave, Jersey City, NJ 07306", "Artist": "Sarah Golley", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7634727.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.063643, 40.727077], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Classical Crossover, Acapella, Avant-garde, Jazz, Indie, Musical Theater, Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Smush Gallery", "moreBioInfo": "\"Equipped with only a keyboard and looping machine, Golley is able to achieve a moody opulence rare among solo artists.\" - Devon Antonetti, Village Voice 2017", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "37 Ludlam Ave, Bayville, NY 11709", "Artist": "Dan Reardon", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9791571.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.548936, 40.905688], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Old Tappan Brewing Co.", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1140 Myrtle Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11221", "Artist": "chastity", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9025606.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.934863, 40.697033], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Dutch, Pop, International", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Market Hotel", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "370 New York Ave, Huntington, NY 11743", "Artist": "Memphis Crawl", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.425768, 40.869652], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Paramount", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1 Dixon Ln, Tarrytown, NY 10591", "Artist": "Tim Armacost", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9505016.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.859062, 41.077912], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Jazz Forum", "moreBioInfo": "Tim Armacost has established himself as one of the most important improvisers on the New York scene today.

While they could barely tune their guitars back then (assuming anyone even remembered to bring a tuner to the shows), they were able to develop a unique, rowdy take on Americana by drawing on a fascination with country music and their own experiences drinking and hanging out in the fields and parking lots of their suburban home towns.\n\nTen years later, after moving to NYC in 2007, GunFight! has grown into a cohesive Brooklyn act with one EP and two LP\u2019s in their repertoire, a steady following, and a sound they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cPost-Country\" \u2014a raucous blend of roots-country, punk, post-punk and good old rock n\u2019 roll, that serves as a timely rebuke and New York-style re-appropriation of the \u201crah-rah red-state\u201d nature of contemporary country music. Think The Clash and The Ramones playing Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings covers with a healthy dose of Bruce Springsteen mixed in. Initially a four piece, the band has grown over the years to include five members: Drew Mintz (guitar and vocals), Rich DiGregorio (drums), Bill Dvorak (guitar), Mark Karges (bass) and Griffin McMahon (keys).\n\nSince moving to NYC, GunFight! has built a strong following in the live settings of loft parties, basements and venues like Mercury Lounge, Cake Shop, BK Bazaar, and Brooklyn Bowl. They released the Hide Your Empties EP (on BNS Sessions) in early 2009 and their first full-length, Frontier Land in 2010. GunFight! has played on bills with Those Darlins, Langhorne Slim, Beach Fossils, J. Roddy Walston and The Business, and others. The band has also been written about by SPIN, FILTER, CMJ, Tiny Mix Tapes, New York Magazine and more.\n\nIn 2017, the band released their second full-length, Stripes (recorded with Jeff Berner at GaluminumFoil Productions).

After building a band for a gig but the players not working out long-term, he took inspiration from Ed Sheeran\u2019s approach to a live show. He bought a loop pedal and began learning how to integrate it into his gigs, often sharing with concert-goers how he builds his backing band: himself.\n\nTaking inspiration from a wide variety of musicians and songwriters has helped Liberio create his unique sound. Artists like Billy Joel, Whitney Houston, Chris Cornell, and Adam Levine have inspired him in different ways, and he\u2019s used that to write music that stands out.\n\nHe\u2019s currently working on an EP of originals, \u201cDichotomy\u201d, that he is producing himself. It will feature primarily new music, but also some older music that he\u2019s previously never produced. 2016 will also feature playing multiple shows a week, sometimes with a full band and sometimes continuing his loop-based solo show.\n\nJ. Liberio is the example of a singer/songwriter with the drive, passion, and work ethic it takes to be seen in a busy music landscape. \u201cDichotomy\u201d is described as \u201ca division or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different\u201d, which is how Liberio has created his music to stand out.\n\nConnect with him on Soundcloud, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "719 New Point Road, Elizabeth, NJ 07201", "Artist": "Cacho Garay", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-74.201086, 40.659032], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Club Cubano", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "100 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794", "Artist": "Victor Wooten", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6364076.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.12433, 40.90982], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Funk, Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Staller Center For the Arts", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cI like to talk and I like to play.\u201d\n\nSo said Victor Wooten as he began his commencement address to the Class of 2016 at the University of Vermont\u2019s Rubenstein School.\n\nThis was his way of explaining why he wasn\u2019t going to recite the speech he had written out for the occasion. Instead, for 24 minutes he shared his thoughts with them about life, about success and challenge and meaning, all while accompanying his words on the bass guitar strapped across his shoulder.\n\nHe played and spoke freely, gently and eloquently. He took his audience back to a bit of wisdom he and his brothers had received from their mother, back when they were just beginning to demonstrate the phenomenal talent that would culminate years later in worldwide recognition as the Wooten Brothers.\n\n\u201cWhat does the world need with just another good musician? We have plenty. What the world needs is good people.\u201d\n\nAs he improvised a four-string soundtrack to frame and channel his ideas, Wooten expanded on the lessons she had imparted: \u201cWe\u2019re already born special. ... In the history of humankind, your fingerprint has never been here and will never be here again. ... No one can take that away from you. Your job is to improve on that specialness and present it to the world ... \u201c\n\nThese moments, whether witnessed that night in Burlington or later on YouTube, surely changed lives. They also capture what Victor Wooten really does best. Better even than his revolutionary technique is his conceptual redefinition of the bass guitar\u2019s role.\n\nHow can this be? What Wooten did with bass has almost no parallel in modern music. From Coleman Hawkins to and beyond John Coltrane, the great saxophonists approached their instrument more or less the same way. Same thing with Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis, Ray Brown and Esperanza Spalding: Styles progress, harmonic and melodic languages expand but essentially fundamental concepts remain the same.\n\nNot so with Wooten. After him, every bassist in the world began to think differently, much as guitarists did after Hendrix. Young bassists now start from a different set of assumptions than their predecessors did a generation ago. Wooten\u2019s blazing, percussive chops lit a fire for many of them, as did his explorations of melody, nuance and phrasing.\n\nBut Wooten might smile when reminded of the old parable about the wind and the sun competing to see who might force someone they had focused on to remove his coat as he went walking one day. The wind whipped the poor guy mercilessly, blowing harder and harder, but he simply wrapped himself up tighter and refused to let go.\n\nThen the sun took over, bathed the man in warmth \u2014 and the jacket was off.\n\nSo, yes, this is what Victor Wooten\u2019s forte and calling, whether speaking in Burlington, working with kids at his Center for Music and Nature at the 147-acre Wooten Woods retreat in Tennessee, or outlining his philosophy of music in a novel, The Music Lesson: A Spiritual Search for Growth through Music, now a part of the curriculum at The Berklee College of Music, Stanford University and other prestigious institutions.\n\nAnd of course he continues to inspire through his work. On his latest album, TRYPNOTYX, scheduled for release in September on his own Vix Records imprint, he recruits world\u2014renowned musicians Dennis Chambers on drums, saxophonist Bob Franceschini, singer Varijashree Venugopal and comedian/voicetrumentalist Michael Winslow, who gained fame in the Police Academy movies.\n\nNot surprisingly, themes from his life thread through TRYPNOTYX, tying virtuoso performance and life experience together. Winslow\u2019s voice and sound effects \u00e0 la conjure James Brown and pop throughout the sizzling \u201cFunky D Mix\u201d and recall the night that a kindergarten-aged Wooten saw the Godfather of Soul on stage for the first time. And in \u201cCupid,\u201d through bucolic textures, a sylvan flute, and spoken exchanges involving Wooten and his children, the horrors of war give way to the promise of redemption through love and music.\n\n\u201cMusic is a great way \u2014 and a safe way \u2014 to teach just about any life principle,\u201d Wooten insists, one afternoon at a table outside of a Nashville cafe. \u201cTo be in a band, you have to listen to each other. Bands are at their best when every instrument is different, not the same. Everyone takes turn talking. Everyone speaks their voice. A lot of times musicians might ask, \u2018What would you like me to play?\u2019 I say, \u2018Listen to the music. The music will tell you exactly what it needs.\u2019\u201d\n\nListening was always essential to Wooten. As the youngest of five brilliantly talented brothers, he listened to the music they loved and to the instruction his brothers offered as he began exploring the bass. He didn\u2019t know it at the time but this sibling input helped free him from preconceptions.\n\n\u201cI learned to speak music the same way we learned to speak English,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one sits you down and says, \u2018Here\u2019s the role of your voice. Learn these words. Go and practice.\u2019 No, you just talk, and your parents allow you to talk even though you might speak \u2018incorrectly.\u2019 You do that for years before you learn about grammar. I learned music the exact same way.\u201d\n\nWith liberated imagination, Wooten saw no reason why he couldn\u2019t apply what his brothers were doing on other instruments to his bass. \u201cI saw my brothers\u2019 instruments on my instrument,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, I started learning Roy\u2019s drum licks and solos on the bass. I heard bass lines in his drumming. Later, when I learned what we now call slapping \u2014 we called it thumping then because that\u2019s what [Sly Stone\u2019s bassist] Larry Graham called it \u2014 that gave me the power but not the speed to play a Billy Cobham drum fill. So my brother Regi showed me how to use my thump to pick up and down. That opened a portal in my brain. Then when you add multiple plucks and left-hand hammers, all of a sudden you\u2019re using ten fingers, man!\u201d\n\nVictor was just two years old when he played his first gigs with the Wooten Brothers Band \u2014 Regi on guitar, Roy a.k.a. \u201cFutureman\u201d on drums, Rudy on sax and Joseph on keyboards. They opened West Coast shows for Curtis Mayfield, War and other headliners, nearly scored a major label deal until someone there was room for only one five-brother act. The other act just happened to be The Jackson 5. But that didn\u2019t stop the five Wootens from pushing against convention.\n\nSettling eventually in Nashville, where connected with the like-minded banjoist and composer B\u00e9la Fleck, Wooten has earned five Grammy Awards, been honored three times by Bass Player magazine as Player of the Year and is included in the Rolling Stone selection for \u201cTop 10 Bassists of All Time.\u201d\n\nWhat really matters, though, is the example Wooten sets in his dedication to music as a means to enhance the human condition even for those who may never master an instrument. \u201cMusic shouldn\u2019t be just about music,\u201d he emphasizes. \u201cMusic should be about something greater. If all you do is music, what is your music about? You\u2019ve got to have a life. You\u2019ve got to have experiences. You\u2019ve got to fall in and out of love. Getting away from your instrument and out into the world, you can see how the little bird gets up and sings \u2014 not to get paid but just because the sun is rising. You go outside to get more inside who you really are.\u201d\n\nAt this point, a young student comes up to our table, apologizes for interrupting, takes\na second to thank Wooten for all that he has done to move so many through his music.\nWooten smiles gratefully. They speak for a few moments. Then the student moves on,\nlike those graduates in Vermont, a little wiser and warmer than before.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d Wooten concludes, \u201cis what it\u2019s all about.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "487 Hudson St, New York City, NY 10014", "Artist": "Of Dreams", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6072775.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.006659, 40.732588], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Church of St Luke in the Fields", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Western Wind presents Of Dreams, Desires, & Dragons.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B.

With finesse and charisma, this vocalist, composer and teacher, has successfully etched out a place for her unique musical expression, electrifying audiences in and around the nation\u2019s capital with sold-out performances.\n\nWith the launch of her independently produced album, A Peace of Mine, in 2010, the young artist\u2019s music and concerts created a significant buzz with critics and music-lovers alike. Said Franz Matzner of All About Jazz, \u201cAkua Allrich\u2019s music flows with a free, natural energy as engaging as her equally ingenuous personality.\u201d\n\nHer appeal has reached across US borders and she has earned international attention. In 2011, Allrich signed a distribution deal with Japanese record label AGATE/Inpartmaint Inc. The CD was released in Japan during their \u201cGolden Week\u201d in May 2011. Music lovers and tastemakers from around the world have expressed their appreciation and excitement at Allrich's new brand of music.\n\nAllrich\u2019s style is fluid and ever evolving. Her musical roots run deeply into blues, soul and rhythm and blues, with a clear grounding in jazz and pan-African music. She sings in many languages including Portuguese, French, Spanish, English, Xhosa, and Twi. Given her ability to capture the essence of a broad range of musical genres, Allrich is often likened to legendary artists such as Oscar Brown, Jr., Miriam Makeba and Nina Simone. She has developed popular tribute programs involving the latter two women and other great African American women of jazz.\n\nAkua Allrich was educated at Howard University, where she obtained her BM in jazz vocals and a master\u2019s degree in social work. She was taught, coached and mentored by talented musicians such as world-renowned singer/drummer Grady Tate, singer Kehembe V. Eichelberger, and pianist Charles Covington.\n\nShe is the child of a musical family (her father, Agyei Akoto, was a founding member of the jazz group, Nation, and recorded two albums during Allrich\u2019s youth). Her home held a wealth of cherished recordings that she and her siblings were invited to explore. In fact, she did not buy any albums until her second year in college because her parents had such an amazing collection of jazz records. One of the first jazz albums she bought was John Coltrane\u2019s Live at the Village Vanguard: The Master Takes.\n\nAllrich has already proven her abilities as a performer and bandleader by producing and performing many successful solo and group programs. In addition to focusing on her own engaging compositions, she keeps an ear to the rest of the world and to other eras and artists. Akua Allrich has inspired music lovers from all walks on an international scale, who enjoy her exceptional artistry and eagerly await her next offering.", "otherInfo": "Akua Allrich: Tribute to Nina Simone & Miriam Makeba tour (Queens, NY)\n\n3/28/2020"}, {"Address": "1690 Oak St., Lakewood, NJ 08701", "Artist": "Pancho Barraza", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6145939.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.186793, 40.059289], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Lake Terrace", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Fecha: Sabado 28 de marzo 2020Lugar: Lake TerraceDireccin: 1690 Oak St. Lakewoo NJ 08701 Tour: Pancho Barraza El cantautor del puebloArtista: Pancho Barraza | La envidia | Plebes de Guerrero18+Ms informacin: zamoralive.com // 313 291 6112"}, {"Address": "Po Box 7891, New York City, NY 10150", "Artist": "DJ Duro", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9118751.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9548573, 40.7639982], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Tech House, Dance Bands, House", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "DJ DURO", "moreBioInfo": "Hi, I'm DJ Duro, a young producer and Dominican DJ living in the United States, a businessman and a lover of his fans.\nSUSCRIBETE:\n\u25bahttp://smarturl.it/djduropartyhouse05 \u25bahttps://www.youtube.com/djduro?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25baWhatsapp Business 1-646-828-9047\nGracias a todos por ser parte de mi Att: Dj Duro", "otherInfo": "Para mas informacion sigueme:\n\nwww.instagram.com/djduro\nwww.facebook.com/djduronyc\nwww.twitter.com/djduronyc\nwww.youtube.com/djduro"}, {"Address": "102 State St, Hackensack, NJ 07601", "Artist": "James Maddock", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8623110.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.04564, 40.88136], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "James Maddock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Hackensack Performing Arts Center", "moreBioInfo": "James Maddock affirms his status as a fixture in downtown Manhattan\u2019s folk and Americana scene with \u2018Another Life,\u2019 his new album out July 23rd on Jullian Records.

With funding entirely from fan contributions through PledgeMusic, Maddock worked with producer Matt Pierson, multi-instrumentalist Larry Campbell (who\u2019s played with Bob Dylan and Levon Helm) and bassist Tony Scherr (who plays with Norah Jones).\n\nThe 13 songs on 'Another Life' paint a portrait of a man reaching the midpoint of his life, a natural progression from themes in Maddock's earlier releases. He\u2019s looking back on roads not taken, and isn\u2019t always sure he chose the right one. On the title track, Maddock wants an extra 50 years to try \u201cacting, white-water rafting,\u201d \u201csome illegal substances,\u201d even having a kid or three. \u201cI\u2019ve Been There Too,\u201d built around an indelible guitar riff, shows Maddock\u2019s knack for instrumental hooks as well as lyrical ones. \u201cDon\u2019t Go Lonely,\u201d in a well-timed moment of levity, hints at reggae with dub bass, bubbling organ and the chorus\u2019s entreaty to \u201cgo get high, go get found, go crazy on this town / don\u2019t go lonely.\u201d\n\nAfter fronting the Columbia Records band Wood, whose debut \u2018Songs From Stamford Hill\u2019 was featured prominently on TV shows such as \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek,\u201d Maddock moved from England to New York City in 2003.

Several demos, a few years, a new group name, and additional members later, the direction of the crew took its turn towards blending science fiction and conspiracy theories into rap songs, which at the time, was a rare take on hip hop music in the early 90s. In 1994, the early \"Demigodz\" group split up due to the ever-so-popular break up reason: \"musical differences\". However, it was through this transition that the Demigodfather met another fellow CT lyricist, Apathy. As the musical partnership between Open Mic and Apathy progressed, the two decided to rebuild the Demigodz name and take their aspirations to an entirely different level. After years of recording songs, mastering the ASR-10, co-hosting a radio show, and gaining ties with the likes of Alien Nation, Mothership aka Eternia, and Al T of Newcleus, Mic's dues were slowly but surely being paid. Along with Apathy, he also headed up a Connecticut based chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation and recorded the cassette-only \"Sureshot Affair\" EP, which was self-released in 1997 and sold throughout the underground circles of the North East. Shortly thereafter, Mic took a step back from the scene after getting married and becoming a father for the first time in his life... In 2000, the Demigodz became resurrected by Apathy and expanded into a military-like squadron of MCs and DJs. With that movement in motion, it couldn't have existed without the inclusion of its original creator, Open Mic, and once again he became immersed into the hip hop world. Since then, Mic has kept himself afloat by making appearances on wax, including \"Science of the Bumrush\" on UK-based Stonegroove Recordings and the Demigodz EP released on Ill Boogie Records in mid-2002, all of which received critical acclaim in such publications as XXL and The Source. Outside of the microphone realm, he has made quite a name for himself over the years as a professional graphic designer, in which his lengthy resume extends widely with the creation of many 12\" single, vinyl album, and CD covers for an extensive list of labels - beginning with Bronx Science Records (Apathy's first label), Raptivism Records, Domination Recordings and most recently Babygrande. In early 2006, after being reunited with early 'Nobility' member and co-founder of the first generation of the Demigodz, P-Air, Open Mic has begun work on a new duo project. Returning to his original group base from 1989-1990, and bringing back that boom-bap early 90's sound that hip-hop has lacked since it took a commercial nosedive, Open Mic is ready to deliver what many Demigodz fans have been asking for.... the real raw shit. Keep your eyes open for the debut of his new group the \"Megadonz\" in late 2007.\n\nFor more info on MEGADONZ check out their MySpace page at:\nwww.myspace.com/megadonzmusic", "otherInfo": "WE TAKE CAUTION UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE WE SHALL ENTERTAIN AN EVEN SMALLER AUDIENCE THAN EVER BEFORE.

Descended from a family of cowboys and Baptist preachers, he\u2019s part African- American, part Egyptian, part Cherokee Indian but while his heritage is all- American his global outlook, and unique way of viewing the world through the prism of contemporary music culture, transcends his Mid-Western origins.\n\nBorn in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and raised in suburban Detroit, Seth learnt the art of DJing initially from his stepfather (then a college Radio DJ) and later working behind the counter in legendary Detroit record store \u2018Melodies & Memories\u2019. It wasn\u2019t until he made the brave decision to seek new-beginnings in mid- 2000s Berlin that his DJ career really found its feet. Moving to Berlin fresh out of his teens, just as the minimal techno movement was kicking off, was the making of Seth and since then he hasn\u2019t looked back.\n\nSince moving from Detroit to Berlin, and more recently London then Ibiza, ten years ago, Seth has established himself as one of underground electronic music\u2019s most iconic figures, equally at home playing to the smoke-filled dancefloors of some of the world\u2019s most discerning nightclubs, such as fabric, Nortstern, De School or Output, as he is headlining the world\u2019s largest festivals, like Glastonbury, Lowlands, Roskilde or Tomorrowlands. Right from the word go Seth has been as passionate about food and contemporary art as he is about music and these two interests have resonated at all points in parallel alongside his music career. A multi-faceted polymath: he has held residencies at talismanic music institutions such as DC10 (Ibiza), fabric (London) Trouw (Amsterdam), and Output (NYC), runs three record labels, owns a successful restaurant \u2018Smokey Tails\u2019 and is just about to unveil a new project that sits firmly at the intersection between futuristic electronica, contemporary art and technology. In 2013 he was voted number one DJ in the world in Resident Advisor\u2019s prodigious \u2018Top 100 DJs\u2019 poll. In 2016 he was member of an expedition to the summit of Mt Kilimanjaro lead by renowned Australian neurosurgeon Charlie Teo that raised over $1million for brain cancer charities.\n\n\u201cI live to work on projects and build ideas that sit at the point where art, commerce and ideas meet. For me, this idea of creation, is really the essence of life.\"", "otherInfo": "Carl Cox Invites: Brooklyn Takeover"}, {"Address": "1008 Cortelyou Rd, Brooklyn, NY 11218", "Artist": "Rene Lopez", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8194677.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.96842, 40.639278], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Electric Latin Soul, Funk, Acoustic, Disco", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Bar Chord", "moreBioInfo": "RENE LOPEZ // Love Has No Mercy\nLiberation Label\nRelease Date: 10/21/14\n\nAlmost every musician in the world will tell you that their ambition when making music is to somehow to create something totally new, a kind of music that sounds like nothing at all that came before it. Most quickly realize that such a feat is nearly impossible, but every once in a while someone manages the wonderful trick of putting a new spin on things in a way that sounds completely and wholly fresh.\n\nSuch is the case with Rene Lopez\u2019s new EP, Love Has No Mercy. While the veteran NYC musician\u2019s earlier records flirted with everything from salsa to soul, the seven tracks on Love are a decidedly more dance-friendly affair. The record\u2014which incorporates the sanguine Latin influences of his previous albums and interjects them with a healthy dose of disco and funk\u2014seems tailor made for both impromptu house parties and late nights at the club.\n\n\u201cThere was no grand plan,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cI wrote a ton of songs for my last record that I didn\u2019t end up using, so I booked some studio time and decided just to go in and kind of see what happened. I wrote \u201cLove Has No Mercy\u201d first and then the other songs just kind of happened. You know, I started off in the early 90\u2019s playing in a Latin funk band with an MC\u2014we\u2019d play with Public Enemy or The Meters or jam bands. We were kind of chameleons. I\u2019ve grown used taking all of my influences and then fusing them together into something new. I never felt very comfortable just working in one genre. This time around it just happened that I started to incorporate a dance sensibility into the work as well, which felt very natural.\u201d\n\nClocking in at just under 30 minutes, Love Has No Mercy is a remarkably slick statement of intent. The EPs title track, which features vocals from NYC powerhouse Carol Cee, is equal parts Chic and Giorgio Moroder\u2014a siren song of synthed-out futuristic disco that swings with the same kind of effortlessness that brings to mind the likes of \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and old school Donna Summer. In other words, it\u2019s a track that basically requires dancing. Elsewhere, tracks like \u201cLovegod\u201d and \u201cCity Streets are Dead Tonight\u201d pulse with same kind of subdued electro-funk that made early Prince and Rick James tracks so eternally irresistible. For Lopez, the tracks represent a natural musical evolution\u2014a move from the sweaty rock and Latin grooves of his previous albums to a place located firmly on the dance floor.\n\nThe somewhat kaleidoscopic array of influences manifesting on Love Has No Mercy make sense considering Lopez\u2019 rich musical heritage. A native New Yorker (and the son of renowned salsa musician Rene Lopez, Sr), Lopez grew up absorbing the non-stop musical melting pot that the city had to offer, eventually channeling those influences into a his own music. A jazz trained drummer and multi-instrumentalist, Lopez recorded with a variety of band projects (The Authority, Extra Virgin) before taking wing as a solo artist, eventually perfecting a style that he came to refer to as E.L.S. (Electric Latin Soul). Though his previous solo records (People Are Just People, E.L.S., Paint The Moon Gold) flirted with the aesthetics of dance music, Love Has No Mercy embraces the spirit of classic 1970\u2019s NYC club culture.\n\n\u201cThis record is a first for me,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m just kind of dipping my toe into this new world. I\u2019m excited to see people remix these songs and for them to have a life out in the clubs. It makes sense when I think about the way I grew up. I was a kid during the disco era. I experienced my parents having epic dance parties in our living room. It just feels right to explore this kind of music right now. I can\u2019t wait to go out and play these songs for people and, hopefully, make them all dance.\u201d", "otherInfo": "With my band Avi Bortnick, Brett Bass, Craig Dryer, and Ethan Eubanks."}, {"Address": "61 Wythe Ave, New York, NY 11249", "Artist": "Lucky Chops", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8999677.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.957549, 40.722053], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Happy Horns", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Bowl", "moreBioInfo": "Follow us on Twitter:\n@theluckychops\n\nFollow us on Instagram:\n@theluckychops\n\nAdd us on Snapchat:\n@theluckychops", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "140 Stewart Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "AVision", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.926398, 40.710569], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Avant Gardner", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Carl Cox Invites: Brooklyn Takeover"}, {"Address": "11 Bloomfield Ave, North Caldwell, NJ 07006", "Artist": "Thomas Vincent", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9456719.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.26174, 40.83513], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Little Falls, New Jersey", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Horseneck Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "Singer/Songwriter from NJ.

They formed in Monmouth County NJ in 2006, although various members have played together in other bands for over 10 years. The band currently divides it's time between New Jersey and Nashville TN, but perform shows all over the country. They play a large repertoire of their own material written mainly by head songwriter Strevens, but also include collaborations with Kelly. 2010 saw the independent release of their debut album \"Hillbilly Clubhouse\" to critic\u2019s raves with the title track receiving airplay both nationally and internationally. In 2012 \"Burning Down The Farm\" the 2nd single from that album stayed on the Music Row Charts for 32 weeks hitting #72. The single was also included on the Sony Music distributed compilation CD \"Country Mix USA\" pairing them alongside other country artists Craig Morgan, Due West, and Sammy Kershaw. Early 2013 the band participated in the Hard Rock Cafe's Hard Rock Rising competition, which was a worldwide battle of the bands that started with over 12.000 bands around the world. After The Reign won the New York City market, in which they represented the area in the competition. Over-all they ranked in the top 20 of the 12,000 bands. They released their sophomore album \"Almost Famous\" in the summer of 2013, produced by Marc Muller, mixed by Billy Decker, and mastered by Richard Dodd. Their single \"Jersey Strong\" featured on their second album has been named the official anthem of New Jersey by the organization Strong Than The Storm and was a feature point on Discovery's Destination American Red, White and You. It has put them in the national media spotlight, in which they completed a media tour in support of the song. In 2014 the band suffered a setback with the sudden death of longtime drummer Herb Van Note. For a moment the band was unsure if it could continue, but with the help of replacement drummer Greg Annunziata the band hit the road again in April. By the year\u2019s end they will have clocked in over 75 shows. 2014 also saw the band doing repeat shows with Sara Evans and Phil Vassar, plus performing with The Swon Brothers. 2014-2015 the band performed headlining theater shows in New Jersey and Virginia. In 2016 After The Reign was named a top 10 Best Bar Band At the Jersey Shore by 105.7 The Hawk's fan voted competition. In late 2016, drummer Greg Annunziata announced his departure from the band. Through the end of 2016 into 2017 the band searched for a new drummer. In February 2017 ATR welcomed John Carretta as the band's new drummer. The band also renewed their contract with Bar Anticipation for the 2017 year for the fifth year in a row. The band\u2019s lead songwriter John Strevens secured a publishing deal and the band is currently working on two new albums simultaneously, \"Born Cool\" and a retro Bakersfield sounding \"Throwback Thursday\".

The one-woman army is marching her muscular take on techno all over the globe, winning fans not only with her music, but her way of being, that\u2019s at once uncensored, inclusive, and fierce.\n\nWith her trademark shock of untamed dark hair, the Nigeria-born artist can be spotted in a DJ booth by profile alone, rocking crowds before she even drops a record. In-demand all over the world, Moudaber has played everything from intimate after-hours clubs; to revered nightclub institutions like Space, DC10, Output and Stereo; to massive festival stages, including Glastonbury, Electric Daisy Carnival (hosting her own MoodZONE stages), and two appearances at Coachella. She\u2019s been featured by the New York Times and CNN, named \u201cone to watch\u201d by Billboard and Paper magazine, and has graced the cover of electronic music magazines in several countries. Her weekly radio show In The MOOD - which Moudaber hosts with her unmistakable husk-and-honey voice - won Best Online Music Show in the 2016 Online Radio Awards and is syndicated across over 80 stations in 50 countries, commanding over 16 million listeners worldwide. She has over a million social followers who she dialogues with daily, sharing candid thoughts on music, work, and life.\n\nMood Records, the imprint she founded in 2013, is a vessel for her own music, and that of other artists who complement her style - which is percussive, deep, and dynamic. She linked up with Skunk Anansie frontwoman Skin for the \u201cBreed\u201d EP in 2015. Backed by a set of high-fashion, black-and-white music videos, it fused their two worlds of techno and rock to critical acclaim, and was submitted and accepted into the 2015 GRAMMYS for consideration. The subsequent \u201cBreed the RMXS\u201d EP (2016) contained a powerhouse of remixers including Carl Craig, Fur Coat, Hector, Jamie Jones, Paco Osuna, Pan-Pot, and Scuba. Moudaber has also logged releases with mentor Carl Cox\u2019s Intec, Adam Beyer\u2019s Drumcode (including full album \u201cBelieve\u201d in 2013), and Jamie Jones\u2019s Hot Creations. Her hit remix of Alcatraz house classic \u201cGive Me Luv\u201d (on Deep Dish\u2019s Yoshitoshi) used bass, drums and silence to make a moment so big, it was used by DJs of all stripes. The track won \"Best Tech House/Techno Track\" at the 2016 International Dance Music Awards, and was the No. 1 techno track of 2015 on online retailer Beatport, making it one of the year\u2019s Top 20 tracks overall.\n\nNicole Moudaber often brings different elements of her style and taste to life under the MOOD banner, showing her roots as a party promoter, and a New York City clubber during the golden age of the resident DJ. In 2014, she headlined the sold-out MoodRAW tour, set in in off-the-grid warehouse venues from Los Angeles to London. During Miami Music Week, the annual industry confab in South Beach, she hosts MOOD showcases, capturing both the pool and after-hours party vibes with packed lineups of superstar friends (like Carl Cox and Danny Tenaglia). She curated MoodZONE festival stages at the 2016 Electric Daisy Carnival in New York and 2017 EDC Las Vegas, and was a fixture of the annual BPM Festival, Mexico, playing the 10-day event\u2019s official closing party in 2016 as well as curating her own BPMOOD event in 2017.\n\nA true global citizen, Moudaber resides in London and Ibiza, with frequent stopovers in New York, Miami and Los Angeles. She supports NYC\u2019s Lower Eastside Girls Club, which helps disadvantaged young women access the tools they need to pursue their passion for music.

They had a hit with the single \"On and On\", and refer to their music as \"Athletic Rock.\"\n\nFormed in Newcastle, England by brothers John and Mark Gallagher, Raven quickly set the pace for the burgeoning metal renaissance in the UK at the time. Raven began creating a sound which was rooted in British hard rock with progressive tendencies and a willingness to take musical chances . The band's highly energized live show and interaction between members developed an image and style of play the band described as \"athletic\". They began wearing guards, helmets and plates from various sports (hockey, baseball,etc...) and incorporating them into the playing of their instruments (for instance, elbow pads were used to strike cymbals for a unique performance angle). Eventually, the band signed with Neat Records, the legendary, low-budget metal label of the Northlands, releasing Wiped Out and Rock Until You Drop within a year's time and making an impressive showing on the UK charts a the time. Sufficient noise was made for the American market to take notice and New Jersey's Megaforce Records signed them, issuing their next recording in the States as All for One. The band came stateside in 1983 and toured extensively with Megaforce bands Metallica and Anthrax, both of whom would gain a place of prominence in the growing thrash metal movement. Manager/Megaforce founder Johnny Zazula believed that Raven were major label material and kept them touring constantly until the big labels noticed. The infamous Live at the Inferno recording was a product of one of those tours. Atlantic Records signed Raven to a worldwide contract after a minor bidding war (major label contracts would follow for Metallica and Anthrax in the following year). The band moved its permanent base from Newcastle to New York.\n\nStay Hard was released in 1984 and proved a minor hit on the strength of single/video On and On. The Atlantic years proved to be less-than-stellar for the band. A drastic shift in a more \"commercial\" direction came at the label's behest, with many diehard fans being alienated by the slick, lightweight production of The Pack Is Back (effectively marketing the band with their weird musical forays and confusing image was likely very difficult). However, the band recorded 2 LPs and the Mad EP before being let go by Atlantic. After touring behind the Life's a Bitch album, Wacko left the band to spend more time with his new wife and family. He would later pursue a career in audio production and engineering, eventually working with jazz greats Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick, Jr. Virginian Joe Hasselvander (ex-Pentagram) took over the drum set and the band dropped the outlandish image for a more conventional \"denim and leather\" look for their 1988 release Nothing Exceeds Like Excess. After the advent of grunge and the dissolution of their record label (Combat Records) led the band to concentrate on continental Europe and Japan, where they retained more of a following. The band recorded and toured until 2001, when a wall collapsed on Mark, crushing his legs. Raven went on hiatus for nearly 5 years while the guitarist rehabilitated. As of 2006, Raven is touring with a new release in the works.\n\n\n2) RAVEN is a Solo project by Terui Toshiyuki (\u7167\u4e95\u5229\u5e78), bassist of BLANKEY JET CITY and ROSSO. In 2003, RAVEN released one album, Kagirinaku aka ni chikai kuro (\u9650\u308a\u7121\u304f\u8d64\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u9ed2), most notably featuring Chiba Yusuke of Thee Michelle Gun Elephant and ROSSO on vocals for most of the tracks.\n\n\n3) Raven is Czech artist and multiinstrumentalist Vladim\u00edr Ku\u010dera (*1966), who's released four albums so far - Bubny a p\u00ed\u0161\u0165aly (1991), Salome a dal\u0161\u00ed p\u00edsn\u011b Karla Kryla (1993), Harmonie (2002) and Kamen\u00ed (2006).\n\n\n4) Raven was an influential band from Buffalo, N.Y., in the 1960s. Raven began as Stan Szelest's backing band in Stan and the Ravens, which featured Tom Calandra on bass and Gary Mallaber on drums. When Stan and the Ravens broke up, Calandra and Mallaber joined a band called The Rising Sons with vocalist Tony Galla, guitarist John Weitz, and pianist/keyboardist Jimmy Calire.\n\nRaven manager Marty Angelo, trying to book gigs for the band outside of Buffalo, met Jimi Hendrix at Steve Paul's Scene in New York City in 1967. Hendrix was so impressed with the tape he heard, that he convinced the club's owner to book Raven.\n\nLater that same year, Angelo sent the same tape Hendrix had heard to Beatle George Harrison. Harrison sent a letter back to Angelo which expressed an interest in signing Raven to Apple Records.\n\n\n5) Raven:\nGenre: Black Metal\nLyrical theme: Misanthropy\nOrigin: Norway\nFormed in: 1993\nLabel: No Colours Records\nLast known line-up:\nRune Vedaa (Forgotten Woods, Joyless)\nothers - unknown\n\nMember(s) of Forgotten Woods involved in this. Their demos were released under the name Ravn.\n\nRumours say that Raven is now a solo band, changed their name to Mengele, and is still making music, but not recording. Might, against all odds, release an MCDlater this year.\n\n\n6) Raven:\nA project of the German band Sleipnir.\n\n7) Raven :\nOhio heavy blues rock band from Ohio, who released one, ultra-rare LP, 1975's \"Back to Ohio Blues\".\n\n8) Raven :\nsee Shape of Despair. They started as Raven, released demo Alone In The Mist and then renamed to their current name\n\n9) Raven:\nRaven is a trash metal band formed in 2007 in Kicevo, Macedonia.", "otherInfo": "The show that started a worldwide movement.

Eleven raps about the life he has led and the things he has learned along the way. He also rocks the crowd. Eleven has honed some interactive stage techniques at his day job as a teacher. He spends his days guiding young minds through the rigors and joys of writing while teaching ninth- and 11th-grade English at Eagle High School. When the bell rings, however, Eleven immerses himself in his own writing\u2014words that he eventually takes to the stage. Born in Florida and raised San Diego, Eleven was raised primarily by his mother after she split from his father early on. Eleven made the point that though he grew up with his mom, his dad wasn't completely out of the picture. \"My dad and I are more than just father and son, we are also great friends. He was never a deadbeat dad.\" Having an always-at-work single mother meant Eleven's home life was a bit lonely. Instead of staying home and watching TV, Maxwell took to the streets to hang out with his friends. For a soon to be hip-hop artist in So-Cal, he was growing up at just the right time. \"I was a break dancer as a kid. I listened to all the big groups at the time: Run DMC, Eric B and Rakim ... I loved the whole Krush Groove era,\" Eleven said. \"As I got into high school, I really got into EPMD and then big time into the West Coast hip-hop when Dre and Snoop got big.\" Eleven found inspiration in the artists he was listening to in high school and formed his own hip-hop group. He christened himself Voice and along with two other MCs, started performing wherever he could\u2014including the parking lots of other high schools and street corners. Unfortunately, just as they started to generate a buzz, the band members graduated and each went their separate ways. So Maxwell put down his microphone and headed off to Fresno Pacific University to focus on an education and sports. In college, Eleven earned a degree in communication and after graduation started working in broadcasting\u2014a job he quickly realized he wasn't cut out for. Shortly after quitting his broadcasting job, he fell into what he felt was his true calling and started substitute teaching in San Diego, very quickly being hired as a full-time English teacher. Spending his days inspiring young minds to write also inspired Eleven to pick up the pen again. \"I thought back to the teachers that inspired me. My literature teachers were my favorite. They had me reading books and writing things that I never would have done on my own,\" said Eleven. \"I was writing these raps to interest the kids, and I realized how much I still liked it.\" Very quickly his spiral notebooks started filling up with his deeply introspective verse. \"Anybody can write about cars ... money ... it's a few of us that look beyond those things and write about our real purpose in life,\" he said. Maxwell started making mix-tapes of his verses to pre-recorded beats. He began getting on stage again and was soon working on projects with all original beats and production. This time around, he dubbed himself Eleven. \"I have a lot of lines that refer to the number. It was my football number and basketball number ... so I associate it with a lot of things that I do. I consider myself to be one of one and I try to hold myself above. One above the average,\" said Eleven. \"I preach that in my music. Be yourself. If someone is going to influence you, let it be positive.\"", "otherInfo": "The Rub \u2022 Saturday \u2022 Mar 28, 2020 \u2022 Tickets On Sale Now!"}, {"Address": "22-79 Steinway St, Queens County, NY 11105", "Artist": "DJ MLUV", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8187110.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.907979, 40.771106], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "ROXY'S", "moreBioInfo": "PROMOTIONAL PAGE TO HEAR NEW MIXES AND FIND LOCAL EVENTS WHERE MLUV IS PLAYING.", "otherInfo": "Open Format Video Mixing\nLadies Drink Free 10-12a Guest Dj Shadee"}, {"Address": "641 Classon Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11238", "Artist": "DJ Ferno", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8601779.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.958599, 40.678558], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Music Lover No Limits", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Friends and Lovers", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "702 Union St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Matt DeCaro", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.980048, 40.676115], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Union Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Lo-Fi NYC"}, {"Address": "149 7th St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "The Rub", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.991761, 40.673627], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Hip Hop", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Bell House", "moreBioInfo": "1)The Rub is the stage name of a London hip-hop/revolutionary guitar player and singer, most notable for his song \"George Bush Is an Islamic Fundamentalist\" which was featured on the first peacenotwar.org compilation CD.\n\n2) The Rub is a collective of musicians in the south Chicago/northwest Indiana area that is composed of many members of bands in that region.
