He takes his first music lessons and after studying under Andre Villeger for 3 years he wins the Esprit Jazz Festival Competition in Paris and is endorsed by Selmer saxophones (2006) A year later he enters the Conservatoire National Sup\u00e9rieur de Musique de Paris where his horizons broaden under the influence of peers and mentors such as Riccardo Del Fra and Francois Theberge. He soon understands the necessity to go to the roots of Jazz and in 2009 he is granted a Fulbright Scholarship to study at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary music on a merit scholarship.\n\nIn New York, the dream of meeting and playing with his idols becomes true and Yacine gets to learn from Chris Cheek, Donny Mc Caslin, Reggie Workman and with countless musicians who inspire him daily. But New York also exposes him to a myriad of different musics. Soon he is part of ex Fela Kuti' drummer Jojo Kuo' Afrobeat Collective, of late Cameroonian singer Martino Atangana's African Blue Note, of Haitian Kompa legends Tabou Combo. In their musics, he finds a deep echo to his North African roots and the Bikutsi rhythms from Cameroon become reminiscent of the trance rhythms and musics from Tunisia.\n\nThese influences urge him to find his own identity and his explorations of Cameroonian dance rhythms lead to the creation of the band AJOYO, a mystic brew of African tradition, jazz and soul. Yacine signs the music and lyrics of a repertoire that celebrates life, love and justice. The album is released in 2015 on Ropeadope Records and played on radios throughout the world from New Yorks' WNYC to French RFI, London's Jazz FM, National radio in Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria...\n\nIn the meantime, Yacine continues to play as a sideman both in the jazz repertoire with the likes of Sheila Jordan, Theo Bleckman and Becca Stevens and for various projects such as Japanese singer/songwriter Senri Oe (3 albums for Sony Japan).\n\nIn 2014 he is part of an intimate band picked by producer and arranger Robert Sadin to accompany Opera legend Placido Domingo on his remarkable record Encanto Del Mar. Yacine is featured both as a soloist and arranger of the Andalucian standard Lamma Bada and gets the chance to work closely with Ira Coleman, Mark Feldman, Rhani Khridja, Chico Pinheiro and Bridget Kibbey. This is also where he meets cellist Vincent Segal and gets the idea to explore the tunisian Stambeli repertoire with Vincent on cello and drummer Nasheet Waits.\n\nIn 2015 this project is granted the French American Jazz Exchange. The trio album will be recorded and released in 2017 with the French label Accords Croises.\n\nConcurrently to his activities as a performer and a composer, Yacine teaches song-writing at the French Heritage Language Program. In 2014 he is commissioned to compose a Musical telling the story of underserved French speaking African and Haitian communities in the USA. The show Amidou & Toya was premiered in NY in May 2014.

Using her formidable voice to fight for the betterment of the music industry and rally against sexism, racism and all forms of structural inequality, she has never shied away from the uncomfortable and difficult topics that dominate the news cycle.\n\nSo when McDonald describes her debut solo album, Pleaser (Run For Cover/Poison City Records) as \"a love album\", it's immediately clear that this is a step in a different artistic direction. \"I think the main theme is love, obviously, all kinds of love. Love that you walked away from so you could love yourself, unrequited love, forgiving love, love with no point to it,\" she explains.\n\nThe album opens strategically with \"Away From Love\" - the only time guitar is featured on all of Pleaser, with the rest of the album done entirely electronically. \"Away From Love\" and \"Like A Shadow\" were recorded with Darcy Baylis, while the other songs on the record were produced by Run For Cover Records labelmate Katie Dey.\n\nPleaser's 8 tracks shimmer and pulsate, calling to mind pop artists like Lorde, Robyn, Charli XCX and Gwen Stefani. \"I took more time to record the songs and play around with them, and I liked that because I could change things and experiment more,\" McDonald says, continuing \"I think the pressure of working with other people drove me to finish the songs, which I hated but also loved because it's nice to be challenged.\"\n\nWhile McDonald may have felt challenged while writing Pleaser, the experience of listening to the album is anything but difficult. Its unapologetic pop sentiments shine and delight, McDonald's gorgeous alto soaring above each track.

With True Love (released on May 3 via Rondette Jazz), vocalist John Dokes turns his attention, and his elegant baritone, to something deeper. Over the course of ten well-chosen songs and an equally diverse range of moods, Dokes explores the more profound, committed side of affairs of the heart, bringing soulful nuance and hard-earned wisdom to each tale of ardent amour.\n\nAs Dokes makes clear with each knowing inflection and wry turn of phrase, committed love doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into comfortable routine. Throughout the album\u2019s ten songs, Dokes imbues each lyric with smoldering passion or heart-wrenching loss, all the more affecting for being so deeply felt. Even in his suave delivery of the album\u2019s sole original track, \u201cCool Enough,\u201d the crooner undercuts his dapper cool with a tinge of self-doubt, pleading to know, \u201cAm I cool?\u201d\n\nThough he may have his moments of uncertainty, there\u2019s little question while listening to True Love that Dokes falls squarely into the \u201ccool\u201d camp. Formerly a champion lindy hopper, he continues to get audiences dancing in his regular gig singing with the George Gee Big Band; he carries the same self-confidence from the ballroom to the boardroom, as the Chief Content Officer and President of Accuweather Network, following similarly successful tenures at Viacom and Marvel Entertainment.\n\nWhen working with the world-class quartet on True Love, though, the executive suite is the furthest thing from Dokes\u2019 mind. The album is the second in a planned trilogy, each of which pairs Dokes with a different frontline horn. The first was 2017\u2019s Forever Reasons, his initial small group endeavor (following his big band debut, John Dokes Sings, George Gee Swings), which featured trombonist David Gibson with the same rhythm section as this release: pianist Steve Einerson (Eric Alexander, Eddie Henderson), bassist Alex Claffy (Kurt Rosenwinkel, Jimmy Cobb), and drummer Lawrence Leathers (C\u00e9cile McLorin Salvant, Aaron Diehl).\n\nOn True Love they\u2019re joined by alto saxophonist Mark Gross (Delfeayo Marsalis, Dave Holland), whose sinuous tone is an ideal match for Dokes\u2019 dulcet baritone. Their chemistry is immediately apparent on \u201cA Sleepin\u2019 Bee,\u201d the opening track, calling to mind the playful back-and-forth between Nancy Wilson and Cannonball Adderley on their immortal 1961 rendition, which inspired Dokes to include the song here. The song\u2019s lyric, by writer Truman Capote, also lends the album its title, as Dokes concludes the song by repeating the phrase like an echoing memory.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "709 Lorimer St, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Deborah C Smith ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10014248.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.950162, 40.718099], "Date": "Tue Apr 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-07", "Genre": "Folk, Rock, Americana", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Pete's Candy Store", "moreBioInfo": "DeborahCSmith is a Singer/Songwriter, rhythm guitarist and recording artist living in Brooklyn, NY.

The right vocalist can make you fall in love at first listen, elicit tears, or bring you back to a different era altogether. A microphone and a stage remain the only necessities. That holds true for New York-based singer and songwriter Morgan James. On her full-length debut for Epic Records, Hunter, she casts an unbreakable spell with a powerhouse voice equally inspired by smoky soul, swaggering R&B, theatrical swing, and a virtuosic classical poise.\n\nThe Idaho native discovered her passion for music early on and pursued it\nwholeheartedly at the prestigious Juilliard School. While in the midst of the institution's rigorous academic program, she soon realized that her path would diverge from the classical world. \"I didn't want a career in opera, but Juilliard still shaped me,\" she confesses. \"The traditional training really made me a disciplined singer. I carry that with me to this day.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Morgan spent the next few years facing the proverbial struggles of being a young artist in New York. Low on money, she bounced back and forth between bartending and restaurant gigs while fighting to survive. Immersed in classic sixties and seventies soul records, she concurrently experienced a pivotal revelation. \"Out of that frustration came this other voice,\" she says. \"It was my true voice, and I feel like I discovered it in the middle of so much hardship just trying to be heard. I embraced who I was at that very moment.\"\n\nSoon, she would be heard in a big way. In 2008, Morgan booked her first Broadway show\u2014appearing in The Addams Family alongside Nathan Lane, as well as in prominent and leading roles in Wonderland, Godspell (Turn Back, O Man), and Berry Gordy's Motown The Musical as Teena Marie. The latter set the stage for her to\nproperly launch her solo career. Gordy recognized the vocalist's immense talent, and introduced her to Doug Morris and L.A. Reid, opening the door for a deal with Epic Records in 2012.\n\nAround the same time, Morgan booked a landmark show at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, where she paid tribute to Nina Simone with a set of songs that were closely associated with the legendary artist. The incendiary show was recorded and released as the critically acclaimed Morgan James Live on Epic Records. It also proved to be the perfect segue for her first studio album, released in June of 2014.\n\n\"I always knew to make a neo-soul pop record,\" Morgan says. \"The foundation is all real ingredients, and those roots of soul and R&B are pretty strong. It's the culmination of my musical life up to this point. The painful songs are straight out of a bad relationship with someone from my past. The joyful moments are wonderful memories. It's all coming from me. I've lived every one of these stories, and I love the genres I'm representing. It's one point-of-view\u2014mine.\"\n\nThe title track and album opener \"Hunter\" boasts a seductive hook with cinematic noir flair. Flaunting the singer's immense delivery and dynamic presence, it's an undeniable and classy come-on that proves as animalistic as it does magnetic. \"From a woman's perspective, it's such an empowering and sexy song,\" she smiles. \"It totally makes me feel like a warrior! Music is so sensual and life-affirming. That's what I look for. You don't often see a girl take this position, and that's what I love about it!\"\n\nMorgan assumed co-writing duties on eight of the collection's fourteen tracks and even performed all of her own background vocals and harmonies. From the empowering farewell of \"Fed Up On You\" to the mournful rumination of \"You Never Lied\", she continually bares it all\u2014both emotionally and musically. \"I sing like I'm never going to sing ever again,\" Morgan affirms. \"I wanted to capture that power and passion every time. At some moments, it might sound flawless; at others, it might sound like it's going to break. I'm revealing something about myself with\nevery song. You've got to do that. My favorite artists, whether Joni Mitchell or Michael Jackson, are and were, always honest.\"\n\nThere's a unique structure to the album. The first five songs boast electronic elements, while the last six don't have any. \"There's a gradient of the record that goes down,\" she says. \"By the time you get to the last song, it's just piano and voice. It starts with a song about power and ego, and it ends on one about surrender and selflessness. I have all of that in me. Maybe we all do.\"\n\nUltimately, her honesty permeates everything that Morgan James does, and it's why you'll always remember her voice. \"I want people to walk away from this album feeling fulfilled. That's the way it used to be. Often, I think I'm from another time,\u201d she says, her voice trailing off. \u201cI just want to bring back the power of the singular legacy voice.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "315 West 44th St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Ben Allison ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9187978.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.989689, 40.759], "Date": "Wed Apr 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-08", "Genre": "Film Music, Improvisation, Jazz, Instrumental, Rock, Other", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Birdland", "moreBioInfo": "Bassist/Composer/Producer/Educator Ben Allison has developed an international reputation as a performer, composer and producer and is a leading voice in contemporary jazz.

For this questing artist, it\u2019s not about the rear-view but the road ahead. The next song. The next session. Tonight\u2019s show and tomorrow\u2019s bus ride. But as Dana sheds her musical skin with her triumphant fourth album Love Lives On, it seems a fitting juncture to rewind the reels and thumb a backstory as compelling as any in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. This life and times doesn\u2019t always make for easy reading. The triumphs are laced by tragedy, ugliness, injustice. But whatever the obstacles, music and love have been the beacons that guide her on.\n\nAs one of New York City\u2019s favorite daughters, it\u2019s tempting to imagine that Dana\u2019s career began amidst the subterranean throb in the clubs on the Lower East Side. It\u2019s true: that city was her birthplace and springboard to fame. But to truly grasp her artistic motivations, you\u2019d have to follow the family\u2019s car towards Florida, and rattle along the dirt tracks until you hit Wildwood: a backwoods town, population 2000, where black and white were split along battlelines and distrust simmered in the air. \u201cBack in the \u201970s, it was a sorta small, racist town,\u201d remembers Dana, who dropped a social hand-grenade by dating a black friend. \u201cWe were a big family from New York, Irish-Catholic, there was no one like us in the area. I tended to gravitate more towards the African-American community. I felt more accepted by them.\u201d\nDana and her five older siblings ran wild in the woods (she remembers herself as a \u201ctomboy with dirt under my nails\u201d). Yet this was no picture-perfect childhood, the family\u2019s mood and rhythm set by her father: a former Marine in daily conflict with his demons. \u201cHe was a very tortured soul who had one of the most brutal lives of anyone I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d explains Dana of the patriarch commemorated in Faithful Sinner, one of the songs she wrote for the album. \u201cHe was tortured by his father and molested by his mother. His beatings only stopped because his father took his own life. My father found him. With all that pain, he was most certainly a flawed parent. He could also be very angry and scary, especially when he drank. Still, we knew he loved us.\u201d\nIf the household was fractious, then music was always the balm. Ostracised at school, Dana found solace in the stomp-and-holler gospel of her local Baptist church, but it was the British classic rock blasted out by her siblings \u2013 The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Fleetwood Mac \u2013 that lit a lightbulb over her head. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew I had to do music,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen I started hearing that stuff, at 10 or 11, I stopped listening to other music completely. Later on, I appreciated my parents\u2019 music \u2013 Hank Williams, Ray Charles, Billie Holiday \u2013 but when I heard the old classic rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, I lost my mind over that stuff.\u201d\n\nDana\u2019s musical appetite was bottomless, and when fronting a band at a local Holiday Inn was no longer enough, the 19-year-old singer hatched a bolder plan. At this time, New York did not hold happy associations. The city had been the backdrop to the tragic death of Dana\u2019s beloved elder sister, Donna. \u201cShe and my brother Don had a band, quite popular in the South. She went up to New York City to find her fame and fortune. She took a lot of wrong turns and tragically ended her life.\u201d\n\nAny other 19-year-old might have run a mile from New York\u2019s bearpit music scene, but Dana used the pain as her fuel (\u201cDonna\u2019s suicide,\u201d she says, \u201ccatapulted me from despair to determination to fulfil our shared dream of music\u201d). Yet she still needed a foil. One fateful day, pounding the sidewalks of the Lower East Side, Dana heard the missing puzzle-piece, in the form of Jon Diamond: a heavyweight session guitarist who could already boast credits with Joan Osborne and others. \u201cI was walking by this little club and I heard his guitar from the sidewalk,\u201d she recalls of the musical partnership that flourishes to this day. \u201cI introduced myself to Jon on the break, told him I thought he was great, and that I had come to New York to be a singer. So, he invited me up to sing, and I faked Stormy Monday. Afterwards, he said, \u2018You have a good instrument, but you really need to learn what you\u2019re doing\u2019.\u201d\nAfter Jon exposed her to his encyclopedic blues vinyl collection, Dana\u2019s astonishing natural vocal prowess took on new depth and nuance. And so they were ready. Together, Jon and Dana hit the Lower East Side\u2019s live circuit like a wrecking ball, holding their own on bills featuring titans like James Cotton and Taj Mahal, and quickly earning a residency at the Red Lion club. Four nights a week, they shook the foundations until 3am, but there was already the sense they could be far more than a rocking covers band. \u201cEvery Tuesday night,\u201d Dana recalls, \u201cwe'd play all night, and that's where we wrote our first handful of tunes and we\u2019d try them out on the crowd.\u201d\n\nDrawn by the pair\u2019s original songs and incendiary performances, those crowds were soon stretching round the block, at mythologised hot-spots like Arlene\u2019s Grocery, The Mercury Lounge and B.B. King\u2019s Blues Club. In the studio, meanwhile, Dana and Jon planted their flag with 2003\u2019s Lonely For A Lifetime: an opening gambit that fizzed with potential, splicing a \u201960s Stax/Volt vibe with the driving grit of the Stones, and fusing the dark wit and wisdom of Bob Dylan, Tom Waits and Lucinda Williams. \u201cThey\u2019re about addiction and religious hypocrisy,\u201d she noted of tunes like Strung Out and Bible Baby, \u201cand like all the tracks on the album, deal with subjects that I have a deep personal experience with.\u201d\n\nBy now, all eyes were on her, and after being spotted by musicians from Broadway\u2019s orchestra pits, Dana won the lead in the hit musical Love, Janis, followed up by the role of Sadie in 2007\u2019s Golden Globe-nominated cult movie, Across The Universe. \u201cWe\u2019d been slugging away in New York,\u201d she recalls, \u201cand then I got the show playing Janis Joplin five nights a week. Jon taught me Piece Of My Heart and I went down \u2013 and that was it. That led to Across The Universe. The director, Julie Taymor, asked if I could act. So of course, I lied and said, \u2018Oh yeah!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe demands of stage and screen inevitably impacted on the band\u2019s studio output. But in 2011, the catalogue was thrillingly reignited by Love To Beg, crowned by the UK\u2019s Classic Rock magazine as blues album of the month on the strength of devastating songs like Keep On Rollin\u2019 and Keepsake, which addressed Dana and Jon\u2019s brief (and ill-fated) romantic coupling. \u201cWe fought like cats and dogs,\u201d she grins. \u201cThe first two weeks we were together, we were breaking up every day.\u201d\n\nStill deeper depths were plumbed on 2013\u2019s \u201cblisteringly good\u201d Bliss Avenue: an album that saw Dana battling back into the light after the death of her brother, and reaching for redemption on cuts like So Hard To Move and Vagabond Wind. \u201cIt really purged my soul,\u201d she said, \u201cin a starker, more naked way, lyrically and musically\u201d.\n\nIt takes a brave artist to rip it up and start again. But Love Lives On is the best kind of evolution, seeing Dana burst defiant from her darkest days with a sound inspired by the siren call of American soul. \u201cIt\u2019s a new beginning for me in every way,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to starting chapter two.\u201d\n\nRest assured, you\u2019ll find all the factors that have helped her conquer the modern music scene, with 13 new songs that offer heart-on-sleeve songwriting, stellar musicianship and the ragged vocal that Classic Rock described as \u201cjuke-joint dirty and illicit, evoking Joplin, Jagger and a cigarette bobbing in a glass of bourbon\u201d.\n\nBut this time there\u2019s a new creative freedom, borne of Dana completing her existing record contract, contemplating a blank canvas and crowdfunding the record that she was burning to make. \u201cI was at an interesting crossroads,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWhen my contract was up, I felt a sense of relief that I really held the reins for my next move. I need to be running things. I decided to start my own label called Get Along Records, and to get out of New York and go to the home of the music that inspired me to follow my passion: the Memphis Southern soul of Stax/Volt, Hi Records and Sun Studios. From Otis Redding to Al Green to Johnny Cash. All huge influences.\u201d\n\nFor better and worse, the record was also shaped by emotional extremes, as Dana weathered the loss of three beloved family members, before the storm clouds parted with the birth of her son. \u201cInitially, it felt the worst timing to have a baby,\u201d she says, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. The shift from grief to joy was the most powerful and empowering experience I\u2019ve ever lived. The opportunity arose to take all of the pain from the family loss, the miraculous love of a new baby and put it in a body of music. This album is all about hope and perseverance.\u201d\n\nWith her raw emotions at the surface, Dana hit the album sessions in Memphis with purpose. Armed with songs mostly penned with Jon, the singer found an immediate telepathy with producer Kevin Houston (North Mississippi Allstars, Luther Dickinson, The Bo-Keys, Ian Siegal) and a crack-squad studio band that took in original Hi organist Charles Hodges, Stax heavyweight Steve Potts on drums, keys wizard Glenn Patscha and first-call bassist Jack Daley. \u201cIt was so fast and easy,\u201d Dana reflects, \u201clike I\u2019ve never experienced before. Unbelievable mutual respect and admiration between everyone. Not one ego, ever.\u201d\nOn Love Lives On, the songs are the stars. The album opens in commanding style with Backstreet Baby, driven by grooving guitars, a spring-heeled horn section and a savagely beautiful vocal telling of a woman with \u201cnothing to lose\u201d. Cuts don\u2019t come funkier than Ain\u2019t Nobody\u2019s Fault But Mine, while Callin\u2019 Angels fuses upbeat gospel with a poignant lyric. \u201cIt has a verse for each family member,\u201d explains Dana. \u201cIt\u2019s become a song of conjuring our loved ones in our hearts at every show.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the bittersweet Sittin\u2019 On rides on clipped guitar, Sad Solution offers an effervescent strut, while the vulnerable and reflective title track \u2013 written by Dana as she watched her mother slip away in a Florida hospital following an 11-day vigil \u2013 traces the circle of life. \u201cThis song is about the experience of losing a mother and then becoming one. Letting go of the first love of my life. Lying next to her as she passed, wishing I had asked her so many things. Wishing I had more time.\u201d\n\nOut of darkness comes light. And out of that fascinating early career emerges an older, wiser Dana Fuchs, armed with the album of her life. New label. New studio. New sound. New possibilities for an artist who has so far only hinted at her potential. \u201cI sure hope those who\u2019ve been with me all along will feel as passionately as I do about it,\u201d she concludes. \u201cAnd that those who have yet to hear me will now come on board. Love Lives On is almost like a second child to me. It\u2019s who I am at this moment in time, captured on tape\u2026\u201d\n\nIn April, Dana is set to embark on her Love Lives On world tour in support of her forthcoming new album.\n\nLove Lives On will be released on Get Along Records on May 18th worldwide.\n\nCheck out http://danafuchs.com for music, video, tourdates and much more", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "330 New York Ave, Huntington, NY 11743", "Artist": "Otan Vargas ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8992055.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.426084, 40.871037], "Date": "Wed Apr 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-08", "Genre": "Melancholic Rock, Grunge, Singer Songwriter Rock, Hard Rock, Acoustic, Singer Songwriter, Post Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Crabtree's NY & Main", "moreBioInfo": "Tondo, Manila is a place where people struggle on a daily basis. It is well known as one of the poorest regions in the Philippines. Born and raised here, singer/songwriter Otan Vargas spent his formative years surrounded mostly by poverty and despair. It is this humble background which helps motivate him to this very day. Vargas\u2019 music is a powerfully simplistic combination of melancholy vocals accompanied by a brooding acoustic guitar. He writes songs about man\u2019s struggle, sorrow and pain and finding the strength to continue on. What started out simply as a means of personal therapy for himself has transformed into an inspirational beacon for adoring fans worldwide.\n\nVargas grew up immersed in music from an early age. His father is an accomplished international entertainer and his siblings all sing and play musical instruments. But it wasn\u2019t until the age of 17 that Otan would start playing the acoustic guitar. Around that time, he also began to follow his father to his shows in the Philippines. It was a great experience for him to see his dad perform live and learn how he handled business matters. But ironically, the family discouraged Otan from pursuing a career in music knowing firsthand how difficult the industry could be.\n\nIn 2006, Vargas travelled to the United States for the first time and would soon settle in with family members in New York. With no serious intentions of becoming a musician at the time, he recorded some videos of himself playing guitar and singing at a friend\u2019s house and uploaded them to YouTube for fun. By a strange twist of fate, the videos gained some popularity on YouTube and eventually ended up being viewed by Aaron Lewis \u2013 vocalist of the rock band Staind.\nOtan\u2019s big break came in 2009 when Aaron Lewis unexpectedly invited him on stage to play a song at the Borgata Hotel and Casinos in Atlantic City, NJ. His somewhat nervous, yet captivating rendition of Staind\u2019s hit song \u201cIt\u2019s Been Awhile\u201d elicited a standing ovation from the crowd. The video of that performance also spread quickly on YouTube. Shortly after, Otan would release his full-length debut album \u201cAlone\u201d in which he sings about enduring suffering, battling the voices within and trying to find a constant peace for his soul. The album was recorded mainly in one live take with an acoustic guitar and a single vocal microphone, a rarity in this digital age of multi-track recording. Otan describes his genre of music as \u201cOrganic Rock\u201d. The songs are focused more on the emotional content and lyrical meaning than the skill or technique involved. He says, \u201cwhen I write, I always follow where the song wants to go rather than following a certain structure or formula.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Vargas would perform his original songs for the first time in front of a huge audience of 5,000+ at the Jones Beach Bandshell in New York. And in 2011, he shared the stage with Corey Taylor of Slipknot/Stone Sour, Aaron Lewis of Staind, Lo Pro and Tesla for the \u201cIt Takes a Community Charity Concert\u201d at the Pines Theater in Northampton, MA.\n\nIn 2012, Otan released a new EP entitled \u201cSelected Sorrow.\u201d The EP contained the song \u201cHollow Destination\u201d which was featured in the documentary film \u201cBattlefield of the Mind.\u201d Produced by renowned videographer Fran Strine, the documentary touches on the plight of neglected US veterans who suffer from PTSD and homelessness. It offered a soundtrack which included well known artists such as Mike Mushok of Staind, Pete Murray of Lo Pro and several others including Otan Vargas.\n\nThe following year, Vargas would travel across country by train from his New York residence to perform at the legendary Whisky A Go Go in West Hollywood, CA for the world premiere of the documentary. Others performing on the same stage, were members of the bands Megadeth, Staind, Evanescence and Eye Empire.\n\nIn 2014, Vargas would record a second EP \u201cOrigins\u201d with producer Johnny April of Staind. The recording exhibited Vargas\u2019 growing range as a musical artist and included several guest musicians to create more of a rock band feel. He followed up the album with a two-week tour of the Northeast U.S., performing 13 shows in 15 nights.\nIn 2015, Otan would again take the stage alongside Aaron Lewis of Staind. This time in Oklahoma for the Boot Campaign Foundation, an organization that supports US troops and their families.\n\nThen in 2016, Vargas would continue his charitable concert appearances with a performance at the Grand Theatre in Foxwoods Resort and Casinos for the Reach Foundation. The concert featured members of the bands Seether, Staind, Three Days Grace and Saint Asonia.\n\nMost recently, Vargas\u2019 has recorded a new single called \u201cGround\u201d which features some veteran New York rock musicians including drummer Sal G. of Staind. Vargas experimented with a new formula for this heavy rock project. For the first time, he recorded only the vocal parts and did not include any acoustic guitar. Look for an official release in early 2017.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long, unexpected journey, but all these experiences have developed Otan into a well-respected musician in the rock world and beyond. His story reminds us that if you dream something, no matter who you are or where you come from, it can come true if you work hard and your intentions are pure.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "185 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Valentina Evans ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9895690.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988346, 40.722035], "Date": "Wed Apr 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-08", "Genre": "Acapella, Ranchera, Bolero, Jazz, Worldbeat, Blues, Folk", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall Stage 3", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cIf you melded Chavela Vargas, Ella Fitzgerald and Gal Costa together, you\u2019d find Valentina\u2019s voice there somewhere in between\u2026\u201d\n- Felipe Fournier, 2017 Latin Grammy award winning producer\n\nEqual parts singer, dancer and jaranera, Valentina epitomizes the m\u00e9lange parfait as a California-born, New York-raised daughter of Mexican and Jamaican immigrants.

The duo steadily made a name for themselves, especially with two of their signature tracks, \u201cVineyard\u201d and their version of the classic \u201cPlease Come to Boston.\u201d They released ten studio albums (two for major label A&M), toured three continents, nine countries, and 45 states - amassing millions of loyal fans along the way . Over the years They have shared the stage with John Mayer, Dave Matthews Band, Matchbox20, Counting Crows, The Wallflowers, Sheryl Crow, Toad the Wet Sprocket - to name a few. After a five-year breakup, the guys reunited in 2002 to test out the waters. They were very warm and city by city, Jack & Cary got back out there to play for grateful fans that thought they would never see them again. The two now have a totally renewed creative vigor, mutual respect and deep gratitude for their fans.\n\nThese good vibes shine through on their 25th anniversary live album \u201cLive 25.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s definitely been a creative time for the duo, and celebrating the past inspires the guys to move forward in new, inventive ways. To freshen up the live show, Jackopierce started creating uniquely intimate \u201cDestination Shows.\u201d These shows are a whole new fan experience where people can enjoy gorgeous scenery, share delicious food & wine and have \u201ccampfire\u201d-type access to their favorite band. It\u2019s a vacation and concert in one. Each Destination Show provides a unique experience dedicated to the local culture: Napa/Sonoma vineyards at sunset, a ranch in Austin Hill Country, high society in Dallas, a two-mile-high a private club in Aspen, amazing history at the Biltmore in NC, a 14,000 square foot hacienda in San Miguel de Allende, MX - and the list goes on.

Beginning in late 2016, he recorded three sets of demos written and arranged for three separate bands, exploring a variety of different sounds and genres. One of these sessions, recorded by Bryce Goggin (Pavement, Antony & the Johnsons, Evan Dando, Phish) and mixed by John Agnello (Kurt Vile, Son Volt, Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr), has evolved into Graham's debut full-length, Out of the Sea, which is slated for a late 2019 release.

For this questing artist, it\u2019s not about the rear-view but the road ahead. The next song. The next session. Tonight\u2019s show and tomorrow\u2019s bus ride. But as Dana sheds her musical skin with her triumphant fourth album Love Lives On, it seems a fitting juncture to rewind the reels and thumb a backstory as compelling as any in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. This life and times doesn\u2019t always make for easy reading. The triumphs are laced by tragedy, ugliness, injustice. But whatever the obstacles, music and love have been the beacons that guide her on.\n\nAs one of New York City\u2019s favorite daughters, it\u2019s tempting to imagine that Dana\u2019s career began amidst the subterranean throb in the clubs on the Lower East Side. It\u2019s true: that city was her birthplace and springboard to fame. But to truly grasp her artistic motivations, you\u2019d have to follow the family\u2019s car towards Florida, and rattle along the dirt tracks until you hit Wildwood: a backwoods town, population 2000, where black and white were split along battlelines and distrust simmered in the air. \u201cBack in the \u201970s, it was a sorta small, racist town,\u201d remembers Dana, who dropped a social hand-grenade by dating a black friend. \u201cWe were a big family from New York, Irish-Catholic, there was no one like us in the area. I tended to gravitate more towards the African-American community. I felt more accepted by them.\u201d\nDana and her five older siblings ran wild in the woods (she remembers herself as a \u201ctomboy with dirt under my nails\u201d). Yet this was no picture-perfect childhood, the family\u2019s mood and rhythm set by her father: a former Marine in daily conflict with his demons. \u201cHe was a very tortured soul who had one of the most brutal lives of anyone I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d explains Dana of the patriarch commemorated in Faithful Sinner, one of the songs she wrote for the album. \u201cHe was tortured by his father and molested by his mother. His beatings only stopped because his father took his own life. My father found him. With all that pain, he was most certainly a flawed parent. He could also be very angry and scary, especially when he drank. Still, we knew he loved us.\u201d\nIf the household was fractious, then music was always the balm. Ostracised at school, Dana found solace in the stomp-and-holler gospel of her local Baptist church, but it was the British classic rock blasted out by her siblings \u2013 The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Fleetwood Mac \u2013 that lit a lightbulb over her head. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew I had to do music,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen I started hearing that stuff, at 10 or 11, I stopped listening to other music completely. Later on, I appreciated my parents\u2019 music \u2013 Hank Williams, Ray Charles, Billie Holiday \u2013 but when I heard the old classic rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, I lost my mind over that stuff.\u201d\n\nDana\u2019s musical appetite was bottomless, and when fronting a band at a local Holiday Inn was no longer enough, the 19-year-old singer hatched a bolder plan. At this time, New York did not hold happy associations. The city had been the backdrop to the tragic death of Dana\u2019s beloved elder sister, Donna. \u201cShe and my brother Don had a band, quite popular in the South. She went up to New York City to find her fame and fortune. She took a lot of wrong turns and tragically ended her life.\u201d\n\nAny other 19-year-old might have run a mile from New York\u2019s bearpit music scene, but Dana used the pain as her fuel (\u201cDonna\u2019s suicide,\u201d she says, \u201ccatapulted me from despair to determination to fulfil our shared dream of music\u201d). Yet she still needed a foil. One fateful day, pounding the sidewalks of the Lower East Side, Dana heard the missing puzzle-piece, in the form of Jon Diamond: a heavyweight session guitarist who could already boast credits with Joan Osborne and others. \u201cI was walking by this little club and I heard his guitar from the sidewalk,\u201d she recalls of the musical partnership that flourishes to this day. \u201cI introduced myself to Jon on the break, told him I thought he was great, and that I had come to New York to be a singer. So, he invited me up to sing, and I faked Stormy Monday. Afterwards, he said, \u2018You have a good instrument, but you really need to learn what you\u2019re doing\u2019.\u201d\nAfter Jon exposed her to his encyclopedic blues vinyl collection, Dana\u2019s astonishing natural vocal prowess took on new depth and nuance. And so they were ready. Together, Jon and Dana hit the Lower East Side\u2019s live circuit like a wrecking ball, holding their own on bills featuring titans like James Cotton and Taj Mahal, and quickly earning a residency at the Red Lion club. Four nights a week, they shook the foundations until 3am, but there was already the sense they could be far more than a rocking covers band. \u201cEvery Tuesday night,\u201d Dana recalls, \u201cwe'd play all night, and that's where we wrote our first handful of tunes and we\u2019d try them out on the crowd.\u201d\n\nDrawn by the pair\u2019s original songs and incendiary performances, those crowds were soon stretching round the block, at mythologised hot-spots like Arlene\u2019s Grocery, The Mercury Lounge and B.B. King\u2019s Blues Club. In the studio, meanwhile, Dana and Jon planted their flag with 2003\u2019s Lonely For A Lifetime: an opening gambit that fizzed with potential, splicing a \u201960s Stax/Volt vibe with the driving grit of the Stones, and fusing the dark wit and wisdom of Bob Dylan, Tom Waits and Lucinda Williams. \u201cThey\u2019re about addiction and religious hypocrisy,\u201d she noted of tunes like Strung Out and Bible Baby, \u201cand like all the tracks on the album, deal with subjects that I have a deep personal experience with.\u201d\n\nBy now, all eyes were on her, and after being spotted by musicians from Broadway\u2019s orchestra pits, Dana won the lead in the hit musical Love, Janis, followed up by the role of Sadie in 2007\u2019s Golden Globe-nominated cult movie, Across The Universe. \u201cWe\u2019d been slugging away in New York,\u201d she recalls, \u201cand then I got the show playing Janis Joplin five nights a week. Jon taught me Piece Of My Heart and I went down \u2013 and that was it. That led to Across The Universe. The director, Julie Taymor, asked if I could act. So of course, I lied and said, \u2018Oh yeah!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe demands of stage and screen inevitably impacted on the band\u2019s studio output. But in 2011, the catalogue was thrillingly reignited by Love To Beg, crowned by the UK\u2019s Classic Rock magazine as blues album of the month on the strength of devastating songs like Keep On Rollin\u2019 and Keepsake, which addressed Dana and Jon\u2019s brief (and ill-fated) romantic coupling. \u201cWe fought like cats and dogs,\u201d she grins. \u201cThe first two weeks we were together, we were breaking up every day.\u201d\n\nStill deeper depths were plumbed on 2013\u2019s \u201cblisteringly good\u201d Bliss Avenue: an album that saw Dana battling back into the light after the death of her brother, and reaching for redemption on cuts like So Hard To Move and Vagabond Wind. \u201cIt really purged my soul,\u201d she said, \u201cin a starker, more naked way, lyrically and musically\u201d.\n\nIt takes a brave artist to rip it up and start again. But Love Lives On is the best kind of evolution, seeing Dana burst defiant from her darkest days with a sound inspired by the siren call of American soul. \u201cIt\u2019s a new beginning for me in every way,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to starting chapter two.\u201d\n\nRest assured, you\u2019ll find all the factors that have helped her conquer the modern music scene, with 13 new songs that offer heart-on-sleeve songwriting, stellar musicianship and the ragged vocal that Classic Rock described as \u201cjuke-joint dirty and illicit, evoking Joplin, Jagger and a cigarette bobbing in a glass of bourbon\u201d.\n\nBut this time there\u2019s a new creative freedom, borne of Dana completing her existing record contract, contemplating a blank canvas and crowdfunding the record that she was burning to make. \u201cI was at an interesting crossroads,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWhen my contract was up, I felt a sense of relief that I really held the reins for my next move. I need to be running things. I decided to start my own label called Get Along Records, and to get out of New York and go to the home of the music that inspired me to follow my passion: the Memphis Southern soul of Stax/Volt, Hi Records and Sun Studios. From Otis Redding to Al Green to Johnny Cash. All huge influences.\u201d\n\nFor better and worse, the record was also shaped by emotional extremes, as Dana weathered the loss of three beloved family members, before the storm clouds parted with the birth of her son. \u201cInitially, it felt the worst timing to have a baby,\u201d she says, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. The shift from grief to joy was the most powerful and empowering experience I\u2019ve ever lived. The opportunity arose to take all of the pain from the family loss, the miraculous love of a new baby and put it in a body of music. This album is all about hope and perseverance.\u201d\n\nWith her raw emotions at the surface, Dana hit the album sessions in Memphis with purpose. Armed with songs mostly penned with Jon, the singer found an immediate telepathy with producer Kevin Houston (North Mississippi Allstars, Luther Dickinson, The Bo-Keys, Ian Siegal) and a crack-squad studio band that took in original Hi organist Charles Hodges, Stax heavyweight Steve Potts on drums, keys wizard Glenn Patscha and first-call bassist Jack Daley. \u201cIt was so fast and easy,\u201d Dana reflects, \u201clike I\u2019ve never experienced before. Unbelievable mutual respect and admiration between everyone. Not one ego, ever.\u201d\nOn Love Lives On, the songs are the stars. The album opens in commanding style with Backstreet Baby, driven by grooving guitars, a spring-heeled horn section and a savagely beautiful vocal telling of a woman with \u201cnothing to lose\u201d. Cuts don\u2019t come funkier than Ain\u2019t Nobody\u2019s Fault But Mine, while Callin\u2019 Angels fuses upbeat gospel with a poignant lyric. \u201cIt has a verse for each family member,\u201d explains Dana. \u201cIt\u2019s become a song of conjuring our loved ones in our hearts at every show.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the bittersweet Sittin\u2019 On rides on clipped guitar, Sad Solution offers an effervescent strut, while the vulnerable and reflective title track \u2013 written by Dana as she watched her mother slip away in a Florida hospital following an 11-day vigil \u2013 traces the circle of life. \u201cThis song is about the experience of losing a mother and then becoming one. Letting go of the first love of my life. Lying next to her as she passed, wishing I had asked her so many things. Wishing I had more time.\u201d\n\nOut of darkness comes light. And out of that fascinating early career emerges an older, wiser Dana Fuchs, armed with the album of her life. New label. New studio. New sound.

He soon understands the necessity to go to the roots of Jazz and in 2009 he is granted a Fulbright Scholarship to study at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary music on a merit scholarship.\n\nIn New York, the dream of meeting and playing with his idols becomes true and Yacine gets to learn from Chris Cheek, Donny Mc Caslin, Reggie Workman and with countless musicians who inspire him daily. But New York also exposes him to a myriad of different musics. Soon he is part of ex Fela Kuti' drummer Jojo Kuo' Afrobeat Collective, of late Cameroonian singer Martino Atangana's African Blue Note, of Haitian Kompa legends Tabou Combo. In their musics, he finds a deep echo to his North African roots and the Bikutsi rhythms from Cameroon become reminiscent of the trance rhythms and musics from Tunisia.\n\nThese influences urge him to find his own identity and his explorations of Cameroonian dance rhythms lead to the creation of the band AJOYO, a mystic brew of African tradition, jazz and soul. Yacine signs the music and lyrics of a repertoire that celebrates life, love and justice. The album is released in 2015 on Ropeadope Records and played on radios throughout the world from New Yorks' WNYC to French RFI, London's Jazz FM, National radio in Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria...\n\nIn the meantime, Yacine continues to play as a sideman both in the jazz repertoire with the likes of Sheila Jordan, Theo Bleckman and Becca Stevens and for various projects such as Japanese singer/songwriter Senri Oe (3 albums for Sony Japan).\n\nIn 2014 he is part of an intimate band picked by producer and arranger Robert Sadin to accompany Opera legend Placido Domingo on his remarkable record Encanto Del Mar. Yacine is featured both as a soloist and arranger of the Andalucian standard Lamma Bada and gets the chance to work closely with Ira Coleman, Mark Feldman, Rhani Khridja, Chico Pinheiro and Bridget Kibbey.

The trio album will be recorded and released in 2017 with the French label Accords Croises.\n\nConcurrently to his activities as a performer and a composer, Yacine teaches song-writing at the French Heritage Language Program.

Is This Thing Cursed?, their first record in over five years, is a spirited conjuring of everything the band has summoned before, electrified with a new urgency. As it turns out, the most important modern rock band to combine heartbreak, power-pop, and a flirtation with the occult was just getting started.\n\nA few short years ago, Alkaline Trio put on a massive black celebration of close to a hundred songs, over sold out multi-night residencies in a handful of cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and Orange County, tearing through eight studio albums and nearly two decades of history. The devotion of the band\u2019s adoring cult following was repeatedly rewarded, as the twists of phrase and dark melodies that have become a part of the fabric of their lives danced around them in sweaty, intimate, seductive ceremony. For a subculture of outsiders, misfits, and lonely-hearts, songs like \u201cThis Addiction,\u201d \u201cTime to Waste,\u201d and \u201cRadio\u201d are perfect anthems.\n\nAlbums like From Here to Infirmary, Crimson, and Agony & Irony are classics. Now the portal to a new era opens with the fresh vibrancy of Is This Thing Cursed?, a furiously inspired collection of songs created in an unprecedented situation. For the first time in their history, Alkaline Trio booked studio time, arrived with little more than a few ideas, and created an entire album on the spot.\n\n\u201cEveryone always thinks that their newest record is their best record and I'm no different,\u201d says vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba. \u201cOf course we think it's our best record. We wouldn't put it out if we didn't think it was our best record. As far as where it sits in our \u2018catalog\u2019? Hopefully, it's a big step, but a logical one.\u201d\n\nVocalist, bassist, and co-songwriter Dan Andriano concurs. \u201cWe made a record in a way we\u2019ve never done it before and it worked. I'm really excited about it. Everything sounds fun and fresh. I suppose any band making their ninth record would like to hope that their longtime fans are going to be into it, but I really feel like we made a record that the old school fans are going to dig. I really, really do.\u201d\n\nGood Mourning (2003) cracked the Billboard Top 20. This Addiction (2010) debuted at Number 1 on Billboard\u2019s Rock, Independent, and Alternative charts. But even with strong record sales, radio play, and several late night talk show performances, the Alkaline Trio torch burns brightest for the diehards. It\u2019s a legion of fans that crisscross the globe for shows; faithful devotees who remain proudly connected to Skiba, Andriano, and longtime drummer Derek Grant.\n\nAs Noisey once summarized, ALK3 \u201ccut themselves from a unique enough black cloth to standout\u201d in a sea of punk lookalikes in the late 90s and early 2000s, mining the poeticism of Jawbreaker, the campy vintage goth of horror rock, and the three-chord driven punk bombast so beloved in their native Chicago scene.\n\nIs This Thing Cursed? hearkens to the creative process of the early days, when the band rehearsed in a tiny apartment on the edge of Chicago\u2019s Humboldt Park, at the intersection of Damen Avenue and Division Street, near D&D Liquor. The appropriately titled \u201cDemon and Division\u201d recalls the vibe of the song \u201cSan Franciso,\u201d one of the beloved tracks from the very first album, Goddamnit (1998).\n\n\u201cIt has an old Trio vibe to it. Somewhere in the back of my mind I was thinking I wanted it to sound like an old school Trio song,\u201d Skiba explains. In fact, much of Is This Thing Cursed? shares exciting psychic similarities with the discography.\n\n\u201cWe slowly realized that in a completely different way there were a lot of parallels between this new record and [2000\u2019s] Maybe I'll Catch Fire,\u201d Skiba confirms. \u201cThe process, the themes, there are just a lot of similarities from our perspective. It almost feels like a sister record to it or something, or like a first cousin.\u201d\n\nThe album was tracked in Los Angeles at The Lair. With its weird antiques, big wooden doorways, large velvet drapery, and eye candy sconces, Andriano describes The Lair as \u201cwhat it would look like if Alkaline Trio designed a studio.\u201d\n\nProducer Cameron Webb (Mot\u00f6rhead, Megadeth) was an essential part of the creative process, encouraging the band to power through their ideas and flesh out their songs with a mixture of spontaneity and certainty. Over the years, Alkaline Trio has worked with the A-list of the genre\u2019s producers, including Webb, Matt Allison (Smoking Popes, Rise Against), Josh Abraham (Thirty Seconds To Mars, Slayer), and Bill Stevenson (Descendents, A Day To Remember). But the advice of the late Jerry Finn (Blink-182, Morrissey) was a pivotal guiding force.\n\n\u201cJerry's sort of mantra was, 'first thought best thought.' Not that it works every time, but it works a lot,\u201d Skiba explains. \u201c[Another thing he taught us] is that just because something wasn't intentional, that doesn't mean it was a \u2018mistake\u2019\u2026 In the past we\u2019d spend a lot of time in preproduction. With this record we went in with pretty much nothing. Dan had a couple of demos. I didn't have a single complete demo for the new album, just a few ideas on my phone. We pretty much wrote the whole thing as we recorded it. We wrote a song or two a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat old school style writing process, combined with how we feel now about what we want when we listen to a record made for a nice combo,\u201d says Andriano.\n\nAs ever, the storytelling remains of paramount importance. As co-lyricists, both of the band\u2019s frontmen avoid empty imagery and flowery words absent of meaning. The songs always tell a story, a mixture of fact and fiction, reality and metaphor.\n\nThe title track began as something very personal for the group\u2019s bassist. \u201cEveryone gets to a point where you feel like you can\u2019t win, you\u2019re up against it,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s totally irrational but that\u2019s how you feel when you\u2019re completely lost in the throes of depression. You feel like everything you look at, everything you touch, all of it must be cursed. Then it becomes inward, like, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s me that\u2019s the problem. Is it this body of mine, this host that I walk around in?\u2019\u201d\n\nWebb suggested Skiba sing a verse on \u201cIs This Thing Cursed?\u201d as well. \u201cDan sings most of the song\u2019s vocals. It's his baby,\u201d the guitarist says. \u201cHe and I work really well together. As corny as it might sound, I'm sure there are a lot of times we're communicating without speaking. Sometimes things are left unsaid or I can tell that he doesn't want me to ask what it's about. There isn't really much that Dan and I wouldn't tell each other, but sometimes it's nice to have the mystery. [This song] is a rare occurrence where [the subject] never came up specifically.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlackbird\u201d is another product of the duo\u2019s collaboration. It was one of the few instrumentals Andriano had worked out before they arrived. He loved the music but wasn\u2019t happy with his own lyrics or melodies before he passed it over to Skiba, who was obsessed with the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird as a kid. Skiba drew the military airplane on everything, built model kits, and even as an adult, devoured books on it. Around the time the lyrics came together, \u201cBlackbird\u201d was the nickname for a girl he was dating. \u201cShe didn't look like a bird, but she has this sleekness, this sexiness, that I felt just reminded me in some way of that plane.\u201d\n\n\u201cI Can\u2019t Believe\u201d is brand new territory for Alkaline Trio. \u201cIt's about the current administration,\u201d says Skiba, who traditionally had shied away from political topics. \u201cIt\u2019s even more so about the people that continue to think that Trump is a good idea, regardless of all the racism, sexual abuse, and pig-nature of this person. So much damage has been done. I can't believe why anyone would think that's a good idea. It blows my mind. It's the first time I've ever written a song like that.\u201d\n\nAndriano wrote \u201cLittle Help\u201d about a type of person he\u2019s \u201cbeen close to becoming and I don\u2019t care to become.\u201d Another new song, \u201cPale Blue Ribbon,\u201d is even more personal. It\u2019s about the death of a friend. \u201cIt\u2019s about wishing I could go back and talk to him.\u201d As the song declares, \u201cThere\u2019s no prize for winning this race.\u201d\n\nIs This Thing Cursed? is filled with the type of naked self reflection and authentic personal revelations that have drawn so many punks, goths, alternative rock advocates, and music fans of all stripes to Alkaline Trio, assuring the band\u2019s continued relevance and vibrancy, now more than 20 years into their story. It\u2019s a passionate display of truth telling emotion set to timeless melodies that\u2019s inspired a type of reverence usually reserved for longer running icons and trailblazers.\n\nLike the Misfits \u201cfiend skull,\u201d the Black Flag \u201cbars,\u201d or the Bad Religion \u201ccrossbuster,\u201d Alkaline Trio\u2019s iconic Heart & Skull symbol is bigger than the band it represents. It\u2019s a badge of honor for diverse and defiant individuals who share a passionate commitment to the triumph of the outsider. Like the heart that surrounds the skull, while the band may celebrate the macabre, there\u2019s an ever-beckoning black light within their darkness. No matter how bleak things may seem, the music of Alkaline Trio is there, with a sly phrase and a sweet melody.", "otherInfo": "ALL AGE SHOW DOORS 7:00 PM"}, {"Address": "315 West 44th St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Ben Allison ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9187978.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.989689, 40.759], "Date": "Fri Apr 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-10", "Genre": "Film Music, Improvisation, Jazz, Instrumental, Rock, Other", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Birdland", "moreBioInfo": "Bassist/Composer/Producer/Educator Ben Allison has developed an international reputation as a performer, composer and producer and is a leading voice in contemporary jazz.

By that Fall they played an inaugural, now-infamous residency at American Beauty in New York City and then road-tested many of the songs on an extended northeast tour. One thing that became apparent right away was that there was going to be an exploratory spirit to their live shows and that the songs are, on one level, springboards for extended improvisation as well as vehicles for dance-floor workouts. Inspired by rock, funk, and jazz artists such as The Band, The Talking Heads, Phish, The Grateful Dead, James Brown, Fela Kuti, Miles Davis, Grant Green and countless others, the goal, in their own words, is to \u201cnot know where we\u2019re going\u201d because that feeling of excitement and adventure translates to the audience. Front and center in the mix is Hilliard\u2019s guitar, which is unmistakable in tone. He lists as early inspirations BB King and Jimi Hendrix, and using that as a jumping off point he brings jazz concepts to tell longer, more complex sonic stories.\n\nJeremy is no newcomer to the scene. He established his songwriting voice as a bandleader and lead guitarist for the band Turbine, with whom he made 4 studio albums and toured nationally for many years, including regular appearances on the some of the country\u2019s biggest stages such as Bonnaroo Music Festival, Telluride Music Festival, Gathering of the Vibes, Moedown, and many others. For his new group, he searched far and wide to find the perfect complement to his sound and finally found it in the great gospel organist Otis Williams. Williams is a master of his instrument from a very young age, as well as a musical Swiss Army knife. He is able to incorporate synths, vocals, samples, really any sound under the sun. Coming from the Bronx, the birthplace of hip hop, beat making and dance music are second nature to him. He also plays with a totally unorthodox harmonic approach that will make any listener sit up and take notice. Holding this all together, and the driving pulse of the band, is the bass playing of Eric Thachuk. The new band was lucky enough to meet him when he first moved to New York from Toronto where he worked as a top studio and touring musician. He somehow always knows exactly the right note to play to hold down the fort for all the harmonic and rhythmic interplay, and his elegant choices as an improviser give the music a sophisticated form. He is also a multi-talented musician, programming all the electronic drums on the bands\u2019 debut album. The newest member of the group is John Venezia on drums who is an up-and-coming killer on the kit. He recently finished at Philadelphia\u2019s University of the Arts and although you don\u2019t know it yet you need to see him live. After spending their first summer jamming, and then going out and getting 50 shows under their belt, the band knew that they wanted a full-length studio album to define their sound, and it would be all about the songs. So in early 2017 they hunkered down in Dave Brandwein\u2019s (Turkuaz) Galaxy Smith Studios in Brooklyn to finish writing and record what would become their debut album, Electric Bouquet.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1218 Jericho Turnpike, New Hyde Park, NY 11040", "Artist": "Phil Smith ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7999326.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.682788, 40.732903], "Date": "Fri Apr 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-10", "Genre": "New York City, New York", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Olde Trading Post", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "459 Valley St, City of Orange, NJ 07050", "Artist": "The Normal Living ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9552060.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.24884, 40.76591], "Date": "Fri Apr 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-10", "Genre": "Indie Pop-rock, Americana, Indie Rock, Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Hat City Kitchen", "moreBioInfo": "Rock/pop band from Jersey City, NJ, now based in West Orange, NJ.\n\nThe seven members of TNL belong to what has been called the \u201cOregon Trail Generation.\u201d They watched MTV rise from its infancy, and then lamented its ultimate transformation. As children of the 80s and 90s, they witnessed first-hand the rise of personal computers, the invention of the Internet, and the emergence of a global community. As adults, they also bore witness to the global cultural shifts that happened after 9/11, and then faced the financial crisis of 2008 as they were beginning to build their careers, families, and livelihoods. In the modern age of music, TNL straddles the divide between analogue and digital in their minds, hearts, and bodies. And their songs are also about straddling a line between youth and adulthood; they write about becoming an adult in the modern age, navigating waters that stretch into an ever-expanding universe.\n\nSonically, TNL is a unique blend of guitar-driven songs, layered with intricate piano, pop-rock vocals, and powerful yet sophisticated drums. It\u2019s American heartland rock for the modern era, for Gen Xers who miss guitars in Top 40 music, who identify with the familiar echoes of 1960s girl groups, and who seek out today\u2019s rootsy indie-rock.\n\nTNL was founded by songwriters Liza Zitelli Grabowski and Jon Ryan Grabowski, who began playing together in New York City in 2009. When childhood friend Paul began to join them for shows around NYC in 2010, along with Zitelli siblings Diana and Andrew, TNL was born.\n\nIn 2013, TNL independently produced and released their first EP, Less Radio (recorded at Sweet Sounds Studios in NYC). Less Radio is a rock record that expresses the inspirations and frustrations of the city and its satellites. Navigating urban and suburban landscapes, the characters of Less Radio are always in motion\u2014on stages and subways in \u201cSkyline Blues\u201d and \u201cTime Out, New York,\u201d on ghostly trains in \u201cPenn Station,\u201d and on lonely highways in \u201cDead End Rock.\u201d They even move in and out of the nostalgic past in \u201cCharlotte Arms\u201d and the dystopian, radio-less future of the haunting title track.\n\nThe blog RockNYC Live and Recorded named Less Radio #22 best album of 2013 and the song \u201cTimeout, New York\u201d as the #16 best song released in 2013. Blog founder and NYC music critic Iman Lababedi wrote, \u201cImagine Ronnie Spector fronting the E Street Band singing Springsteen-Goffin-King songs, and you will have an idea of what they are going for...It is like they are the last band in town writing new, young, classic rock worth a damn.\"\n\nWith the additions of Nick, Petros, Colin, and Amy over the next few years, TNL expanded its sound and released its first LP, Signals, on Feb 24, 2017. Recorded at Water Music Studios in Hoboken, NJ, Signals is a collection American stories set in the new millennium, as told by characters who consider the redeeming powers of community, love, music, and spirituality. The 8-song LP features an American heartland-rock sound\u2014lush and spirited piano, powerful yet sophisticated drums, and driving guitar and bass, with crisp vocals and harmonies.\n\nIn his review of the Signals, Jersey Beat music blogger Joe Wawrzyniak wrote, \u201cThe robust vocals project a winning blend of strength and vigor. The harmonic arrangements boast everything from meaty guitar riffs to rousing horn lines to mighty rolling drums. Whether it's the fist-pumping anthem \u2018American Summer\u2019 or the tremendous headlong rush of \u2018Into the Night,\u2019 there's plenty to relish on this hugely enjoyable album.\u201d\n\nA record-release show for Signals was held on Feb 25, 2017, at the legendary Maxwell's in Hoboken, to a sold out crowd.\n\nTNL\u2019s next full-length release is planned for 2020, with singles from the new record being released in late 2019. On October 25, 2019, TNL released \u201cHow It All Went Down,\u201d the first single from the forthcoming 2020 release. \u201cHow It All Went Down\u201d is a powerful, up-tempo rock song driving guitars, a powerful rhythm section, crisp vocals and harmonies, and lush piano. It touches on themes of loss, motherhood, and storytelling, working towards a cathartic emotional ending.\n\nWith Grammy-nominated Chris Badami producing the new material, with mastering by the renowned Scott Hull of Masterdisk, TNL looks to help carry on the story of American songwriting in the millennial age.", "otherInfo": "It may be Good Friday, but every Friday at HCK is a good Friday!!

Indeed, since he debuted almost two and a half years ago on New York City hip hop station WWPR Power 105.1 FM, Norie\u2019s Sunday night show \u201cAnything Goes-Caribbean Edition\u201d, a vigorous blend of soca, reggaeton, roots reggae and dancehall, accented with a distinctive Brooklyn flavor, consistently tops the ratings for the 8-10 PM time slot according to Arbitron statistics.\nRespectfully referred to as Da Reggae Don, DJ Norie was born to Panamanian parents in Brooklyn, which is often referred to a Jamaica\u2019s 15th parish, due to its concentration of immigrants from reggae\u2019s birthplace. Raised in Brooklyn\u2019s East Flatbush area, Norie became familiar with the music of Shabba Ranks, Super Cat and Ninja Man (dancehall reggae superstars of the late 1980s and early \u201890s) by listening to coveted sound clash cassettes that furthered the popularity of the latest reggae hits and the renown of the era\u2019s premier Jamaican sound systems. \u201cListening to the cassettes of Stone Love, Kilimanjaro and other sounds I thought, I want to be a part of that,\u201d Norie recalled.\nBarely into his teens, Norie began working with a neighborhood sound doing odd jobs such as carrying speakers and other equipment to their various gigs around Brooklyn. He paid close attention to the deejays (or selectors in Jamaican parlance) observing their proficiency in choosing just the right tunes to elicit roaring responses from the crowd and keep them on the dance floor. When the selectors needed to take a break, Norie got the chance to display his burgeoning skills on the wheels of steel; however, these early career-training sessions took place unbeknownst to Norie\u2019s mother. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will get in trouble for saying this now but my mom used to work nights so I used to sneak out to play at these basement parties, and basically that is how I learned to select,\u201d Norie laughingly discloses. \u201cIt was kind of hard in the beginning; they used to line up four or five records, tell me what to play and when I played them, people used to go crazy. So it used to seem like, yeah, I can do this, even though I was scared as s*#t. But I did it anyway and it was a good experience.\u201d\n\nNorie\u2019s fears subsided with repeated stints at the turntables and eventually he was recruited by Spectrum Disco, working with selectors Redds and Super C; as Spectrum\u2019s popularity spread throughout Brooklyn and the greater New York area during the 1990s, so too did Norie\u2019s renown as an intimidating selector. In the late 1990s Super Claude, the founder of Afrique Sound Station, one of the most venerated sound systems in the New York area, recruited Norie to join the set. Alongside Afrique\u2019s remarkable team of selectors, which included Jagga B, Crazy Richie and Super Twitch, Norie\u2019s talents were taken to a wider audience that spanned many states and several countries. \u201cSometimes you have to make a move, enhance yourself and go for you, and Afrique is where my name really started from, its what took me to the level of traveling with the music,\u201d Norie reflects. \u201cI will never forget Spectrum Disco because that is where I came from but Afrique has been in the business for more than 20 years, they set the trend for \u2018nuff sounds and it is a blessing to have been a part of it.\u201d\nNorie has also played on numerous Brooklyn based pirate and Internet stations that exclusively play reggae and Caribbean music (he even started one of his own, My Radio 94.3 FM), a phenomenon indicative of the vast potential for Caribbean music in the New York area. But Norie\u2019s expertise in selecting dancehall also resonated with a mainstream listenership, as he found out when he joined up with (hip hop) DJ Self as one of six deejays comprising a collective called Da Union, which enabled him to take dancehall into several (Manhattan) clubs where it had previously been excluded. This led to a few guest appearances on Power 105.1 FM, and eventually his Sunday night show on the station, which has contributed to his enviable status as America\u2019s most influential radio personality for dancehall reggae. As such, Norie is usually the first to transform a core dancehall anthem into an international hit, which he recently did with Stephen and Damian Marley\u2019s single \u201cJah Army\u201d, featuring Buju Banton.\nNorie is also the personal deejay for Beenie Man, with whom he travels whenever the artist has a show outside of Jamaica and he has also toured with Elephant Man, Bounty Killer, Mavado and Serani. On March 30, 2011 at New York City\u2019s BB King\u2019s nightclub, Norie made history selecting the rhythms for seven time Grammy winner Stephen Marley\u2019s first performance done solely to backing tracks (that is, without his band\u2019s accompaniment); Marley headlined Norie\u2019s two year anniversary party for his Power 105 show, which was also the one year anniversary celebration for his immensely popular monthly live concert series, \u201cAnything Goes\u201d. \u201cStephen was a little hesitant at first, because he never performed to tracks before, but he did it and he was happy about it, so it is a great experience to have under my belt,\u201d Norie shares.\nNorie has recently partnered on several projects with Queens New York based VP Records, the largest independent reggae label in the world. He selects the music at each of VP\u2019s album release parties and the label\u2019s artists are regularly showcased at his \u201cAnything Goes\u201d series. For VP Records\u2019 \u201cReggae Gold 2011\u201d, a collection of the year\u2019s biggest reggae hits, Da Reggae Don provided a vibrant, 35-minute bonus mix CD, rife with artists\u2019 shout-outs to Norie (including 2011 Celebrity Apprentice winner/country superstar John Rich) and customized renditions of popular songs. Additionally, Norie has just started recording artists on his own dancehall rhythms and he plans to release those tracks as part of his own compilation series sometime in the near future.\nEach of Norie\u2019s endeavors is in pursuit of his ultimate goal: expanding the overall popularity of Caribbean music, especially dancehall reggae, the music that inspired his career path almost 20 years ago. \u201cMy radio show has served a lot of purposes; not only did it allow my fans to get to know me but it allowed me to give back to this music game,\u201d Norie explains. \u201cBut I would like to get further in radio, be more than just a deejay because then I can help reggae by impressing upon program directors that New York\u2019s Caribbean population is really an untapped market that no one is paying attention to so why not go out and support it? We don\u2019t have to follow the same trends that everyone has been doing for years and years, we can do things differently, add on and make it much stronger.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "39 E 58th St, New York, NY 10022", "Artist": "Stoon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8865245.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.971301, 40.762831], "Date": "Fri Apr 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-10", "Genre": "Hip Hop, House", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Lavo", "moreBioInfo": "Stoon is one of the most established DJs in the New York tri-state area.
