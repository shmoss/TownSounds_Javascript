As he unleashes his high-energy music to fans all over the world, Castro is inspired by the sounds he absorbed while coming of age on the rough and tumble side of San Jose, California. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, this was Castro\u2019s home turf\u2014his stomping ground. It was a place where the street-tough Mexican Americans and the counter-culture hippies came together to drink, smoke, laugh, party and listen to tunes\u2014the hippies with their blues and rock, the Mexicans with their soul music. Mixing the blues-rock he loved and the soul music he heard blasting out from the lowriders cruising the streets, along with the socially conscious message songs of the day, Tommy\u2019s own sound was born. He honed his guitar playing to a razor\u2019s edge on the city\u2019s competitive bar scene, where he learned how to capture an audience with his intensely passionate vocals, stellar musicianship and dynamic performances. Almost every major rock and soul act, from Ike & Tina Turner to Janis Joplin to Elvin Bishop to Taj Mahal, toured through the area, and Castro was at almost every show. He saw John Lee Hooker, Albert King and Buddy Guy & Junior Wells at the same local blues bar, JJ\u2019s, where he often jammed, dreaming of one day busting out.\n\nOver the course of his career, Tommy Castro\u2019s San Jose DNA has always inspired his music, whether he\u2019s squeezing out the deepest blues or the funkiest soul grooves. He and The Painkillers\u2014bassist Randy McDonald, keyboardist Michael Emerson and drummer Bowen Brown\u2014have played hundreds of shows to thousands of music lovers, always leaving his audiences screaming for more. All of his albums are filled with original blues, soul and West Coast rock, each song showing a slightly different side of Castro\u2019s multifaceted musical personality. Billboard says the band plays \u201cirresistible contemporary blues-rock\u201d with \u201cstreet-level grit and soul.\u201d\n\nOn his new album, Stompin\u2019 Ground, Tommy Castro opens windows into both his past and his always-evolving musical future. Produced by Castro and guitar wunderkind Kid Andersen and recorded at Andersen\u2019s soon-to-be legendary Greaseland Studio in San Jose, Stompin\u2019 Ground finds Castro letting loose on a set of 12 tracks featuring six originals and new versions of songs he learned and played as a young up-and-comer. He is simultaneously looking back with autobiographical originals and cover songs that inspired him, while forging a forward trail with modern lyrics atop blistering blues-rock. With The Painkillers firing on all cylinders behind him, Castro lays it all on the line from the opening notes of Nonchalant to the final, introspective Live Every Day. From the autobiographical My Old Neighborhood to the socially aware Enough Is Enough and Fear is The Enemy to versions of Elvin Bishop\u2019s Rock Bottom and Taj Majal\u2019s Further On Down The Road (two of his favorite songs from his earliest heroes), Stompin\u2019 Ground is pure musical pleasure. \u201cAs soon as we started cutting,\u201d Castro says, \u201cwe knew we were onto something.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the The Painkillers, Castro\u2019s friends Charlie Musselwhite (harp and vocals on Live Every Day), Mike Zito (guitar and vocals on Rock Bottom), Danielle Nicole (vocals on Soul Shake) and Los Lobos\u2019 David Hidalgo (guitar and vocals on Them Changes) add their talents to Stompin\u2019 Ground. \u201cI heard each one of my friends\u2019 contributions to these songs in my head as I was working on them. Happily, when I reached out and actually asked, everyone said yes.\u201d\n\nBorn in San Jose, California in 1955, Tommy Castro first picked up a guitar at age 10. He fell under the spell of Eric Clapton, Elvin Bishop, Taj Mahal, Mike Bloomfield and other blues-rockers. As he got older, Castro discovered the bedrock blues of Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Freddie King, Buddy Guy, Elmore James and the deep-rooted soul of singers like Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett and James Brown. By his teenage years, he was regularly heading to San Francisco to see his favorite artists at legendary venues like The Fillmore West and Winterland. He began playing in a variety of Bay Area blues and soul bands in his early 20s, making a name for himself as a hotter than hot live artist. In 1985 he became lead singer and guitarist for the locally popular blues band NiteCry, and began gigging regularly throughout Northern California.\n\nCastro joined Warner Brothers\u2019 artists The Dynatones in the late 1980s, gigging all over the country. He formed the first Tommy Castro Band in 1991, releasing his debut album in 1996 on Blind Pig. He hit the road hard, picking up new followers everywhere he went. In the mid-1990s The Tommy Castro Band served as the house band for three seasons on NBC Television\u2019s Comedy Showcase (airing right after Saturday Night Live), bringing him in front of millions of viewers every week. During the 1990s and into the 2000s, Castro released a series of critically acclaimed CDs for Blind Pig, Telarc and 33rd Street Records, as well as one on his own Heart And Soul label.\n\nCastro joined Alligator Records in 2009, releasing Hard Believer to massive acclaim. He won four of his six career Blues Music Awards including the coveted B.B. King Entertainer Of The Year Award (the very highest award a blues performer can receive). His song Hard Believer took first place in the blues category of the International Songwriting Competition. His next release, 2011\u2019s Tommy Castro Presents The Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue\u2013Live!, was a boisterous and searing collection of highlights from a series of live performances anchored by Castro and an all-star collection of blues giants, including Rick Estrin, Michael \u201cIron Man\u201d Burks and Joe Louis Walker. His relentless road-dog approach\u2014gig after gig, night after night\u2014has won him loyal, lifelong fans everywhere he plays. The Washington Post says Castro is \u201cphenomenal and funky\u201d with \u201csoulful vocals and inspired blues-rock guitar.\u201d\n\nCastro formed The Painkillers in 2012, creating a lean, mean four-piece lineup, capable of delivering soul-shaking, muscular music. The band released The Devil You Know in 2014 and Method To My Madness in 2015, with critics shouting praise and admirers cheering his every move. Castro had stripped his music down to its raw essence with the new, smaller band, sounding bigger than ever. On record and on stage, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers\u2019 road-hardened, seemingly telepathic musicianship bring an unmatched passion to Castro\u2019s blue-eyed California soul and hard-rocking, good-time songs. His hometown newspaper, The San Francisco Chronicle, describes Castro\u2019s music as, \u201cfunky Southern soul, big city blues and classic rock...silvery guitar licks that simultaneously sound familiar and fresh.\u201d\n\nWith months of tour dates across the U.S. and Europe, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers will be bringing the songs from their new album directly to their fans. No Depression says \u201cCastro plays gritty, string-bending blues like a runaway soul train...a glorious blend that rocks the soul and lifts the spirits.\u201d Blues Revue says simply, \u201cTommy Castro can do no wrong.\u201d With Stompin\u2019 Ground, he is clearly, once again, doing everything right.", "otherInfo": "Hey folks, who\u2019s ready for another live show?

We hope Canada will share her with us.\u201d (Hot Indie Music Review) Krystle Dos Santos has taken her experience from the Canadian College of Performing Arts, and transformed it into the beginnings of a career already full of achievements. Unveiling her talents to the public with her 2008 full length self-titled debut, Dos Santos was instantly recognized as a force by the Western Canadian Music Awards, winning the Urban Recording of the Year. That same album charted for six weeks on CJSR FM88\u2019s Urban chart and was top ten on 92.5 The X in Kamloops, BC. One of the single\u2019s from the album even appeared in an Episode of ABC\u2019s Samantha Who? But to simply classify Dos Santos as a recording artist would be neglecting one of the most intriguing aspects of her talents. Whether facing the crowd on her own or with her full ensemble of band-mates as she is more accustomed, Dos Santos uses a sultry tone and eccentric array of melodies to create an intimately magnetic connection with her audience. She is able to further engage her audience by shifting seamlessly through genres, embodying her musical influences-Nina Simone, Etta James, Alicia Keys-culminating into a powerful live experience that fuses jazz, soul, pop, funk and blues into an arena of styles and sounds that takes listeners from mid-20th century Harlem, right up to present day L.A. With key performances at the Edmonton International Jazz Festival, Whistler International Film Festival, and the Honey Jam Showcase in Toronto, Krystle has had many opportunities to put her live shows on full display. She has already toured extensively throughout western Canada, singing stories of pain and love, joy and redemption, all told through a voice that precisely reflects the emotion of her music. It is nearly impossible to be a true fan of Krystle Dos Santos without taking part in the experience she creates with her live performances. Dos Santos completed her second album in the first quarter of 2011. Femme Fatale, as it was aptly titled, again revealed Dos Santos versatility and her ability to capture the audience with an eclectic mix of dance and funk, but always with the soulful jazz vocals for which she has quickly become renowned. Dos Santos\u2019 interpretation of her influences has made it difficult to categorize her style. Compared presently to Jill Scott or Corrine-Bailey Rae or even Erykah Badu, Krystle is able to personalize her sound and message, adding her own character to her music to create a uniquely refreshing sound. Her vibrant personality has been utilized outside of music in various add campaigns and modeling opportunities. It also helps that Krystle is as stunning as she is talented; one of those rare beauties that command attention with little more than a moments glance. But make no mistake, Krystle Dos Santos is a musician first and foremost. With a smoky voice that can fluctuate to fit any style and a live show that demands the audience stand-up and take notice, Dos Santos is ready for the masses to feel her music. She is currently working on her third studio release, and will no doubt continue to strive until her name and her music is known to the world.

This fresh-faced native of Southampton, England, was merely playing into his love of funkadelic hip-hop and crooning urban stylings when he started writing songs as a teenager. His love for Terence Trent D'Arby, Sisqo, and Donnell Jones allowed him to put his creative love for art, culture, and history into a musical beat all his own. And the new millennium belonged to him and garage had been redefined.\n\nBorn Craig Ashley David on May 5, 1981, David was slicing and dicing ragga and R&B on the local station PCRS 106.5FM and found himself playing club gigs prior to rubbing elbows with some of music's finest. It was during this time he hooked with Artful Dodger's Mark Hill. After winning a national writing competition, Craig was more than ready to start producing with Hill. His big break came when he put his own additives on Damage's \"I'm Ready,\" a B-side to \"Wonderful Tonight.\" Soon thereafter he remixed his own version of Human League's \"Human\" and started himself a regular spot in area clubs during the weekends. \"Rewind\" was another underground smash, specifically a definitive move for David. His respect for Stevie Wonder, Faith Evans, and R. Kelly was most apparent, however his own vocal talent was beginning to shine. He and Hill's specialty show on Capital Radio provided another outlet for David to shape his musical work of genius. \"Fill Me In\" proved yet another hit, shooting straight to number one in summer 2000. David was now the youngest British male solo artist to have a number one single. He was 19-years-old.\n\nA deal with Wildstar Records in the U.K. sparked toward the end of the summer as \"Re-Rewind\" and \"7 Days\" gained praise in late November. A stateside agreement with Atlantic also led to more global hype. He had sold 3.5 million records worldwide and garage was finally becoming massive overseas and it was David's debut Born to Do It that was at the head.\n\nBut not all were pulling for this R&B prodigy. Aside from winning three awards at the MOBO's in October, Craig David walked away empty handed at the 2000 Brit Awards in February 2001. He was up for six nominations, including Best British Male Solo Artist, Best British Newcomer, and Best British Single for \"7 Days,\" but industry politics fell into operation. Many mainstream stars came to David's defense, artists such as Elton John, U2, and Robbie Williams, professing their disgust for the ill recognition for David and his musical efforts in the past year. Death threats soon followed for the superstar in spring 2001 as he took the stage in a show in London. An anonymous caller claimed a soldier would injure David with tear gas and hand grenades. Still, his record sales continued to soar in the U.K. with sales of Born to Do It increasing over 100 percent after his dismal beginning months of 2001. He bombared American Shores with a deal with Atlantic and released Born to Do It stateside in summer 2001. Mainstream radio flocked to him immediately. Missy Elliott, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, and Usher called themselves fans.\n\nThe next year, things didn't simmer down for the now international pop star. Craig David returned with a sophomore effort Slicker Than Your Average in November 2002. This particular album saw a much grittier side from David. Debut single \"What's Your Flava?\" also became one of the year's hottest singles.\n\nIn 2005 he released his 3rd album \"The Story Goes...\", the first single of the album, \"All The Way\", returned him to the top three, and the second single, \"Don't Love You No More (I'm Sorry)\", tied with \"7 Days\" as his longest running single in the charts since \"Rewind\", spending 15 weeks inside the UK top 75. However, the album's third single, \"Unbelievable\", debuted and peaked at #18 in March 2006.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated with UK rapper Kano on his upcoming album London Town, for the single \"This is the Girl\". The track was released on August 27, 2007 and debuted at #18 on the UK charts.\n\nThe first single \"Hot Stuff\" from the album Trust Me, was released on November 5, 2007 . The single was a top ten hit, whilst the album charted at #18 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\"6 of 1 Thing\", the second single to be taken from Trust Me charted at thirty-nine on the UK Singles Chart, becoming his second lowest charting single to date.\n\nHis UK tour will start in June 2008, details of which can be found on the official website.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Versus.Goliath ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10381765.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Metal, Industrial, Rap", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Mit feinen Pinselstrichen zeichnet Versus Goliath beklemmende Endzeitszenarien aus der kaleidoskopischen Farbpalette zwischen schwarz und grau, und l\u00e4dt den H\u00f6rer in eine klaustrophobische Welt aus Dekadenz, Stahlbeton und Gleichschaltung ein.\n\nHunderte N\u00e4chte hat der geb\u00fcrtige M\u00fcnchner im Studio an seinen detailverliebten, apokalyptisch-epischen Industrial-Kompositionen gearbeitet und sich dabei durch die Untiefen sowohl der eigenen Psyche, als auch einer extrem entmutigenden Realit\u00e4t gek\u00e4mpft, alles zugelassen, und in seine Kunst einflie\u00dfen lassen.\n\nDas Ergebnis ist fein durchdachtes Sounddesign das im Ausdruck eine gro\u00dfe Palette abdeckt, ein digitaler Brandsatz zwischen Industrial, Metal und Rap, der aber immer aus einem Guss klingt.\n\nVersus Goliath liefert einen ansteckenden, wunderbar abgefuckten Soundtrack f\u00fcr den n\u00e4chtlichen Spaziergang in der kalten Stahlbetonw\u00fcste, die geballte Faust in der Tasche.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DUNE (Official) ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10395650.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Happy Hardcore, Rave, Techno, Electronic, Harder Styles Of Dance", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "www.dune.dance", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dana Rexx ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9601718.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Indie Pop, Hard Pop, Indie Electronic, Cinematic Pop, Pop, Adult Contemporary", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dana is on a mission to bring out your inner Warrior, transporting you to a world where people are free to explore their unlimited potential and follow their dreams.

He went back to all his old machines acquired over the years, the TR-808, SH-101, TR-909, TB-303, Juno 60... all instruments that have earned their place in the old school techno hall of fame.\nBack then he said, \u201cFaced with my old drum machines and keyboards again, I felt so at home, like I\u2019d been using them all my life. Getting so much pleasure from going back to those sounds was a revelation. When you switch on a synthesiser, you\u2019re playing an instrument that is part\nof music history. A laptop will always be something you use to send e-mail.\u201d\nMusic Components, the album released under his own name that resulted from this redisco- very of diodes and transistors, is a pure homage to techno classics and the philosophy that accompanied them: long tracks, instrumental, repetitive, powerful and melancholic, carved out\nof one idea explored to the point of obsession. Ten carefully crafted tracks that prove has a life outside the dancefloor, in the vein of classic albums by Carl Craig, Plastikman and Drexciya (to name but a few). But above all, Music Components went totally against the grain,\neschewing all the fashionable traits of the time; saturation, successive layers of sound, a mix of genres, the hybridisation of formats, malformed ideas...\nAfter the unexpected and strangely revealing success of this concept album in the pure techno tradition, it seemed inevitable that Rebotini would pen a follow-up to Music Components . And\nso he has! But just as our man mutated from Zend Avesta to Aleph to Black Strobe, he\u2019s a great fan of doing something different, always returning with new projects and carefully defined iden tities. Don\u2019t expect to hear Music Components Volume 2 . Instead, expect a new approach, a\ndifferent angle, another side of his return to machines.\nSomeone Gave Me Religion is an album resonating from the live tour that followed Music Components , where from behind his machines, Rebotini launched into his music, confronting it with the harsh reality of the dancefl\noor...\nFrom the very start, track one The First Thirteen Minutes Of Love\nopens the album with over ten minutes of ambient unlike anything you\u2019ve heard in years, a long, elegiac composition\nsomewhere between Carl Craig and the chill-out zone at a bygone rave. It\u2019s a warning: take a deep breath before being swept away by eight tracks that span Detroit and Berlin, Front 242\nand Carl Craig, linking them via soaring trance, carefully-crafted minimal, the sound of the 90s, the sound of the new millennium. It\u2019s hard to imagine the strike force and heart pangs it will inevitably inflict on any club in the know.\nNowadays, in an age where vintage is the latest fashion, ancient synths go for silly money on eBay, where the still-worshiped instrument manufacturers are concocting new machines, and\nwhere many famous producers openly criticise the creative limits of composing music on a computer, we can finally see to what extent\nMusic Componentswas a record that managed to cultivate a certain nostalgia for techno\u2019s golden years, whilst refusing to hide in the past.

He became known on the Spanish scene, performing many covers in solo or with local artists.\n\nBorn in Lorraine, France, he quickly moved abroad for professional reasons. In 2008, following a stroke, he left all his former activities, to take refuge in music, a therapy that allows him to rebuild.\n\nThis accident of life has considerably influenced his music. Today, he shares with us his dark vision of the world, but always full of hope. He is the former Godfather of France AVC, an organization for stroke research and prevention.\n\nHis main artistic influences come from Joe Cocker, Banners, Ed Sheeran, Lou Reed, Simply Red, or Bruce Springsteen, but also French singers like Serge Gainsbourg, Alain Bashung or Jacques Higelin. His own sound takes elements from several of these, particularly Joe Cocker, with whom he shares a gritty yet natural vocal texture, and adds a unique tenderness to an emphasis on delicate piano, hypnotic harmonies, and surprisingly intimate lead singing.\n\nFox first album, \"\u00eatre ET rena\u00eetre\", released in 2018, after a promo CD including \"Laissez-moi chanter\" and \"Revolution\", prefiguring the style of the album.\nWith very personal lyrics, neat music, a particular voice, this dark crooner who never leaved his hat and sunglasses, found his actual style after a stay in Liverpool, where he plunged back into the sources of rock and English pop.\n\nThere came a double single, including \"God lives in hell\" and \"The clown\" (Fall 2018), preparing the release of the album \"to be AND to be\".\n\nHis recent encounter with producer Matt Butler let him deliver a more polished song, \"The game is over\" (March 2019), which has enjoyed universal critical acclaim, perhaps most notably from Rolling Stone Magazine. The official video for \u201cThe Game Is Over\u201d is directed by French filmmaker Florent Charles.\n\nHe successively released singles Aloha (June 2019), a \u201cdancing\u201d reggae full of good vibes as we can expect in Hawaii, with once again, an excellent video, then \u201cLove me again\u201d (September 2019), possibly the \u201cgem\u201d of the next album, and \u201cDrunk lover\u201d (October 2019) a swing in the pure cabaret style, before \u201cDark world\u201d (November 2019), song in which it is inspired by the spirit of Bob Dylan (Blowin 'in the wind).\nFinally, the album \"to be AND to be\" (December 2019) is a compilation of his best songs and an addition of new ones, especially \u201cBad boy\u201d and \u201cI don't want you\u201d, reminding his favorite style : Blues.\n\nWebsite Officiel \u2013 http://foxnigon.com\nYouTube channel\u2013 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJanXgapogBaa7cePRpcrBw\nStreaming on Spotify \u2013 https://open.spotify.com/artist/4fwvArBJAXzNDEcSIjKOOV\nShop CDs \u2013 https://www.amazon.fr/s?i=popular&rh=p_32:Fox+NIGON", "otherInfo": "Apr\u00e8s deux mois d'absence, confin\u00e9, voici un concert en direct, o\u00f9 je vais interpr\u00e9ter quelques uns des titres de mes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents albums.\nEntre autre, Bad boy, The game is over, Les paradis perdus...\nUn mix de chansons en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais, que vous pouvez retrouver en version originale dans les playlist de ma cha\u00eene; pensez-\u00e0 vous abonnez : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJanXgapogBaa7cePRpcrBw?sub_confirmation=1\n\nMusique et paroles \u00e9crites et interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es par Fox Nigon \u00a92019 Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s\nLes paroles sont disponibles sur mon site : http://www.foxnigon.com\n\nPour me soutenir, faites un saut \u00e0 la boutique officielle : https://www.difymusic.com/fox-nigon"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "JAUZ ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9197480.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Music Has No Boundaries", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "JAUZ \u2013THE PROJECT OF SAM VOGEL, A 24 YEAR OLD, LA-BASED ICON COLLECTIVE GRADUATE IS ONE THAT COMBINES BRILLIANT PRODUCTION,ENERGETIC SETS, AND UNDERGROUND TUNES, THAT HAVE CAPTIVATED THE HEARTS OF THE DANCE COMMUNITY.

It\u2019s like my body needs it as much as it needs food, water or sunshine.\u201d Right now, Trago\u2019s immersion in music is almost total. An internationally renowned DJ, producer, live performer and label owner with three critically acclaimed albums to his name, the Dutchman divides his time between all-day studio sessions, DJ gigs and live shows all over the world, and a steady stream of musical collaborations. You sometimes wonder how he finds time to sleep. His dedication to the cause has been unflinching since his earliest years. He grew up in a free-spirited, artistic household, surrounded by music and encouraged to make his own. He entertained himself by recording his own home-made radio shows using the weird and wonderful albums he found in his parents\u2019 record collection. At the age of 15, he decided that he would devote his life to music. \u201cI just had this realization that life is so short, you have to pursue your dreams,\u201d he says. \u201cMy dream was music. That\u2019s all I ever wanted to do \u2013 to listen to it, discover it, make it, play it and share it.\u201d Ever since, he\u2019s been living that dream. Success wasn\u2019t instant, and in his early years in Amsterdam he barely eked a living DJing in coffee shops, earning just enough to afford to feed his vinyl addiction. \u201cAs long as I had enough to live and buy records, I was happy,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt also gave me more time to make music.\u201d He was offered encouragement in these difficult early days by a number of figures on the Dutch scene, with the likes of Mike Kivits (AKA Aardvarck) and Steven de Peven (Awanto3) happy to act as unofficial mentors. As he still does now, Tom poured his heart and soul into making music. Early experiments with blends of experimental hiphop, jazz, Latin influences, Afrobeat sounds and soul-flecked broken beat caught the ear of local labels and producers, before he began to apply his composition and production skills to house music. By the time local label Rush Hour snapped up his debut single, \u201cLive With The BBQ\u201d, in 2006, he\u2019d already developed a trademark style that blended the best of three decades of dance music \u2013 disco, boogie, synth funk, Detroit techno and more \u2013 with insatiable house rhythms and an intrinsic grasp of what makes dancefloors tick. It\u2019s this blend, not to mention his love of collaborating with musicians, vocalists and producers from Amsterdam and beyond (think Romanthony, San Proper, Awanto 3, Cinnaman, Tyree Cooper and Bok Bok), which makes his music so irresistible. Given his impressive track record, it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that several of his tracks \u2013 not least the rush-inducing \u201cUse Me Again\u201d and 2015\u2019s equally delicious \u201cHidden Heart Of Gold\u201d and \u201cBrutal Romance\u201d \u2013 sound like future classics. It\u2019s not surprising that Tom is a man in demand. Aside from travelling the glove, he continues to develop the Voyage Direct label he founded in 2010, an outlet for Dutch electronic music that\u2019s more like an extended family of like-minded musicians than a regular imprint. It celebrated its\u2019 fifth birthday in Spring 2015 with a label compilation, ahead of an expansive tour featuring appearances from various \u201cVD\u201d family members. As time moves on, Tom continues to pour his heart and soul into music, whether DJing, performing live or making new tracks. If you bump into him in the corner of some dark, sweaty club, you\u2019re likely to find him excitedly talking about ideas for new projects \u2013 from film soundtracks to audiovisual performances and straight-up club tracks \u2013 or waxing lyrical about hitherto unknown producers he\u2019s discovered in Amsterdam or Rotterdam. His immersion in music may be total, but Tom Trago\u2019s musical journey is far from complete.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Saint John and the Revelations ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/440517.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Folk Rock, Rock, Alt Folk, Alternative, Indie Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"...I feel like the guy who discovered U2\" - Indie Music Express\n\n\"...these guys are Smiths 3.0\" - Eat Sleep Drink Music\n\n\"Halo demonstrates that this band from Venice, CA comes with\nremarkable depth\" - Caught in the Carousel\n\nSaint John was born in Victoria, BC, Canada.

The first is an American doom / sludge rock band from Louisiana, characterized by their extremely slow, low-keyed, hardcore and brooding songs.\n\nStarting in 1989 and taking its name from the Crowbar group in NOLA (New Orleans), Kirk Windstein went on to pioneer slow and heavy music with a unique vocal style. Their first album, \"Obedience Through Suffering\" was released in 1991, but failed to achieve notoriety. By 1993's self-titled (Crowbar) album, personal friend Phil Anselmo (Pantera, Down, and Superjoint Ritual among others) produced the record, which eventually led to national promotion on MTV's Headbanger's Ball. Phil sang back up on a few tracks and sang background on \"Broken Glass\" which rounded out the anthems \"All I Had (I Gave),\" \"I Have Failed\" and \"Existence is Punishment\" along with a new take on the Led Zeppelin song \"No Quarter.\" Following their success the band went on to record music videos, major tours with Pantera, and more albums. Their band stage antics became infamous, which led to being immoralized in the Pantera \"Home Video 3\" and Crowbar's \"Like Broken\" Home Video.\n\nAs time moved on the band lost its founding members with the exception on vocal and guitarist Kirk Windstein. After Todd Strange left the band, the trademark 300 pound + band members slimmed down and the heaviness was only in the music and not the band members. The band continues to perform, borrowing members from NOLA metal bands like Goatwhore and Acid Bath. In their recent 2005 release, \"Life's Blood For The Downtrodden\" Pantera bassist rex brown lent his bass duties and keyboard playing and Down's producer Warren Riker.\n\n2). The second features Casey Chaos of Amen with a friend and ex-member of The 4-Skins, and is now broken up.\n\n\n\nThere is also a 3rd band called Crowbar, and this band hailed from Toronto, Canada in the early '70s.

After hearing classic hip-hop albums from the era such as The College Dropout, Get Rich Or Die Tryin\u2019 and The Documentary, LTtheMonk knew that he had to find out properly what this music was. Combining this with an interest in reggae (shown to him at an early age by his Jamaican mother) and rock (via his Irish father), LT\u2019s adventurous love of music and performing onstage grew throughout the years, culminating in the release of his first EP at age 17. He has since grown into a vibrant and compelling talent. LTtheMonk\u2019s 2015 debut album, Monk in London, described his career, relationship with his home city and journey to adulthood. His 2017 release The Dark Side of the Monk was an introspective and wide-ranging session rooted in California production aesthetics and informed by contemporary race politics.\nHaving moved from the UK megacity to Hamilton, Ontario in 2017, listeners might expect LT\u2019s latest outing Kinks, Drinks & Hip-Hop to reflect another leap in personal and artistic evolution. And they would not be disappointed. The album is as questioning as its predecessors, serving up an in-depth exploration of his romantic relationships, place in hip-hop and the music industry, and more discoveries of his persona. The album\u2019s title nods to Diamond D\u2019s 1992 classic Stunts, Blunts & Hip-Hop, but the album is of-the-moment and crisply defined by local players \u2014 the sounds of Hamilton producer Judah Jump, plus Hamilton hip-hop and R&B artists Hoss Bowman and Viktoria Csik \u2014 as well as collaborations with New York\u2019s YoHanMadeTheBeat, Canadian musicians such as Aisha Barrow, Lucas Hibbs and Owen Gow, and (in a call-back to his roots) longtime friend, rapper and producer ROYOS from South London. London-made and East-Coast trained, paying homage to his home city as well as the New York MCs who were his inspiration to begin rapping after his first discovery of hip-hop.\n\nWith a new release on the horizon for 2020, you can catch LTtheMonk (emcee-vocalist LT, backed by keyboardist Santiago Rozo-Paz, bassist Cam Watson and drummer Lucas Hibbs) live on stages across Ontario.\n\nLTtheMonk\u2019s album Kinks, Drinks & Hip-Hop is available now on all streaming platforms.

The fourth full-length from bi-lingual French-born singer Samantha Stephenson and post-punk guitar visionary Scott Helland, Hooray Beret is organic and largely acoustic but relentless in its downhill grooves and cheeky garage noir riffage. In song after song, Stephenson nails the vanities, traps, and disfiguring pressures of 21st century life as she delivers a genuinely affirmative and urgent call to action: the action of self-reflection.\n\nThe album-opening \u201cWah\u201d winks in awareness of this paradox. Over an insistent club beat and a stylish, Euro vocal hook, Stephenson instructs herself to \u201cstay at home on a Saturday night...diving into what feels real.\u201d A feminist theme of self-exploration-as-activism recurs in almost every song. The deliriously cool chorus of the New Wave and spy-toned \u201cLankey Bell Bottoms\u201d celebrates continual growth and the rejection of triviality, while the gorgeous jangle-pop of \u201cSing\u201d offers a compact time-lapse portrait of a woman ignoring or forestalling her true calling in five different decades of her life.\n\nHooray Beret\u2019s message of independence and the shedding of socially imposed identities is well-earned. For more than a decade, Frenchy and the Punk have been refining their own voice in many quadrants of the Balkanized post-punk world. They have essentially invented their own genre in which punk vitality and drive meets an evocative, cinematic way with exotic melodies and European-inflected percussive textures. A founding member of Deep Wound with J Mascis and Lou Barlow, Helland weaves dark riffs and layers of spidery melody in an acoustic/electric tone that is entirely his own. Stephenson sings with a gothy heft and authority that may remind one generation of Siouxsie Sioux and another of Grace Slick.\n\nThrough no design of their own, the Hudson valley, New York, based band has become an in-demand performer on the post-cabaret, mythic, and steampunk scenes, even as they eschew affectation and excessive theatricality. Their engaging, unjaded live shows convert strangers to fans regardless of the setting. Hooray Beret offers the strongest proof to date of this band\u2019s rich and edifying spirit of serious fun.\n\nThe product of a 1998 office romance, the two left their temp jobs, traveled as a solo musician (him) and artist (her) selling their wares until 2005 when, Stephenson, the sultry French born singer jumped onstage and joined, Helland, the fiery punk rock guitarist from the golden days of the hardcore scene, and Frenchy and the Punk was born. Along the way they became the 'jewel of the steampunk/Dark Cabaret scene' and were named one of the ''Top 25 duos in America' by Yahoo music.\n\nThe unlikely pairing has since released 6 full-length CDs, produced a live concert DVD and have performed all across the U.S. and in Europe. Their show is a carnival of two that will take you from the Moulin Rouge to CBGBs and back again.

The Canadian piano pop tunesmith has been steadily building a loyal following across North America and beyond for over ten years, yet his new music has the feel of an artist still out to discover something fresh and honest and connect with a wider audience.\n\nEvin On Earth builds on Evin\u2019s soulful sound and tells the story of the search for love and community. As one fan puts it, Evin has a way of \u201ccalling out all the meaningless noise we live with these days and just paring music down to simple, beautiful perfection.\u201d This new album, his sixth full-length, is one of his most diverse collection of songs, but it never strays from the consistent and distinctive sound of Evin\u2019s piano and singing. Along the way, Evin wears his various influences on his sleeve and takes us from theatrical power-pop to Afro-Latin grooves, from electro ska to laid-back beach pop. There are touches of The Who, West Side Story, Jason Mraz, ELO, Toots & The Maytals, The Bee Gees, Coldplay and Joe Jackson. Throughout the record, the catchy pop influence of his two mainstays, Billy Joel and Elton John, is alive and thriving.\n\nThe new album reunites Evin with some key collaborators from different points in his career: producer Howie Beck (Charlotte Day Wilson) first worked with Evin on 2015\u2019s Life As A Lover, bassist Jim Creeggan (Barenaked Ladies) co-produced 2005\u2019s I\u2019ll Bring The Stereo, and drummer Ian MacKay (Basia Bulat) has toured across Canada and the US with Evin.\n\nTo shake things up midway through the writing and recording process, Evin spent a summer traveling and immersing himself in two different cultures: he volunteered in the Aniishnaabe community of Manitoulin Island for a month, and he drove down to New Orleans to write for the other month. These adventures added a thematic thread to some of the album\u2019s songs. Evin\u2019s no stranger to dropping himself in the middle of unfamiliar territory. In the summer of 2012, he spent two months studying percussion in Cuba in the midst of a rich Afro-Cuban community.\n\nEvin On Earth was recorded in Evin\u2019s homebase of Toronto, and the album title has been kicking around since his early years coming up in the Montreal scene. A friend suggested it back then, and Evin originally scoffed at it - but it just seemed right for this album. That same friend challenged Evin to write a short album opening title song, and the result is \u201cEvin On Earth\u201d, a kind of mission statement and salute to artists everywhere.\n\nEvin\u2019s fans include Canadian icons Barenaked Ladies and Ron Sexsmith. CBC Music called Evin the \u201cnext big thing\u201d, and \u201cHave I Ever Loved?\u201d was among the Top 20 most played songs of 2015 on Sirius XM\u2019s CBC Sonica. \u201cAl Green\u201d reached #1 on Sirius XM\u2019s The Verge. In 2017, Barenaked Ladies brought him out to support their US theatre tour, and he\u2019s also shared stages with Sexsmith, Dan Mangan and Sarah Harmer. Audiences love the spontaneity, intimacy and energy of his live shows.\n\nThe Evin On Earth album title took on added nuance when toward the end of making the record Evin had a near-death experience. He and a friend found themselves lost in the woods of Quebec after-dark while cross-country skiing in -25 degree celcius weather. Close to hypothermia, Evin almost lay down to rest in the snow, but he pushed on. During the next two months, he endured frostbite on his finger-tips and was unable to play piano.\n\nMike Evin\u2019s modern spin on piano pop manages to sound contemporary, classic and elusive all at once. His voice is a heartfelt reflection of the human experience. Now with his new album (out October 11 on Cairomin Records), he\u2019s bringing everyone another \u2018little slice of Evin on Earth.\u2019\n\n\u201cAn overflowing musical universe\u201d\n- Live In Limbo\n\n\u201cDanceable sexy pop music that will make you want to sway your hips\u201d\n- The Girl At The Rock Show\n\n\u201cHauntingly beautiful vocals and mesmerizing music\u201d\n- Canadian Beats", "otherInfo": "Music Room Session"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Outer Vibe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9636714.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Pop, Rock, Alternative, Pop Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, band members Lisa Kacos (drums/trumpet), Sean Zuidgeest (vocals/bass), and Nick Hosford (guitar) studied classical music in college while packing dance floors throughout the Midwest.

After hearing classic hip-hop albums from the era such as The College Dropout, Get Rich Or Die Tryin\u2019 and The Documentary, LTtheMonk knew that he had to find out properly what this music was. Combining this with an interest in reggae (shown to him at an early age by his Jamaican mother) and rock (via his Irish father), LT\u2019s adventurous love of music and performing onstage grew throughout the years, culminating in the release of his first EP at age 17. He has since grown into a vibrant and compelling talent. LTtheMonk\u2019s 2015 debut album, Monk in London, described his career, relationship with his home city and journey to adulthood. His 2017 release The Dark Side of the Monk was an introspective and wide-ranging session rooted in California production aesthetics and informed by contemporary race politics.\nHaving moved from the UK megacity to Hamilton, Ontario in 2017, listeners might expect LT\u2019s latest outing Kinks, Drinks & Hip-Hop to reflect another leap in personal and artistic evolution. And they would not be disappointed. The album is as questioning as its predecessors, serving up an in-depth exploration of his romantic relationships, place in hip-hop and the music industry, and more discoveries of his persona. The album\u2019s title nods to Diamond D\u2019s 1992 classic Stunts, Blunts & Hip-Hop, but the album is of-the-moment and crisply defined by local players \u2014 the sounds of Hamilton producer Judah Jump, plus Hamilton hip-hop and R&B artists Hoss Bowman and Viktoria Csik \u2014 as well as collaborations with New York\u2019s YoHanMadeTheBeat, Canadian musicians such as Aisha Barrow, Lucas Hibbs and Owen Gow, and (in a call-back to his roots) longtime friend, rapper and producer ROYOS from South London. London-made and East-Coast trained, paying homage to his home city as well as the New York MCs who were his inspiration to begin rapping after his first discovery of hip-hop.\n\nWith a new release on the horizon for 2020, you can catch LTtheMonk (emcee-vocalist LT, backed by keyboardist Santiago Rozo-Paz, bassist Cam Watson and drummer Lucas Hibbs) live on stages across Ontario.\n\nLTtheMonk\u2019s album Kinks, Drinks & Hip-Hop is available now on all streaming platforms.

The fourth full-length from bi-lingual French-born singer Samantha Stephenson and post-punk guitar visionary Scott Helland, Hooray Beret is organic and largely acoustic but relentless in its downhill grooves and cheeky garage noir riffage. In song after song, Stephenson nails the vanities, traps, and disfiguring pressures of 21st century life as she delivers a genuinely affirmative and urgent call to action: the action of self-reflection.\n\nThe album-opening \u201cWah\u201d winks in awareness of this paradox. Over an insistent club beat and a stylish, Euro vocal hook, Stephenson instructs herself to \u201cstay at home on a Saturday night...diving into what feels real.\u201d A feminist theme of self-exploration-as-activism recurs in almost every song. The deliriously cool chorus of the New Wave and spy-toned \u201cLankey Bell Bottoms\u201d celebrates continual growth and the rejection of triviality, while the gorgeous jangle-pop of \u201cSing\u201d offers a compact time-lapse portrait of a woman ignoring or forestalling her true calling in five different decades of her life.\n\nHooray Beret\u2019s message of independence and the shedding of socially imposed identities is well-earned. For more than a decade, Frenchy and the Punk have been refining their own voice in many quadrants of the Balkanized post-punk world. They have essentially invented their own genre in which punk vitality and drive meets an evocative, cinematic way with exotic melodies and European-inflected percussive textures. A founding member of Deep Wound with J Mascis and Lou Barlow, Helland weaves dark riffs and layers of spidery melody in an acoustic/electric tone that is entirely his own. Stephenson sings with a gothy heft and authority that may remind one generation of Siouxsie Sioux and another of Grace Slick.\n\nThrough no design of their own, the Hudson valley, New York, based band has become an in-demand performer on the post-cabaret, mythic, and steampunk scenes, even as they eschew affectation and excessive theatricality. Their engaging, unjaded live shows convert strangers to fans regardless of the setting. Hooray Beret offers the strongest proof to date of this band\u2019s rich and edifying spirit of serious fun.\n\nThe product of a 1998 office romance, the two left their temp jobs, traveled as a solo musician (him) and artist (her) selling their wares until 2005 when, Stephenson, the sultry French born singer jumped onstage and joined, Helland, the fiery punk rock guitarist from the golden days of the hardcore scene, and Frenchy and the Punk was born. Along the way they became the 'jewel of the steampunk/Dark Cabaret scene' and were named one of the ''Top 25 duos in America' by Yahoo music.\n\nThe unlikely pairing has since released 6 full-length CDs, produced a live concert DVD and have performed all across the U.S. and in Europe. Their show is a carnival of two that will take you from the Moulin Rouge to CBGBs and back again.

The Canadian piano pop tunesmith has been steadily building a loyal following across North America and beyond for over ten years, yet his new music has the feel of an artist still out to discover something fresh and honest and connect with a wider audience.\n\nEvin On Earth builds on Evin\u2019s soulful sound and tells the story of the search for love and community. As one fan puts it, Evin has a way of \u201ccalling out all the meaningless noise we live with these days and just paring music down to simple, beautiful perfection.\u201d This new album, his sixth full-length, is one of his most diverse collection of songs, but it never strays from the consistent and distinctive sound of Evin\u2019s piano and singing. Along the way, Evin wears his various influences on his sleeve and takes us from theatrical power-pop to Afro-Latin grooves, from electro ska to laid-back beach pop. There are touches of The Who, West Side Story, Jason Mraz, ELO, Toots & The Maytals, The Bee Gees, Coldplay and Joe Jackson. Throughout the record, the catchy pop influence of his two mainstays, Billy Joel and Elton John, is alive and thriving.\n\nThe new album reunites Evin with some key collaborators from different points in his career: producer Howie Beck (Charlotte Day Wilson) first worked with Evin on 2015\u2019s Life As A Lover, bassist Jim Creeggan (Barenaked Ladies) co-produced 2005\u2019s I\u2019ll Bring The Stereo, and drummer Ian MacKay (Basia Bulat) has toured across Canada and the US with Evin.\n\nTo shake things up midway through the writing and recording process, Evin spent a summer traveling and immersing himself in two different cultures: he volunteered in the Aniishnaabe community of Manitoulin Island for a month, and he drove down to New Orleans to write for the other month. These adventures added a thematic thread to some of the album\u2019s songs. Evin\u2019s no stranger to dropping himself in the middle of unfamiliar territory. In the summer of 2012, he spent two months studying percussion in Cuba in the midst of a rich Afro-Cuban community.\n\nEvin On Earth was recorded in Evin\u2019s homebase of Toronto, and the album title has been kicking around since his early years coming up in the Montreal scene. A friend suggested it back then, and Evin originally scoffed at it - but it just seemed right for this album. That same friend challenged Evin to write a short album opening title song, and the result is \u201cEvin On Earth\u201d, a kind of mission statement and salute to artists everywhere.\n\nEvin\u2019s fans include Canadian icons Barenaked Ladies and Ron Sexsmith. CBC Music called Evin the \u201cnext big thing\u201d, and \u201cHave I Ever Loved?\u201d was among the Top 20 most played songs of 2015 on Sirius XM\u2019s CBC Sonica. \u201cAl Green\u201d reached #1 on Sirius XM\u2019s The Verge. In 2017, Barenaked Ladies brought him out to support their US theatre tour, and he\u2019s also shared stages with Sexsmith, Dan Mangan and Sarah Harmer. Audiences love the spontaneity, intimacy and energy of his live shows.\n\nThe Evin On Earth album title took on added nuance when toward the end of making the record Evin had a near-death experience. He and a friend found themselves lost in the woods of Quebec after-dark while cross-country skiing in -25 degree celcius weather. Close to hypothermia, Evin almost lay down to rest in the snow, but he pushed on. During the next two months, he endured frostbite on his finger-tips and was unable to play piano.\n\nMike Evin\u2019s modern spin on piano pop manages to sound contemporary, classic and elusive all at once. His voice is a heartfelt reflection of the human experience. Now with his new album (out October 11 on Cairomin Records), he\u2019s bringing everyone another \u2018little slice of Evin on Earth.\u2019\n\n\u201cAn overflowing musical universe\u201d\n- Live In Limbo\n\n\u201cDanceable sexy pop music that will make you want to sway your hips\u201d\n- The Girl At The Rock Show\n\n\u201cHauntingly beautiful vocals and mesmerizing music\u201d\n- Canadian Beats", "otherInfo": "Music Room Session"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Liam Payne ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8224999.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hey Monea ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10387470.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-27", "Genre": "Pop, Rock, Indie", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hey Monea are:\nDan Monea \u2013 vocalist, guitarist, shark fisherman, foodie\nNate Monea \u2013 vocalist, drummer, MacGyverer, skeptic\nStephen Fernandez \u2013 vocalist, bassist, herboligist, shaman\n\nHey Monea have always been driven by a healthy sense of wanderlust \u2013 a deep desire to see the world, try new things, and to challenge the limits of what is possible.

My granddaddy's granddaddy's granddaddy was born in Caswell County in 1795. Maybe we go back further, I don't know.\n\nOn Friday the 13th, November 1970, I was born at the Cape Fear Valley Hospital in Fayetteville, North Carolina, probably the biggest military town in the country. Fort Bragg alone covers 250 square miles, and the used car dealerships and titty bars are like stars in the sky, grains of sand on the beach. The ground is sandy and the woods are open and piney, with tall loblollies, jack oaks, and the longleaf pine.\n\nWe left for Fort Worth, Texas when I was about 2 or 3, so that dad could attend Southwest Theological Seminary. My first memory is of crossing the Mississppi in a U-Haul. My dad was excited about the bridge and couldn't stop talking about how it was an engineering marvel and all.\n\nFrom there, the memories get thicker, catching tarantulas after a rainstorm, putting pennies on the railroad track, barefoot ooching across the Texas road, so hot the asphalt was soft. There was a snowstorm. We've got pictures.\n\nDad got a commision to preach in an English-speaking church in what was then West Germany, in a little town called Vernheim. Our landlord worked for Mercedes, got a new one every year, and kept a weinkellar like a liquor store. Dad would give me the rent check, I'd walk it upstairs, and the hausfrau would pinch my cheeks and give me a chocolate bar as big as my head.\n\nIn church, my father preached and my mother played piano for the services. I learned how to sing in that church and even did a solo of \"Amazing Grace\" for the congregation. We had a piano in the house and my mom gave me some lessons. I did really well, but I got bored with the workbook/lesson plan style. My brother had a guitar and that was cooler. We moved to Giessen a few years later and he got \"The Wall\" for a birthday present from a friend. Mom and Dad almost didn't let him keep it, 'cause there were \"disturbing images\" on the inside. They relented and Gray taught me my first guitar piece, that cool acoustic guitar solo in A minor. I was 8.\n\nWhen I was about ten, we came back to the states, my daddy lost his mind, divorced my mom, and started drinking and managing Eckerds drug stores. He went through another wife and found the construction industry, wherein he could stay drunk all day. That finally lead him to recovery and he spent the rest of his life building houses for storm victims and Habitat whenever he could. He was a good man with a lot of demons, and he married a third time 'til death did he part in 1999. His favorite song was \"Amazing Grace\" and his vinyl bluegrass collection influenced me greatly, especially Flatt and Scruggs and the Stanley Brothers. He bought a banjo once and became so frustrated with it that he turned it into a clock.\n\nMom was a rock through all of that, got a good job at UNC, paid a man to build her a log cabin in the country outside of Chapel Hill, and did her best to raise me. I was a real pain in the ass. Once I got my own guitar, I had a place to put all my teen angst, but it didn't help my schoolwork at all. I probably set records for non-attendance and spent a lot of time running around in the deep woods of western Orange County. Four years in the high school jazz big band program taught me the majority of what I still know about music theory. Along with an early enlistment in the Navy, music got me through and out into the real world, where I finally got my ass kicked.\n\nI spent the next four years touring the Mediterranean on a tank landing ship out of Little Creek Naval Base in Norfolk, VA. The open ocean is a powerful thing to behold. The stars at night are unlike anything you will see on this Earth anymore; it is the last great wilderness. Besides that, being tear-gassed was about the most fun I ever had in the Navy. I carried a guitar behind my bunk everywhere we went and made strange four-track recordings when we were in port and there was an empty berthing to use as a late-night studio. Of all the guys I knew on ship, I still remember the names of the ones I played music with- Robert Thomas, David Saylor, Hadji Henderson.\n\nAfter my time was up, I spent some days in Virgina Beach, playing in a heavy rock band called Coup d'Etat at first, and then Day 11, which was just a license plate we saw at a grocery store one day. We were sort of prog, like Bad Brains meets King Crimson and we rubbed Tiger Balm on our nads before we took the stage because Fishbone said that they did. They probably said that just to see if anyone would do it. A girlfriend gave me my first acoustic guitar, a Fender; I think she stole it. She stole enough money from me that I think I paid her for it.\n\nVirginia Beach outright sucked, so I came home to work at Weaver Street Market and started another band called Scalliwag. I knew there was something missing from my culinary life (mac'n'cheese, ramen, pizza) and the job at Weaver Street was a cry for help. It turned out to be the social hub of Carrboro, NC and I met a lot of people who are still my close friends today. The rock band thing wasn't working out, so I started playing the acoustic more and met a lot of other acoustic musicians.\n\nMy friends Leo Lorenzoni and Michael Kovich told me about an Old-time fiddler's convention up in Buena Vista, VA and it sounded like just a laid-back, weekend-long party. I cruised up there and hung out with them; I can't even remember if I had a tent. It changed my life and it changed my music, just banging away on an A chord for hours at a time and sippin' that corn liquor. I didn't know the songs and I didn't care. Whatever these people had a hold of, I wanted some of it. It shot straight down into my veins like lightning and made my hair stand up on end. The music was intense, lyrically cut down to the bone, no bullshit. They didn't have bridges; bridges were for pussies. People got killed, died or fell in love and then got killed or maybe drank themselves to death. They weren't gonna be treated this way and they'd trade their shoes for a little bottle of booze. They were big, like John Henry and Wild Bill Jones, all fists and whiskey, heartbroken and angry as I was, ready to kill somebody.\n\nI started going to Clifftop and Mt. Airy and finding Old-time jams at home and on the road, anywhere my new friends lived. I got to thinking that I could write songs like that, or maybe one just fell out of me and I thought, \"Wow, there it is.\" Either way, I figured nobody was writing songs like that anymore, at least nobody I'd heard, and I knew that style was just technique. In other words, those songs didn't sound old because they were old; they sounded old because they were written in an old style. There wasn't a reason in the world why somebody couldn't write a song like that, if he wanted to.\n\n\"Ashe County Fair\" was probably the first song I wrote like that. Another one was \"Velma,\" a song I wrote about the woman who killed my grandfather. I think somebody dies in most of the songs on my first album. Three of them die in \"Velma.\" I was also playing Irish music by the time I recorded, so I played the guitar parts in an alternate tuning, DADGAD. In retrospect, it gives the whole album a dark, open sound that takes the themes over the edge and out into the dripping woods.\n\nI started touring full-time in 2000, realizing that I could do it as a solo performer and actually make a living. Of course, that's what every other singer/songwriter in America was doing, too, but I didn't even know what a singer/songwriter was, so that didn't bother me. I thought I was a folk musician. Over time, I realized that folk got cross-dressed and don't mean what it used to mean anymore. I think my friend Aengus Finnan said it better than anybody I've heard yet, \"It's a style of presentation.\" So that's just it, as long as you don't put on the razzle-dazzle and shake your ass in a sequin skirt, you can be a folk musician. Sit there on a stool and play your tuba, tell a story once in a while and wear some Birckenstocks. Everybody will think you're a folk musician.\n\nIn 2002, I went to the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas, where there are lots of these folk musicians, only mostly songwriters. I wandered around for a week looking for the dance tent and the fiddle bands before I realized what I've already said about the word \"folk.\" It ended up being an amazing and inspiring experience and I've been for all 18 days every year since. At the 2003 festival, I won the New Folk competition and got hired on as a performer for the next three years. I never took to Birckenstocks and my friend Anais Mitchell helped me find a great pair of boots in Austin. They're Fryes.\n\nIn 2004, Dromedary and I recorded an album together called \"The Sea and the Sky,\" which brings beautiful instruments from all over the world into my sound and songwriting. I've toured in Europe and the US with them, including a return to Kerrville and two consecutive years at the Moab Folk Festival in gorgeous Moab, Utah. If you're not familiar with Dromedary, I highly recommend you go to dromedarymusic.com right now- well, after you read the rest of this, anyway. Their music is magic, like the voice of Emmylou Harris, an instant drop in the shoulders, a glaze on the eyes, a trip back to childhood. I'm honored to be friends with them and occasionally share the three-man funk in a rental car.\n\nThe next album was a rock 'n' roll album called \"This Is The New That.\" Rock 'n' roll, because I just didn't know how else to play these songs. They're rock 'n' roll songs. It leads off with a revision of \"Subterranean Homesick Blues.\" Dromedary came back into the studio with me and played electric guitars. Rock 'n' Roll Hall-of-Famer and Muscle Shoals session guitarist Will McFarlane sits in on a few. It was amazing to watch him work, a blue-eyed gent in a kilt ripping the blues from stem to stern. When the first take was done, there were no questions and nothing left to be done but get the cat off the ceiling. What a pro.\n\nWill McFarlane told me a story about recording with Frank Sinatra, wherein Frank walked in and sang the whole album, no retakes. The engineer asked him to sing the first few words of the first song again, because he hadn't had time for a line check. Apparently, Ol' Blue Eyes squared his shoulders and told the engineer, \"Overdubbing's for faggots,\" and walked out. Political incorrectness aside, I rather like his style.\n\nTexas is a huge influence on my writing. \"The Law and the Lonesome\" is what might have happened if Townes Van Zandt had made a record with Doc Watson. Tamara Kater of Canada's venerable folk mag Penguin Eggs called \"The Law and the Lonesome\" her \"album of the decade.\" Co-produced by the brilliant Chris Bartos in Toronto, \"The Law and the Lonesome\" features a couple of co-writes with my friend Corin Raymond. We wrote the title track together, which was featured in a songwriting class at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.\n\nI beat \"Radio Soul\" and recorded \"Cackalack\" in six hours with a handful of the best musicians in Toronto, although it sounds like it was recorded in a barn in North Carolina. Ken Whitely, who has gold and platinum records to his name, engineered the record in his converted garage with Nik Tjelios. As of mid-January 2011, \"Cackalack\" was #1 on Roots Music Reports folk radio chart. I went back to Canada and made a record in two days in Gimli, Manitoba with Alexa Dirks of Begonia and Andrina Turenne singing harmonies. Joanna Miller, Rej Ricard, and Grant Siemens round out the all-star Winnipeg crew.\n\nJonathan Byrd & The Pickup Cowboys is my latest record and project. We play every Wednesday at a little roadhouse called The Kraken on highway 54 outside Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The residency has become a community for some and a pilgrimage for others. Tune in on facebook live, 7-10pm Eastern Time any Wednesday, or make the trip to join us. My friend Nathan Brown said, \"It's like a Quentin Tarantino movie.\"\n\nI'm represented by Craig Grossman at the Green Room Music Source. Email Craig and check out their roster on the website.

Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011. Elephant Mountain has just recorded their new album and will be releasing it Spring/Summer of 2013.

Whether it was rocking out to Bruce Springsteen in his dad\u2019s car or singing along to Garth Brooks with his mom, music always played a big part in Chris\u2019 life. Fast forward a few years and, like most kids, Chris couldn\u2019t stand to listen to the same music as his parents. Being from St. Louis he had to know every word to Nelly\u2019s \u201cCountry Grammer\u201d, he also fell in love with artists such as Usher and Fall Out Boy. His mix of pop, rock and country separates him from most other artists out there. After graduating from Ole Miss and spending a few summers traveling back and forth from Oxford to Nashville, Chris decided it was time to make the move. Initially knowing only a few people in the Music City, his drive and determination were quickly noticed throughout town.\n\nFrom almost empty bar rooms to fraternity parties to sold out shows, Chris has been captivating audiences everywhere he goes. Having opened for bands like The Marshall Tucker Band and LoCash, Chris\u2019 stage presence and voice pull the audience in until they are all on their feet!

The music needed to exist, and it was as much an emotional exercise as a creative one.\n\u201cI think every other record that I've written, I wrote knowing that the songs would have an outlet,\u201d Costa says \u201cAnd for this one, I really didn\u2019t. It was just a process I was going through, clearing myself of these feelings and thoughts.\u201d\nThe songs were like Costa\u2019s letters to himself, with the honesty and intimacy of something that was not meant to be heard. \u201c I feel really close to them for that reason,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of my favorite writing is like that - Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s Dear Theo, or Steinbeck\u2019s A Life in Letters. Those are really revealing, because it\u2019s not intended as part of their body of work. There\u2019s something really special about that. But at the same time, I write songs and perform for a living. So it's hard to think these songs will never see the light of day.\u201d\nAnd now, of course, they have. Yellow Coat is a masterpiece of heartbreak from a preternatural tunesmith, its raw emotion channeled into gently swinging, hooky love songs, most of them awash in strings and mellotron and harmonies and groove. From the insinuating acoustic riffs and lo-fi beats of \u201cAvenal\u201d and the snappy fatalism of \u201cSlow\u201d to the almost church-like fragility of \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d Yellow Coat is equal parts lost \u201860s AM radio hits, folk-pop beauty and dark night of the soul music.\nAt the time that Costa started writing, he had stripped things down not only emotionally, but in terms of his surroundings. He had moved into a Laguna Beach studio - as in the size of his living quarters, not a recording complex - with just the bare minimum of furniture and instruments. Instead of a bedside table, a Wurlitzer Sideman drum machine.\nThe Wurlitzer eventually got used and sampled on \u201cAvenal,\u201d which Costa and his friend Chase Perkowski (Iris and the Shade) wrote on a going-nowhere road trip a few hundred miles northeast of L.A. \u201cI was in a searching headspace,\u201d Costa says. \u201cRunning away from something, trying to find something, trying to find myself. We stopped at a gas station overlooking highway 5. Chase was strumming a few chords as the gas was pumping, and I sat under a tree humming a melody and frantically writing down lyrics. By the time the car was fully fueled I asked him to play back the chords to me as I sang the song.\u201d Back on the road, the next sign said \u201cAVENAL: 2 Miles\u201d and Costa had both his opening track and song title.\nThe 37 year-old Costa has a lot of music and artistic growth under his belt, particularly in the last six years. He was 21 when he made his first EP, having immersed himself in music after a bad skateboard landing sidetracked what might have been a pro career. Coming out of that world, he had a punk side, but also became enamored of Scottish folk, and Brian Jones\u2019 guitar style in the Rolling Stones.\n\u201cOne of my first shows that I played was with a band that was all about things like At The Drive-In,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI went up there with my acoustic guitar and played like a Pixies song, and a Donovan song, and then an original of mine. And I remember thinking, What am I? Do I even belong here?\u201d But at no point did he ever think, \u201cOkay, I'm just going to be a guy with a guitar. I always heard bigger arrangements.\u201d\nHe began his career on Jack Johnson\u2019s Brushfire Records, where both his 2006 debut, Songs We Sing, and 2008\u2019s Unfamiliar Faces were produced by No Doubt\u2019s Tom Dumont. Costa produced 2010\u2019s Mobile Chateau himself, while 2013\u2019s self-titled effort brought him to Scotland, where producer Tony Doogan (Beck, Air) assembled a backing band drawn from the ranks of Belle and Sebastian. In 2013, he began a several year period of restless wandering, working on soundtracks such as the 2017 documentary Orange Sunshine and releasing short EPs experimenting with different aspects of his artistry. Then, in 2018 with Santa Rosa Fangs, he found a new home at Dangerbird. The record, a winding story about a family of characters in Northern California, was a rebirth of sorts and a second act to a long and storied career.\n\u201cI've always had freedom in making my records and songs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with Dangerbird, and the last records, they really trusted me to follow my instincts, which is a pretty special place to be.\u201d\nEven before writing \u201cAvenal,\u201d Costa had done a fair amount of home recording. Once an album seemed to be in the cards, the label suggested he connect with producer Alex Newport (At the Drive-In, Death Cab For Cutie, Bleached), as much because they would get along personally as creatively. They worked on three songs that were in varying states of completion, including \u201cLast Love Song\u201d (a simple home recording), \u201cSlow\u201d (a demo) and \u201cMake That Change\u201d (a bare-bones solo acoustic track that Costa and Newport fleshed out from start to finish). Then they kept on going.\nCosta plays a bit of everything on the record, but he also brought in touring drummer Cory Gash and one-woman string section Alexis Mahler (she plays both violin and cello). Costa and Mahler had previously done a lot of remote recording, but this time she came down to California for a week. \u201cWe worked up a bunch of arrangements together that lifted up a lot of the songs in a nice way,\u201d Costa says. \u201cI wanted to really pull up some of the emotional stuff with string and things\u201d (said \u2018things\u2019 being the mellotron, which can evoke so many different tones, as well as Costa\u2019s layered vocals).\nCosta had been playing \u201cSlow\u201d at solo shows before recording it, but it was first written around a rhythm track. With its snappy bass and doo-wop-inspired backing vocals, it feels like a song that could have been plucked from a Scorsese movie, except made in 2020. The sweeping, soulful \u201cJet Black Lake\u201d is equally cinematic, with Costa pushing his vocal range into falsetto.\nBut it\u2019s \u201cLet Love Heal\u201d and \u201cLast Love Song\u201d that are perhaps the heart of the record, bittersweet evocations of love\u2019s power to both soothe and devastate. When Costa first wrote what became \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d it had a different title, and was meant to be an anniversary gift. Instead, it turned into a break-up song, its sadness as palpable as the sound of Costa\u2019s fingers on guitar strings.\nLife does go on, however: the record ends with the last song Costa wrote for it, \u201cSo I Say Goodbye,\u201d which provides a sense of closure, its piano-driven tunefulness feeling both uplifting and melancholy. And since finishing Yellow Coat, Costa has written and released an even newer piece of music, \u201cHuman Kind of Song,\u201d which he lyrically crowd-sourced with fans on Instagram while sheltering in-place. Like every other songwriter, he doesn\u2019t know when he will next play live in front of people, so the experience provided some community. And while Yellow Coat may have started as an album about heartbreak, its sense of sadness, hope and perseverance also feels completely universal.\n\u201cEveryone's going through personal trials all the time,\u201d says Costa. \u201cAnd it can be isolating. But now everyone's going through something. And as difficult as that is, there's comfort in that too. Because we're all in it together, and we have been the whole time. Except now we can actually feel it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Plain White T's ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8800211.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Poprock, Power Pop, Alt Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Download + Stream 'Parallel Universe' on all your favorite music sites", "otherInfo": "Major thanks for tuning in for Tom's previous FB live session!\n\nThis time, Tom is BACK and is looking for YOU to vote on the 5 songs he will perform via FB messenger.\n\nSign up to be notified when voting begins for the next live set list now ->>> https://linktr.ee/plainwhitets"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Max Stalling ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10395131.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Country, Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Texas based songwriter, Max Stalling, had no expectation of ever being in the music business. \u201cI didn\u2019t even pick up a guitar until graduate school,\u201d notes Stalling. After attending high school in South Texas, Stalling studied at Texas A&M - College Station, where he earned a masters degree in Food Science. He followed the corporate road from there and eventually landed in Dallas working in product development for Frito-Lay.\n\nDuring this time, Stalling discovered the Three Teardrops Tavern and Dallas community radio station KNON. These outlets exposed a musical heritage to which Stalling had been nearly oblivious. Inspired by artists like Townes Van Zandt, Robert Earl Keen, Guy Clark, Lyle Lovett, and Jerry Jeff Walker, Stalling started writing songs, recording albums, and eventually touring with a full band to back him. In June 2008, Stalling joined musical greats Kris Kristofferson, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, Selena, Guy Clark and many others when he received a star on the South Texas Music Walk of Fame in Corpus Christi.\n\nStalling's style is modern with a vintage feel. With Jeff Howe on drums and percussion, Glenn Wallace on nylon-string guitar and electric guitar, Heather Stalling on fiddle and harmony vocals, and Jason Steinsultz swapping between stand-up and electric bass, Stalling creates a dynamic live show that\u2019s smart, charming and as listenable as it is danceable. Stalling and troupe are equally at home on a huge concert stage in front of thousands or playing an acoustic set for a hundred. Attendance numbers at shows have continued to rise. \u201cI chalk it up to the strength of the songs and the strength of my band\u201d, comments Max.\n\nDespite playing the same circuit as many household names in Texas country, grouping Stalling with them would be premature. His unique voice and amusingly clever song lyrics pull him in a different direction - a direction most obviously evident in his newest record Banquet.\n\nStalling has put together an elite team for his newest studio project, Banquet, including recording heavyweight and Grammy winner Lloyd Maines. Maines has been instrumental in developing the sounds of some of the best artists in music and has worked with industry giants including the Dixie Chicks, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Bruce Robison. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the life that this record has,\u201d says Max. \u201cWe poured heart and soul into this project and I think people will be wowed by what this project contains\u201d\n\n\nBanquet was released in 2015. Previous projects include Home to You from 2010, Topaz City in 2007; One of the Ways, 2002; Wide Afternoon, 2000; Comfort In the Curves, 1997; and three live releases (Sell-Out, 2006; Live From The Granada CD/DVD 2009 and Live At The Mucky Duck - Portmanteau, 2019).

When Freddie was 15, the family moved to a more upscale neighborhood in New Orleans. Freddie\u2014along with his brother Adam and sister Crystal Ross\u2014were immersed in music at home by their mother, who often sang along to her Gladys Knight and Patty LaBelle records around the house. But it was the Baptist church choir where a young Freddie flourished. \u201dMy mother made sure I never missed practice,\u201d recalls Freedia. It\u2019s no wonder that by the time he was 18, Freedia moved from member to director of the choir.\n\nA product of the hip-hop generation, Freedia was rocking RUN DMC, Salt \u2018n Pepa and Adidas Shell Tops as a teenager. One night in 1991 he heard \"Where Dey At\" by MC T Tucker, (what many believe to be the first recorded Bounce track) and he was transfixed. After starting as a back-up dancer for Katey Red, the original \u201cSissy Bounce\u201d rapper, Freedia knew Bounce was his calling and eventually broke out on his own.\n\nBig Freedia is in the studio wrapping up her new ep Queen of Bounce and her first TV series, Queen of Bounce will air this Oct on Fuse TV.

When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do. Having already established themselves both as melodic songwriters (2004\u2019s RIAA-Certified Gold record They\u2019re Only Chasing Safety) and as ambitious power merchants (2006\u2019s stentorian, gold-selling Define The Great Line and its majestic follow-up, 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound Of Separation), the evolution detailed on Erase Me finds them using the sonic dialects they\u2019ve crafted to reveal where they are now. Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems. Even with a comeback title seemingly marinating in self-fulfilling prophecy, nobody in their right mind would dare delete Under\u00f8ath\u2019s measurable contribution to the advancement of post-hardcore and heavy rock.

But the South Korea born, New Mexico raised performer hardly realized just how dynamically his skills on the instrument would mesh with his ultimate development as a rocker in the popular regional bands Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and now, his emergence as a powerful and emotional singer/songwriter in his own right. On his debut album These Illusions, Park plays violin and acoustic guitar in addition to reaching out to acoustic rock fans everywhere with his inimitable vocals. Because of the mostly personal nature of the songs, the compelling 11-track collection rolls like a fascinating chronology of the 27-year-old singer\u2019s life, beginning with tunes he wrote when he was an engineering student at New Mexico State in his now adopted hometown of Las Cruces. He was also building his catalog of songs as he played violin and contributed backing vocals for several years in two well known regional bands: the mostly cover band Live Bait and the \u201cscreamo\u201d metalcore/hardcore group Kiss To Betray. Playing in Live Bait, his violin came in very handy for those Dave Matthews songs and it helped him take songs like Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d to a transcendent level. Live Bait won the local college radio station KRUXFEST for \u201cBest New Alternative Band\u201d in 2005 and Kiss To Betray won the Las Cruces 2006 Battle of the Bands and later played at well known venues around the country like Headhunters in Austin, The Viper Room in L.A. and hotspots in Phoenix. As a solo artist, Park has since headlined regularly at local clubs like El Patio Bar and Hurricane Alley, the Albuquerque haunts the Launch Pad and Rally\u2019s Pub on 4th Street, and in Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix and even Colorado Springs. He recently posted two live performance videos on his myspace (myspace.com/danielparkmusic), one of which features his unique looping technique which allows him to play violin and guitar \u201csimultaneously\u201d on the same song. While Park enjoyed his time in Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and the notoriety he received as a featured performer, in some ways he felt he was always gearing up for his eventual breakthrough to the forefront as his own artist. In the months leading up to the breakup of Kiss To Betray, Park gathered his best material, entered what kiddingly refers to as \u201ca local ghetto studio\u201d and started to come to grips with These Illusions. While many of the tracks on the album have their roots in romantic relationships, the hypnotic and percussive, acoustic guitar driven title cut cuts to the core of his desire to find his own creative path in life\u2014even if it means going against the mainstream expectations of our society. Other songs tap slightly into his lifelong search for identity as an Asian born man adopted (along with two of his siblings) by a white American family. Other key tracks on These Illusions include the jangling, high energy \u201cTimes Have Changed,\u201d which laments the shift in life as his significant other chooses to move on. The graceful, easy strumming ballad \u201cWhat We Should Be\u201d is another heartbreaker about learning to accept the changes in a relationship when one person leaves to pursue his or her dreams\u2014while still celebrating the memories.

Combining Thomas\u2019s arranging ideas and skilled instrumental work with Andrija\u2019s studio full of vintage mics, tube amps, keyboards, and tape machines, the resulting record has a rich, buttery warmth well-suited to Miss Tess's voice and authentic, retro-contemporary songwriting style.\nAfter over a decade on the road, now making her home in Nashville \u2014 by way of Baltimore, Boston, and Brooklyn \u2014 Miss Tess has found a creative community that encourages and embraces wide artistic exploration and expression as much as she does.\n\n\u201cMiss Tess swings and swaggers, rooted in a retro groove that\u2019s equal parts blues, mid-century rock & roll and Booker T-worthy R&B.\u201d \u2013 Rolling Stone\n\n\u201cOld-time warmth, 21st-century sass.

Kids play in the shadows of the row houses that line the sidewalks. Their parents sit on the stoops leading up to front doors. It all seems normal at first glance.\n\n\n\nBut zoom in on one of these homes \u2014 that old duplex built back when this part of town was still mainly open fields. Inside is a completely different community, where fundamentalism, hippie values and volatile, unpredictable emotions coexist and collide. Escape is difficult: the only way out is to pass through the bedrooms of people you might be trying to get away from.\n\n\n\nThis is where Eliot Bronson grew up. Yeah, he often wanted to slip away from there, but the first thing he saw once he exited was the Pentecostal Church across the street where his father and grandfather had preached and where congregants spoke in tongues.\n\n\n\nSo Eliot looked inward instead.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor better or worse, I\u2019ve always been a weirdo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI was reading about Zen Buddhism when all my friends were getting high and drunk in high school.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he adds, \u201cI did all that stuff later.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also observed. In this kaleidoscopic family, where glossolalia and, on occasion, alcohol-fueled ravings, sometimes bled into each other, Bronson found shelter in music. At age 15, he got his first guitar and started teaching himself to play. \u201cRight away, I wanted to write my own songs,\u201d he says. \u201cMy house was pretty chaotic so I took to music like it was a life raft. It was something I could do to keep myself alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nPunk rock was his shelter at first. Then one day his dad put on a few of his favorite LPs \u2014 Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, something by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. Eliot had heard these albums a thousand times before. This time, though\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 it resonated with me,\u201d Eliot says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just in the background. I tuned into it for the first time. There was a magic and a power there. It didn\u2019t talk down to the listener but it was also high art. It asked you to be smart and to become a better version of yourself. For me, this was a moment when it became my music, not just my parents\u2019 music.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom local coffee houses and venues beyond Baltimore, Bronson sharpened his writing and performance. He cultivated a working approach that involved singing to himself as ideas came to him and never jotting down chord changes or lyrics once he had committed the finished version to memory. A local following grew. Astute observers saw something different in the young artist\u2019s work. The Baltimore Sun even anointed him \u201ca folk singing wunderkind.\u201d\n\n\n\nExpanding his range, Bronson toured as one-half of a duo. They moved to Atlanta and picked up a gig in a room frequented by The Indigo Girls, John Mayer, Shawn Mullins and other discerning clientele. When his partner quit to take a sensible non-musical job, Bronson persisted on his own. His songs won first-place honors at MerleFest\u2019s Chris Austin Songwriting Contest and Eddie Owens Presents \u201cSongwriter Shootout.\u201d He issued several solo albums, including a self-titled release in 2014 that prompted Glide Magazine to describe him as \u201ca gorgeous, magnificent hybrid of (Ryan) Adams, Jason Isbell and Jim James.\u201d Bop n Jazz upped that ante by heralding him as \u201cmaybe the best singer/songwriter since Dylan.\u201d\n\n\n\nWriters may have trouble topping these accolades, though that\u2019s what Bronson\u2019s latest album merits. Scheduled to release Aug. 25 on Rock Ridge Music, James offers songs that are more like pictures than movies, capturing moments and digging deeply into their meanings. A stomping beat, raw harmonica and searing electric slide drives the opening track, \u201cBreakdown In G Major,\u201d followed by a selection of songs that only confirm Bronson\u2019s restless, escalating excellence.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood Enough,\u201d for example, captures a relationship in its final stage \u2014 a stage that may end tomorrow or stretch on for years. Bronson sings it sorrowfully, asking the rhetorical question of whether \u201c\u2018good enough\u2019 is good enough for you\u201d from this point. \u201cWhen I stumbled onto that line, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll probably stick,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think the song really came from the first line, \u2018Were we really that young?\u2019 Sometimes it takes just one line to resonate with me and get me to start writing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Mountain,\u201d whose elusive grandeur delivers a powerful message but leaves it to the listener to parse its meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s a very literalist current in writing and music right now,\u201d Bronson observes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of layers to lyrics these days. It\u2019s just what you see on the page. So when you don\u2019t write that way, you get, \u2018What are you hiding?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughs and then concludes, \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way. For me, it\u2019s more about how you feel when you hear it. What does it do for you? That\u2019s the message!\u201d\n\n\n\nOne more, \u201cRough Ride,\u201d is a departure for Bronson. Here, the meaning is clear: When 25-year-old Freddie Gray fell unaccountably into a coma in the back of a Baltimore police van, much of America expressed shock and outrage. So did Bronson, but he channeled those emotions into this song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had mixed feelings about writing this because I don\u2019t like inserting my political or social beliefs into art,\u201d he explains. \u201cArt should be about connecting people, not drawing lines between them. But I was listening to Dylan\u2019s Desire album at the time, especially \u2018Hurricane.\u2019 I always wanted to write a song like that. It was like, \u2018How can you tell a story almost journalistically with great emotional impact and yet not come off heavy-handed?\u2019 I wanted to see if I could do it. Now I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\n\n\nKnown for his empathetic work with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and other utterly original artists, producer Dave Cobb played a critical role in bringing James to fruition. \u201cHis honesty and old-fashioned vibe were so appealing to me,\u201d Bronson says. \u201cThey leant themselves to the way I created. And, of course, it was a huge boost to have this great artist/producer at your back.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey had worked together previously on his 2014 release, Eliot Bronson. \u201cBut this album is different,\u201d Bronson points out. \u201cIt\u2019s more sparse and economical. My voice is stronger. And I think it\u2019s a step away from the purely Americana vibe of the last one in a direction that I have a hard time defining. I\u2019m excited to discover how this music will define itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nWherever he\u2019s bound, Bronson promises to write and sing the truth as he sees and feels it. \u201cFor the really great artists, like Dylan or Paul Simon, you never quite find what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get closer, it changes. It stays elusive. What I want to do now isn\u2019t the same as what I wanted to do five years ago. And that\u2019s what keeps me going.\u201d And it\u2019s that shift that drives Bronson to continue to refine his art.", "otherInfo": "All request EB songs this week, on the \"I Love Your Guts\" show."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Erath Old ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10396371.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Pop Country, New Country, Country, Red Dirt Country, Heartland Rock, Singer - Songwriter", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Erath Old (pron.

My passion for music was passed down from generation to generation, but some of my earliest influences came from my dad and my love for artists like John Cougar Mellencamp, Black Hawk and Garth Brooks.\n\nAfter graduating high school, I moved to Atlanta where my brother Sean and I started the power-pop band, Loverush, which was influenced by some of our favorite artists at the time: the Goo Goo Dolls, Greenday and Cheap Trick. The band ended abruptly in 2009 when our grandparents died, then our father just a few months later. Sean moved 3000 miles away and joined the military and my music career faded. I worked a landscape job and married the love of my life. My marriage would later become a catalyst for change I never knew could emerge.\n\nIn 2012, my wife and I moved back home to Birmingham. I found myself in music again, learning how to make a living performing covers for the first time. Who knew playing other people\u2019s music would be a platform for finding my way again?\n\nHowever, the booze, the partying, the late nights, even the pride and selfishness that grew inside got the best of me and, therefore, my relationship. At the time of releasing, \u201cHey Y\u2019all\u201d in 2015, my first single and music video as a returning original artist, my wife left. I was on the road and we separated. I found myself alone in an empty apartment, falling deeper into my lifestyle and into a depression. After a four-day binge and an episode where I thought I might die, I finally asked for help. Tired of trying, tired of pushing, tired of losing it all to a dream; motivated by my own ego, I got down on my knees and gave it all to God.\n\nIt started with giving up my obsession with alcohol. On my road to recovery God has renewed my mind and my spirit and He has rejuvenated my sense of self-worth. A lot has changed after three years of sobriety. Since then I have started touring, surrounded myself with family and friends and finished an album that I\u2019m proud to share with the world.

Although most audiences are introduced to Jake Allen through the spectacle of his solo acoustic performances, the scope of Allen's artistry runs much much deeper.\n\nAt age five, Allen began exploring synthesizers and recording music in his father\u2019s Northern Michigan studio. By fourteen, he had become proficient with a variety of instruments and he solidified his commitment to a life of producing and performing music. Allen has since gone on to produce several acclaimed solo records, playing every instrument himself, while tastefully complementing his smooth to soaring voice. In addition to drums, guitars, etc., Jake often stresses his belief in using the studio itself as a key instrument to create his massive productions and concept albums. His deep and detailed records lend themselves to the fleeting practice of sitting down and really listening to a record from start to finish.\n\nBy his late teens, Jake found himself being drawn to the sounds of finger-style guitar trailblazers like Michael Hedges and Andy McKee. He started to pin point his focus on acoustic guitar, crafting his own breed of six string wizardry. On top of a two-hands on the neck, percussive tapping style, Jake employed an array of effects and live looping to create an engaging solo performance. Through the art of looping, he discovered a way to create a virtual clone-like backing band.

Bronson sings it sorrowfully, asking the rhetorical question of whether \u201c\u2018good enough\u2019 is good enough for you\u201d from this point. \u201cWhen I stumbled onto that line, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll probably stick,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think the song really came from the first line, \u2018Were we really that young?\u2019 Sometimes it takes just one line to resonate with me and get me to start writing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Mountain,\u201d whose elusive grandeur delivers a powerful message but leaves it to the listener to parse its meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s a very literalist current in writing and music right now,\u201d Bronson observes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of layers to lyrics these days. It\u2019s just what you see on the page. So when you don\u2019t write that way, you get, \u2018What are you hiding?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughs and then concludes, \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way. For me, it\u2019s more about how you feel when you hear it. What does it do for you? That\u2019s the message!\u201d\n\n\n\nOne more, \u201cRough Ride,\u201d is a departure for Bronson. Here, the meaning is clear: When 25-year-old Freddie Gray fell unaccountably into a coma in the back of a Baltimore police van, much of America expressed shock and outrage. So did Bronson, but he channeled those emotions into this song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had mixed feelings about writing this because I don\u2019t like inserting my political or social beliefs into art,\u201d he explains. \u201cArt should be about connecting people, not drawing lines between them. But I was listening to Dylan\u2019s Desire album at the time, especially \u2018Hurricane.\u2019 I always wanted to write a song like that. It was like, \u2018How can you tell a story almost journalistically with great emotional impact and yet not come off heavy-handed?\u2019 I wanted to see if I could do it. Now I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\n\n\nKnown for his empathetic work with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and other utterly original artists, producer Dave Cobb played a critical role in bringing James to fruition. \u201cHis honesty and old-fashioned vibe were so appealing to me,\u201d Bronson says. \u201cThey leant themselves to the way I created. And, of course, it was a huge boost to have this great artist/producer at your back.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey had worked together previously on his 2014 release, Eliot Bronson. \u201cBut this album is different,\u201d Bronson points out. \u201cIt\u2019s more sparse and economical. My voice is stronger. And I think it\u2019s a step away from the purely Americana vibe of the last one in a direction that I have a hard time defining. I\u2019m excited to discover how this music will define itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nWherever he\u2019s bound, Bronson promises to write and sing the truth as he sees and feels it. \u201cFor the really great artists, like Dylan or Paul Simon, you never quite find what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get closer, it changes. It stays elusive. What I want to do now isn\u2019t the same as what I wanted to do five years ago. And that\u2019s what keeps me going.\u201d And it\u2019s that shift that drives Bronson to continue to refine his art.", "otherInfo": "All request EB songs this week, on the \"I Love Your Guts\" show."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Andy Patalan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9130960.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Country, Rock, Metal, Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Andy Patalan is an American musician best known as the guitarist and backing vocalist for the alternative rock band Sponge.

Air-Rith) it\u2019s a family name.\n\nI grew up in a small blue-collar town on the outskirts of Birmingham, Alabama and have been playing music for as long as I can remember. My passion for music was passed down from generation to generation, but some of my earliest influences came from my dad and my love for artists like John Cougar Mellencamp, Black Hawk and Garth Brooks.\n\nAfter graduating high school, I moved to Atlanta where my brother Sean and I started the power-pop band, Loverush, which was influenced by some of our favorite artists at the time: the Goo Goo Dolls, Greenday and Cheap Trick. The band ended abruptly in 2009 when our grandparents died, then our father just a few months later. Sean moved 3000 miles away and joined the military and my music career faded. I worked a landscape job and married the love of my life. My marriage would later become a catalyst for change I never knew could emerge.\n\nIn 2012, my wife and I moved back home to Birmingham. I found myself in music again, learning how to make a living performing covers for the first time. Who knew playing other people\u2019s music would be a platform for finding my way again?\n\nHowever, the booze, the partying, the late nights, even the pride and selfishness that grew inside got the best of me and, therefore, my relationship. At the time of releasing, \u201cHey Y\u2019all\u201d in 2015, my first single and music video as a returning original artist, my wife left. I was on the road and we separated. I found myself alone in an empty apartment, falling deeper into my lifestyle and into a depression. After a four-day binge and an episode where I thought I might die, I finally asked for help. Tired of trying, tired of pushing, tired of losing it all to a dream; motivated by my own ego, I got down on my knees and gave it all to God.\n\nIt started with giving up my obsession with alcohol. On my road to recovery God has renewed my mind and my spirit and He has rejuvenated my sense of self-worth. A lot has changed after three years of sobriety. Since then I have started touring, surrounded myself with family and friends and finished an album that I\u2019m proud to share with the world. My hope and prayer is that my music would inspire and encourage everyone who hears to do whatever \u201cIt\u201d is; because Sooner or Later whatever \u201cIt\u201d is, is going to \u2013 so let it.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tom Wurth ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10395885.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "There are words that resonate with Tom Wurth. You will hear him talk about \u201cstaying constant,\u201d being \u201creal\u201d and \u201cnatural.\u201d They resonate in the songs he writes, those he chooses to record and in every aspect of his career.\nIt isn\u2019t that Tom Wurth does not embrace change and growth. He has experienced a lot of that musically as he met milestone after milestone in his career. At the same time though, he believes that music can be a \u201cconstant\u201d for most people and they crave consistency from an artist.\nWhether you sit down to talk about his career, where he has been, where he is going; or listen to the lyrics of each song, you will know his commitment to that real and natural music. It is music you can count on with every song and at every show.\nThe new album A Different Soul shows that commitment. There are deep roots that brace this album. Roots from his small town up-bringing to his musical roots that are evident with the collaborations found on this new project which includes Vince Gill, T. Graham Brown and John Ford Coley.\nOut of the gate, at only twenty years of age, Tom Wurth was nominated for a Grammy. That particular milestone built a foundation for his career. The Grammy experience fresh in his mind, Wurth pushed forward with his songwriting aspirations.\nWurth initially signed as a staff writer with Belden; later signing with one of the largest publishers in the world, BMG Music Publishing. At BMG he garnered two major record label cuts including; \u201cIf the Road Runs Out,\u201d appearing on This is Ty Herndon \u2013 Greatest Hits and a Ken Mellons cut, \u201cI Can\u2019t Kick My Country\u201d for a NASCAR compilation, Inside Traxx.\nTom Wurth found the best school was on the road playing and in the studio recording. He took to both and never looked back. He has shared a stage with some of the most respected and successful artists in music including\nVince Gill, John Ford Coley, T. Graham Brown, Eddie Money, Larry Gatlin and The Gatlin Brothers, Lonestar, Billy Dean, Ronnie Milsap, Rascal Flatts, Billy Currington, LoCash, Pam Tillis, Mel Tillis, Thompson Square, Marty Stuart, Tim Rushlow, Trick Pony, Clay Walker, Tony Coleman & many others.\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Tom Wurth for several years. I\u2019ve always appreciated his friendship and what I\u2019ve always admired was his professionalism. As we say in Alabama \u2013 he\u2019s a hard charger. (He\u2019s a) great entertainer, and one of the true inspirations in this business!\u201d \u2013 Marty Raybon\nIn 2006 Wurth signed his first record deal, recorded and released his first album on Aspirion Records. The first release from Tom Wurth, \u201cBread On The Table,\u201d reached the top thirty on the charts as well as earned a spot on CMT.com for the single\u2019s video. Wurth\u2019s next two single releases (\u201cGood Ground,\u201d from the album Tom Wurth and \u201cIf The Road Runs Out,\u201d from If The Road Runs Out) also enjoyed top thirty chart status.\n\"Tom Wurth is a three-way hitter. He's a tremendously gifted vocalist and artist and a Grammy nominated artist. Tom has a genuine love for the song, strong and memorable melody-tunes that people can sing along with. Tom is truly a gifted singer with a style all his own. I think you'll love what you hear.\u201d - John Ford Coley\nThis quote may well explain the feelings both peers and fans have about Tom Wurth and his music. What you hear on Tom Wurth\u2019s records are exactly what you will hear on stage. No smoke, no mirrors just great music.\n\u201cSome time ago Vince Gill finished performing and sat next to me backstage ... I have the same remark about Tom as I said to Vince, \"You did more with just you and a guitar than the act that preceded you with a full band. This is a wonderful talent that should be a much bigger name because he understands what it means to get up on a stage and perform. A wonderful talent.\u201d \u2013 Sandy Smolen\nTom Wurth crossed paths with famed rocker Eddie Money leading to a friendship and several collaborations. Money asked him to produce a special project, The Other Side of Money. Wurth took on the project bringing in John Ford Coley to co-produce the project with him. The album included a remake of Money\u2019s song, \u201cGimme Some Water\u201d and featured Vince Gill. For Tom Wurth\u2019s new project, A Different Soul, Wurth and Money once again collaborated, along with Scott Soderberg, with their co-write of \u201cBack On The Highway Again.\u201d\n\u201cEvery once in a while, someone comes along that has the quality, that believability tone in their voice with a simple but honest emotion, like he\u2019s talking late at night to his sweetheart in a quiet driveway. It\u2019s a gift. Tom Wurth has that gift. \u2013 Eddie Money\nIn 2012, Wurth signed with TaDa Records recording the studio album, Midnight Rain. The album brings together Tom Wurth\u2019s soulful blend of country with his trademark additions of R&B and gospel. Midnight Rain was featured on iTunes New and Noteworthy right off the presses. Singles from the album included, \u201cTo Love Somebody,\u201d and \u201cDiggin in The Dirt.\u201d\nFor Tom Wurth, music isn\u2019t just a vocation, it defines him as a person. If he isn\u2019t crafting a new song, out on the road singing or in the studio recording his own music he often takes to the studio as a producer. His latest project is with John Ford Coley. Coley\u2019s latest album, Eclectic, is a 26 song collection co-produced by Wurth and features Vince Gill, Collin Raye, Jamie O\u2019Neal, Georgia Middleman and T. Graham Brown.\nYet, there is nothing Tom Wurth would rather be doing than singing. This past year and a half he has devoted everything to the making of A Different Soul. There is no \u201cfast forward\u201d to this latest project on TaDa Records.\nIt is part of his artistic progression and builds on his musical roots. A Different Soul has quickly become labeled \u201ca different style, a different sound.\u201d It is not \u201cdifferent\u201d for Tom Wurth, but gives that same \u201cconstant\u201d fans have come to expect from his music. But, it is music different from anything you have heard before.\nThe project includes a song he will say \u201cdefines him.\u201d \u201cWhere I Belong\u201d was written by Wurth with Vince Gill and features Gill on vocals and guitar. For Wurth it is another milestone in his career. Right next to that is another Wurth co-write, \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Build It,\u201d that has his soulful vocals paired with those of another soulful singer, T. Graham Brown. John Ford Coley also appears offering his talents with background vocals on two songs on the project, \u201cOnce A Lover (Always A Friend)\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Make Love.\u201d\nA Different Soul is produced by T. W. Cargile (who also co-produced Wurth\u2019s Midnight Rain) and Tony Coleman (former B.B. King drummer for thirty years).\n\u201cIn my lifetime as a musician, I have had the opportunity and honor to work with the world\u2019s greatest soulful singers \u2013 Otis Clay, Bobby Blue Bland, Johnnie Taylor, Etta James, B.B. King and others. Tom Wurth is one of those soulful singers that I can add to that list. The first time I heard him sing I knew immediately I had to work with him. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of co-producing him on his latest recording, A Different Soul. I consider his voice and singing to be as soulful as those great artists I\u2019ve worked with and grew up listing to whether jazz, blues, country or R&B. I know people from all over are going to like, A Different Soul just like I do.\u201d - Tony Coleman", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "8 Ball Aitken ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8734612.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Swamp Blues", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "For more than a decade, multi-awarded global troubadour, 8 Ball Aitken, has flown the Australian flag on the international circuit performing more than two hundred shows a year, and is thrilled to be back in the place where his heart is.\nImpossibly dedicated to his six-string muse and absolutely devoted to his audiences, 8 Ball Aitken\u2019s funky, foot stomping energy and infectious blend of swampy blues-rock, have brought the party vibe to venues, festivals and high profile music events in the USA, France, Japan, Canada and Europe.\nHe has garnered numerous accolades, awards, rave reviews and recognition across genres with the single, (She\u2019s Going To Mexico) I\u2019m Going To Jail, reaching #1 on the Country and #2 on the Blues charts.\nThe international patron for the Airlie Beach Festival of Music is a prolific singer/songwriter and ace multi-instrumentalist, and brings his 9th self-titled album on the road for the Blazing Blues Summer Tour.\nAll video clips including his USA release, Sleepy, the achingly beautiful Girl In A Million, Seven Bucks An Hour in A Chicken Suit, Yellow Moon and Shut The Front Door may be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/user/8ballaitken.\n\n\u201cOutstanding.

Combine that with Delta blues, compliments of a childhood spent in Cajun country, and you\u2019ve got one badass up-and-comer, with the pure musical talent and vocal chops to back him up. Already turning heads throughout Nashville, Baton Rouge and beyond, having been named one of the \u201cTop New Artists You Need To Know\u201d by Rolling Stone Country, CJ says the driving force behind his current success isn\u2019t fame nor fortune \u2013 it\u2019s just a diehard infatuation with the music he grew up on.\n\n\u201cI just want to write songs that say something that really means something. I want to ride around in a van, tour the country, and play songs with my buds. Everything I do in music, I want to do it for the love of the music and the sake of the song,\u201d he adds.\n\nIt all started back in Baton Rouge where his family\u2019s affinity for music struck a chord. \u201cMy grandparents loved country music. My dad was a big classic rock fan,\u201d he said. \u201cDad kept a guitar in a closet, and I dug it out when I was seven and started making noise of my own with it,\u201d Solar recalls. That so-called \u201cnoise\u201d would sharpen quickly, through lessons at the young age of eight, to enrollment at Nashville\u2019s Belmont University, to cuts on albums by Justin Moore and Jerrod Niemann, and, now, his own critically acclaimed solo EP that\u2019s turning heads, Hard One to Turn Down.\n\nAnd a Hard One To Turn Down, the EP is. Critics at The Daily Country write, \u201cSolar injects a hefty (and welcome) dose of Southern rock into his country, which melds perfectly with his gravelly vocals.\u201d Country Music Rocks was \u201cimmediately captivated by all five songs and hopes that [the EP] obtains the recognition it deserves.\u201d The Rowdy found it \u201cexactly what country fans are looking to savor.\u201d And The Shotgun Seat welcomes Hard One to Turn Down as \u201cthe perfect pairing of country storytelling and rocking rhythms, married by his dynamic vocals.\u201d And that\u2019s only the beginning.\n\nFlashback to Louisiana where CJ put a group together while in elementary school, recruiting his two brothers. They called themselves The Solar Heat, recollected by CJ as \u201cthe cheesiest band name of all time.\u201d But the band built up a solid local fan base, and helped CJ hone his writing and performance skills. However, CJ knew he needed to be in Nashville where he attended Belmont and landed an exclusive publishing agreement before he had even graduated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded some of my best songs in December of my senior year,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started interning at Sea Gayle Music in February, I played these and two other songs I hadn\u2019t recorded for Mike Owens (VP Creative at Sea Gayle). A week later I had a publishing deal. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not the way it happens with most interns. I\u2019m grateful for these opportunities, and I don\u2019t plan on taking them for granted.\u201d\n\nThe ink was still wet on Solar\u2019s degree when artists all over town started putting the new Nashville songwriter\u2019s self-penned songs on hold. \u201cBlue Bandana,\u201d which he\u2019d written in January, was chosen by Jerrod Niemann and released as a single. Then, Solar began writing with Bob DiPiero and other members of Nashville\u2019s songwriting elite.\n\nSolar tracked and produced Hard One To Turn Down, alongside Sea Gayle\u2019s Brent Anderson, (who\u2019s producing and songwriting credits include Chris Janson, Blake Shelton and others), with established country hit-maker Jerrod Niemann joining in on one song as guest vocalist. Its lead single, a paean to the powers of sipping on a \u201cTall Boy,\u201d dropped in mid-March and quickly garnered over 164,000 Spotify spins in its first month of release. The EP followed on April 15, in both digital and physical formats. In May, the music video for \u201cTall Boy,\u201d directed by Marcel Chagnon, premiered on CMT. Tour dates from coast to coast include his own headlining dates and opening slots for The Cadillac Three, Old Dominion, Hank Williams, Jr., and the list goes on.\n\nIf it\u2019s not obvious yet, Solar is on the fast track to success, with a solid team in Nashville to back him up. And he\u2019s not going to leave any stones left unturned. As important as songwriting is and will always be to Solar, he is excited to be stepping into the spotlight as an artist. CJ is a powerful vocalist with his Southern, gravelly edge and he has the guitar chops to match. His live show puts it all together and will knock you off your feet.\n\nYet the pensive, bolero-brimmed, too-wise-for-his-age 23-year-old is riding his momentum thoughtfully, with the long haul in mind. \u201cI\u2019d love to tour the country and have a handful of hit songs,\u201d he muses. \u201cBut I\u2019m totally cool with living pretty normally as long as I need to.

This is due to his well-known ability to work with any genre of music, or combination of multiple genres at one time, to produce dynamic and high energy music sets. In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture. As the resident DJ since 2004 of some of Vegas\u2019 hottest clubs and lounges including Rum Jungle, Jet Nightclub & Koi Nightclub inside of the Planet Hollywood. Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip. Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cWEST COAST WEDNESDAYS\u201d EVERY WEDNESDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

The multi-million selling country icon is set to embark on a tour commemorating the 30th anniversary of his groundbreaking debut album Killin\u2019 Time, which all but altered the landscape of country music. Three decades later, Clint remains humble as ever about the massive influence he has had on the genre.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really feel like I was leading a change in country music,\u201d Clint remarks. \u201cIt just felt like big success to me. I would hear things like, \u2018So-and-so is going to record, and they\u2019re using their own band because you did.\u2019 Or, \u2018So-and-so wants to write more of their own songs, because you did.\u2019 But I don\u2019t feel like I changed anything, other than contributing my work to the big picture. It\u2019s hard to look at myself and see the impact I\u2019ve had. I do know that my songs have touched a lot of people.\u201d\n\nIf Black won\u2019t say it outright, his staggering career speaks for itself. His is one of the most storied careers in modern music. Black surged to superstardom as part of the fabled Class of '89, reaching #1 with five consecutive singles from his triple-platinum debut, Killin' Time. He followed that with the triple-platinum Put Yourself in My Shoes, and then a string of platinum and gold albums throughout the '90s. Perhaps most impressively, Clint wrote or co-wrote every one of his more than three dozen chart hits, including \"A Better Man,\" \"Where Are You Now,\" \"When My Ship Comes In,\" \"A Good Run of Bad Luck,\" \"Summer's Comin',\" \"Like the Rain\" and \"Nothin' But the Taillights,\" part of a catalog that produced 22 #1 singles and made him one of the most successful singer/songwriters of the modern era. Along the way, he\u2019s earned more than a dozen gold and platinum awards in the U.S. and Canada, landed nearly two dozen major awards and nominations, won a GRAMMY Award, countless Country Music Association, American Music Awards and Academy of Country Music Awards, as well as a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nRaised in the suburbs of Houston, Texas, Clint Black is the youngest of four brothers. He began performing with brother, Kevin at the family\u2019s backyard barbecues. After high school, he spent 10 years on the local nightclub circuit and in 1989, he led a movement of young talent that transformed country music leading into the \u201890s.\n\nIn 2004, he scaled the top of the charts by trading lines with Buffett, Alan Jackson, George Strait, Toby Keith and Kenny Chesney on the Hank Williams classic \u201cHey Good Looking.\u2019\u201d He contributed \u201cThe Great Mississippi Flood\" to the 2005 post-Katrina charity album Hurricane Relief: Come Together Now. He released albums in 2004, 2005 and 2007.\n\nHis interest in releasing new music waned when his record label closed its doors in 2008. He explains, \u201cI had interest from major companies to sign deals, but declined\u201d.\nClint Black has hardly been idle since then. He\u2019s written and produced songs for Hasbro\u2019s children\u2019s shows and in 2010 and 2012 starred in the films Flicka 2 and Flicka: Country Pride, the latter with his wife and daughter.\n\nIn 2013, the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain began marketing an album of Black\u2019s hits, which continues to sell strongly and in early 2015, he collaborated with Joe Nichols on a Superstar Duets NBC-TV special for the Academy of Country Music.\nIn 2015 released On Purpose, his first studio album of new material in nearly a decade. He dedicated the album to his father, who passed away in 2012.\n\n\u201cMy dad was a huge country fan and is the first reason I listen to country music. He is probably the reason I\u2019m a songwriter today. He was my introduction to \"who\u2019s behind the music\". I grew up wanting to be the writer behind the song. That really all started with him.\u201d\n2018 was a particularly busy year for the Class of \u201889 alum. Always finding ways to challenge himself creatively, Clint produced his first ever holiday musical, titled Looking For Christmas, which focuses on family, love, and the magic of Christmas. It\u2019s expected to tour in 2019.\n\n\u201cThis has been in the works for a while now and it was great to see the audience reaction. Working with James Sasser has been both a blessing and a learning experience and I believe that the story is relatable to many Americans, both young and old.\u201d\nNow, with the 30th anniversary of Killin\u2019 Time approaching, Clint has earned the right to sit back, and let his body of work speak for itself.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sydney Wright ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8940542.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Sydney Wright", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Sydney Wright has been writing songs for over a decade.

His love for Terence Trent D'Arby, Sisqo, and Donnell Jones allowed him to put his creative love for art, culture, and history into a musical beat all his own. And the new millennium belonged to him and garage had been redefined.\n\nBorn Craig Ashley David on May 5, 1981, David was slicing and dicing ragga and R&B on the local station PCRS 106.5FM and found himself playing club gigs prior to rubbing elbows with some of music's finest. It was during this time he hooked with Artful Dodger's Mark Hill. After winning a national writing competition, Craig was more than ready to start producing with Hill. His big break came when he put his own additives on Damage's \"I'm Ready,\" a B-side to \"Wonderful Tonight.\" Soon thereafter he remixed his own version of Human League's \"Human\" and started himself a regular spot in area clubs during the weekends. \"Rewind\" was another underground smash, specifically a definitive move for David. His respect for Stevie Wonder, Faith Evans, and R. Kelly was most apparent, however his own vocal talent was beginning to shine. He and Hill's specialty show on Capital Radio provided another outlet for David to shape his musical work of genius. \"Fill Me In\" proved yet another hit, shooting straight to number one in summer 2000. David was now the youngest British male solo artist to have a number one single. He was 19-years-old.\n\nA deal with Wildstar Records in the U.K. sparked toward the end of the summer as \"Re-Rewind\" and \"7 Days\" gained praise in late November. A stateside agreement with Atlantic also led to more global hype. He had sold 3.5 million records worldwide and garage was finally becoming massive overseas and it was David's debut Born to Do It that was at the head.\n\nBut not all were pulling for this R&B prodigy. Aside from winning three awards at the MOBO's in October, Craig David walked away empty handed at the 2000 Brit Awards in February 2001. He was up for six nominations, including Best British Male Solo Artist, Best British Newcomer, and Best British Single for \"7 Days,\" but industry politics fell into operation. Many mainstream stars came to David's defense, artists such as Elton John, U2, and Robbie Williams, professing their disgust for the ill recognition for David and his musical efforts in the past year. Death threats soon followed for the superstar in spring 2001 as he took the stage in a show in London. An anonymous caller claimed a soldier would injure David with tear gas and hand grenades. Still, his record sales continued to soar in the U.K. with sales of Born to Do It increasing over 100 percent after his dismal beginning months of 2001. He bombared American Shores with a deal with Atlantic and released Born to Do It stateside in summer 2001. Mainstream radio flocked to him immediately. Missy Elliott, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, and Usher called themselves fans.\n\nThe next year, things didn't simmer down for the now international pop star. Craig David returned with a sophomore effort Slicker Than Your Average in November 2002. This particular album saw a much grittier side from David. Debut single \"What's Your Flava?\" also became one of the year's hottest singles.\n\nIn 2005 he released his 3rd album \"The Story Goes...\", the first single of the album, \"All The Way\", returned him to the top three, and the second single, \"Don't Love You No More (I'm Sorry)\", tied with \"7 Days\" as his longest running single in the charts since \"Rewind\", spending 15 weeks inside the UK top 75. However, the album's third single, \"Unbelievable\", debuted and peaked at #18 in March 2006.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated with UK rapper Kano on his upcoming album London Town, for the single \"This is the Girl\". The track was released on August 27, 2007 and debuted at #18 on the UK charts.\n\nThe first single \"Hot Stuff\" from the album Trust Me, was released on November 5, 2007 . The single was a top ten hit, whilst the album charted at #18 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\"6 of 1 Thing\", the second single to be taken from Trust Me charted at thirty-nine on the UK Singles Chart, becoming his second lowest charting single to date.\n\nHis UK tour will start in June 2008, details of which can be found on the official website.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Krystle Dos Santos ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8164394.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Soul-blues, R&b, Soul, Soul Jazz, Pop", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cYou can hear her voice across all oceans and terrain\u2026.[Krystle] takes the new, mixes it with the old, and creates something undefined. We hope Canada will share her with us.\u201d (Hot Indie Music Review) Krystle Dos Santos has taken her experience from the Canadian College of Performing Arts, and transformed it into the beginnings of a career already full of achievements. Unveiling her talents to the public with her 2008 full length self-titled debut, Dos Santos was instantly recognized as a force by the Western Canadian Music Awards, winning the Urban Recording of the Year. That same album charted for six weeks on CJSR FM88\u2019s Urban chart and was top ten on 92.5 The X in Kamloops, BC. One of the single\u2019s from the album even appeared in an Episode of ABC\u2019s Samantha Who? But to simply classify Dos Santos as a recording artist would be neglecting one of the most intriguing aspects of her talents. Whether facing the crowd on her own or with her full ensemble of band-mates as she is more accustomed, Dos Santos uses a sultry tone and eccentric array of melodies to create an intimately magnetic connection with her audience. She is able to further engage her audience by shifting seamlessly through genres, embodying her musical influences-Nina Simone, Etta James, Alicia Keys-culminating into a powerful live experience that fuses jazz, soul, pop, funk and blues into an arena of styles and sounds that takes listeners from mid-20th century Harlem, right up to present day L.A. With key performances at the Edmonton International Jazz Festival, Whistler International Film Festival, and the Honey Jam Showcase in Toronto, Krystle has had many opportunities to put her live shows on full display. She has already toured extensively throughout western Canada, singing stories of pain and love, joy and redemption, all told through a voice that precisely reflects the emotion of her music. It is nearly impossible to be a true fan of Krystle Dos Santos without taking part in the experience she creates with her live performances. Dos Santos completed her second album in the first quarter of 2011. Femme Fatale, as it was aptly titled, again revealed Dos Santos versatility and her ability to capture the audience with an eclectic mix of dance and funk, but always with the soulful jazz vocals for which she has quickly become renowned. Dos Santos\u2019 interpretation of her influences has made it difficult to categorize her style. Compared presently to Jill Scott or Corrine-Bailey Rae or even Erykah Badu, Krystle is able to personalize her sound and message, adding her own character to her music to create a uniquely refreshing sound. Her vibrant personality has been utilized outside of music in various add campaigns and modeling opportunities. It also helps that Krystle is as stunning as she is talented; one of those rare beauties that command attention with little more than a moments glance. But make no mistake, Krystle Dos Santos is a musician first and foremost. With a smoky voice that can fluctuate to fit any style and a live show that demands the audience stand-up and take notice, Dos Santos is ready for the masses to feel her music. She is currently working on her third studio release, and will no doubt continue to strive until her name and her music is known to the world.

After 20 stellar years with Feeder -including 8 gold and platinum albums and over 3 million album sales- for Grant Nicholas that moment came after his band\u2019s sell out show at Brixton Academy on 23rd November 2012. \u201cWhen you have a formula which you know works it can be difficult to stop,\u201d he explains with typical candour. \u201cFeeder is a great band to be in, but it requires a certain head space. I wanted to clear my head for a bit and write some songs, and this album just came along. It felt so natural because there were no expectations.\u201d As with so many of his peers (Noel Gallagher, Damon Albarn) this lifting of the commercial burden sparked an outpouring of fresh music and ideas. Recorded over fourteen months in various studios on both sides of the Atlantic, Yorktown Heights is that rarest of beasts- an album which evokes the carefree spirit of Laurel Canyon in the \u201870\u2019s while also sounding bang up date. Ambitious, largely acoustic, and full of head-spinning melodies, it\u2019s also Grant\u2019s most personal work to date. \u201cI definitely had a 70\u2019s vibe in my head for this record,\u201d he says, citing Nick Drake, Neil Young and James Taylor as inspirations. \u201cI love the fact they weren\u2019t always the best singers, but their songs sounded so believable.\u201d Grant\u2019s ability to match these songwriting legends is clear from opening track \u2018Soul Mates\u2019. A beautiful acoustic lament -which comes with a video shot in Queens Wood, close to Grant\u2019s North London home- it\u2019s a heartfelt hymn of mutual need. \u201cEven though it\u2019s just an acoustic guitar and a vocal, it\u2019s immediately got a reaction from people. It\u2019s easy to criticise simple songs, but if you strike a chord with someone, that\u2019s gold.\u201d A strident \u2018Hitori\u2019 reflects on life, loneliness and relationships. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of my own feelings and what my friends are going through- losing parents, divorces,\u201c says Grant of lyrics like: \u2018Sorrow will find me everywhere I go.\u2019 \u201cI know it sounds awful, but as a songwriter I feed off of that.\u201d If the reflective \u2018Father To Son\u2019 is self-explanatory and the propulsive \u2018Robots\u2019 tackles technology\u2019s insidious grip on our lives, gothic murder ballad \u2018Joan Of Arc\u2019 is a reminder that Grant is also in demand as a songwriter for both rock and pop acts (who shall remain nameless). \u201cThat song is a mixture of influences- everything from Johnny Cash, to spaghetti Westerns to Paris itself. I think it would work perfectly on a film soundtrack. And I\u2019m sure Nick Cave could do a decent version!\u201d \u2018Vampires\u2019 is equally expansive, and acts as a noir-ish nod to his songwriting past. \u201cIt\u2019s about a girl who feels she\u2019s surrounded by the wrong people in the big city. She feels lost and awkward in society. It\u2019s almost a love song.\u2019 Fans of the euphoric, punch-the-air choruses which are Grant\u2019s trademark, meanwhile, will be in raptures on hearing \u2018Hope\u2019 and \u2018Time Stood Still\u2019. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of being anthemic,\u201d he says, citing Tom Petty as inspiration for these stadium-sized interludes. \u201cThere\u2019s a directness to his writing which I love. \u2018Hope\u2019 is about my memories of growing up near Chepstow, on the Welsh borders. When things go wrong in life, with friends or family, you can always go home, and I think everyone can relate to that.\u201d If Yorktown Heights\u2019 lyrics offer up both personal insights and classy ruminations on modern life, its sonic character comes from where the tracks were laid down. While sessions at his own home studio (The Treehouse), Angelic Studios in Banbury and The Crypt (London) were vital staging posts, the album takes its name from the district of upstate New York where the songs came into focus. \u201cThe bulk of it was done at Tiny Pocket in Yorktown Heights with Brian Sperber (Julian Casablancas, Dinosaur Jr) and Sam Miller,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s only about an hour directly north of Manhattan but you feel like you\u2019re in the middle of nowhere.\u201d It was this sense of isolation -surrounded by nothing but woodland and the roar of passing pick-up trucks- which resulted in the sparse but beautiful textures of \u2018Tall Trees\u2019. \u201cWhen I first arrived at the studio it was deep snow,\u201d recalls Grant. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t get out of the house. I was getting cabin fever after a while. \u2018Tall Trees\u2019 came from that. It\u2019s not a redneck area but it\u2019s got that feel, which I think is reflected in the music. In fact, that\u2019s what I call it- redneck indie!\u201d The final piece in the jigsaw came with a mastering session in Los Angeles with Brian \u2018Big Bass\u2019 Gardner, famed for his work with everyone from Alice Cooper to Dr Dre. \u201cI think he\u2019s got a magic button under the desk which suddenly brings a new depth to everything,\u201d says Grant with a grin. \u201cHe gave the record a real \u201970\u2018s warmth, which is so important.\u201d It\u2019s this attention to the smallest sonic details you\u2019d expect from a master craftsman who worked as a studio engineer before Feeder took off. Future plans include intimate live shows, uploading full length visuals for every song online and a new touring band..Right now, though, it\u2019s all about getting the songs a fair hearing. \u201cThis record is very important to me,\u201d he says, explaining that the album is also a family affair- the sleeve illustrations were hand drawn by his nine year old daughter. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time on it and I want people to hear it. And if it takes off, then of course that\u2019s a nice problem to have.\u201d Don\u2019t bet against it.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

The band\u2019s seventh album, Wildness, their first in seven years, entered the UK charts at Number Two, went gold, and kept them on tour around the world for the best part of 18 months.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gigging time, but also a lot of thinking time.\n\n\u201cWhere did it all go right?\u201d echoes Lighbtody. \u201cNo idea!\u201d the singer and songwriter laughs. \u201cAfter 10 years of no success, no one \u2013 least of all us \u2013 expected us these last 15 years to sell 17 million albums, headline festivals and play to thousands of people all over the world.\u201d\nAdd to that: one billion global track streams, five UK platinum albums, an Ivor Novello award and Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominations. And, in the shape of Chasing Cars, a modern classic recently anointed by the PPL as the most played song on UK radio of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWhen we released Final Straw in 2003, I think there was general goodwill around us from the media,\u201d continues Lightbody, \u201cas people knew the story of the previous 10 years and were kinda glad for us to get a shot on a major label,\" he notes of their move from indie Jeepster (also original home of Belle and Sebastian) to discerning Polydor imprint Fiction. That \u201csea-change\u201d set in motion the next phase of the band\u2019s existence. Still, in music, as in life, nothing is a given. \u201cOf course the good grace of the press is hard won and easy lost, but radio kept on playing us. That\u2019s been the real key to our success, I firmly believe. Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. On those shows we did some of the songs close to how they sound on the Reworked album \u2013 for example, the new version of You\u2019re All I Have came directly out of playing those acoustic shows.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re All I Have is the opening track from 2006\u2019s Eyes Open, the album that also featured Chasing Cars. On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain. Iain came up with the beautiful, John Martyn-style guitar, and his version floored me when I heard it the first time. Iain\u2019s guitar playing has always been a joy to listen to and to have it feature so prominently on this album is just amazing.\"\n\nAlso presented in simple acoustic simplicity is Chocolate, the third single from Final Straw, and produced here in classy, \u201ctime-stopping\u201d style by McDaid. \u201cChocolate has been a live favourite since we released it. It\u2019s a song all Snow Patrol fans know \u2013 I can\u2019t attest that they all love it but they know it!\u201d its co-author laughs. \u201cAnd we wanted to rework the songs that the fans are the most familiar with. There's not much point in reworking songs people don\u2019t really know as there's not really a stark contrast.\u201d\nThat said, \u201cwe will be doing something with the first two albums before the release of Reworked as those two albums do not feature for that same reason,\u201d Lightbody teases.\nWhat of the recent Twitter \u201caccusation\u201d that SP have \u201cdisowned\u201d those albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It\u2019s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2001), because they don\u2019t play the songs live?\n\u201cNot true at all,\u201d he replies with a shake of the head. \u201cWe are very proud of them. It\u2019s just that when we play those songs live they negatively affect the atmosphere of the gig. And as Star Trek taught us: \u2018The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat need to entertain and surprise also informed the approach taken to Called Out In The Dark. The curtain-raiser from 2011's Fallen Empires now comes with an inventive synth throb that echoes the original.\n\u201cI had worried a little that the whole record was getting very downtempo,\u201d admits Lightbody. \u201cThe nature of recording in hotel rooms and dressing rooms is that things will invariably be low-key. Hard to rock out with a family of four in the next hotel room trying to sleep!\n\u201cSo when it came to some of the songs we recorded towards the end of the new album, we wanted to explore a slightly higher tempo \u2013 without, of course, leaning too heavy into the original version. Called Out\u2026 is certainly the closest to the original version of any song on Reworked, but I think distinct enough to warrant its place. It has an electro bent like the original but steers clear of any of its predecessor\u2019s tropes. I asked Iain to lift it up and he sure did.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the three new songs. First up, the lovely, heart-stopping Time Won\u2019t Go Slowly.\n\u201cJohnny and I wrote this in his house in LA. We\u2019re both massive fans of Frank Ocean, so we wanted it to sound like Frank Ocean crossed with Frank Sinatra. All the Franks! It\u2019s a classic crooner track. We just wanted to try something starkly different from anything we have done before.\n\"As for the lyrics, I guess I\u2019ve not written about love for a while and needed a fix,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI like the idea of the inherent tragedy woven into the fabric of time: time speeds up when we're having a great time and slows down when we're miserable. Although it\u2019s all perception, of course, not reality. And I like that, too. That distortion. Our minds are powerful and sometimes terrible things. I guess the song tries to wrap its head around that great cosmic joke. Also it\u2019s just a love song.\"\nThen there\u2019s I Think of Home, a folk-flavoured piano ballad with vivid, evocative and deeply personal lyrics. Lightbody wrote it in 2014, as part of a five-song contribution \u201cto a night dedicated to my greatest literary hero Seamus Heaney when he opened the Seamus Heaney Home Place in Magherafelt. They wanted me to play a few songs at the opening night.\n\u201cI set my own rules for the songs\u2019 content,\" he expands. \"They had to be inspired by what Heaney had been inspired by: home, family, Ireland, The Troubles, hope, the soil\u2026\u201d\nI Think of Home was later considered for inclusion on Wildness, but none of the versions the band tried out in the studio fitted.\n\u201cBut then we went on tour with Wildness and at shows in Ireland and Irish strongholds like Boston, New York, Sydney and Melbourne, I would play I Think Of Home acoustically on my own in the middle of gigs. It would always go down well.\n\u201cSo when it came to Reworked we had lived with the song enough to feel like we could do a great version of it. And Johnny produced a stunning version of it. I had been playing it a certain way for so long it was hard for me to hear it any other way. That can be dangerous \u2013 stagnation can set in. So when that happens you have to let someone you trust take it from you and remake it. So, in the spirit of what we were doing, it was great to get a reworked version of a song that had never even been released.\"\nThe third new song is Made Of Something Different Now, which is quietly sweeping, quietly epic and wholly devastating.\n\u201cOne of my favourite tracks we have done in ages,\" nods Lightbody. \"In keeping with the Reworked attitude of trying new things, it\u2019s unlike much of what we\u2019ve done before. Lyrically, it\u2019s the story of a dear friend\u2019s heartbreak. My own heart, having not been in a relationship in ten years, is unrisked so unbroken. A damning self-portrait if ever there was one! Writing this song \u2013 with Johnny \u2013 made me realise my own lack of bravery in that department. Hasn\u2019t effected any change yet, mind you, but it did start me thinking at least\u2026 Anyway, as us Celts say, it\u2019s a belter,\u201d he grins.\n\nThe final word should go to Take Back The City. Gary Lightbody\u2019s hymn to Belfast is the song that opens Reworked and is sure to be an emotive live highlight when Snow Patrol take Reworked on the road later this year. As he reflects on 25 years of Snow Patrol, how have his feelings about the city changed in the 11 years since the song was released?\n\u201cWell, as the song says, I love Belfast tonight and always. There are still things that drive me crazy about the place. But I think that's the same for everyone\u2019s home city \u2013 although my home town, of course, is Bangor.\n\u201cMy love has deepened though not waned. I see the conflict that still goes on in people\u2019s hearts, my own included, and yet there is this drive in most people \u2013 most people \u2013 to put the past behind us and move on. To lift each other up.\n\u201cWe need that now more than ever with the looming clusterfuck that is Brexit and the devastation it has the potential to bring to the whole of UK, but to Northern Ireland more than anywhere else. We need that will to put the past behind us and lift each other.\u201d\n\nHear, hear. Equally, with these 16 inspiring, enveloping tracks, this is also moment to embrace the past \u2013 and, like the man said, to use it to lift each other. This is Reworked. This is Snow Patrol\u2019s history, and their legacy. And it\u2019s their inspired next step.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gary Lucas ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8516552.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Various", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Guitarist extraordinaire, Grammy-nominated songwriter and composer with over 30 acclaimed genre-defying albums", "otherInfo": "Gary is streaming live solo acoustic concerts on Facebook every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday @ 3pm!!\n\nIn this time of no gigs if you like what you hear, please share your appreciation!

As promoter of the decade-old Hazy Recollections concert series and founder of the Glasgow Songwriting Festival, he\u2019s been particularly influential in fostering cross-fertilisation between the city\u2019s folk and indie communities. Spring 2017 saw him touring with acclaimed contemporary protest-song showcase Shake the Chains, whose September album release is followed by more dates early next year.\n\nWhile the sorrow and anger simmering through Glasgow track \u2018There\u2019s More to Building Ships\u2019 (originally written for Shake the Chains) highlight Napier\u2019s political leanings, humour is an equally vital element in his work, both recorded and live - as reflected in his recent sideline career as a stand-up comedic.

But it was in the sweaty climes of the Lock Up Stage at Reading and Leeds 2008 that his solo career really started to take off. Inside the packed out tents, heaving with adoring fans and intrigued passers-by, Frank led the congregation in a mass sing-a-long; a stirring set that not only sparked the interest of the British mainstream but resonated unassumingly across the pond as a wealth of American punk bands watched approvingly from the sidelines.\n\nNo stranger to the festival, Frank had not only played the Lock Up Tent with former hardcore band Million Dead back in 2005 but also as a tentative solo artist in 2007 when debut album \u2018Sleep Is For The Week\u2019 was just an underground success. Within the following year, Frank\u2019s popularity grew with yet more touring and the release of second album 'Love Ire & Song' in March 08. He started to play larger headline shows and develop the live band that he was looking for.\n\nThe profits of all his hard work came together that festival weekend; it kicked started a new wave of interest and thanks to the unwavering support from Radio 1 DJs Mike Davies and Steve Lamacq, the rest of Radio 1 began to follow suit. Soon enough when Frank\u2019s single 'Long Live The Queen' \u2013 taken from \u2018Love Ire & Song' \u2013 was released in October, it made the R1 C-list, was Single Of The Week on Sara Cox\u2019s show and helped sell out Frank\u2019s largest UK headline tour culminating in a bursting-over-capacity-finale at London\u2019s Scala. The following single 'Reasons Not To Be An Idiot' released in January of this year eclipsed those successes by graduating to the R1\u2019s B-list, 6Music\u2019s A-list and XFM\u2019s daytime playlist, prompted a Live Lounge session for Sara Cox, a Hub Session for George Lamb as well as making iTunes Single Of The Week all helping to recruit a new army of Frank followers.\n\nIt was also during this time that sections of the US punk fraternity began to take notice. Having watched the infamous Lock Up Stage set at Reading and Leeds, Vinnie from Less Than Jake got in contact asking to release 'The First Three Years' album (a collection of all early and previously unreleased material, live tracks and b-sides released in the UK in December 08 on his vinyl label Paper and Plastick. Chuck Ragan took him on the Revival Tour with Tim Barry across America, he did a few shows with up and coming stars Fake Problems and New Jersey boys The Gaslight Anthem invited him to support them on their huge UK and European dates in the early part of this year. It was evident that word was spreading throughout the punk scenes both sides of the Atlantic and by the time Frank flew in to Austin, Texas for the annual industry showcase SXSW in March, a whole new chapter in his story was about to begin.\n\nFrank\u2019s brand of folk songwriting, catchy melodies and punk passion had reached the ears of the CEO of US independent label Epitaph Records, Bad Religion\u2019s legendary guitarist: Brett Gurewitz. Excited by what he had heard and seen when Frank headlined LA\u2019s notorious Viper Rooms in March, Gurewitz got in contact and soon enough plans were formulated and a worldwide deal was inked. With loyalty and integrity firmly intact, Frank kept his relationship with his existing label Xtra Mile Recordings for all releases in the UK and Ireland and so the two labels will work closely for what will undoubtedly be an exciting new era in Frank\u2019s ever evolving career.\n\n\u201cFrank Turner\u2019s music is a revelation to me,\u201d says Gurewitz. \u201cI can\u2019t stop listening to it. It\u2019s a real privilege to get out there and help Xtra Mile spread the Frank Turner gospel.\u201d\n\nEpitaph is the perfect home for Frank. With its fiercely independent spirit, rich in punk and hardcore history it is also home to the song-writing talents of Nick Cave and Tom Waits on sister label Anti; mirroring Frank\u2019s cross-over appeal of punk ethics and strong song-writing abilities. Inspired by the likes of Bad Religion as a kid, this really is a dream come true for Frank.\n\nSo with this exciting plot in place the year ahead is looking pretty good. His third studio album, \u2018Poetry Of The Deed\u2019, released worldwide in September, sees Frank venture in a more rock direction recruiting his outstanding band for the recording process. Performing live has always been at the very heart of the Frank Turner experience and whilst he\u2019s still writing all the songs, they will be recorded live to help bring that experience to the album. Grammy nominated producer Alex Newport \u2013 who has previously worked with Death Cab For Cutie, At The Drive-In, Two Gallants \u2013 is on production duties after contacting Frank directly asking if they could work together. Coinciding nicely with the release are tours in America and Europe as well as the massive UK headline tour in October, where having previously supported The Gaslight Anthem at London\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, he will return triumphantly to headline for the last night of the tour.\n\nBefore that though, another summer of further touring and festivals lies ahead. He will jet off to the East Coast of America to support The Offspring for 12 dates of their tour in July, performing solo to potentially 30,000 people. He\u2019ll play at Camp Bestival and Jersey Live fest and return full circle to this year\u2019s Reading and Leeds Festival.

When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities.

In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

Very rarely though, do we see this happen in a live environment.\n\nSince 2005, John Rotellini has captivated audiences around the world by doing the impossible. A childhood love for magic paired with an eclectic collection of interests led John to develop what has become an obsession. By merging sleight of hand magic and illusions with other disciplines - psychology, con artistry, film, music and theatre, John has created live, interactive events that more closely resemble Hollywood blockbusters rather than traditional magic shows. No longer is the world of the impossible limited to the silver screen.\n\nJohn now resides in Las Vegas, Nevada where he can be found performing select dates in some of the Strip's most critically acclaimed productions and entertaining some of today's hottest stars when not on his own U.S. Tours.\n\nWhether it be performing live in front of thousands, entertaining small groups or executing death-defying large scale stunts, John's performances will be sure to leave you speechless. After all, how often do you get to live the impossible?\n\n\nHistory:\n\nWhen it comes to his shows, John has a very unique way of thinking. Rather than using a traditional audience/performer relationship, John has developed interactive experiences where the audience become the stars of the show. This allows each show to be different than the last and makes for many off-the-cuff and unique moments between John and his volunteers.\n\nAfter several years of honing his craft and performing for people in his home state of Wyoming, John launched his first headlining tour, Locked UP in April of 2009. The show, which opened to sold out crowds included a very special stunt. The spectacle, Rotellini's first venture into stunt work, was entitled -B L I N D- and required John to spend a day without sight, wrapping up with a blind drive through the streets of his hometown in a 2009 Pontiac Solstice roadster.\n\nThree years later, in January of 2012, the show transitioned from it's original Locked UP format into the TOURPOCALYPSE brand. The show, a blend of high-octane illusions punctuated with close up effects, celebrity cameos and what can only be called \"special\" theatrical moments, entertained crowds across the U.S. and led to John's first full-length DVD - John Rotellini: TOURPOCALYPSE Live From The Gryphon Theatre.\n\nFrom late 2011 until early 2013 John spent most of his time on the road. After his critically-acclaimed tour wrapped its run during the middle of 2013, John began developing an all-new show - AGENT PROVOCATOUR which began in 2015 and is currently touring the United States.\n\nOn April 19, 2016, John became the first magician to perform at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, NV. John joined the Harlem Globetrotters (who were also completing another first for the arena - its first athletic event) to create some very special magic for their 90th Anniversary World Tour.\n\nCurrently, John keeps very busy, raising thousands of dollars for charities that include Kidd's Kids, Children's Miracle Network, Win-Win Entertainment, The USO and Relay for Life while traveling the country entertaining audiences at various colleges, public and private events to rave reviews. He has been fortunate enough to gain sponsorship from Countryman Microphones, American Crew Men's Products and has had the privilege of having EXPRESS Fashion be the official wardrobe provider for some of his tours.", "otherInfo": "Special Win-Win Entertainment Virtual Visit and performance for patients, staff and visiting families of Sunrise Children\u2019s Hospital in Las Vegas, NV."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mo Stroemel ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8884570.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Alt-country, Country, Folk, Americana, Folk Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Music Page for Mo Stroemel", "otherInfo": "With Special Guest William Ryan"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "QUIX ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9202178.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Electronic, Trap, Edm, Bass, Dance Music", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "HI, MY NAME IS JONO\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nI'm a bass producer from Auckland, NZ.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

Both on stage and off, Toronto-based Charles presents an immutable charm, at times endearingly abrasive and honest in her vulnerabilities. Tanika returns in 2019 battle tested and ready to reveal the latest chapters of her life since graduating from local favourite to international success.\n\nIn early 2016 Tanika independently released Soul Run within Canada. The album went on to receive nominations for the Polaris Music Prize and a Juno Awards nomination for best R&B/Soul Recording of the Year. In 2017 Soul Run was released internationally by Italian funk/soul label Record Kicks. The critical reception was overwhelmingly positive with Now Magazine giving it a 4/5, Exclaim! Magazine rating it an 8/10 and Music Republic Magazine giving it a perfect 5/5. Songs such as \u201cEndless Chain\u201d, \u201cLove Fool\u201d and \u201cSoul Run\u201d received regular radio rotation in the Canada, the US, the UK and France.\n\n\u201cI heard Tanika Charles and it just reminded me of that Beastie Boys deep funk, raw soul era\u201d - NPR\u2019s What\u2019s Good with Stretch and Bobbito\n\nTanika\u2019s sophomore album The Gumption was released May 10th, 2019 through Record Kicks. It picks up where Soul Run left off, continuing her tradition of marrying classic soul with modern production styles. Across a dozen songs spanning 38 minutes, Tanika addresses moments of vindication, uncertain love, forbidden fruit and the state of the world today. \u201cIt\u2019s a little more mature,\u201d Tanika reflects on the album overall. \u201cIt\u2019s not feeling guilty about being up front, not being afraid to address situations that aren\u2019t comfortable for me. I\u2019m comfortable in my skin now in a way I never was before.\u201d\n\nPredominately guitar-driven mid-tempo soul, with a handful of dance floor friendly tunes and some psychedelic leanings, production on The Gumption was steered by DJ Kemo (Kardinal Offishall, Akon) and Chin Injeti (DJ Khalil, Eminem, Drake), Daniel Lee (Hooded Fang, Phedre) who previously contributed to Soul Run, multi-instrumentalist Kevin Henkel (Patch Banks & Sound sample library, sampled by T.I. and Young Thug) and solo artist Marlon James (Jessie Reyez, Iman Omari) who has played bass alongside Tanika for many years.\n\n\u201cImpressive vocal qualities, winningly honest lyrics, and a contemporary twist on classic soul sounds all point to great things\u201d - Albumism\n\nBacked by her band The Wonderfuls, Tanika has embarked on 5 tours since the release of Soul Run. Those tours took her across Canada many times over, as well as into eight other countries. Together they impressed crowds at such festivals as Rennes Trans Musicales, NXNE, L\u00e4rz Fusion, Pop Montreal, Canarias Jazz Festival, CBC Music Fest, TD Toronto Jazz Fest, Birmingham\u2019s Mostly Funk, Soul and Jazz Festival, the Pan Am Games, and many more.\n\nTanika has also appeared on television both as a reoccurring guest on CBC Kids, and as a lounge singer on Global TV\u2019s Bomb Girls drama series. Her music has been featured on HBO\u2019s Less Than Kind, ABC\u2019s Rookie Blue, The CW\u2019s Seed, CTV\u2019s Saving Hope, CBC\u2019s Kim\u2019s Convenience and Workin\u2019 Moms as well as in a nationally broadcast KFC commercial. In 2017 she made her theatrical debut in the touring production Freedom Singer, and returned to that role in February 2019\u2019s Now We Recognize.\n\n\u201cOne of the big hitters\u201d - Craig Charles - BBC6 Music", "otherInfo": "A stellar lineup of up-and-coming and established Canadian musicians \u2013 including Juno Award winners and nominees, buzz-worthy emerging artists, and a Broadway performer \u2013 will perform on Thursday, May 28, in Winnipeg\u2019s most exclusive music venue \u2013 your home.\nRos\u00e9 SoirIN will be Manitoba\u2019s first-ever \u201cvirtual\u201d gala fundraiser, in support of patient care and medical research at St. Boniface Hospital \u2013 the second-largest health care facility in the province.

Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week. I only made it through one semester of college, but being around these amazing songwriters here in Austin\u2026 It\u2019s like getting an education.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Peppino D'Agostino ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9127405.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "World, Open Tunings, Acoustic, Fingerstyle, Folk, Guitar Virtuoso", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Peppino D\u2019Agostino doesn\u2019t just play the guitar. He composes, arranges, collaborates, improvises and has even been known to sing a song here and there in both English and Italian. But what he does create on the guitar makes the difference between simply playing and truly making music apparent in the most wonderful ways.\n\nD\u2019Agostino has been hailed as \u201ca guitarist\u2019s guitarist\u201d by Acoustic Guitar magazine as well as \u201ca giant of the acoustic guitar\u201d (San Diego Reader), and holds many top guitar awards, but the San Francisco Chronicle encapsulated the essential difference that distinguishes D\u2019Agostino\u2019s music when it dubbed him \u201ca poet.\u201d\n\nThat poetic eloquence, grace and magic suffuses Nine White Kites, his first album of new compositions for the guitar in a decade (during which time he\u2019s done much else wonderful with his musical talents). The set of 11 songs and two bonus tracks launches with the soaring fingerpicking of the title track, leading the listener through a tour de force showcase of D\u2019Agostino\u2019s mastery and artistry.\n\nNumbers like \u201cBarefoot in Rio\u201d (on which D\u2019Agostino makes a rare appearance on nylon string guitar), \u201cCowboy Minestrone\u201d (an homage to master country picker Jerry Reed) and \u201cReggae Ragu\u201d travel through spots on the musical globe where he finds stylistic inspiration to blend with his own international roots, while \u201cSan Francisco 1982\u201d revisits the allure of the city he first visited on vacation that year and soon after returned to and made his home. \u201cStreet Pulse\u201d bristles with a kinetic urban energy, \u201cImminent Dawn\u201d evokes the mystical junction of night becoming day, \u201cJump Rope\u201d is a stunning showcase of guitar athleticism and dexterousness, and the sparse and subdued \u201cSilence In Between\u201d captures the music in the space among the notes. \u201cClare\u2019s Gifts\u201d and \u201cSweet Sylvia\u201d are D\u2019Agostino\u2019s musical Mona Lisas that paint women on guitar. D\u2019Agostino wraps it up with two Italiano melodic deserts on the bonus tracks: \u201cNella Fantasia,\u201d an Ennio Morricone melody (originally \u201cGabriel\u2019s Oboe\u201d in the film The Mission) with lyrics by Chiara Ferrau, beautifully sung by Peppino\u2019s daughter Aleza, and the spry folk classicism of \u201cLa Gazza Ladra.\u201d\n\nAfter a listen to Nine White Kites, It\u2019s no wonder that Acoustic Guitar says that D\u2019Agostino is \u201cone of the most capable composers among fingerstyle guitarists\u201d while the San Jose Mercury News notes his \u201cgift for writing emotionally evocative tunes.\u201d The title reflects the fact that \u201cmusic is weightless,\u201d D\u2019Agostino observes. \u201cBut if you think about it, it can create very deep and heavy feelings. The kite is very light, like music, but it also can evoke feelings. Plus it symbolizes a sense of freedom, and kites are universal, found all around the world.\u201d\n\nA native of Italy, D\u2019Agostino has made his considerable international mark as a musical artist on the guitar since he arrived in America a little over 25 years ago. The readers of Guitar Player voted him Best Acoustic Guitarist in 2007, and the following year in Acoustic Guitar\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Awards he won a Bronze medal for Best Acoustic Album of All Time for his 2002 release Every Step of The Way (tying with Leo Kottke, one of his prime inspirations) and another Bronze award as Fingerstyle Guitarist of the Year. But as said above, it\u2019s not just his talent that makes D\u2019Agostino so notable, but also what he does with it.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune praises his \u201cvirtuosity and complexity\u201d as well as his gift for composing \u201cmemorable melodies.\u201d He is also an \u201castonishing entertainer\u201d (Anchorage Daily News). Yet it\u2019s what Guitar One has noted as his \u201clyrical artistry\u201d and fellow master player Adrian Legg describes as the \u201cwarm humanity\u201d of his playing that has earned him the stature of being a \u201cphenom,\u201d as Jazziz raves.\n\nHow has D\u2019Agostino earned such high praise and honors? \u201cMusic is not only what you know musically, but also what you experience in life, because it is a reflection of our personalities and spirit,\u201d he explains. In his playing and writing one feels his heart, spirit, soul and essence as well as your own.\n\nHe began playing guitar at the age of 10 when he heard his cousin play in church. After D\u2019Agostino got a few lessons from the cousin, he embarked on a journey of self-study and further exploration on the guitar and in music that continues today. So in addition to his \u201ctechnical prowess\u201d (Guitar One), he displays a stunning stylistic range in his work that spans classical to pop music and incorporates a spectrum of folk, ethnic and world styles. From his teens into his twenties, D\u2019Agostino learned about and absorbed many musical colors and flavors, being so enthralled with all to know about music and his chosen instrument that he went AWOL one night from the Italian Army to catch a concert by some acoustic guitarists he admired.\n\nAfter making his recorded mark in his homeland with his first album Bluerba in 1981 and Silk and Steel two years later \u2014 both discs collaborations with fellow players that set the stage for many to follow \u2014 he moved to America in 1985. Starting out by performing in the streets and on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco, he graduated to playing in restaurants and then clubs and concerts after a fellow musician introduced D\u2019Agostino to a booking agent. He made his American recording debut in 1987 with Acoustic Spirit on Shanachie Records, and has since issued six more albums prior to Nine White Kites, the most recent being Made in Italy, a musical travelogue through the songs and composers of the country where he was born and came of age.\n\nHe has released the collaborations Classic/Steel (2001) with contemporary classical guitar master David Tanenbaum and Bayshore Road (2005) with his close friend and virtuoso electric player Stef Burns. D\u2019Agostino also performs and has recorded with the United Guitar Ensemble, which features his steel string guitar alongside eight nylon string classical masters.\n\nHe has also released three instructional/performance DVDs as well as the book New Acoustic Guitar (Warner Bros. Publications), and also designed his signature Seagull guitar with innovative guitar maker Robert Godin that won a Silver People\u2019s Choice Award for Acoustic Guitar of the Year from Acoustic Guitar magazine in 2008. A hot ticket live performer in North and South America and Europe, he charms audiences with performances that are captivating and full-blooded musical experiences.\n\n\u201cI play Brazilian music, Irish music, country music, blues, ragtime, classical,\u201d he says of just some of the many styles heard within what he creates. Inspired by such diverse players as Paco de Lucia, Leo Kottke and Carlos Santana, among many others, his influences also include the progressive rockers like Genesis, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant and Mike Oldfield he listened to in his teens and early adulthood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to my curiosity,\u201d D\u2019Agostino explains. \u201cA lot of people stay within a frame and say they play blues and they play blues all their life. And that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not judging anyone. But the way my brain works I need to explore different styles and what\u2019s available there and what\u2019s possible and what others do.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeppino writes wonderful guitar pieces,\u201d says Kottke of his onetime acolyte. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my favorite composers for this cranky instrument. Plus, he\u2019s a tone player. I love his sound\u2026 [he] gets the resin and the wood.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Agostino likens his musical approach to the culinary artistry of his native Italy. \u201cIf you only know about tomatoes, garlic and basil, you will only make a certain kind of sauce. But if you know about maybe thyme, parsley, onions and olives, you make a different kind of recipe. But you have to know how to mix those elements with discretion and elegance.\u201d The results provide a delectable and nutritious listening experience for music lovers of all tastes that brings D\u2019Agostino satisfaction that radiates throughout his self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d. For as he says, \u201cOur job as musicians is to try to do what we love.self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d.

At age 12 she was appearing on Knoxville TV, and at 13, she was recording on a small label and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. When she graduated from high school in 1964 she moved to Nashville, taking many traditional elements of folklore and popular music from East Tennessee with her.\n\nParton's initial success came as a songwriter, with her songs being covered by Kitty Wells, Hank Williams, Jr., Skeeter Davis, and a number of others. She signed with Monument Records in late 1965, where she was initially pitched as a bubblegum pop singer, earning only one national chart single, \"Happy, Happy Birthday Baby,\" which did not crack the Billboard Top 100. Additional pop singles also failed to chart.\n\nThe label agreed to have Parton sing country music after her composition \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\" as recorded by Bill Phillips (and with Parton, uncredited, on harmony) went to No. 6 on the country charts in 1966. Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but didn't write), reached No. 24 country 1967, followed later the same year with \"Something Fishy,\" which went to No. 17. The two songs anchored her first full-length album, Hello I'm Dolly, that same year.\n\nIn 1967, Parton was asked to join the weekly syndicated country music TV program hosted by Porter Wagoner, replacing Norma Jean. She also signed with RCA Records, Wagoner's label, during this period, where she would remain for the next two decades. Wagoner and Parton immediately began a hugely successful career as a vocal duet in addition to their solo work and their first single together, a cover of Tom Paxton's \"The Last Thing on My Mind,\" reached the top ten on the U.S. country charts in late 1967, and was the first of over a dozen duet singles to chart for them during the next several years.\n\nParton is a hugely successful songwriter, having begun by writing country songs with strong elements of folk music in them based upon her upbringing in humble mountain surroundings. Her songs \"Coat of Many Colors\" and \"Jolene\" have become classics in the field, as have a number of others. As a composer, she is also regarded as one of country music's most gifted storytellers, with many of her narrative songs based on persons and events from her childhood.\n\nIn 1987, Parton left her longtime label, RCA, and signed with Columbia Records, where her recording career continued to prosper, but by the mid 1990s, Parton, along with many other performers of her generation, found that her new music was not welcome on country radio playlists. She recorded a series of critically acclaimed bluegrass albums, beginning with \"The Grass is Blue\" (1999) and \"Little Sparrow\" (2001), both of which won Grammy Awards. Her 2002 album \"Halos and Horns\" included a bluegrass version of the Led Zeppelin classic Stairway to Heaven. In 2005, Parton released Those Were The Days, her interpretation of hits from the folk-rock era of the late 1960s through early 1970s. The CD featured such classics as John Lennon's \"Imagine,\" Cat Stevens' \"Where Do The Children Play,\" Tommy James' \"Crimson & Clover,\" and the folk classic \"Where Have All The Flowers Gone\", as well as the title track.\n\nIn 2007, Dolly paved new musical ground by forming her own record label, Dolly Records. The label's first release - Backwoods Barbie - debuted at #2 on the Billboard country albums charts and marks Parton's first mainstream country album in 17 years. Parton is touring North America and Europe throughout 2008 in support of her latest release.", "otherInfo": "\u201cGoodnight With Dolly\u201d will feature Dolly Parton reading a series of Imagination Library books"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Clap Your Hands Say Yeah ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8315551.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Indie Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s 2005 self-released debut album set a precedent for how bands might begin to approach making music independently. The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go.

But the South Korea born, New Mexico raised performer hardly realized just how dynamically his skills on the instrument would mesh with his ultimate development as a rocker in the popular regional bands Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and now, his emergence as a powerful and emotional singer/songwriter in his own right. On his debut album These Illusions, Park plays violin and acoustic guitar in addition to reaching out to acoustic rock fans everywhere with his inimitable vocals. Because of the mostly personal nature of the songs, the compelling 11-track collection rolls like a fascinating chronology of the 27-year-old singer\u2019s life, beginning with tunes he wrote when he was an engineering student at New Mexico State in his now adopted hometown of Las Cruces. He was also building his catalog of songs as he played violin and contributed backing vocals for several years in two well known regional bands: the mostly cover band Live Bait and the \u201cscreamo\u201d metalcore/hardcore group Kiss To Betray. Playing in Live Bait, his violin came in very handy for those Dave Matthews songs and it helped him take songs like Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d to a transcendent level. Live Bait won the local college radio station KRUXFEST for \u201cBest New Alternative Band\u201d in 2005 and Kiss To Betray won the Las Cruces 2006 Battle of the Bands and later played at well known venues around the country like Headhunters in Austin, The Viper Room in L.A. and hotspots in Phoenix. As a solo artist, Park has since headlined regularly at local clubs like El Patio Bar and Hurricane Alley, the Albuquerque haunts the Launch Pad and Rally\u2019s Pub on 4th Street, and in Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix and even Colorado Springs. He recently posted two live performance videos on his myspace (myspace.com/danielparkmusic), one of which features his unique looping technique which allows him to play violin and guitar \u201csimultaneously\u201d on the same song. While Park enjoyed his time in Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and the notoriety he received as a featured performer, in some ways he felt he was always gearing up for his eventual breakthrough to the forefront as his own artist. In the months leading up to the breakup of Kiss To Betray, Park gathered his best material, entered what kiddingly refers to as \u201ca local ghetto studio\u201d and started to come to grips with These Illusions. While many of the tracks on the album have their roots in romantic relationships, the hypnotic and percussive, acoustic guitar driven title cut cuts to the core of his desire to find his own creative path in life\u2014even if it means going against the mainstream expectations of our society. Other songs tap slightly into his lifelong search for identity as an Asian born man adopted (along with two of his siblings) by a white American family. Other key tracks on These Illusions include the jangling, high energy \u201cTimes Have Changed,\u201d which laments the shift in life as his significant other chooses to move on. The graceful, easy strumming ballad \u201cWhat We Should Be\u201d is another heartbreaker about learning to accept the changes in a relationship when one person leaves to pursue his or her dreams\u2014while still celebrating the memories. Park spins a different perspective .., going even deeper and more introspective .. in Me,\u201d a song about a man who hits rock bottom and realizes his need to adjust his course. \"Daniel Park has distilled what it is to be a singer songwriter in the late oughts, and in doing this, has created a blueprint that every individual with an acoustic guitar and a microphone should follow for the next decade.\" - James @ NeuFutur.com www.danielparkmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Johnson Crook ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9191293.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Alternative Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "What the quartet\u2014Noel Johnson (rhythm guitars/vocals), brothers Nathan (lead guitar/vocals) and Trevor Crook (drums/vocals) and Jared Craig (bass/vocals)\u2014share is a love of pure, honest music stemming from their small-town backgrounds.

I\u2019ve never had voice lessons, and it wasn\u2019t until after graduating from college that I started teaching myself how to play guitar. So, if you\u2019d told me then that I\u2019d end up making a living as a singer-songwriter, I wouldn't have believed you. Even now, with the release of my fifth studio album, Morning Light, I can barely believe it.\n\nMy performing career began in the smoky corners of Knoxville, TN\u2019s restaurants and bars, singing cover songs for distracted drunks and underage college students. I didn\u2019t seriously consider pursuing a career in music until May 9, 2007, after an unexpected opportunity to open for John Legend at Knoxville\u2019s Tennessee Theatre. The guy that walked on stage that night, wasn\u2019t the same guy that walked off. One set, six songs in just thirty minutes, changed my life forever.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve shared a tour bus with Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Famers, performed in front of crowds of over 20,000 people, and been lucky enough to share the stage with artists like Brandi Carlile, Heart, Gavin DeGraw, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, James Blunt, Edwin McCain, Chris Isaak, and Daughtry, as well as tour Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, performing for our men and women in uniform stationed overseas.\n\nMusic has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It\u2019s taken me to parts of the world I would\u2019ve never seen and connected me with lifelong friends I would\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s given my life purpose. Without music, I may have never met the two greatest loves of my life, my wife, Mandy, and my daughter, Annabelle Rose Baker. However, at the same time, music almost tore my life apart.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2013, I was touring over 200 days a year. By many standards, I was living the dream, but life on the road was taking its toll. While my music career had never been better, my personal life had never been worse. At home, waiting for me, was the life that I\u2019d dreamed of, and I was missing it. First words were being spoken, first steps taken, and it was all passing me by like road signs on the highway. Sadly, the two people I was working hardest to protect, were the ones getting hurt the most.\n\nThen one day I walked into an empty house and found my wife\u2019s wedding ring on the kitchen table along with a note that read, \u201cI will not be sorry for the choice YOU made.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, success as a singer-songwriter didn\u2019t seem nearly as important if it meant failing as a husband and as a father. I was at an intersection in my life and a choice had to be made. I could continue down the road I was on, whatever the cost, or change my direction and come home.\n\nThankfully, I made the choice to refocus on my family, and in January of 2014, I put down my guitar and started picking up the pieces. I stopped recording and touring, and traded the stage lights, for front porch lights, but as it turns out, the day that I decided to stop making music, was the day a new chapter in my music career began.\n\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve learned is that you get what you give in this life. 5 years ago, I GOT a second chance, and everything that\u2019s happened has GIVEN me this moment.\n\nToday, I am a better husband. I\u2019m a better father, and hopefully, I\u2019m a better songwriter. Music may have tried to tear my family apart, but now it\u2019s graciously bringing us back together. So, I see music as a celebration of every wrong turn and right turn that has led me here, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t give thanks for that old wooden box with six strings.\n\nHere\u2019s to the hope that keeps us holding on and to never losing sight of the things that are truly important. Here\u2019s to the promise and possibility of each NEW DAY. Here\u2019s to the beauty of the present moment and to trying our best to make the most of it. The road here has not been easy, but over the last few years, I\u2019ve learned that if you look hard enough, the shadows always show us the light.

Even though I wrote characters that are not the band members, our relationship definitely informed the writing of the lyrics.\u201d\n\nBlue Water Highway was started by two best friends from high school- Kibodeaux (lead vocals/guitar) and Greg Essington (vocals/guitar). Zack then turned to Catherine Clarke (vocals/keyboard), to complete the three-part harmonies that the band would soon to be known for, and they were joined by Kyle Smith (bass), and Jared Wilson (drums).

I\u2019ve never had voice lessons, and it wasn\u2019t until after graduating from college that I started teaching myself how to play guitar. So, if you\u2019d told me then that I\u2019d end up making a living as a singer-songwriter, I wouldn't have believed you. Even now, with the release of my fifth studio album, Morning Light, I can barely believe it.\n\nMy performing career began in the smoky corners of Knoxville, TN\u2019s restaurants and bars, singing cover songs for distracted drunks and underage college students. I didn\u2019t seriously consider pursuing a career in music until May 9, 2007, after an unexpected opportunity to open for John Legend at Knoxville\u2019s Tennessee Theatre. The guy that walked on stage that night, wasn\u2019t the same guy that walked off. One set, six songs in just thirty minutes, changed my life forever.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve shared a tour bus with Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Famers, performed in front of crowds of over 20,000 people, and been lucky enough to share the stage with artists like Brandi Carlile, Heart, Gavin DeGraw, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, James Blunt, Edwin McCain, Chris Isaak, and Daughtry, as well as tour Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, performing for our men and women in uniform stationed overseas.\n\nMusic has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It\u2019s taken me to parts of the world I would\u2019ve never seen and connected me with lifelong friends I would\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s given my life purpose.

Her dog is buried in the garden along the eastern wall; sometimes, she wonders if the ground will bloom half-a-dozen of him under a certain kind of moon. In the morning the light creeps sideways through the windows and lights her up from the chest down, her head nestled in the shadow. Sometimes she finds herself playing guitar before she has left sleep. Her hands strum but her mind is still dreaming. (It\u2019s her birthday, she\u2019s at the movies, the screen is a tidal wave, someone touches her leg, she wakes up with her fingers tangled in the strings and the kettle whistling.)\n\nThe house is haunted. It should go without saying, but it should be said anyway. The house is haunted, but no one knows anything about the ghost or how it messes with you, except for the fact that every time she goes away (to Texas, to Memphis, to Graceland, to Germany) she always ends up coming home again. It\u2019s the strangest kind of haunting. Everyone calls it, the house, the House of Punishment\u2014more than one mistaken citizen has turned up looking for a similarly-named erotic dungeon on the other side of town\u2014but the name is misleading. It is not a house where someone was punished, or a house where someone might be punished, but a house that replaces punishment; instead of feeling guilt or regret you must play quietly in any corner, and eventually the emotion will resolve itself.\n\nInside, every door frame is notched: the respective growths of former tenants, friends. On one of them, a place where\u2014deep in her cups\u2014she\u2019d measured her height as a full five inches taller than normal; only the next morning did she realize, cotton-mouthed, that she\u2019d been standing on her toes when she\u2019d slid the pencil over the apex of her skull. There had been a Murphy bed once, she was certain, and sometimes when she was very, very tired she would imagine her bed, which was not a Murphy bed, snapping her up into the wall. Next to her bed, in her nightstand drawer, lived the following things: crumpled receipts, red yarn, eight dollars, a white lighter, two undeveloped film cameras, Grether\u2019s Pastilles in their old-timey tin, fistfuls of birthday cards with the shimmer worn off, a pocket-sized copy of the constitution, a pocket knife, a pair of swimming goggles, a pair of recording headphones, shoelaces twisted into a Gordian knot, an unpaid parking ticket, a strip of Peanuts Halloween stickers, an MRI request form from when she sprained her finger, colloidal silver (someone told her it would cure her cold; someone else told her it would give her Argyria), a map of Kyoto (she\u2019d gotten bored at the temple), incense, her first fan letter (she promised herself she\u2019d respond; she never did), a bunch of bolts, a plastic doll\u2019s hand, doggie bags (he\u2019d died over a year ago), an unopened Replacements cassette, an unopened 23 & Me kit, an unopened fortune cookie, unopened pepper spray she doesn\u2019t trust herself to take out of the packaging. In a fake book on her desk\u2014pleather-bound and conspicuously absent a title\u2014she collects her used boarding passes, old concert tickets, disconnected wristbands. It doesn\u2019t escape her notice that she can\u2019t throw anything away, that objects remain unopened, unresolved, untangled, unconsumed. She is always in the middle. She is never at the end of anything.\n\nShe lives near a hospital. All night, she hears sirens, imagines the people being transported to and fro, their bodies speeding along in the back of ambulances and their spirit trying to catch up. She makes jokes. \u201cIf I wake up, someone better be dying,\u201d she says, until one night she wakes up and feels it: someone\u2019s essence slipping past her on the way to somewhere else. After that, she thinks about the hospital as a metaphor, and considers the many ailments the metaphorical hospital could cure, the many symptoms it could treat: Imposter syndrome. Cabin fever. Foot-in-mouth disease. Word vomit.\n\nShe invites her friends\u2014that is to say, her family\u2014over for dinner. She has this one friend whose dad was really obsessed with blood\u2014blood as in family, not the interesting kind of blood\u2014and how it was thicker than water (ew), and then one day her friend looked up the actual expression and it was, The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. Shit, right? Anyway, she makes a green bean casserole, which is demolished in short order, and hot rolls. Someone kills a pint of ice cream she\u2019s been saving. Someone else drinks a beer so hard it sputters, erupts. Someone else sits in the corner playing cat\u2019s cradle, waiting to feel the guilt lift from their sternum.\n\nAfter that, the coven of her covenant goes out beneath the new moon; they journal and play Bright Eyes and Britney Spears and act out Mar\u00eda Irene Forn\u00e9s\u2019 plays and eat peaches. They lie on the grass and the stone and talk about the skies they were born under. They don\u2019t believe, really, that it makes a difference, but it\u2019s nice to think about. After all, everyone knows the world is ending. They\u2019ve been told as much, and they can see it in the streets, and they know the world is irreparably fucked, but most importantly they feel it among themselves; they know this goodness cannot last forever.\n\nShe sits near them. They are together but at the same time they are alone, as we all are. Someone has put a braid into her hair; she\u2019s left toothmarks on someone else. Something moves through the empty house, less the ghost than the breath of the ghost. She tells her friends: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to disappear.\u201d Someone laughs. Then, someone else opens their mouth, and something else climbs out.\n\nCarmen Maria Machado, March 2020", "otherInfo": "VICE's second installment of Noisey Night In, a virtual concert fundraiser to support artists impacted by the pandemic.

Hannah always knew she wanted to be an entertainer, but it wasn't until she was ten years old that she made her debut solo performance at her fourth grade Christmas Recital. She sang \"Tender Tennessee Christmas\". After that she was hooked. She focused on nothing else. At fourteen she picked up a Squire acoustic guitar that her younger sister had abandoned and quickly began learning to write. Over the next four years she performed at fairs, coffee houses, shopping malls and talent shows throughout the Upper Midwest. At eighteen Hannah moved to Nashville, TN to make her dreams a reality. She attended Belmont University in Nashville to study the business of music and vocal performance. After two years she decided to leave Belmont and delve deeper into the art of song writing. She also began performing her own material in and around Nashville. In 2010 Hannah released her first EP, a self produced project called, \"No Stopping, Standing, Parking\". It received rave reviews from the Nashville songwriting community. Soon after it's release, she was personally selected to attend the prestigious Horse & Writer Songwriting Invitational by one of Nashville's most successful songwriters, Skip Ewing. Hannah was a contestant on the 2011 season of the reality television show, \"The X Factor USA\". Her goal was to show America her unique version of country music. The results were evident when her fan base exploded and has continued to grow ever since. Hannah returned to Nashville to continue performing and writing. Her hard work paid off when she secured four song cuts on the debut album of country artist, Rachele Lynae, on Momentum Label Group. Hannah's newest project, \"The Freedom EP\", was released on Thanksgiving Day 2012. Her current single from the project, \"No Where Left to Roam\" has been sent to Country, Americana, College and Internet radio around the world and is receiving an enthusiastic response. \"The Freedom EP\" includes five original tracks and is available now on all major online stores including iTunes and Amazon, as well as her website.

As a songwriter, specifically for liturgy in 2017, the question that provokes him is: How do I create a song that will honor traditions and music yet speak to the modern Church and lead them to worship?\n\nJosh collaborated with his guitar player, Grae McCullough, to write a new mass setting, paying homage to the hymns of the past and the culture of modern worship. \u201cEvery week we lead music for school and parish masses, so we knew we needed something that would resonate with all ages. We also wanted it to be joyful, approachable and easy to sing but still fresh, dynamic and expressive,\u201d says Blakesley.\n\nOn March 3, 2017 is the release of this long-awaited project called Mass of Restoration. It is available now anywhere music can be downloaded. For sheet music, please visit ocp.org\n\nJosh Blakesley's last full-length album, Even in This, was recorded in 2015 in Franklin, TN with Grammy Nominated producer/singer- songwriter, Michael Farren. The album features songs co-written with Farren, Mia Fieldes (Hillsong), Dove Award winner Marc Byrd (God of Wonders) and Grammy Award Nominated, Sarah Hart (Better than a Hallelujah).\n\nThe title track from the album is a song about finding hope in the darkest valleys of life. It was born out of tragedy after the band's guitar player, Grae McCullough, lost his one-month-old daughter to a chromosomal disorder called Trisomy 18. \"The peace I had the day Lizzie's short life ended could have only been God. There was an underlying sense of peace in the devastation and the song really encapsulates the situation we were in,\" says McCoullough.\n\nBlakesley has been featured on Sirius XM, EWTN\u2019s Life on the Rock, Relevant Radio, KLOVE and has performed with wide variety of Christian artists like Matt Maher, Andrew Peterson, Jars of Clay and the Newsboys; as well as several International Papal events, most recently in Milan, Italy in 2012.

In 2014, she was named one of the \u201cNew Faces of Country\u201d by Renegade Radio Nashville and was a contestant on Season 14 of American Idol. The following year, she was nominated for \u201cNew Female Vocalist of the Year\u201d at the Texas Regional Radio Music Awards. She also performed at Taste of Addison, headlined by Granger Smith, in 2017. \u201cMy greatest dream is to share what I love to do with the world, and that\u2019s to sing and make music! I love to be on stage and connect with my fans. To me, that\u2019s home.\u201d Commented Martin.\n\nMartin currently co-hosts the \u201cMusic Biz Besties Songwriter\u2019s Series\u201d at Just Love Coffee in Nashville.

These are melodies of depth, and her guitar work is exemplary.\" - Robert K. Oermann, Music Row Magazine\n\nOnce a Seattle resident, Treva Blomquist is now a Nashville local and has quickly risen to the top of an endless pool of talent that inundates the music city. Treva's ability to seamlessly weave a tapestry of folk and soul, dye it indigo blue, and adorn it with the occasional sparkling sequin of pop has earned her considerable recognition among artists and critics alike. Her songwriting is rock solid and mature, often earning favorable comparisons to Patty Griffin and Mindy Smith, with the exception that Treva is more versatile than either of the aforementioned tunesmiths. Treva is comfortable and compelling performing as a solo act, in front of a small string section, or shaking the walls of any rock venue in town with a band.\n\nAlthough Treva's brilliant songwriting and impressive guitar chops distinguish her from other artists in her genre, it is her voice that places her in a league of her own. Treva's range is wide and her timbre is as focused and as pure as a trumpet, and just as powerful. But it is the integrity and authenticity embedded within her lyrics, and the passion and soul conveyed through her voice that are truly the most inspiring. Treva posses a rare talent that is often sought after but rarely obtained.\n\nBlomquist\u2019s new album Snakes & Saints makes that point perfectly clear. Produced and engineered by multi-instrumentalists Nathan Johnson (Meaning Machine) and J. Brandon Owens (Enjoyer) at both Owens\u2019 Silent Planet studios and Johnson\u2019s home studio, it offers another example of how Blomquist culls her inspiration and sustains her intents through a resilient sense of hope, purpose and affirmation.\n\nConsisting of all original material penned by Blomquist herself, the album finds her sharing her heartfelt vocals through a delivery that\u2019s both hushed and heroic, upbeat and yet unassuming. On songs such as \u201cSecret\u201d and \u201cShape I\u2019m In,\u201d her singing literally seems to shimmer and shine. \u201cSugar\u201d finds her delivery teeming with pure pop perfection. The atmospheric ambiance of \u201cAnger\u201d belies the sentiments suggested by the title, just as the mellow drift of \u201cSorry\u201d and the distinctive dynamic of \u201cThe Bottom\u201d reflect a wisdom and endurance that conveys an inherent emotion that\u2019s bound up in each.\n\n\n*Riverbluff Performing Songwriter Grand Prize Winner (2006) for \"I Could Get Used To This\"\n\n*USA Songwriting Competition Honorable Mention (2006) with \"When the Cards Are Yours\" (Folk Category)\n\n*Kerrville Folk Festival Finalist (2005)\n\n*USA Songwriting Competition Honorable Mention (2018) with C'mon Love (Americana)", "otherInfo": "Tune in as Singer-songwriter Treva Blomquist streams an acoustic concert from her home to yours via FaceBook and Instagram."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Keith Kenny ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9369673.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Blues, Rock, Acoustic, Folk", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "If the audience at a Keith Kenny show were to close their eyes for the performance they would swear that there was a full band on stage. The audience, however, is too busy dancing to the one-man acts layered guitar riffs, foot stomping percussion, blues harmonica, and emotionally charged lyrics to even think about looking away.\nThe New Jersey native is able to emulate the sound of a full rock band with his percussive fingerstyle approach to the acoustic guitar and an array of effects pedals. Kenny has even customized a vintage red suitcase which has been dubbed \u201cThe Big Red Suitcase\u201d to use as a kick drum, which has appeared with him on stage for over a decade of live performances.\nHis debut appearances at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park paved the way for Kenny\u2019s developing one-man band show and led him into the national touring circuit and beyond. Over years of honing his craft on the road, Kenny caught the attention of one of his guitar idols, Mickey Melchiondo, a.k.a. Dean Ween from WEEN. Melchiondo recently asked Kenny to tour opening up for his new band, The Dean Ween Group, and has gained him new fans around the United States. Kenny has also been spreading his music internationally with multiple tours throughout Europe and performances in SE Asia to raise awareness about unexploded bombs. In recent years he has shared the stage with the likes of John Butler Trio, Keller Williams, WEEN, The Dean Ween Group, Leon Russell, John Hammond Jr., New Riders of the Purple Sage and John Kadlecik (Further & Dark Star Orchestra). In January of 2016, The Eagles of Death Metal released Kenny\u2019s version of \"I Love You All The Time\" as a part of their Pay it Forward Campaign to raise money for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.\nOn his latest self-titled release, Kenny teamed up with three-time Grammy Winning Producer Justin Guip (Sound engineer for Levon Helm and current touring drummer for Hot Tuna) to create a record that expanded on his signature one-man band sound. The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks. With an influential voice that lies somewhere between Neil Young and Jack White, Kenny delivers clear and concise visions of dynamic musical deliverance. Combining a deep dive into tone, originality and believability, he ushers the listener into his brand new living room of roots riddled rock and roll.\nNever going for the standard attack, he flies far from the 12-bar blues, three-chord rock and Americana stereotype to land some place between a rock and a new place. The album illustrates a highly skilled writer who utilizes the same down-home approach in his music as he does with his day-to-day interactions with others. It\u2019s a combination that will continue to see Kenny reach exciting new levels as he helps future fans \u201csee the light\u201d of his musical message.\nTo hear his full discography, watch recent videos, and check out upcoming tour dates visit www.KeithKenny.com\n(Excerpt from John Pfieffer & Jessica Smith of The Aquarian Weekly)", "otherInfo": "Virtual Tip Jar!\nVenmo: Keith-Kenny-1\nPaypal: Keith@KeithKenny.com or Paypal.me/KeithKenny\nCashApp: $KeithKenny\n\nMerchandise!

The band is the musical outlet of the songwriters Doug Byrkit and longtime musical partner Brian Zielie.\n\nDoug and Brian have been friends since 8th grade and their music partnership goes back with their first band while still in high school. They have maintained a close working relationship that has lasted through college and a host of musical projects. In the last 25 years, they have toured both nationally and internationally with various artists.\n\nFresh out of college Doug Byrkit and Brian Zielie met Mike Zito who was looking for a rhythm section to form his band. They were a perfect match. The trio began playing clubs around the St. Louis area and in no time they were working 7 nights a week. In the late \u201990s, they recorded Blue Room which celebrated it\u2019s 20th Anniversary and was recently remastered and released on Ruf Records.\n\nOdds Lane was formed in 2003 and they began recording and playing live to a steadily growing fan base. As part of an effort to promote emerging artists, they were invited to record at legendary Sun Studios, after which they released the first of several projects as independent songwriters in 2004. In 2012 their release Dark Matters garnered Byrkit an ASCAP Plus Songwriting Award.\n\nLOST & FOUND, Odds Lane\u2019s newest release on Gulf Coast Records was inspired by the re-mastered release of Mike Zito\u2019s Blue Room. They have come full circle with a collection of eleven songs that are influenced by their South St. Louis blues rock/funk roots. Lost & Found was recorded at MARZ Studio in Netherland, TX and mixed by Grammy Award-winning producer David Z (Prince, Etta James, Buddy Guy).", "otherInfo": "DOUG\u2019S QUARANTINE BIRTHDAY Living Room Show, with Doug Byrkit once again joined 6 feet away by Brian Zielie in his Living Room for the 2nd to last \"Live From The Living Room\" live streams.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brad Byrd ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9515335.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Alt-country, Rock, Indie, Folk Rock, Americana", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Brad Byrd is an Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter whose music is firmly planted in both indie-rock and alt-country.

Maggie's recent album Change The Whole Thing was named by Rolling Stone as one of the \"Best Albums of 2018.\"\n\nThe resilient powerhouse recorded this album at the famed Starstruck Studios in Nashville, TN implementing an impressively demanding method highlighting an artist in complete command of her ever-evolving creative process: live with her 13-piece \u201cfamily band\u201d in one take, no overdubs, no bullshit and a sound that is best described by the following quote from Rolling Stone:\n\n\u201cMaggie Rose has come into her own with this current earth-conscious, trippy country-soul stage of her ever-evolving musical persona...Rose\u2019s performances [during CMA Fest and Bonnaroo] showed her embracing her inner soul diva, belting with fire on \u2018It's You\u2019 and the pulverizing \u2018Pull You Through.\u2019 Just to drive the point home, Rose and her band even stretched out on a swinging cover of \u2018The Letter,\u2019 doing a more-than-respectable impression of the funky Mad Dogs & Englishmen arrangement originally sung by Joe Cocker.\u201d\n\nLeading to the Fall album launch, Rose incrementally released four Digital 45s from her forthcoming project beginning in October 2017 to both satisfy and build the anticipation of her growing fanbase. The initial 45 earned her a spot in the Top 10 on Sirius XM with the \u201csmoldering\u201d A-side, \u201cPull You Through.\u201d The \u201cpulverizing\u201d single was hailed by Rolling Stone as a \u201csoulful ballad that rejoices in the healing powers of love...a bare-bones track [that is] really a showcase for the Dusty Springfield-worthy vocals of Rose\u2026\u201d.\n\nIn Spring of 2018, Maggie released \"It's You\" and \"Smooth.\" Rolling Stone once again praised Maggie Rose with \"It's You\" as \u201ca giant, throwback Soul ballad that shows off her dynamic vocals [containing] shades of Aretha Franklin,\u201d and also praised \"Smooth\" as \"a supremely funky rocker with hints of Grace Potter [and] Janis Joplin\".\n\nThe enthusiasm surrounding each Digital 45 release has continually increased the appetite of her fans while relentlessly expanding her following via radio, streaming platforms and through her captivating live performances. The full-length album will feature 12 songs, 12 live in-studio videos, with a full-access behind-the-scenes one-hour musical documentary which peels back the layers and allows the viewer an intimate look into the making of the album.\n\nRose has been named to YouTube\u2019s Emerging Artist and Artist in Residence 2018 programs, and Pandora named her an Artist to Watch 2018. In June, Maggie\u2019s creative breadth and versatility sparked the first-ever partnership between Prescription Songs and Sea Gayle Music, with the two companies signing a joint-venture publishing agreement with Rose. In July, she was tapped for an as-named synchronization deal that lends her voice to a national ad campaign focusing on Women\u2019s Empowerment.\n\nIn 2018, Maggie Rose has played over 150 dates across the world including\nBonnaroo Music and Arts Festival and The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, while sharing the stage with artists such as Kelly Clarkson, Julia Michaels, Brandy Clark, and Bob Weir of Grateful Dead.", "otherInfo": "Join us LIVE on Thursday May 28th at 9pm CT for the Official \u201cHELP MYSELF\u201d Virtual Release Party, Song Premiere and Concert.

Catching his break after winning a Beatport remix contest in 2012 with his dubstep-\nfocused version of Above & Beyond\u2019s \u201cYou Got to Go\u201d, Seven Lions, born Jeff Montalvo, garnered early support\nfrom the likes of Skrillex and his OWSLA label. 2013 tour dates with Porter Robinson and Krewella pushed\nMontalvo and his genre-bending production style to the forefront of the modern electronic music scene.\nPutting sheer technical production prowess to work in soulful, deep, hybridized creations all distinctly his\nown, the multi-talented musician is single-handedly changing the sonic landscape for future generations to come\nby bridging the gap between the soaring, ethereal vibe of trance and intensely adrenalizing bass music. His\nproductions have seen stages at world-renowned festivals such as Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival\n(New York and Las Vegas), Electric Forrest, Electric Zoo, South by Southwest, and HARD.\nAfter several successful releases under the OWSLA label (his debut EP, Days to Come, reached #2 on\nthe iTunes Dance charts), Montalvo released his highly anticipated 2014 follow-up EP, Worlds Apart, on Republic\nRecords\u2019 dance imprint Casablanca. Containing several notable features which include Ellie Goulding and Tove\nLo, Worlds Apart debuted at #1 on the iTunes Dance charts, and the title track was also featured in Billboard\u2019s\n\u201cTop 10 Electronic/Dance Songs of 2014\u201d list. The EP also featured the smash hit and canonical dance track\n\u2018Strangers\u2019, featuring superstar vocalist Tove Lo. \u2018Strangers\u2019 was a definitive track in what was perhaps the peak\nof American electronic dance music, and solidified Seven Lions as one of the scene\u2019s premier artists.\nIn 2015, Seven Lions began releasing music in EP formats, devoting each EP to a cohesive idea and\nworld found within the Seven Lions universe. 2015\u2019s \u201cThe Throes of Winter\u201d hints at a larger seasonal theme, to\nbe continued through to his future releases. When asked about the spark for this vision, he explains, \"Since\nartists aren't releasing proper albums anymore, it makes sense to create something that's digitally artistic with real\ncohesion as opposed to tossing out singles and just haphazardly seeing what sticks\u2026 I wanted to start making\nthe music more thematic, interesting, and part of something larger.\u201d\nBucking more trends and breaking from convention, his 2016 Creation EP [Casablanca Records] followed\na different path for his latest body of work. \u201cThis time, songwriting really took place on guitar,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere\nare more acoustic elements in the songs, and that ties it together. I wanted to get a little more experimental. I\ndidn\u2019t worry if something was going to be a big banger on the dancefloor or not. I just made what felt right at the\ntime.\u201d Ultimately, Seven Lions continues challenging himself and musical genres. \u201cI want to do something\ndifferent,\u201d he concludes. \u201cEverything doesn\u2019t have to fit into just one genre. I want people to walk away loving\ndifferent kinds of music and sounds.\u201d\nThis year saw Seven Lions once more travel across the country on his There and Back Again club-\nfocused tour, in addition to hallmark festival appearances at Tomorrowland, EDC Las Vegas, Life in Color, EDC\nJapan, Middlelands, Electric Zoo, and Paradiso, amongst others. This summer the sound-sculptor unveiled his\nhighly-anticipated Where I Wont Be Found EP as well, continuing his always growing world, identified via these\nannual EP projects. The eight-track offering is a wondrous journey from start to. From the heavily streamed and\ncritically praised \u201cFreesol,\u201d to the energetic future bass collaboration \u201cRescue Me\u201d with scene upstart Unlike Pluto,\nWhere I Wont Be Found reminds fans of what made Seven Lions who he is today - a singular talent in electronic\nmusic, and a producer who has always forged his own lane.\nIn support of the EP and the year as a whole, Seven Lions will wrap up 2017 with a 20 date North\nAmerican headlining tour with Tritonal (and Kill The Noise as support). Playing some of America\u2019s largest\ntheatres, the Horizon Tour hits LA (2 nights at the iconic Palladium), NYC (Brooklyn\u2019s Hangar), Boston,\nPhiladelphia, San Francisco (Bill Graham), Toronto, and many other key locales.\n\nJeff started 2018 in a new direction \u2013 his very own record label. Called Ophelia Records, the imprint has\nalready seen a handful of strong releases: Calling You Home, Ocean, and Horizon. \u2018Ocean\u2019 in particular has\nalready cemented itself as a quintessential Seven Lions track, racking up over 1.7 million Spotify streams in just a\nfew weeks.

His songs tell heartfelt stories about real people, and are unfailingly optimistic and forward looking. In addition to being a Billboard Top 10 recording artist, he is also the winner of Best Americana Artist by the Indie Music Channel, and two Grammy certificates, awarded in 2017. He performs frequently in southern Appalachia: Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia - however he has performed everywhere from the Troubadour in Los Angeles to Carnegie Hall in New York, and most places in between.

Equally at home as a solo artist and with his Nashville band, Grant is an engaging performer who delights audiences with his southern humor and passion.\n\nHis most recent album \"Dust Bowl - American Stories\" spent 17 weeks on the Billboard charts, including eleven weeks in the TOP 10 of the Americana/Folk Album Sales Chart, and reached as high as #12 on the Country Album Sales Chart, and #2 on the Heatseekers Chart (across all genres). The album continues to earn rave reviews, like this one from NO DEPRESSION, the bible of American Roots music: \u201cGrant\u2019s ability to capture the heartland in his music is amazing ... he has written A heartland masterpiece ... lyrics and music as potent as Woody Guthrie ... sent chills down my spine ... bound to become a classic ...

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. He\u2019s never more than one degree away from a powerful musical hook-up.", "otherInfo": "Cecil B.

In fact, with seven studio albums and more than 2.3 million Facebook fans, he is one of techno's biggest superstars. In a time where the big drops of EDM (Electronic Dance Music) and cake-throwing DJs seem to reign supreme, Paul Kalkbrenner is keeping his cool. He trusts on his remarkable talent as a producer and live act\u2014no added artificial flashiness needed. He can rave with the best of them, and raise his arms to full dancefloor delirium, but his head will never spin right off.\n\nPaul Kalkbrenner's demanding compositions are full of energy; they exist to take listeners away from the everyday, from the weekly grind, into rapture\u2014into art, ecstasy, absurdity friendship, hope and love.\n\nJust 12 years old when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Kalkbrenner watched as East Berlin became an anarchic playground for a previously oppressed generation, recently freed from an overbearing state. Techno music became a way of expression and for many, Paul included, the soundtrack of Germany's reunification. In the autumn of 1992, together with his friend Sascha Funke, he started DJing at local youth clubs. Very quickly Paul and Sascha were either DJing or obsessively collecting records as electronic dance music's first tidal wave spilled over dance floors in Berlin's soon-to-be legendary clubs Tresor, Planet, Walfisch and e-werk.\n\nAt 18, he took a job at German television, spending his days sitting and editing suites watching as staid German political parties held national conferences. This would make him enough money to buy equipment to produce his own tracks. As much fun as DJing was, Paul wanted to play his own music live.\n\nHis first tracks were released on Ellen Allien's newly founded Bpitch Control label in 1999. In contrast to the darker, monotone sounds that characterized techno at the time, Paul's music was more melodic and enriched with a warm, dubby feel. After a number of 12\" singles, Paul realised he was better suited producing albums. In 2000, he released \u2018Superimpose\u2019, followed by \u2018Zeit\u2019 one year later. His third album, \u2018Self\u2019 from 2004, resonated beyond the dancefloor and took the cinematic quality of his music to new heights\u2014an indication of what was to come next.\n\nIn 2004, Berlin-based film director and self-confessed Kalkbrenner fan, Hannes Stoehr, got in touch with Paul. He was planning to make a movie about an electronic musician in Berlin's techno scene and wanted Paul to produce the soundtrack. As the script for the film developed, Hannes suggested Paul might be perfect in the starring role.\n\nTogether with his old friend Sascha Funke, he moved to Aix en Provence for six months. There, far away from Berlin's dreary winter, Paul produced some of his most diverse and mature compositions yet, which would later make up the soundtrack for \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019. He started shooting the movie upon his return to Berlin, with the result being an unconventional but outstanding performance. Somewhere between Paul Kalkbrenner and his character Ickarus, an intimate dialogue developed between actor and audience.\n\n\u2018Berlin Calling\u2019 became a surprise hit, and a German cult movie in its own right. It drew audiences all around Europe and stayed on the big screen at Berlin's Central Kino for several years. The soundtrack went platinum and the single \"Sky and Sand\", featuring his brother Fritz Kalkbrenner's vocals, spent over 121 weeks in the German singles charts\u2014a German record.\n\nAt the end of 2009, Paul split with his longtime label Bpitch Control to form his own independent imprint, Paul Kalkbrenner Musik. A sold-out European tour and a documentary followed. Made with the help of the \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019 team, Max Penzel and Hannes Stoehr, \u20182010 - A Live Documentary\u2019 featured an 8-camera shoot of 15 live shows, with computer graphics created by Pfadfinderei (who also worked on \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019). The documentary remains an intimate insight into Paul's life on the road, sprinkled with his dry, deadpan humour.\n\nBetween June 2011 and November 2012 Paul released his fifth and sixth studio albums \u2018Icke Wieder\u2019 and \u2018Guten Tag\u2019. These two self-released albums are Paul's bestselling albums yet\u2014both went top five in his native Germany, with \u2018Guten Tag also topping the charts in Switzerland.\n\nNot one to rest on his laurels, Paul returned to the studio soon after, but this time made a conscious decision to take his time and explore new avenues of his sound. While working on new tracks, flipping samples and experimenting, Germany's Federal Government asked him to play a headlining live show in front of the Brandenburg Gate in a historic ceremony commemorating the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was another milestone moment in Paul's career. The framed thank-you note he received from the Government afterwards has a special place in his apartment.\n\nAfter 15 years of releasing on independent labels (ten years at Bpitch Control and five on his own label), Paul decided to take the next step and signed a long-term deal with Sony International/Columbia in March 2015. Enthused by this new chapter in his career and incited by the pressure a deal like this is usually accompanied by, Paul went back to his studio to finish his seventh studio album and create a new live show.\n\nThe album, aptly titled \u20187\u2019, was released through Columbia Records in August 2015, and it saw Paul work with vocals for the first time since his chart-topping, record-breaking single \"Sky and Sand\". In an unprecedented move by the label, Sony and Columbia provided him total access to their Legacy vaults, allowing him to incorporate vocals from previously-unsampled music icons Luther Vandross and Jefferson Airplane. The album was a success across Europe, hitting No. 1 on the charts in Austria, Switzerland, and his native Germany; and earning plaudits from the New York Times, Village Voice, Mixmag, and others.\n\nFollowing \u20187\u2019\u2019s success, Paul continued to blaze new milestones, becoming the first techno artist to grace long-running European institution Tomorrowland\u2019s main stage in July 2016. At the end of the day, though, he always comes back to his underground Berlin roots, which he celebrated with his \u201cBack to the Future\u201d mixtape series, a trilogy that chronicles his personal history of electronic music\u2019s arrival to Germany as heard on the radio during his teenage years. The series went viral, amassing over 490K downloads and 502K streams, prompting rumors of a live experience in 2017.", "otherInfo": "Join me this Friday 5pm CET for Studiosession #2.

They also incorporate symphonic elements into their sound. The past years, their melodies have taken much more melancholic turn and the sound is overall much darker.\n\nBiography\nInsomnium began to take shape during the bleak spring of 1997. In a quiet town of Joensuu, located in the easternmost part of Finland, four young men were forming a fierce metal band. From the beginning it was clear that this band would make music that was brutal and yet melodic, full of contrasts and changing atmospheres. They took what they regarded as the best aspects of their favourite bands and moulded these influences into a new kind of entity. The result was the marriage of melodic Scandinavian death metal and traditional Finnish tunes. Lyrics turned out to be sorrowful, dream-like tales of love and death that usually took place amidst the Finnish nature. Influences were taken from the Finnish folklore as well as the world literature.\n\nAfter two years of intensive training Insomnium made their first demo-cd, which received praises from all over the world. The second demo was made the following year and it gained a lot of attention as well. This time, record companies got interested, too. In the beginning of 2001 founding members, guitarist Ville Friman, drummer Markus Hirvonen and bassist/vocalist Niilo Sev\u00e4nen, attached a new guitarist, Ville V\u00e4nni to the band. Now Insomnium was stronger than ever and ready to rise to the next level. A deal with Candlelight was signed the same spring and recording of the first album began in the summer.\n\n- In the Halls of Awaiting - was released in April 2002 and it introduced a band that had evolved in many ways. The legacy of Scandinavian death metal was still the core of the music but new layers had appeared around it. There were more nuances and depth in the songs, and the music was more versatile and challenging than before. Progressive shades had crept into the songs, and in many ways the band had stepped aside from the mainstream of melodic death metal. Debut album received excellent reviews in many magazines around the globe, especially in Germany, Finland and North America. The recording of the second album began in summer 2003. The process was somewhat painful but finally in December the new album was ready. - Since the Day It All Came Down - continues the development that the first album began. Songs are more versatile and surprising, progressive influences are ever clearer. Some tracks may even be described as experimental. But the straightforward side of the music hasn\u00b4t gone anywhere, since catchy guitar-harmonies, crushing riffs and soothing acoustic interludes are all still there. Melodies are still the most essential element in the music of Insomnium, but this time the tunes are even more melancholic and wistful than on the debut album. This is a sad and dreary album, heavier and gloomier than the first one, and undoubtedly more challenging. So when you take this path, keep in mind that it takes a while before your eyes get used to the dark...\n\n..And darker it got. With their third release, - Above The Weeping World -, the music got more agressive, harder, louder and the progressive elements grew once again. The first European tour is over, and Insomnium is once again a step closer to world domination.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.insomnium.net", "otherInfo": "Friends, we have good news for you.\nMark your calendars for May 29! \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb\n\nOfficial announcement:\n\nINSOMNIUM performs a special WINTER\u2019S GATE live stream show\n\nFinland\u2019s spearhead of melodic death metal, Insomnium will play a special worldwide live stream show on Friday, May 29, showtime 19:00 CET.

Growing up around folk music, he listened to a musical gamut that covered Hank Williams, Jimi Hendrix, Sam Cooke and gospel. As he fell in with other musical progeny, most notably close friend Rufus Wainwright, his sound developed into his own combination of country/western, rock, and his father's folk-rock.\n\nTeddy played regular shows at Jon Brion's venue, Largo, in Los Angeles while getting his first album contract together. He signed with Geffen, who had big plans for him - but Geffen was soon after swallowed up by Virgin, who did not. Teddy's debut came out with little fanfare and less push from the label. He took a few years to tour and write before finally recording his second album on his own, and has been touring in support of that. While reviews for his first album were generally positive, the critics have gushed over his second album.

This fresh-faced native of Southampton, England, was merely playing into his love of funkadelic hip-hop and crooning urban stylings when he started writing songs as a teenager. His love for Terence Trent D'Arby, Sisqo, and Donnell Jones allowed him to put his creative love for art, culture, and history into a musical beat all his own. And the new millennium belonged to him and garage had been redefined.\n\nBorn Craig Ashley David on May 5, 1981, David was slicing and dicing ragga and R&B on the local station PCRS 106.5FM and found himself playing club gigs prior to rubbing elbows with some of music's finest. It was during this time he hooked with Artful Dodger's Mark Hill. After winning a national writing competition, Craig was more than ready to start producing with Hill. His big break came when he put his own additives on Damage's \"I'm Ready,\" a B-side to \"Wonderful Tonight.\" Soon thereafter he remixed his own version of Human League's \"Human\" and started himself a regular spot in area clubs during the weekends. \"Rewind\" was another underground smash, specifically a definitive move for David. His respect for Stevie Wonder, Faith Evans, and R. Kelly was most apparent, however his own vocal talent was beginning to shine. He and Hill's specialty show on Capital Radio provided another outlet for David to shape his musical work of genius. \"Fill Me In\" proved yet another hit, shooting straight to number one in summer 2000. David was now the youngest British male solo artist to have a number one single. He was 19-years-old.\n\nA deal with Wildstar Records in the U.K. sparked toward the end of the summer as \"Re-Rewind\" and \"7 Days\" gained praise in late November. A stateside agreement with Atlantic also led to more global hype. He had sold 3.5 million records worldwide and garage was finally becoming massive overseas and it was David's debut Born to Do It that was at the head.\n\nBut not all were pulling for this R&B prodigy. Aside from winning three awards at the MOBO's in October, Craig David walked away empty handed at the 2000 Brit Awards in February 2001. He was up for six nominations, including Best British Male Solo Artist, Best British Newcomer, and Best British Single for \"7 Days,\" but industry politics fell into operation. Many mainstream stars came to David's defense, artists such as Elton John, U2, and Robbie Williams, professing their disgust for the ill recognition for David and his musical efforts in the past year. Death threats soon followed for the superstar in spring 2001 as he took the stage in a show in London. An anonymous caller claimed a soldier would injure David with tear gas and hand grenades. Still, his record sales continued to soar in the U.K. with sales of Born to Do It increasing over 100 percent after his dismal beginning months of 2001. He bombared American Shores with a deal with Atlantic and released Born to Do It stateside in summer 2001. Mainstream radio flocked to him immediately. Missy Elliott, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, and Usher called themselves fans.\n\nThe next year, things didn't simmer down for the now international pop star. Craig David returned with a sophomore effort Slicker Than Your Average in November 2002. This particular album saw a much grittier side from David. Debut single \"What's Your Flava?\" also became one of the year's hottest singles.\n\nIn 2005 he released his 3rd album \"The Story Goes...\", the first single of the album, \"All The Way\", returned him to the top three, and the second single, \"Don't Love You No More (I'm Sorry)\", tied with \"7 Days\" as his longest running single in the charts since \"Rewind\", spending 15 weeks inside the UK top 75. However, the album's third single, \"Unbelievable\", debuted and peaked at #18 in March 2006.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated with UK rapper Kano on his upcoming album London Town, for the single \"This is the Girl\". The track was released on August 27, 2007 and debuted at #18 on the UK charts.\n\nThe first single \"Hot Stuff\" from the album Trust Me, was released on November 5, 2007 . The single was a top ten hit, whilst the album charted at #18 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\"6 of 1 Thing\", the second single to be taken from Trust Me charted at thirty-nine on the UK Singles Chart, becoming his second lowest charting single to date.\n\nHis UK tour will start in June 2008, details of which can be found on the official website.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Beth ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8098043.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Punk, Hard Rock, Lounge, Post Punk, Rock, Electronic", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A band among bands.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "LP Giobbi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10388009.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Electro House, Disco, Dance Pop, House, Electro Pop", "Time": "5:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "LP Giobbi is rock \u2019n roll with a disco soul, born draped in sequins and cloaked in fog at a seance in the mountains of Oregon.\n\nShe was trained in jazz piano at UC Berkeley before becoming a synth warrior goddess in Los Angeles.

Widely labelled as one of Britain's greatest soul singers, Knight is best known for her hit singles \"Greatest Day\", \"Shoulda Woulda Coulda\" and \"Come As You Are\" and \"Get Up!\". After a decade in the industry, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Urban Music Awards in 2004.\n\nIn 2006 Knight starred in BBC1 music TV show, Just The Two Of Us, and is the host of the Radio 2 show Beverley's Gospel Nights, which explores the origins and impact of gospel music. Now in its second season, the show has featured interviews with stars such as Destiny's Child and Shirley Caesar.\n\nKnight is an ambassador for many charities such Christian Aid and has travelled to areas affected by disease and poverty to help raise awareness. She is an active campaigner for anti-Aids organisations such as the Stop AIDS Campaign and The Terrence Higgins Trust and is also a vocal campaigner against homophobic lyrics in urban music. She became an MBE in 2006, the only musician to be granted such an honour in the Queen's eightieth birthday honours list.\n\nIn February 2006 Knight consolidated her move into the mainstream audience by appearing on BBC1 music show, Just The Two of Us. The show, featuring celebrities who duet with established singers, ran for two weeks and proved to be a relative disappointment in terms of audience figures \u2013 averaging between fifteen and twenty-five percent audience shares.[17] Nevertheless it provided a platform for Knight to reach out to a bigger audience and demonstrate her talent by performing a different array of songs than she would otherwise be known for.

Take That - The Ultimate Tour 06, which ran from April to July 2006, sold 270,000 tickets in less than four hours on sale at the box office and featured Knight as a support act.[18]\n\nIn March 2006 Beverley released her fifth album, a compilation set featuring the majority of her top forty UK singles entitled Voice - The Best Of Beverley Knight.

It was preceded by the single \"Piece of my Heart\" \u2013 a cover of the Erma Franklin classic made famous by Janis Joplin and entered the singles chart at number sixteen, spending eleven weeks inside the UK top 75 singles chart and becoming her longest-running chart single to date.\n\nIn October 2006, Knight recorded her fifth studio album, Music City Soul, in Nashville. Completed in less than five days, the album was released on 7 May 2007 and features collaborations with musicians such as Ronnie Wood and Scotty Moore.

With both of his parents being preachers and his siblings all being vocalists, it's no surprise that he began singing at only five years old.\n\n\"Music has been instilled in me all of my life,\" he confesses. \"So essentially, I'm just embracing who I am. At first, his young position in a large family relegated him to supporting roles, usually that of a background tenor. However, he was met with adversity due to a speech impediment. \"I used to have a bad stuttering problem and because of that a lot of people would stay away from me in school,\" he admits. In fourth grade he tried out for a part in his school's rendition of Oliver Twist, but the director dismissed him, informing him that he wasn't fit for the production: if he couldn't speak clearly, how could he ever expect to sing?\n\nGuordan's mother, however, observed that her son's speech issues weren't present in his singing and came up with a plan: she would truly make him sing for his supper. Instead of speaking to her, all of his communication would have to be in melodic form. \"I would literally sing to my mother if I wanted to go to the store, or outside,\" Banks recalls.\n\n\"Whatever I had to say to her, I would sing to her. Through that, I began to build my confidence and learned to talk without a stutter. It also helped me become the songwriter I am today, because I don't ever really write anything down with a pen or a pad. I just sing it out and whatever comes out is what I use and adjust to keep.

Being 1 of very few DJs in England back then to get their 1st ever gig on the legendary Funktion One Sound Speaker System! And been 1 of the very 1st trance DJs to play at that venue!!\n\nSince then Ed has travelled to many places showcasing his DJing abilities, such as regular appearances at The Gallery @ Ministry Of Sound (Including playing The Main Room, 103 and The Baby Box), Trance Sanctuary @ The Egg, The Rhythm Factory, Frantic @ Koko, Trancelucid @ Club 414, Digital Impact @ Plan B, and Friendz and Submerged Boat Parties in London. Also performing in Birmingham at the Rainbow Warehouses for Godskitchen. Ed has made many appearances also in his favourite place in the world; Ibiza. Where he has performed at Judgement Fridays@Eden, Connect@Privilege, Es Paradis, Ultraviolet@Play2, Driftwood@Itaca, Tropi Trance Bar, Tropicana\u2019s, Akwa, @Night and Peppers 2.

He has also graced festivals such as Soundwave, Sub Audio and Sussexfest.\n\nEd runs the increasingly popular radio show called Adrenalin Sessions that airs on the World's Biggest Trance Radio Station; Afterhours.FM every 4th Saturday of the month. And will reach 100 episodes in August 2016.\n\nThe style of music Ed plays is a very energetic blend of Tech Trance and Hard Trance with a bit of Hard Techno thrown in for good measure! He also likes to incorporate plenty of Mashups and bootlegs into his sets. And the occasional scratch or 2! But on the odd occasion likes to play the \"softer\" side of trance if asked nicely!!\n\nProduction wise. Ed had his 1st original single out in the summer of 2014, appropiately titled \"Adrenalin\u201d, and a year later in 2015 with \u201cEpinephrine\u201d. Ed has also been making a name for himself producing mashups under the alias \u201cDirty chef\u201d. His 1st mashup of \u201cDK8 vs Underworld \u2013 Murder Was the Slippy Bass\u201d stormed the crowds he played to in the summer 2008 as well as causing chaos on the dance floor with \"Enjoy The Silence For The Weekend\" in 2012, \"Advanced Bastard\" in 2013,\u201cGenetic Ping Pong Animals\u201d and \u201cHybrid Spaceman\u201d in 2014 and \u201cZero Voodoo\u201d in 2015.

Their hard work has lead to a string of releases in the Top 100 beatport Trance chart, as well as a monthly residency at Ministry of Sound, and other solo run events in London, Ibiza and Holland. 3 Years later the brand is strong as ever\n\nWith now a decade of experience, Ed continues to wow the crowds with energetic interaction, wearing his Oakley Sunglasses (No matter how dark it is!) and general all out enthusiasm behind the decks! Combine that with Ed\u2019s lethally banging tunes and you\u2019re in for some powerful ride!!

With both of his parents being preachers and his siblings all being vocalists, it's no surprise that he began singing at only five years old.\n\n\"Music has been instilled in me all of my life,\" he confesses. \"So essentially, I'm just embracing who I am. At first, his young position in a large family relegated him to supporting roles, usually that of a background tenor. However, he was met with adversity due to a speech impediment. \"I used to have a bad stuttering problem and because of that a lot of people would stay away from me in school,\" he admits. In fourth grade he tried out for a part in his school's rendition of Oliver Twist, but the director dismissed him, informing him that he wasn't fit for the production: if he couldn't speak clearly, how could he ever expect to sing?\n\nGuordan's mother, however, observed that her son's speech issues weren't present in his singing and came up with a plan: she would truly make him sing for his supper. Instead of speaking to her, all of his communication would have to be in melodic form. \"I would literally sing to my mother if I wanted to go to the store, or outside,\" Banks recalls.\n\n\"Whatever I had to say to her, I would sing to her. Through that, I began to build my confidence and learned to talk without a stutter. It also helped me become the songwriter I am today, because I don't ever really write anything down with a pen or a pad. I just sing it out and whatever comes out is what I use and adjust to keep.

Derek Warfield is a distinguished name among them. Derek Warfield and They Young Wolfe Tones are bringing that musical tradition forward with a reverence for Ireland\u2019s past and the energy and optimism of a new generation of Irish musicians. \u201cWe\u2019re presenting an old tradition in a new package \u2013 and I\u2019ve the same passion for it now as I had when it all started 50 years ago!\u201d DEREK WARFIELD After spending nearly 40 years as founder/leader of the legendary Wolfe Tones (named after the 18th century Irish Revolutionary Theobald Wolfe Tone), Derek Warfield is revered as a singer, songwriter, historian and entertainer in all parts of the world where Irish roots have been put down. The Wolfe Tones enjoyed phenomenal success with 13 best-selling albums, 3 number one hits, many television appearances and shows in esteemed venues such as New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall and The Royal Albert Hall in London. Since breaking away from the Wolfe Tones in 2001, Derek\u2019s solo career has yielded 11 albums to date, the most successful of them being On the One Road, The Bonnie Blue Flag and Let Ye All be Irish Tonight. With the formation and ongoing success of The Young Wolfe Tones, the legend of Derek Warfield continues. LEGACY \u2013 THE YOUNG WOLFE TONES In 2001, after nearly 40 years performing, the legendary Wolfe Tones parted with their founder and leader \u2013 Derek Warfield. No other Irish folk group, before or since, told the story of Ireland so completely and unapologetically. But for Derek\u2019s hunger and desire to continue to further the story of Ireland through song, an ancient tradition might have lost perhaps its most iconic figure. In 2006 Derek put together a band containing some of the finest musicians and singers in Irish music \u2013 The Young Wolfe Tones. Damaris Woods - Banjo Damaris Woods from Co. Meath and is recognized as one of the foremost banjo players in Irish music. She has made a major contribution in popularizing the banjo within Irish traditional music. Damaris has performed an extremely hectic touring schedule over the last decade across the world. She has appeared on the Irish Spring Tour in Germany and been part of performing groups in North America, Australia and the prestigious Celtic Colours Festival in Cape Briton, Canada. Damaris has appearances on many radio and television shows including Ireland\u2019s The Late Late Show (RT\u00c9). Damaris is also a gifted music and many of her students have been prominent prizewinners in traditional music competitions over the last number of years. On an annual basis Damaris organizes the hugely popular traditional arts camp \u2013 The Ag Seinm Traditional Arts Camp in Co. Cavan, Ireland. Despite her own hectic schedule she still manages to find time to teach at the Joe Mooney Summer School in Drunshambo every year as well as The University of Ulster, Coleraine. Peadar Hickey \u2013 Guitar and Vocals Dublin\u2019s Peadar Hickey has been delivering the songs of Ireland\u2019s history to audiences at home and abroad for over a decade. A regular fixture on the Dublin city folk and traditional music circuit, Peadar learned his trade on stage at The Arlington Hotels, Oliver St John Gogarty\u2019s and The Temple Bar in Dublin\u2019s Cultural Quarter. In 2010, Peadar moved to New York City and now performs mainly on the Irish American circuit, teaming up with notable musicians such as Pio Ryan (banjo), Matt Mancuso (fiddle) and Vonnie Quinn (fiddle). On St Patrick\u2019s Day 2013, Peadar was invited to join All-Ireland winning accordion player Martin O\u2019Connell in a performance at the New York Mayor\u2019s residence \u2013 Gracie Mansion. Peadar is currently an instructor of guitar for traditional Irish accompaniment at the Irish Arts Center in Manhattan. Dan Lowery \u2013 Flute and Vocals Dan Lowery is one of the top Irish flute players in the United States today. Born in Milwaukee, raised in Dallas, and with ancestry from County Cork, Dan spent his youth travelling to Ireland learning traditional Irish music. A tour with Surreel, a band of up-and-coming American Irish musicians, prompted him to move to New York in 2002, where he has lived for the past ten years playing Irish music full-time. In demand as a flute and whistle player, and also as a guitarist, singer and teacher, he has appeared on stage and recordings with numerous musicians and bands, including Ivan Goff, Damien Connolly, Allison Barber, Johnny Cuomo, Ashley Davis, Darren Maloney, the Trinity Hall Session Players and Idle Road. Dan has been a member of Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones since 2010. Derek Warfield\u2019s 50 years of experience coupled with the talent and energy of The Young Wolfe Tones brings the old tradition of Irish balladry into a new age. The story of Ireland is transmitted in their music and song and illuminated by the outstanding musicianship of three wonderful ambassadors of a new generation of traditional players. Derek Warfield and The Young Wolfe Tones deliver Ireland\u2019s traditional music and folk songs with an energy and skill that shows the quality of contemporaries within that tradition. The patriotic spirit of Irish music carried through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s by the Wolfe Tones now marches on in the dynamic sound of The Young Wolfe Tones. SHOWS Irish festivals all over the United States have been host to Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones since 2007. Currently the band plays between 20 and 30 Irish festivals per year all over the country. In addition to musical performances, Derek also delivers lectures on Irish history and the history of the Irish in America. These lectures feature acoustic performances of ballads relevant to the subject matter. Perhaps most notably, the band performed at the great Milwaukee Irish Festival in 2011 - the biggest Irish festival in the world. Pat Byrne from Columbus Ohio, one of the organizing committee at the Dublin Irish Festival in Ohio, had this to say \u201cDerek has always set high standards for his performances and this band raises the bar. The people loved them and gave them an unbelievable rousing and appreciative reception. These Young Wolfe Tones and their legendary leader were given a standing ovation, The Dublin Ohio festival were delighted to have them \u2026 they\u2019re as good as it gets!\u201d Australia was the destination in April of 2011. The band played twelve concerts in two weeks with the highlight being four days performing at the National Folk Festival in Canberra. The same year saw the release of Far Away in Australia \u2013 a CD to coincide with their Australian visit. With 19 tracks the collection is a mixture of classic Irish songs music and literature that connect the two countries. Far Away In Australia fittingly highlights the Irish contributions to Australia in song and music. They perform regularly at the R\u00ed R\u00e1 Irish Pub at Mandalay Bay Casino, Las Vegas and are certainly regarded as a unique stalwart among Las Vegas\u2019 many musical acts. AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY AND CIVIL WARS Many of the Irish festivals around the United States every year also play host to lectures/musical performances on the songs of the Irish in the American Revolution and Civil War by Derek Warfield and The Young Wolfe Tones. Derek deals with ballads of regret, joy, victory and defeat and clearly illustrates Ireland's hand in defending the ideals that the United States was founded on. The lecture/show has been an eye-opener for many folk and history enthusiasts from Ireland and America alike. The response and feedback throughout the festival circuit here has been wonderful and has added such a wide and important aspect to the legacy of Derek Warfield and his part in the history of Irish balladry. It is a rich legacy that was almost entirely neglected before Derek began putting together Sons of Erin, Bonnie Blue Flag, Faugh-a-Ballagh and Washington's Irish \u2014 four albums dealing with the Irish of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. He has also written a book, The Irish Songster of the American Civil War. He comments: \u201cLooking at the tremendous quality of the songwriting among the Irish over generations in the States, as recorded in libraries and collections across the country, it\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that Ireland lost its greatest talent in those times, particularly in those who starved or emigrated during the Famine years.\u201d \u201cI hope it helps to keep alive the memory of the many Irishmen who fought on both sides,\u201d he says. Derek Warfield\u2019s lifelong passion for engaging people in the music and story of Ireland is also very present in the other band members: \u201cCommunication with a live audience through music is what I believed to be of primary importance when I founded the Wolfe Tones in 1963. In performing with The Young Wolfe Tones, I continue to communicate with audiences while also passing on an important tradition to a new generation. But perhaps most importantly, it has been fun and enjoyable and every performance gets better. The experience has reinvigorated me and given the young players and singers the opportunity to display their skills and talents around the world\u201d www.theyoungwolfetones.com www.facebook.com/theyoungwolfetones www.irishworldradio.com DISCOGRAPHY Legacy Faugh-a-Ballagh (Clear The Way) Bonnie Blue Flag Sons Of Erin Liberte 98 Sl\u00e1n Abhaile A Nation Once Again God Save Ireland Green White & Essential Gold Volume 2 (2 CD Set) Green White & Essential Gold Volume 1 (2 CD Set) The Night Is....Young On The One Road Far Away In Australia On The One Road Let Ye All Be Irish Tonight (Available from www.theyoungwolfetones.com) Fifty years on from his debut performance, Warfield is now delighted to present the Young Wolfe Tones.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Adam's Wedding ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7815446.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Pop & Mandolin, Folk Rock", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Die Reise von Adam\u2019s Wedding begann 2014 mit der Release der Living Room Session - EP.

Picking up an old guitar in a pawn shop along the way he found gigs from town to town playing his way across the states in the tradition of the delta Bluesmen before him.\n\nThen while stumbling home drunk one night along the main drag of Nashville, he came across a crowd. The crowd were surrounding an old man playing a one string guitar made from a broom handle and a box, while playing drums with his feet. In that moment Ben new he had found the inspiration he was looking for. But it wasn\u2019t until he made his way to New Orleans that he managed to get his hands on such an instrument. Walking down the backstreets of the french quarter he found his way into an old instrument shop selling a cigar box guitar. And he realised that he\u2019d discovered something special.\n\nWhen he finally got back to London along with the collection of songs he\u2019d written along the road, he recorded his first album \u2018Broken Man\u2019. With nothing more than the equipment he had to hand, he self released the album to critical acclaim. The Blues Magazine called him 'A unique musical identity\u2019; Blues Blast Magazine described his songs as being 'of bleak beauty' and Americana U.K. hailed his work as 'A new Blues\u2019.\n\nSince then he has never looked back, going on to tour internationally four times to date, and releasing a second album \u2018City of Streets\u2019, independently and to great success. A maverick in the true sense of the word his live shows are the stuff of legends. Not only is he an excellent guitar player and powerful vocalist, but an awesome drummer too, and he plays both guitar and drums at the same time in a stunning show as a \u2018one man band\u2019.", "otherInfo": "Ben Hemming will be performing live for an hour on Facebook in light of the current venue closures."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alex Behning ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10309986.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Blues, Folk, Country, Rock, Acoustic Blues", "Time": "6:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Alex Behning ist ein deutscher S\u00e4nger und Liedermacher und spielt Blues-Folk-Songs mit deutschen Texten.

But if she was wandering around America in 2019, what the hell would she say?\u201d wonders Siri Undlin of indie-folk band Humbird. Based in Minneapolis, Minnesota and inspired by the crystalline chill of the state\u2019s Northern winters, Undlin creates experimental folk and environmental Americana tinged with the sophistication of classic\norchestral compositions. Her upcoming album Pharmakon, out August 30, focuses on women and the female body in folklore as a poetic way to explore the human experience. Working with engineer Brian Joseph (Bon Iver, Sufjan Stevens) and producer Shane Leonard (Field Report), Undlin\u2019s newest release joins the leagues of masterful indie storytellers.\n\nGrowing up the child of a Lutheran preacher and a trial lawyer, Undlin witnessed the power of stories in her childhood home and began writing music and performing in her church choir from a young age. Her voice, which contains the unwavering fortitude of hymnal melodies, reveals her traditional background. Paired with Undlin\u2019s knack for eccentric musical arrangements and unpredictable, fresh modes of storytelling, Pharmakon bounces between two worlds, never lingering in one for long.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that this dynamic, oscillating motion inspired the creation of Undlin\u2019s upcoming release. \u201cWhen I was writing these songs, I was moving between extremes and trying to look at things differently,\u201d says Undlin. \u201cI was exploring the black and the white and then the gray.\u201d The word \u201cpharmakon,\u201d defined by Plato, is the concept that something can either be the poison or the cure, depending on how much one consumes. \u201cI love that idea, of the two polarizing sides of something that could either be the answer or kill you,\u201d says Undlin. \u201cAnd I think the concept is suited to the album. It was written over an intense period of a couple of years,\nwhere I was redefining my own power in music.\u201d Dotted by highs and lows, this period of time didn\u2019t always feel victorious. However, the final product is a resolute album that brings attention to the universality of women\u2019s experiences throughout time. Inspired by myths and stories such as the legend of Persephone, a modern retelling of Eve\u2019s ancient dilemma, and Angela Carter\u2019s heroine-themed fairytales, Undlin crosses centuries and cultures. \u201cThe track \u2018Wolf Alice\u2019 is inspired by Carter\u2019s version of the fairytale of the same name, which became a vehicle to talk about the attempted \u2018civilizing\u2019 of women\u2019s bodies as an oppressive force throughout human history,\u201d says Undlin. \u201cOn \u2018Eve Boards A Train,\u2019 I imagined Eve getting kicked out of the Garden of Eden and into America\nin 2019. In this story, Eve has boarded a train and is writing a letter to someone .\u201d Just as the characters in these tales didn\u2019t always know which turns they were going to take, Undlin is coming to enjoy the mystery of the creative process. \u201cThere\u2019s this myth that comes with being an artist that there\u2019s gonna be this one defining moment of success where everything suddenly makes sense,\u201d says Undlin. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s actually a crock of shit.\u201d Though she admits that the process of creating a brave album can be fraught with pain and disappointments, Undlin\u2019s upcoming release is nothing short of triumphant. Along with the heroines of the fairytales that inspire her, Undlin is fearlessly blazing ahead, no matter where the winding forest path might take her.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Suns of Arqa ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8666506.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "World Music", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Pioneers of World Beat, Ambient, Electro-Dub, inspired by indigenous, tribal & classical folk traditions since 1979. sunsofarqa@hotmail.co.uk", "otherInfo": "Exclusive preview of \"The Wolf of Badneoch\" album which is due in June, accompanied by visuals for the full album!

The Los Angeles based troubadour uncovers an era-spanning style of his own at the crossroads of traditional folk songcraft, impressive guitarwork, bluesy gusto, and 21st century pop adventurousness. The singer and songwriter sifts through a lifetime of influences in order to assemble a vibrant, vivid, and vital vision.\n\nThis poignant, passionate, and personal style resounds throughout his 2018 EP.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixture of popular music that I respect and the classics I grew up on, because they will always be a part of who I am,\u201d he explains. \u201cI started out by making a lot of Americana folk rock, but I really wanted to explore new sounds. For the first time, the new music reflects everything\u2014from what inspired me to be a musician and a guitar player in the first place such as Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Jackson Browne to artists I\u2019ve just discovered in recent years like Ed Sheeran. There are those songwriter elements as well as the modern nuances. I feel as if I\u2019m moving with a new generation.\u201d\n\nSince his emergence in 2015, he has quietly set the stage for such an evolution. At 19-years-old, Corey dropped out of college in Eugene, Oregon, grabbed his guitar, and relocated to an eternal haven for creatives of all kinds: Venice Beach, CA.\n\nJust blocks away from the Pacific Ocean, he spearhead the genesis of an arts collective and hangout known as Winston House. After reposting clips of Corey on guitar, Cody Simpson tapped him to handle six-string duties on a national tour. Meanwhile, Justin Bieber caught a Winston House performance and invited Corey to open up a run of Pacific Northwest dates on the sold-out Purpose Tour in 2016.\n\nTeaming up with producer Andrew Wells [Meghan Trainor, Jason MrAZ, Bebe Rexha, etc.], he unveiled the On The Run EP following his appearance on the historic tour. Its title track racked up 7 million-plus streams as he garnered widespread acclaim from Rolling Stone, Billboard, American Songwriter, Teen Vogue, Baeble Music, and more. Along the way, he toured with the likes of Niall Horan, Noah Kahan, and more.\n\nIn early 2018, he relocated to a studio in Topanga, CA. Exploring new sonic territory, he started amassing an arsenal of guitar pedals to \u201ccome up with new riffs and sounds\u201d and channel \u201cwhat the past year looked and sounded like into a six-song EP.\u201d\n\nNow, Corey introduces that EP by way of the single \u201cWild Nights.\u201d It juxtaposes a cinematic piano-driven soundscape with bluesy guitar and handclaps before culminating on a slick, soulful, and soaring confession, \u201cI\u2019ll give up all the wild times, jump into the wild fires, just to have one more wild night with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about knowing that you\u2019re so in love with someone and satisfied that you\u2019d never want anybody else,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you were ever separated from this person, you\u2019d give up everything just for one more memorable night together. You\u2019d sacrifice everything.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on the EP, \u201cDried Blood\u201d stretches from stark and stripped verses into a powerhouse chant. Meanwhile, \u201cCloser\u201d pairs a steady and strong beat with plaintive acoustic guitar and another hard-hitting hook, \u201cI just want you closer, closer than my demons.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Corey emerges with a striking signature sound that immediately connects.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to inspire others to have a voice of their own and be themselves,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cMusic did that for me.

The pair kicked off the label in 2000 with \u2018Anjunabeats Volume 1\u2019, a massive club success which instantly ear-pricked the likes of Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold and Paul van Dyk. The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label. It provided the perfect outlet for their numerous production projects \u2013 Oceanlab, Aalto, Freestate, Nitromethane, POS, Rollerball and Tranquillity Base \u2013 and every release was warmly received by elite DJ\u2019s and club-goers across the globe.\n\nIn late 2002 James Grant joined the Anjunabeats management team and the label began to expand its output, signing a series of fresh artists.

In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON).

He has performed his radio hit \u2018U People\u2019 with the late great Ian Dury\u2019s legendary \u2018Blockheads\u2019 and has recorded the song with award winning saxophonist Gilad Atzmon. Over the last 5 years Ben has enjoyed successful tours in Europe, receiving rave reviews and attracting a growing fan base . His band includes amongst the finest musicians in Ireland, his brother in law Michael Black on Drums, Ronnie O\u2019Flynn on bass and Mick McCarney on guitar. With this line up they have built up a loyal underground following. Ben is often described as an \u2018artist lying beneath the radar for way too long\u2019. In 2011 Ben played showcase gigs in Nashville & Memphis (Folk Alliance) where he colloborated with some of Nashville's finest, David Olney, Sergio Webb & Irene Kelley to name a few.

Rainy Nights nails down the pang of loneliness that emigrants feel when they are far from home and someone says something that just triggers regret. The easy, soulful melody and performance underlines the impact, with Reel\u2019s singing striking just the right note. It is the high point of the album. Though Feel Alive , the title track and the gospel of Old Bog Road come close. The Armagh singer-songwriter comes across as a honest man determined to use his love of music to best effect, and he is lucky in having a band, particularly guitarist Mick McCarney, full of expression and no little skill. www.benreel.com Download tracks: Rainy Nights, Time to Get Real http://dvdfever.co.uk/reviews/erbenreel.shtml Elly Roberts reviews The Ben Reel Band: Time To Get Real Another little gem from the Emerald Isle. Rating: 8/10 Irishman Ben Reel has consistently released solid albums over the past 10 years. My last CD encounter was 2007\u2019s fabulous New Horizon. Now on his fifth album, Time To Get Real, keeps that tradition well and truly alive with a dazzling collection of Americana crossover songs that ought to have ears pricking at all the \u2018real music\u2019 stations. Reel has a penchant for ignoring fads and trends keeping the focus on real music which is why he\u2019s become a cult artist in his native Ireland, though sadly he hasn\u2019t been picked up as genuine singer-songwriter in the UK. Everybody in the business knows he\u2019s hot stuff having supported Jools Holland, Alabama 3, The Cranberries and stage star Michael Ball no less. The good news is he doing rather well in Holland, Belgium and Germany. As an introduction to the album he\u2019s released Feel Alive as a single. The down and dirty groove has some sublime guitar licks carried by a great melody and his rough edged vocals. ________________________________________ This box of delights opens with a gentle country shuffle in the form of Rainy Night as the band moves with confidence and swagger, again with Reel dropping in some superb guitar breaks and a fine line in vocal gymnastics including falsetto along with a Neil Young-like harmonica swish. The introduction of songbird Julieanne Reek on the deliciously tender love ballad Summers Always Here only adds to the romantic mood. With a troubled heart he gushes with lyrics like \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re like the warm summer sun that\u2019s rising / Feel your warm love in my heart / Melting away the cold ice of winter / The storms have passed / There\u2019s a new life on the way.\u201d Embracing an eclectic mindset, Keep On Drivin\u2019 takes on a C.C.Rider rockabilly hue drenched in honeyed vocals, stylish pedal steel, thumping basslines and wah wah, whereas Time Slips Away is deeply reflective, yearning for his childhood days and the onset of wisdom now he\u2019s turned 35. A heavy funky bass, rolling organ, and acoustic chords make Who You Are the albums catchiest song, with the main hook coming in the chorus. For Old And Wise Reel delves deep into a more traditional Irish template which brings forward his wishes not to die a typical rock\u2019n\u2019roll death \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t wanna overdose like a rockin-roll star /Or choke on my vomit after whiskey in the jar.\u201d By far the best song on the album, closes it \u2013 the stripped back dusty-bowl ballad Old Bog Road. Reverbed harmonica leads to gentle acoustic picks, chords slabs and wailing solos, on what is essentially a mournful ballad. The verdict \u2013 Quality album. http://www.billybop.be/admin/CDdetail.asp?ID=8717 Ben Reel : Time To Get Real \u2013 CD, BRBCDA-007;B Reel Records Album Kindly Submitted by G-Promotions Style : Americana Rate (1-5) : Ben Reel is the latest addition to a series of Americana artists emerging from Ireland! Against the backdrop of the troubles in Northern Ireland, Ben first picked up his guitar when he was 15 years old inspired by greats like Bruce Springsteen or Neil Young. Today this inspirations are still to be found in his passionate music! Leading track \u201cRainy Night\u201d is one of those tunes that you start to whistle along without ever having it heard before! Country and Americana are the main genres on this album but this doesn\u2019t mean the album is limited to it. On \u201cFeel Alive\u201d Ben comes with some enjoyable soul influences while \u201cKeep on drivin\u2019\u201d throws in a lot of country as does \u201cLooking for a Lost Horizon\u201d. \u201cOld & Wise\u201d throws in some old styles and mix folk influences into this Americana tune. On \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d the title track of this album, Ben Reel, returns to his old habits and creates a song that could be from the hand of \u201cThe Boss\u201d. Closing down the album is \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d that opens with a beautiful haunting blues harp. The haunting keeps going on, both with his voice and slide guitar! As an extra, hidden track we can hear a nice rockabilly kind of version (Live) of Keep on Drivin\u2019 in a mix with the classic \u201cTrain Train\u201d Time To Get Real is already the fifth album for Ben Reel and in the past two years he has successfully toured Holland, Belgium and Germany steady working on a growing fan base. Back you\u2019ll can find him as supporting act for bands like the Cranberries, Alabama 3 or Jools Holland. The album is a true Americana effort and comes with handful of interesting tunes that makes me feel that this artist need to be in the spotlight a little more. Mr Blue Boogie http://www.getreadytorock.com/reviews2009/ben_reel.htm BEN REEL Time To Get Real (2009) Play this new Ben Reel CD to any music aficionado, and ask them where it was recorded. Nine out of ten would say Nashville. Guaranteed. Now, Ben Reel may not be a household name (yet), but let's assume for a moment his work is unfamiliar to you. OK, what genre music would you say Time To Get Real was? No problem - southern, country blues rock. And name any influences you can hear at play? Again, no problem - Neil Young is an obvious one, but also Springsteen and perhaps Chris Isaak and even a little Clapton circa 361 Ocean Boulevard. So, nationality? No brainer - a man from the deep south of the US of A. Wrong on all accounts, because Time To Get Real is the 5th album in 10 years from Irish guitarist and singer songwriter Ben Reel. And naturally it was recorded in Monaghan in the north of the emerald isle. In reviewing Ben's last album New Horizon (2007) - which had an altogether more 'west coast' feel - we pondered on image, and what might make Ben stand out from the likes of Marc Cohn. It may be that with Time to Get Real, and diving deep into Americana, Ben has found his niche. Beautifully played and recorded it's bound to strike a chord with the market that's fuelling the resurgence of Neil Young, and Springsteen's exploration of the American psyche. But the challenge is still to get his music across the pond. It's not easy to crack America - many have tried and failed, but the rootsy warmth of the songs, the soulful singing and classy playing (some wonderful blues guitar and harmonica work) would undoubtedly be lapped up with a little exposure. So remember the name - Ben Reel - a real class act. *** Review by Pete Whalley http://www.lonesomehighway.com/pdf/online-issue-7.pdf Ben Reel Time To Get Real B. Reel Northern Ireland native Ben Reel has delivered a roots album that is full of strong songs and good playing. There\u2019s some solid keyboard playing, a rhythm section that drives things along and some very tasty guitar from Mick McCarney. Reel\u2019s voice is accompanied by welcome backing vocals that help to portray the mood of the songs. Rainy Night sets the tone for time and place, a song that looks at what has been missed by moving away from your home town. Other topics are ageing, freedom, the nature of searching and of truth. Mature songs for a mature audience that\u2019s given a melodic and malleable musical base that could just as easily have come from the States as from Northern Ireland. Reel no doubt has taken from those who have also come from the North, such as the undeniable influence of Van Morrison as a beacon of musical innovation. Reel does not have Morrison\u2019s track record, but this is an album that shows all the signs of a true talent making his own way. It\u2019s time to get serious is the signal Ben Reel gives with the release of his latest cd \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d. Wasn\u2019t he before? Haven\u2019t got a clue because for me Ben Reel is a complete stranger. He is (northern) Irish and has been working at his craft for quite some time. \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d sure is a good way to get to know him and the cd is full of piercing impulses. Delicate songs, strongly carried by the accompanying musicians, but by no tarnishing ben\u2019s Vocals. (His vocals show comparisons to Rod MacDonald and John Stewart). I hope that I grow old and wise suggests that Ben has come to an age where he starts realising his own mortality, what undoubtedly determines the profundity you find again in his lyrics. With what I don\u2019t want to affect his compositions. As I said before, I only know Reels past from what I read in his biography, But \u201cTime to get Reel\u201d indeed looks like the start of a new development, a new awakening. No trace of a personal crisis. My guts tell me Ben Reel has defined he wants to make a good product. One he will be remembered by. The closing song \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d tells of a permanent goodbye Ben Reel manages to create a excellent variation of styles, and within a limited nr of spins I still a real positive feeling about Ben Reel. Serious, skilful. driven \u2026. (after the official songs there is a hidden track, a live song, where you hear the presence of a modern day Elvis. Not renewed, but very entertaining. www.rootstime.be /Rein van den Berg Oct 09 The Irish hearts are often rather melancholic. Maybe the beautiful sceneries see to a tendensy of warmth and retirement. It characterizes at any rate the dark songs of Ben Reel, which the cover of the newest album, time to get real, suggest. Eleven songs written by reel himself and richly arranged with violin, piano, appropriate guitar lines and a choice of extra additioned instruments. With this the Irish know how to display a large scale of spheres and feelings, carying names as Neil Young and sometimes Bob Dylan. Indeed in rags, because Ben Reel is a slippery costumer. Ben\u2019s first album, \u201cthis is the movie\u201d, came out in Ireland in 1999, after this the EP \u00ebxorcise me\u201d(2000) only with 3 tracks, which seemed to be forerunner for his second album \u201cLost in Haze\u201d (2001). After that came Sweet Victory (2004), U People (2006) and New Horizon (2007). We don\u2019t have to complain about man\u2019s releases and qualities: guitarplayer Ben Reel, born in silverbridge but now living in Castlebalyney, is a supreme storyteller; has a pleasant voice, writes, beside that, upperclass songs and has also the quality to gather very able musicians around him. At his new album Ben Reel is accompanied again by a fine equilibiated band: Ronnie, Michael. Mickey, John, Colin. And now we are calling names: the recordings were done in the Attic studios with producer Ronan who also has a vocal contribution in the last two songs. In the quite openers Rainy Summers etc. we hear Reel\u2019s wife Julieanne who takes the change of the singing second. Anyway, in their natural but yet larger soundscape is more than enough space for improvisation and variety, which we can hear clearly on their new album. What Ben has settled with this successor is impressing. In 11 songs the band knows to create an oppressing atmosphere, which gets enlightened only now and then. Rasping and grating, then again with deceptive lovely acoustic guitars, then with thin guitarsounds and spacious violin, the listener is taking to a voyage through the Deep South of the mind, which only can turn out bad. It is oppressing, dark, stirring and especially very beautiful. Roots, pop and folk are going hand in hand with now and then an experimental strain. The point is that Ben Reel makes magnificent music. Music that mixes influences from alt-country with the atmospheric and darkness the music from Ireland so often charcterizes. Music that attracts attention by the variety and the highstanding music, because they really can play. Ben Reel searches, with his new album, joining with the greatness of the alt-country, but takes here at the same time surrender. Time to get real is just a good patterncard of the ability of the Ben Reel Band. Everything sounds beautiful, clear and especially respectable. The sharp ends are removed expertly and almost everything is produced in a way that it has to be specially accessed for the singersongwriter radiosize.

There's lots to inspire and Ben Reel has absorbed those influences and let them inform his particular style of travelling blues. \"Time To Get Real\" isn't a classic troubadour album, but it is deep hearted blues packed with characters, places and just a wee bit of drinking. The songs are strong through out, all could standalone without being thought of as filler. Time to step up from being a solid support to being the headliner. BELGUIM http://www.ctrlaltcountry.be/Pagina1.htm#BenReel BEN REEL \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d (Ben Reel) (3,5****) Ireland has long been enjoying a good reputation, where the singer-songwriters are concerned. And with Ben Reel has another one to be proud of. With \"Time To Get Real\" the man has just delivered his fifth album in ten years time, and that is a very beautiful album. Reel is gifted with a warm, a little soulful vocal style, shows himself a truly excellent song smith and professional manner together in genres like rock, pop, folk, Americana and blues into his songs. He calls himself Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young as inspiration, but there really is not much sign of that. Reel sounds like a particularly original. Someone with a vision of his own writing and placing songs. Someone with an own sound. And it would absolutely not surprise us if he behave the songs on \"Time To Get Real\" soon break on larger scale. He fully deserves it already! Songs like it a little reminiscent of Neil Young \"Rainy Night\", the beautifully subdued piano and harmonica work on-going rootspopdeuntje \"Summer's Always Here\", the soulful rockin 'Feel Alive', the bluesy bounce \"Keep On Drivin '\", the summer, somewhere between pop, folk and country resident \"Old & Wise\" is simply magnificent.

And De Sport in Geel On Monday 9th http://www.ilpopolodelblues.com/rev/novembre09/recensione/ben-reel.html Ben Reel is part of the wide array of successful songwriters born and raised in Ireland. More precisely, the North and administratively part of the English crown. Yet in his music are heard echoes of Neil Young or Bruce Springsteen rather than those of the island's musical tradition.

(SWA) REAL ROOTS CAF\u00c9 Netherlands Dutch to English translation Very recently came from Time to get real, the fifth full-time CD of Irish singer-songwriter Ben Reel. For me a great unknown, but already 20 years active in music since he was a teenager in 1989 founded his first band, \"Trim the Velvet '. After the breakup of this band eight years later, Ben's solo tour in 1999 and came from his solo CD's available. With five number one so he just scored an average of two years each. Ben's music is best described as Irish mid-tempo alt-country, the songs are nice sound and treat a number of pressing issues for Ben. He describes one part of his life and Rainy Night Time just slips away, do proclaim his feelings, especially love, respect, in four songs and shares his thoughts with us and future expectations in another four songs. He concludes (No. 11 is) a kind of summary of this in Old Bog Road: Seasons change as people come and go, life and death is the endless flow. Want to find the answers, because the story to be told, is not gonna quit the mining for gold. Want to find a reason before I go. Before they take my body, down that old bog road. Heavy thoughts for a guy who has several years of the 40 removed. But we are not all looking for the deeper meaning of life? Incidentally, after more than six minutes of the final number is still nearly six minutes a lasting valve closure, which Ben totally in style and tempo rocking (leading to a sodden organ) announces yet another time by a wish to: (I 'll) keep on driving, a live concert recording and a perfect valve. Always funny, some unexpected hidden track. Ben's band was great response and are in addition to Ben's acoustic guitar (and occasional harmonica) bass, drums and electric guitar. A few songs do keyboards and violin along. Ben has a somewhat gritty but pleasant voice. His wife Julianne sings along to eight songs, four songs is half Bloch (e, you never know with those Irish first names) to hear. I think it's a good CD, especially through the expressiveness of the songs both lyrically and in terms of melody (Fred Schmale) Put simply and aptly, New Horizon is all killer, no filler! Rarely have I heard an album so complete and so fully realised. From the brilliance of the playing and arranging to the magnificence of Reel's voice, this is heaven all the way. A superb album by an artist good enough to hold his own in rock\u2019s premiere league. Andrew Hobbs, Hi Fi + magazine When it comes to making classy albums, Ben Reel's your man. Year on year, Reel's songwriting is growing in stature in every department, yet he still doesn't get the wide spread recognition he richly deserves it's one of the strongest albums this year. This CD isn't just music: it's art. AllGigs.co.uk review of New Horizon, 8th October 2007 Ben Reel, a native of South Armagh, has in the words of one journalist \u2018operated under the media\u2019s radar for far too long\u2019. On the evidence of this release, his fourth album, I would have to agree. The songs and the playing are really impressive, an earthy mix of rock, roots and blues, all mixed lovingly together with soulful vocals. His song writing shows maturity and progression which comes through with repeated plays. Featuring some great slide guitar from Micky McCarney and terrific vocals from Kelie Redmond, \u201cHell In Ur Own Head\u201d is a standout, closely followed by the semi spoken \u201cWhen Will Be Ever Be Free\u201d. \u201cFor U And I\u201d shows the band at their best with a lovely rock/soul groove that you wish would go on longer. All in all this is an impressive album from a major talent who needs further investigation.

He spent six years performing in the hardcore circuit and released an independent album with a huge fan following before moving to Philadelphia, PA.\n\nSoon after arriving in the city of Brotherly Love, he co-founded the Philadelphia-based rock band Octane (2000-2005). Still considered to this day as one of the most successful bands to come out of Philly, Octane sold more than 20,000 copies of their independent debut release and enjoyed more than 1000 spins of the single \u201cI For One\u201d on Philadelphia rock station 94.1 WYSP.\n\nDuring this time, Quinn was named \u201cBest Guitarist\u201d in the Philadelphia region by the Philadelphia Music Awards in 2001 and 2004 and was routinely praised by fans and critics alike for his signature guitar technique, especially on slide guitar, and dynamic on stage presence.\n\nAfter enjoying five successful years with Octane, Quinn left the band to found a blues-based hard rock band that would later become known as Fosterchild. This project would quickly gain national attention and the band was signed to the SMG/ILG/WARNER record label from 2007-2010. After touring the country numerous times with Fosterchild, the band culminated its journey with a special invitation to perform for the U.S. troops stationed at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, where the group performed in front of thousands of soldiers.\n\nToday, Quinn is lead guitarist for multi-platinum selling, Seattle, WA based rock band, CANDLEBOX. The band has finished it's sixth studio effort and was released on April 22nd, 2016.

In his own way he goes about singing songs from all over the spectrum with an ease that is only fitting of one who is many years older and a prowess on guitar that is singular in its ability to stand alone without accompaniment. Its a wonderful mystery to behold how the essence of any song can be captured so simply by one voice and a guitar, but he does it with originality, taste and an unexpected power for someone who isn\u2019t really on the radar to the wider music community. And it is with a resigned sense of purpose that this 29 year-old Canadian continues to write, interpret and perform music in often the humblest of capacities. This is his path. And he must follow it to the end.\n\n\n\n\u201cI always say \u2018you must inspire yourself, find your path, be true to it and follow it to the end\u2019 because that\u2019s really all that needs to be done in this life. If you can do that then there is nothing to worry about. Whatever your path may be, it will always teach you everything else you need to know about life on the way. For me there is a feeling of obligation to music because it is so clearly the best thing I can offer to the world, but I often fight it in favour of other things only to eventually realize I\u2019m not honouring my true path. So it becomes a balance between seemingly opposing forces that in the end put me right where I need to be.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe opposing force he is referring to is his commitment to a contemplative life of meditation practice. A life traditionally aided by long hours of silence and rigid structure; not a life typically lived by a working musician. After several years of torn aspiration between the life of a Buddhist monk and pursuing a serious music career as a singer/songwriter, Corey is settling somewhat into a situation he feels best serves both of these energies. He feels by maintaining a low-key, almost anonymous attitude to his live performances and online presence he can still allow room to teach guitar (another precious pastime) and spend a few hours alone each day in silent meditation.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the most part I play gigs around here in Southern Ontario. Usually just really ordinary pubs, cafes and restaurants to people who may or may not be listening all that intently but I can show up, play my heart out and leave without having to worry too much about selling tickets, or CD\u2019s and merchandise, trying to make something happen or grow my brand or whatever. I can play covers the way I want, maybe play some originals if I feel like it, work out the kinks of my delivery and be spontaneous. I often don\u2019t even say who I am. Sometimes I don\u2019t really say anything at all. Which is exactly how I go about making my videos as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nOver the years, a devoted worldwide following has sprang up through his YouTube channel where he posts performances of popular and not-so-popular cover songs as well as his own material which has helped define his purpose with music. He plays many kinds of songs without pandering to any one listening demographic and often without much of anything in the way of effects or editing. Just 20 years of craftsmanship and passion on display. The response is overwhelmingly positive as viewers experience the consistent quality and creativity of each performance. Whether its the music of musical heroes or his original songs, its difficult not to be impressed by the standard at which he sets each time he plays.\n\n\n\n\u201cPutting up videos on YouTube has been such a wonderful way for me to exercise my musical freedom and play all the songs I love \u2014 from artists I admire \u2014 and challenge myself to grow as a musician publicly. It allows me to connect with people from all over the world and reminds me why its important for me to do what I\u2019m doing, because they appreciate it. I earn very little money from this medium but its been a constant motivator and mirror for me to reflect and improve which makes it such a valuable aspect of what I do. I really neglected it while I was away travelling recently, which was necessary because I was busy gigging, busking and trying to make ends meet but now that I\u2019m back home with my recording gear I\u2019m looking forward to making videos more consistently.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter spending 18 months in Australia and California doing performances mostly on the street as well as in \u201cordinary pubs and restaurants\u201d half a world away, Corey has returned to Canada and settled in Kitchener, Ontario where he performs regularly, teaches students and still finds time for silence and meditation. Always following his path.

prolific Brill building pop Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and \u2013 fingers crossed - Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music - and give them an experience that they will never forget.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Every Friday I will transport my viewers into the past where they will feel as thought they are sitting behind the recording console at Motown's Hitsville recording studio.

The original members were Stephan Jenkins (singer, songwriter, electric guitar), Kevin Cadogan (guitar), Adrian Burley (drums), and Jason Slater (bass guitar). The band's original line-up changed several times before the release of the group's debut album, and again shortly after the release of the band's second album Blue \u2014 at which point the band's main guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released from the band under circumstances that still elicit controversy among fans. Third Eye Blind's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, electric guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums), and Tony Fredianelli (electric guitar). More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. Leo Kremer has been filling in for Salazar during concerts, but it is not yet known if he will become a full-time member. For a time the band also featured ex-Smash Mouth drummer Michael Urbano and early Primus drummer Tim ''Curveball'' Wright.\n\nThird Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis, prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing Liam Gallagher to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins' outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of \"the biggest mouth in music\" by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox Twenty.\n\nA fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, is scheduled for a winter 2008 release. Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor. Only Jenkins' lyrics and vocals are left to be finished; all instrumental work is reportedly complete. Recent live performances have revealed a majority of the new tracks being worked on, including \"Don't Believe a Word,\" \"Lay Back (and the Water Will Hold You),\" \"In the Skin,\" \"Summer Town,\" \"Second Born,\" \"(You Really) Don't Like Me Now\" aka \"Campfire,\" \"Monotov's Private Opera,\" \"Break Me,\" \"Stevie Ray Vaughan,\" \"Red Star,\" and \"Standing Up For You.\" Other tracks mentioned for the album by Fredianelli are \"Away,\" \"A Sharp Knife,\" \"Captain of Emo,\" \"Swimming,\" and \"Jesse 2k.\" He also confirmed that \"Lay Back\" was scrapped. A number of previously unreleased recordings were made available, including \"Persephone,\" \"Carnival Barker\" (an instrumental), and numerous instrumental sessions declined by Jenkins for inclusion on the fourth album.", "otherInfo": "Please note the exact film start time is 6:11PM ET."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jessica Pearson and the East Wind ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10159248.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Folk, Country, Celtic, Canadiana, Americana, Bluegrass", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jessica Pearson is a Canadian born storyteller with a voice like melting honey on a summers eve.

Over ten years and seven long players into their career, White Denim are still in the relentless pursuit of a thread- in other words, a wick.\n\nThe band have carefully studied the greatest records ever made, but they write songs just dumb enough to drink, dance, and fight to. Theirs is a music that aims for the whole body, while equally satisfying the mind. While it has morphed, expanded, and even burst apart, White Denim\u2019s sincere and human drive and ability to spark exhilaration have been unerring constants of the band\u2019s existence. Now, two years on from their comeback album supreme 'Stiff,' singer-guitarist Petralli and bassist Steve Terebecki have changed tack again for their seventh full-length, 'Performance.' A new studio, new collaborators, and new techniques for writing and recording influenced the elastic possibility and liberation felt throughout.\n\nIf the album\u2019s title seems meaningful in its deadpan simplicity, it is. There is, of course, the meaning of \u201cperformance\u201d that applies to anyone for whom the live arena is the proving ground. There\u2019s also something more personal but universally acknowledged \u2013 the gap that exists between what we project and who we really are. \u201cThere is something absurd and isolating in continuing this pursuit for personal connection on such a wide scale. When writing an album I essentially leave my actual life, retreat deeper into myself and as it nears completion, I evaluate my work based on my own extremely skewed notion of what is widely relatable and still legitimately cool,\u201d says Petralli. \u201cMy idea of cool is most significantly shaped by Steve\u2019s body language when we are talking through ideas in session.\u201d It has been said that \u201cA clown enriched knows neither relation nor friend.\u201d\n\n'Performance' was mainly recorded over eight weeks at the band\u2019s new downtown Austin studio, Radio Milk. Once an old general store constructed in 1902, it is now respectfully restored and sandwiched in between bars and modern condominiums. Two new players were key in what Petralli describes as \u201ca super-collaborative record:\u201d keyboardist Michael Hunter, a \u201cyoung, humble genius with endless potential\u201d and Conrad Choucroun, a \u201cridiculously solid\u201d drummer with a long stint with NRBQ on his resume. \"If you take nothing else from this at least take some time to listen to NRBQ, rock & roll scholars who shared members with the Sun Ra Arkestra\" advises Petralli. It makes sense that White Denim would develop a kinship with a player from their circle. In many ways, they are a continuation of that sort of group. One that will never stop pushing and taking every opportunity to shine a light on and exemplify what is truly good about Rock & Roll music.\n\nCategorically speaking, White Denim is still impossible to narrowly pin down. There\u2019s the glam-rock strut of \u201cMagazin\u201d and \u201cIt Might Get Dark,\u201d the dueling guitars on the low-slung blues prog of \u201cMoves On\u201d, and the sideways jazz of \u201cSky Beaming.\u201d There are plenty of pleasingly unexpected musical moments on the title track and the easy-rolling closer \u201cGood News,\u201d along with some seriously distorted guitar. In the title track, Petralli sings, \u201cFlashing light in a tunnel, You\u2019re indicating a change.\u201d In many ways, White Denim is the flashing light in a dark and crowded tunnel of showbiz glop.

In the true spirit of punk rock we view the band and the audience as one in the same; in other words our stage and our microphone are yours.\n\nIn addition to hopefully bringing people together for a good time, we hope to share some of our experiences and beliefs in working class solidarity, friendship, loyalty and self- improvement as a means to bettering society (i.e. You can preach till you\u2019re blue in the face but if you\u2019re lying in the gutter no one\u2019s gonna listen.

However, within three months of moving to the big city, Theresa\u2019s father and best friend passed away.\n\n\u201cIt was a very confusing time for me,\u201d recalls Theresa. \u201cI was very insecure. I had all these dreams, but they seemed so far out of reach.\u201d\n\nTheresa re-focused her music career to work behind the scenes, taking intern roles at Jive Records and with Sheryl Crow\u2019s management company, W Management. Later, she landed in the advertising world as a music producer for commercials. But, last year, Theresa decided to once again chase her girlhood dreams, and reignited her career as an artist.\n\nNow living in Queens, Theresa has come a long way since \u2018Love is Like Bubblegum.\u201d Her 2019 debut single, \u201cThings About to Change\u201d reached over 40 thousand streams in its first month on Spotify. Then, in November of 2019, she released her highly acclaimed follow-up single, \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Another Day.\n\nTaking cues from the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, Theresa draws influence from artists like Blondie, Madonna, Duran Duran, Mariah Carey and Lady Gaga.\n\n\u201cI wanted to BE Madonna when I was younger,\u201d admits Theresa. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t about her sex appeal. I just loved her style and her story. I loved seeing what she was going to do next. And I loved that she did it ALL. She wrote, she sang, she acted. And she still does it on her terms.\u201d\n\n2020 promises to bring big things for Theresa, including her newest single, \u201cLet Go.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet Go,\u201d which finds Theresa channeling her insecurities, is the first song she wrote with Mike Cash and Jesse Blum.\n\n\u201cI had been doing a LOT of soul searching and was starting to come to terms that I was holding myself back through dwelling on experiences, people or even my former self. But it was time to shove fear in the closet and throw away the key. I needed to \u201cLet Go\u201d to move the fuck forward!\u201d\n\nAs Theresa moved forward, she continues to generate well-deserved buzz for her infectious brand of pop.

The younger brother of Cajun fiddler Michael Doucet, Doucet has used his distinctive hybrid of folk-style fingerpicking and bluegrass-like flatpicking to strengthen the performances of Beausoleil, the band he's shared with his brother for over 21 years. With the release of his debut solo album, Quand J'ai Parti in 1991, Doucet successfully stepped into the spotlight.\nDoucet first played the guitar after recuperating from a broken arm sustained while practicing with his high school football team. Although he initially taught himself to play by using Bob Dylan and Paul Simon songbooks, Doucet became fascinated with flatpicking after listening to an album by Doc Watson.\n\nTogether with his brother and banjo player Raoul Breaux, Doucet played Cajun music in Louisiana clubs in 1975. When the project proved commercially unsuccessful, the band broke up with Doucet enrolling in college and his brother going on to form the Cajun rock band Coteau and the original lineup of Beausoleil. A turning point in Doucet's evolution as a guitarist came when he heard the playing of the late Clarence White on an album, The Kentucky Colonels 1965-1967, in 1980. Inspired by White's use of unusual chords and imaginative melodies, Doucet began to develop his own unique style.\n\nAlthough Doucet did not play on Beausoleil's first recording session in Paris, he joined the group before the recording of their debut album, The Spirit of Cajun Music, in 1976.\n\nGrand Texas Doucet moved to New Orleans, where he continues to reside, in 1980 to work at the World's Fair.

The band performed on the Warped Tour and other high profile gigs before dissolving. But heavy metal was never Jordan\u2019s passion; it was just a fun experience with his friends to grow musically. As a child, Jordan grew up with R&B artists like Sam Cooke and Earth Wind & Fire providing the soundtrack to his frequent road trips to a ski resort with his family. Artists from what his father called \u201cthe good music era.\u201d Those were the sounds and stylings that stuck in Jordan\u2019s musical memory and by the time he was old enough to realize that his own singing voice was a gift, it was those early groove-funk-soul singers that had shaped his personal aesthetic. If he was going to make records, those were the kind of influences he wanted to draw from.\n\nAfter his move from California to Nashville, Jordan was invited to participate in an unsigned artists retreat hosted by Centricity Music. It was the combination of Jordan\u2019s nuanced vocal abilities, the freshness of his retro-influenced melodies and songwriting, and his warm, enthusiastic personality that spurred label execs to take a closer look and ultimately sign him.\n\nJordan Feliz\u2019s debut project, Beloved, brings the rich influence of 70\u2019s sensibilities into a modern pop context. Intentionally constructing uncluttered tracks free of production tricks and excessive instrumentation, Jordan instead focused on arrangements that were designed to give the vocals center stage. The songs on the Beloved 10 song album are soul-influenced pop numbers, and the instruments present are articulate in their voicings and melodies, saying only as much as they need to.\n\n\u201cI was the kid growing up with the headphones on listening to every lick and reading the lyrics,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cMy dad had a collection of cassettes. My mom had some vinyl. I discovered artists like the Commodores, Bill Withers, and Nat King Cole through them. When I was in the studio making Beloved, I told my producers I didn\u2019t want thirty guitars stacked on one track. I didn\u2019t want five different guitar tones. I want to put one guitar sound on a song and find a way to make that one lick sound massive, the way those 70\u2019s artists were able to do. If you stack too many sounds on one track you can lose the song in all that clutter. Building \u2018clean\u2019 tracks on Beloved was very intentional.\u201d\n\nTag-team produced by Colby Wedgeworth (Lincoln Brewster, The Main, Lydia) and Josh Silverberg (Newsboys, Jon Foreman, Plumb), Beloved has plenty of radio-friendly pop melodies that manages to hit those marks without compromising Jordan\u2019s unique musical personality. The best example of his singular vision is the record\u2019s powerhouse first single, \u201cThe River.\u201d While it sounds like a pulse-quickening mega-hit from the first listen\u2014instantly singable and repeatedly listenable\u2014 the song actually rides on a deep current of soul-driven funk influence that serves to set it apart from other contemporary radio fare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big melody guy,\u201d Jordan admits, \u201cand musically \u2018The River\u2019 is my own personal happy place. It\u2019s a great driving groove that just feels good to sing. The song itself is an invitation to anyone who hears it\u2014whether they\u2019re stuck in pride and legalism or wallowing down in the mess they\u2019ve made of their lives\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to take whatever we have and to run to Jesus. It\u2019s an invitation to go down in amazing grace and to rise up being made new.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s title track, while every bit as soulful and catchy as the first single, was penned from a more personal and autobiographical posture. Jordan\u2019s wife was about to give birth to their first child, and Jordan began to consider what he, as a new father, would most want to communicate to the daughter he was about to meet.\n\n\u201cI wrote \u2018Beloved\u2019 before she was born,\u201d he says, \u201cand I wrote it with two guys who both had little girls. The thing I really wanted my daughter to grow up knowing was that no matter what the world tells her, she\u2019s beloved. She\u2019s loved beyond compare. Regardless of what any of the people around her think, she doesn\u2019t have to be concerned with measuring up because I\u2019m gonna love her unconditionally as long as she lives. She\u2019s beloved and that\u2019s a love she was born into without having to earn it. I wrote it for her, but of course the parallel of God\u2019s unconditional love for His children is obvious. Anything I feel for my daughter is just a small echo of what God feels for her and for all of us.\u201d\n\nWith its slow build and towering vocal hooks, \u201cBeloved\u201d will doubtless provide one of the cornerstones of Jordan\u2019s energetic live shows, along with \u201cThe River,\u201d a festive cut that reveals some of the artist\u2019s roots as a worship leader, and the laid back grooving track, \u201cSimple.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my record has a theme, it\u2019s probably summed up in the \u2018Simple lyric,\u2019\u201d Jordan explains. \u201cI really just wanted this to be a project that people would smile when they listened to it. I wanted to write songs that would make people feel loved. I want them to feel good. Whatever the complications of life that we might be going through at any given moment, our relationships with Jesus don\u2019t have to be difficult. We have a tendency to make it so much harder on ourselves than it really is. We think God can\u2019t love us because we\u2019re struggling with something or we messed up somewhere. But it\u2019s not that complicated. God loves us. Our ransom has been paid. The emotional baggage we carry around doesn\u2019t change the truth. We belong to God and He loves us. It really is that simple. We just have to be constantly reminded of that. The work has already been done on the cross. We just have to remind ourselves and each other to believe it.\u201d\n\nHaving just navigated a long and rocky transition after leaving the security of his local music connections, a church staff position, and moving from California to Tennessee, Jordan Feliz and his wife experienced firsthand what it means to learn to rest in the simplicity of faith in a Father who daily provides for the needs of His children. In fact, they set out from California without even enough money to make it past Phoenix. But along each leg of the journey some music gig opened up that provided enough funds to drive the next leg. By the time they reached their new home, Jordan had actually made several hundred dollars from the move.\n\n\u201cWe believed God had made it clear from the beginning we should move to Nashville,\u201d Jordan says, \u201cbut that didn\u2019t mean it was easy. After we got here I couldn\u2019t find a job. My wife and I were sharing one car. I was posting handyman ads on Craigslist and working as a valet downtown. I could hardly get any people to write songs with me. Then we found out we were pregnant and there was so much that seemed up in the air and kind of scary. In the last few months though, it\u2019s just been like this whirlwind of good things falling into place. I signed the record deal with Centricity Music in February of this year and I finished the Beloved record July 5th. Then, I actually won a brand new car, completely out of the blue, right before my daughter was born July 20th. My first single went to radio July 31st. After so much difficulty and uncertainty, God answered our prayers. He is there for all of us and all we have to do is remain faithful.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join an exclusive VIP video call with Jordan Feliz and experience a rare opportunity to ask questions and hear directly from one of your favorite artists!

At sixteen she began performing in bars in Salvador da Bahia and discovered that her calling in life was music. Her passion for Bahian Carnaval led to the ultimate challenge of singing in a trio el\u00e9trico. Mercury took to the rolling, amplified bandstand that lumbers down the avenue among Carnaval revelers at a time in which only men sang in blocos. Since then the festa barroca has become her milieu of choice for redefining her artistry. A performer of exceptional magnetism who emphasizes creativity, responsibility, and social commitment, excellence and originality in her work, Mercury comfortably navigates musical diversity with the infectious energy and joy of being a Baiana. Her tours and concerts around the world have transformed her into an ambassador for Brazilian music. She sold more than 10 million albums wordwide and is one of the best selling female artists in Brazil.\n\nCareer\n\nDaniela Mercury formed the pop group Companhia Clic and recorded her first two albums. Pega que Oh! and Ilha das Bananas became hit singles in the late 80s. Mercury\u2019s first studio efforts paved the way for her incursion into electronic music, placing her at the forefront of what lay ahead.\n\nHer first solo project (1991), released by independent record company Eldorado, announced the arrival of a sound that conquered Brazil. The single Swing da Cor became the most played song on Bahian airwaves. From there it rippled into the rest of the northeastern region and resonated in southern and southeastern Brazil. Today Swing da Cor is synonymous with samba-reggae, a genre rooted in the Afro-blocos of Bahia (dancing groups that act as afro-centric vehicles of racial identity) and directly influenced by the ceremonial drumming used in the African-derived religious rituals of Candombl\u00e9.\n\n\nDaniela Mercury\u2019s first live concert (1992) in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Museum of Art consolidated her popularity onstage. The midday performance attracted more than twenty thousand people who spilled into the avenue, interrupting the flow of traffic.\n\n1992\u2019s Canto da Cidade (Sony) emerged just as Brazil was experiencing the enthrallment of having discovered a new star. The single that gave the album its title became a number one hit and stayed in that position for months. The LP broke sales records, giving Mercury the distinction of being the first artist to receive a diamond record for having sold a million copies. Its success is so impressive that many years have passed since its release, yet Canto da Cidade continues to sell, having already surpassed the three million mark in Brazil and abroad. Canto da Cidade sparked a special on Rede Globo, shows throughout Europe and the United States, magazine covers, and hundreds of interviews. Its success was crowned by shows throughout Brazil boasting a record number of attendants that reached more than two million concertgoers.\n\nMercury\u2019s next album, M\u00fasica de Rua (1994-Sony), proved that the singer was no fleeting sensation. The record established her versatility as a composer and arranger and more frequent domestic and international tours consecrated her as a top-notch performer. Singing in Portuguese for an international audience was not a setback for Mercury. In response to the perceived language barrier she once countered: \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m a Brazilian artist who has less difficulty expressing what I do on an international level. While my audience may not understand what I sing they certainly feel the joy and energy coming from my music and sing along.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Mercury continued to delight audiences with Feij\u00e3o com Arroz (1996-Sony), and won over critics for good. Given her unabated popularity with audiences, skeptics recognized the artist\u2019s musical consistency. Feij\u00e3o com Arroz explored the range of Samba music in its sundry phases, paying homage to Brazil\u2019s musical and ethnic roots with arrangements that showcased the modern pop sensibilities present in the most traditional of rhythms. Feij\u00e3o com Arroz was a landmark album in Mercury\u2019s career, especially in the international market.\n\nFinally in 1998 Mercury released her first live album, El\u00e9trica (Sony), in response to the public\u2019s overwhelming demand of having the electrifying atmosphere of her shows preserved on disc. Recorded in her stronghold, Salvador, Mercury blended the Bahian guitar typically used in the trios el\u00e9tricos during Carnaval with electric rock guitar. The album\u2019s repertoire included hits from previous records, including Swing da Cor, O Canto da Cidade, M\u00fasica de Rua, Rapunzel, Nobre Vagabundo, among others, and songs she had performed live but never recorded. Additionally Mercury included five new songs on the album, four of which were either penned solely by the artist or in partnership with other songwriters.\n\nSol da Liberdade (2000-BMG) reaffirmed Mercury\u2019s affinity for the samba-reggae hybrid. The single Il\u00ea P\u00e9rola Negra registered as one of Mercury\u2019s most beautiful renditions. The artist\u2019s newest challenge, hailed as her best album yet, surprised fans and critics alike. Joining forces with Suba (an acclaimed producer in Brazilian electronica), Mercury mixed the drumbeats of samba-reggae with sounds extracted from electronic music (rap, funk, lounge, house), in a harmonious, if unlikely union.\n\nSou de Qualquer Lugar (2001-BMG) brought together prominent songwriters such as Lenine, Gilberto Gil and Carlinhos Brown and showcased a remake of Rita Lee\u2019s Mutante and an electrifying version of the late Chico Science\u2019s Praieira. Electronic samba-reggae frames the album for the most part, though Mercury\u2019s most intimate and feminine side permeates throughout, from the album art to the compositions and her renditions of the songs.\n\nEletrodom\u00e9stico \u2013 MTV Live (2003-BMG) was recorded during a show at the Castro Alves Theater\u2019s Concha Ac\u00fastica in Salvador and released on CD and DVD. By inviting Portuguese singer Dulce Pontes, flamenco pop sensation Ros\u00e1rio Flores, Italian rapper Lorenzo Jovanotti, Bahian percussionist Carlinhos Brown, along with the bands Olodum, Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea, and Hip Hop Roots to join her onstage, the show became a high point on the multicultural scale of Mercury\u2019s career.\n\nIn Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico (2004-BMG), Daniela invited the most important DJs and producers of electronic music in Brazil, as well as Gilberto Gil, Carlinhos Brown, and Lenine, to participate in a commemorative disc celebrating five years of her having formed TrioTechno, the first trio el\u00e9trico of electronic music to parade in Bahia\u2019s Carnaval. The album is a fusion of a panoply of electronic musical expressions, including Drum\u2019n Bass, House, Techno, Lounge, and Dub with Brazilian rhythms that result in original song creations. The disc subsequently received a Latin Grammy nomination for best pop album of the year and Mercury was nominated for a Tim award for best female pop/rock vocals. Internet users voted Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico the best pop album of the year online in one of Brazil\u2019s most important weekly magazines Revista Isto \u00c9.\n\nIn 2005 Mercury released Cl\u00e1ssica (Som Livre) on CD and DVD. Recorded from a show she gave the year before at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Casa de Espet\u00e1culo - Bourbon Street the album is a sampler of bossa nova, jazz, and remakes of MPB (Brazilian Popular Music) hits. The recording signaled a new phase for Mercury, who chose independence from multinational record companies to gain full control of her music.\n\nThe year 2005 also saw the release of Bal\u00e9 Mulato (EMI). Produced by Mercury, Ramiro Musotto, and Al\u00ea Siqueira, the album is percussive, vibrant, and contemporary. On it Mercury draws from samba-reggae, rock, frevo (a hybrid of martial polka and African rhythms played mostly during Recife Carnaval), galope eletr\u00f4nico (the electronic version of a northeastern rhythm that imitates the gallop of a horse), and romantic ballads.\n\nBaile Barroco (2006-EMI) is the first live DVD of Mercury performing in a trio el\u00e9trico during the 2005 Bahian Carnaval. The collection of songs celebrates twenty years of ax\u00e9-music with quest performers Luis Caldas, Fernanda Porto, Banda Kaleidosc\u00f3pio and Ramiro Musotto. A highlight that exemplified Bahian Carnaval\u2019s history of diversity was when Mercury opened the parade with a baby grand piano set up on an ample stage. Accompanied by Ricardo Castro on piano, Mercury sang Ary Barroso\u2019s Aquarela do Brasil, Villa Lobos\u2019 Bachianas n.5, and some Bach, in a performance that enchanted millions of revelers at the Barra-Ondina circuit and demonstrated the singer\u2019s boldness and inimitability.\n\nPresent\n\noday Mercury has sold more than ten million albums around the globe. She was the only Brazilian artist invited to participate in the recording of a DVD celebrating the twentieth anniversary of Cirque de Soleil. In 2004 she was invited to commemorate the Montreal International Jazz Fesitval\u2019s 25th anniversary and was a special guest on Alejandro Sanz\u2019s latest DVD, with whom she sang a duet in a bullfighting ring in Madrid. Mercury has sung with the greatest names in Brazilian music and in popular music abroad. Legends such as Tom Jobim, Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Paul McCartney and Ray Charles stand out.\n\nThe artistic vitality of Daniela Mercury\u2019s musical trajectory is reflected in the fact that all of her albums have produced national hits and many of her songs have been included in soap opera soundtracks.\n\nToday Mercury is the star of bloco Crocodilo, headlining the Barra-Ondina circuit, which was created as an alternative space in an area in the center of the city that was drawing large crowds during Carnaval. From the time Mercury began parading in 1996 down the Avenue the winds along the seashore, later setting up her own camarote (boxes along the parade route), the circuit became official. Today it attracts hundreds of thousands of revelers in the same way the former Seventh Avenue circuit did in the past.\n\nThe celebration of Carnaval is a backdrop to Mercury\u2019s success on stage and in the studio. For many years she was chosen best Carnaval singer and some of her hits were named best Carnaval themed music, sang by other artists and blocos.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Buffy Sainte-Marie ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6304611.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Folk", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Academy Award winner Buffy Sainte-Marie\u2019s audacious attitude to life on and off the stage has inspired people around the world for over five decades.", "otherInfo": "Buffy Sainte-Marie reads \u201cHey Little Rockabye - A Lullaby for Pet Adoption\" on Facebook Live, as part of the National Arts Centre's #CanadaPerforms series.\n\nTune in at 7pm ET over at www.Facebook.com/BuffySainteMarie\n\n\"Hey Little Rockabye\" is available in stores now, and for order online: https://bit.ly/2znpgw4\n\nSing-a-long to the book:\nhttps://smarturl.it/heylittlerockabye"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anthony DeVito ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10265031.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Comedy, Sketch Comedy, Improvisation, One Man Show, Standup Comedy, Stand Up Comedy, Stand Up", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Anthony DeVito is a NYC based comedian who recently made his network television debut on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DAVE BRAY USA ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8628524.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Rock And Country, Pop, Christian & Gospel, Acoustic Country, Rock N Roll, Christian Rock, Patriotic, Rock & Pop, Corporate Band, Rock & Country, Private Event, Folk Acoustic Rock, Acousic, Rock Alternative, Country, Cover Songs, Opening Ceremonies, Rock, American Rock, Patriotic Rock, Acoustic & Acoustic Rock, Sports Anthems, Corporate Event, Story Teller", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dave Bray USA - Patriotic Entertainer\nDave Bray is a United States Navy Veteran.

They decided on their first name, Psychedelic Breakfast, based on the suggestion of Tramontano's cousin. It is a reference to Pink Floyd's song \"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\" from their album Atom Heart Mother. Besides playing cover songs by classic rockers such as The Doors and Floyd, they released a self-titled DIY studio album in 1999. The band's popularity began to rise after four songs from this album were featured on the MTV series Undressed.\n\nThe band won their first Jammy for being \"New Groove of the Year\" in 2004. Around the same time, the band decided to change their name due to misnomers of the seriousness of the band leading to the loss of booking for shows and festivals. Spears defended the choice, though, saying that \"the Music is what is important, not the name.\" While supporting their 2005 release, Real Radio, the band performed a national tour, at times backing up popular bands such as The Wailers, moe., North Mississippi Allstars, and Gomez. In early July of 2006, Giangreco left and the band continued on as a trio.\n\nThe band is also known for a high level of musicianship. In the current incarnation, instrument swapping between members is not uncommon. Guitar virtuoso Tim Palmieri also plays keyboards, drums and bass. Both Spears and Tramontano are highly proficient guitar players. Tramontano also plays the keyboards. Such swaps are usually reserved for encores, and are especially well received by fans. Members of the Breakfast also share vocal duties. While lead vocals are typically handled by either Palmieri (a baritone) or Spears (a tenor), Tramontano will occasionally act as a lead vocalist, but is most often heard providing harmonies.\n\nOn August 3rd, 2007, it was announced that Matt Oestreicher will be joining the band as the new keyboardist.\n\nwww.thebreakfast.org - Official site", "otherInfo": "The Breakfast COVID Live Stream Episode 3 - performing The Doors' 1967 Self-titled debut album in its entirety plus a set of Breakfast originals."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tim Baker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8969941.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Techno, Electronic", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tim Baker is best known as the writer and frontman of the much-acclaimed Newfoundland group, Hey Rosetta!.

Though he remains among the most pop-friendly of today's singer-songwriters - his songs regularly appear in hit movie and TV soundtracks , fans say he has bridged the gulf between the modern folk sound and the populist traditions of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger more successfully than any of his songwriting peers.

MPress, distributed worldwide by Caroline/Universal via SRG-ILS Group, also releases albums by Rachael Sage, Seth Glier, and A Fragile Tomorrow.\n\nGrace Pettis is an award-winning songwriter from Austin, Texas who is a noted member of the South Austin scene. A little bit folk, a little bit country/Americana and with a whole lot of soul, Pettis has released two DIY albums and the Dallas Morning News has hailed her as \"one of the most talented young singer-songwriters in America\".\n\nPettis first came to the attention of MPress founder and President Rachael Sage at a SXSW party in Austin, where her voice and presence, even totally unplugged in a crowded room, commanded the spotlight. Sage gushes, \"Grace Pettis is one of the best singers I have ever had the pleasure to hear. And when I say 'best', I don't mean that in a showy way -\u2013 although her voice is both powerful and beautiful. I mean that she can tell a story with her voice in a way that cuts right to the heart of our collective humanity, whatever the topic may be. Her songwriting is nothing short of masterful, and to see these timeless qualities in someone so young feels like discovering something akin to the magic of Loretta Lynn, Johnny Cash or perhaps, Brandi Carlile. MPress Records is thrilled to be working with Grace!\"\n\nPettis, who is repped by Chas Management, will be touring the southeastern US and Europe in winter/spring 2020. Her first release on MPress is expected later on in the year. In the meantime, she is eager to have found such a supportive new team. \"Signing a record deal sounds pretty daunting\", Pettis admits. \"It's not a decision to take lightly. But from the first conversation with Rachael Sage and her wonderful team, I've felt like I've finally found my way home. After a decade of releasing my own music, I couldn't be more thrilled to announce that I'm partnering with MPress Records, a label that has built its unique reputation on championing and supporting artists and putting music with integrity out into the world. I'm so proud to be a part of the MPress family.\"\n\nAs a card-carrying member of the south Austin scene, Grace Pettis has amassed bragging rights to spare. She is the winner of many of the nation\u2019s most prestigious songwriting contests, including NPR's Mountain Stage NewSong Contest, and has received grants from the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation. Grace\u2019s songs have been recorded by other esteemed artists, including Sara Hickman and Ruthie Foster and she added to her songwriting accomplishments in 2019 by signing a publishing deal with BMG.

The band performed on the Warped Tour and other high profile gigs before dissolving. But heavy metal was never Jordan\u2019s passion; it was just a fun experience with his friends to grow musically. As a child, Jordan grew up with R&B artists like Sam Cooke and Earth Wind & Fire providing the soundtrack to his frequent road trips to a ski resort with his family. Artists from what his father called \u201cthe good music era.\u201d Those were the sounds and stylings that stuck in Jordan\u2019s musical memory and by the time he was old enough to realize that his own singing voice was a gift, it was those early groove-funk-soul singers that had shaped his personal aesthetic. If he was going to make records, those were the kind of influences he wanted to draw from.\n\nAfter his move from California to Nashville, Jordan was invited to participate in an unsigned artists retreat hosted by Centricity Music. It was the combination of Jordan\u2019s nuanced vocal abilities, the freshness of his retro-influenced melodies and songwriting, and his warm, enthusiastic personality that spurred label execs to take a closer look and ultimately sign him.\n\nJordan Feliz\u2019s debut project, Beloved, brings the rich influence of 70\u2019s sensibilities into a modern pop context. Intentionally constructing uncluttered tracks free of production tricks and excessive instrumentation, Jordan instead focused on arrangements that were designed to give the vocals center stage. The songs on the Beloved 10 song album are soul-influenced pop numbers, and the instruments present are articulate in their voicings and melodies, saying only as much as they need to.\n\n\u201cI was the kid growing up with the headphones on listening to every lick and reading the lyrics,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cMy dad had a collection of cassettes. My mom had some vinyl. I discovered artists like the Commodores, Bill Withers, and Nat King Cole through them. When I was in the studio making Beloved, I told my producers I didn\u2019t want thirty guitars stacked on one track. I didn\u2019t want five different guitar tones. I want to put one guitar sound on a song and find a way to make that one lick sound massive, the way those 70\u2019s artists were able to do. If you stack too many sounds on one track you can lose the song in all that clutter. Building \u2018clean\u2019 tracks on Beloved was very intentional.\u201d\n\nTag-team produced by Colby Wedgeworth (Lincoln Brewster, The Main, Lydia) and Josh Silverberg (Newsboys, Jon Foreman, Plumb), Beloved has plenty of radio-friendly pop melodies that manages to hit those marks without compromising Jordan\u2019s unique musical personality. The best example of his singular vision is the record\u2019s powerhouse first single, \u201cThe River.\u201d While it sounds like a pulse-quickening mega-hit from the first listen\u2014instantly singable and repeatedly listenable\u2014 the song actually rides on a deep current of soul-driven funk influence that serves to set it apart from other contemporary radio fare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big melody guy,\u201d Jordan admits, \u201cand musically \u2018The River\u2019 is my own personal happy place. It\u2019s a great driving groove that just feels good to sing. The song itself is an invitation to anyone who hears it\u2014whether they\u2019re stuck in pride and legalism or wallowing down in the mess they\u2019ve made of their lives\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to take whatever we have and to run to Jesus. It\u2019s an invitation to go down in amazing grace and to rise up being made new.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s title track, while every bit as soulful and catchy as the first single, was penned from a more personal and autobiographical posture. Jordan\u2019s wife was about to give birth to their first child, and Jordan began to consider what he, as a new father, would most want to communicate to the daughter he was about to meet.\n\n\u201cI wrote \u2018Beloved\u2019 before she was born,\u201d he says, \u201cand I wrote it with two guys who both had little girls. The thing I really wanted my daughter to grow up knowing was that no matter what the world tells her, she\u2019s beloved. She\u2019s loved beyond compare. Regardless of what any of the people around her think, she doesn\u2019t have to be concerned with measuring up because I\u2019m gonna love her unconditionally as long as she lives. She\u2019s beloved and that\u2019s a love she was born into without having to earn it. I wrote it for her, but of course the parallel of God\u2019s unconditional love for His children is obvious. Anything I feel for my daughter is just a small echo of what God feels for her and for all of us.\u201d\n\nWith its slow build and towering vocal hooks, \u201cBeloved\u201d will doubtless provide one of the cornerstones of Jordan\u2019s energetic live shows, along with \u201cThe River,\u201d a festive cut that reveals some of the artist\u2019s roots as a worship leader, and the laid back grooving track, \u201cSimple.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my record has a theme, it\u2019s probably summed up in the \u2018Simple lyric,\u2019\u201d Jordan explains. \u201cI really just wanted this to be a project that people would smile when they listened to it. I wanted to write songs that would make people feel loved. I want them to feel good. Whatever the complications of life that we might be going through at any given moment, our relationships with Jesus don\u2019t have to be difficult. We have a tendency to make it so much harder on ourselves than it really is. We think God can\u2019t love us because we\u2019re struggling with something or we messed up somewhere. But it\u2019s not that complicated. God loves us. Our ransom has been paid. The emotional baggage we carry around doesn\u2019t change the truth. We belong to God and He loves us. It really is that simple. We just have to be constantly reminded of that. The work has already been done on the cross. We just have to remind ourselves and each other to believe it.\u201d\n\nHaving just navigated a long and rocky transition after leaving the security of his local music connections, a church staff position, and moving from California to Tennessee, Jordan Feliz and his wife experienced firsthand what it means to learn to rest in the simplicity of faith in a Father who daily provides for the needs of His children. In fact, they set out from California without even enough money to make it past Phoenix. But along each leg of the journey some music gig opened up that provided enough funds to drive the next leg. By the time they reached their new home, Jordan had actually made several hundred dollars from the move.\n\n\u201cWe believed God had made it clear from the beginning we should move to Nashville,\u201d Jordan says, \u201cbut that didn\u2019t mean it was easy. After we got here I couldn\u2019t find a job. My wife and I were sharing one car. I was posting handyman ads on Craigslist and working as a valet downtown. I could hardly get any people to write songs with me. Then we found out we were pregnant and there was so much that seemed up in the air and kind of scary. In the last few months though, it\u2019s just been like this whirlwind of good things falling into place. I signed the record deal with Centricity Music in February of this year and I finished the Beloved record July 5th. Then, I actually won a brand new car, completely out of the blue, right before my daughter was born July 20th. My first single went to radio July 31st. After so much difficulty and uncertainty, God answered our prayers. He is there for all of us and all we have to do is remain faithful.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join an exclusive VIP video call with Jordan Feliz and experience a rare opportunity to ask questions and hear directly from one of your favorite artists!

Hannah always knew she wanted to be an entertainer, but it wasn't until she was ten years old that she made her debut solo performance at her fourth grade Christmas Recital. She sang \"Tender Tennessee Christmas\". After that she was hooked. She focused on nothing else. At fourteen she picked up a Squire acoustic guitar that her younger sister had abandoned and quickly began learning to write. Over the next four years she performed at fairs, coffee houses, shopping malls and talent shows throughout the Upper Midwest. At eighteen Hannah moved to Nashville, TN to make her dreams a reality. She attended Belmont University in Nashville to study the business of music and vocal performance. After two years she decided to leave Belmont and delve deeper into the art of song writing. She also began performing her own material in and around Nashville. In 2010 Hannah released her first EP, a self produced project called, \"No Stopping, Standing, Parking\". It received rave reviews from the Nashville songwriting community. Soon after it's release, she was personally selected to attend the prestigious Horse & Writer Songwriting Invitational by one of Nashville's most successful songwriters, Skip Ewing. Hannah was a contestant on the 2011 season of the reality television show, \"The X Factor USA\". Her goal was to show America her unique version of country music.

Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011.

On this recording, Valdes is again featured with his Afro-Cuban Messengers, and the compositions include nods to flamenco, the Gnawa music of Morocco and the ritual rhythms of the Orishas, the deities of the Afro-Cuban Santer\u00eda religion. There are mentions of hard-bop and danz\u00f3n but also echoes of Bach, Rachmaninoff and Miles Davis -- and yet the sum total is a deeply personal and open-ended sound. And it\u2019s all Chucho Vald\u00e9s.\n\n\u201cSince I was a student I had this idea of taking disparate elements, mixing them and seeing what happened. And little by little, over time, I\u2019ve found my ways,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cAnd I love it because it\u2019s a search that forces you to investigate and study. It\u2019s not all about Afro-Cuban music. I\u2019m always looking for new things.\u201d\n\nThe concept in Border-Free \u201cwas to do many different things but all in my own style. Now, that is something very difficult to achieve.\u201d\n\nDionisio Jes\u00fas \"Chucho\" Vald\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, was born in a family of musicians in Quivic\u00e1n, Havana province, Cuba, October 9, 1941. His first teachers were his father, the pianist, composer and bandleader Ram\u00f3n \u201cBebo\u201d Vald\u00e9s, and his mother Pilar Rodr\u00edguez, who sang and played the piano.\n\nAt the age of three, Chucho already played at the piano, using both hands, in any key, melodies he heard on the radio. In fact, there is a famous anecdote that tells the story of Bebo tricking his friend, the late Israel \u201cCachao\u201d Lopez, about checking out, with his back to the player, \u201ca young North American pianist.\u201d Chucho was then four years old.\n\nAt the age of five, Chucho began to take lessons on piano, theory and solfege with maestro Oscar Mu\u00f1oz Boufartique. He continued his studies at the Conservatorio Municipal de M\u00fasica de la Habana, from which he graduated at 14. Chucho also took private lessons from Zenaida Romeu, Rosario Franco, Federico Smith and Leo Brouwer.\n\n\u201cAt home he played jazz: the music of Ellington, Count Basie, and Glenn Miller\u2019s band. I\u2019ve been privileged. Because Bebo was the piano player at the Tropicana I could see true legend of jazz in person. He took me to see Nat King Cole, Errol Garner and Sarah Vaughan when I was child studying music. You can\u2019t imagine the effect that had on my life! It was enormous! Magical!\nAt 15 Chucho formed his first jazz trio end in December 1958 he worked as a pianist at the Deauville and St. John hotels in Havana. In 1959, he debuted with the orchestra Sabor de Cuba, directed by his father, Bebo. That band accompanied the top singers of that era such as Rolando Laserie, Fernando \u00c1lvarez and P\u00edo Leyva.\n\n\u201cMy father taught me everything about Cuban music, South American music, jazz, and how to work with an orchestra,\u201d reminisces Chucho. \u201c He gave me the piano chair, and stayed on as director, so I could learn how to work under a conductor. We did our shows and a million other things with that orchestra, including accompanying shows at the Havana Hilton. I learned a lot there. He is my idol, \u201che pauses, then continues. \u201cI don\u00b4t say was, my idol. He is my idol. He was my teacher. He still is.\u201d\n\nChucho\u2019s family and professional life took a dramatic turn in 1960 when his father left to work in Mexico and from there he moved to Europe, where he eventually settled. Bebo Vald\u00e9s never returned to Cuba. (Father and son saw each other again 18 years later at Carnegie Hall, where Chucho was debuting in the United States with his group Irakere. The relationship was fully restored in 2000, when they met again to play a duet on Calle 54, a film about Latin jazz by Oscar winning Spanish director Fernando Trueba. The father and son reunion culminated, musically, in Juntos Para Siempre, a 2007 duet recording that won both a Grammy and a Latin Grammy. Bebo Vald\u00e9s died on March 22, 2013. He was 94.)\n\nIn the early \u201860s, Chucho worked as a pianist at the Teatro Mart\u00ed (1961), the Sal\u00f3n Internacional del Hotel Habana Riviera (1963) and the orchestra of the Teatro Musical de la Habana (1964-67). In 1967, and after a suggestion of his old teacher, the great guitarist, composer and director Leo Brouwer, Chucho organized his own combo.\n\nStill, that same year he joins the important Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, then directed by maestros Armando Romeu and Rafael Somavilla. While a member of the orchestra, Chucho revisited the idea of a small group and, in 1970, he appeared at the Jazz Jamboree in Poland leading his own quintet.\n\nIn 1972, after recording Jazz Bat\u00e1, an album featuring an unusual jazz trio comprising bassist Carlos del Puerto and singer and percussionist Oscar Vald\u00e9s on bat\u00e1 (the traditional hourglass shaped drums used in the ritual music of the Orishas), Chucho decided to enlarge the group adding brass and trap drums. That\u00b4s the genesis, in 1973, of Irakere, a small, Cuban-style big band that played an explosive mix of jazz, rock, classical music and traditional Cuban music, including Afro-Cuban religious music and instruments.\n\n\u201cThe ideas for the brass have to do with the work we did with the Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, which was a great big band,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cI tried to imitate that with four horns -- two trumpets, a alto and a tenor sax -- and with just that try to have the sound of a big band. Of course when you have monster players like Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, [trumpeter] Jorge Varona and [saxophonist] Carlos Averhoff you can write anything you want and it will work.\u201d\nIrakere first made its mark internationally in Finland in 1976. But the following year, the band was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie in a visit to Havana on a jazz cruise that also included pianist Earl \u201cFatha\u201d Hines and saxophonist Stan Getz. In 1978 the producer Bruce Lundvall, then president of CBS, signed the band for the label. Irakere debuted, unannounced, as \u201csurprise guests,\u201d at Carnegie Hall as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. As fate would have it, the program that night also featured pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner, two of Chucho\u2019s main influences.\n\nSelections from Irakere\u2019s performances at Carnegie Hall and at the Montreux Jazz Festival comprised the repertory of Irakere (CBS) their debut recording in the United States. The album won a Grammy as Best Latin Recording in 1979.\n\nThe group went on to create an extraordinary body of work that includes great dance recordings such as Homenaje a Beny Mor\u00e9 (Pimienta, 1989) and Indestructible (Sony, 1997); explorations of Afro-Cuban religious music such as Babal\u00fa Ay\u00e9 (Bemb\u00e9, 1999) featuring the great Orisha music singer L\u00e1zaro Ros; as well as ambitious projects such as Tierra En Trance (Are\u00edto, 1983) and Misa Negra (Messidor, 1987)\n\nIrakere\u2019s lineup went through many changes over the years. Throughout, Chucho remained as the one, great constant. But success had its costs. Except for the remarkable solo outing Lucama (Mission, 1986), his talent as a pianist was largely out of sight, obscured by his other obligations with the band.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1997, Chucho won his second Grammy for his work on Habana (Verve) as a member of trumpeter Roy Hargrove\u2019s Crisol. The following year, while not completely leaving Irakere behind, Chucho started a parallel career as a solo player and quartet leader, looking for greater opportunities to explore and showcase his playing.\n\n\u201cTwenty five years with the same band is a long time,\u201d said Chucho at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to play solo and with a quartet for some time now. My work as a pianist and soloist gets diluted in Irakere. My job in the group is to be the composer, arranger and musical director and that\u2019s a completely different role.\u201d\n\nChucho stayed with Irakere until 2005.\n\nThe fruitful period that followed is highlighted by albums such as Solo Piano (Blue Note, 1991), Solo: Live in New York (Blue Note, 2001) and New Conceptions (Blue Note, 2003), as well as quartet recordings such as Bele Bele en La Habana (Blue Note, 1998), Briyumba Palo Congo (Blue Note, 1999) and Live at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note, 2000), capturing a performance that features Chucho\u2019s sister, singer Mayra Caridad Vald\u00e9s . The recording won a Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album.\n\nThere were also Grammy awards for the already mentioned Juntos Para Siempre (Calle 54, 2007), the duet recording with Bebo; and for Chucho\u2019s Steps (Comanche, 2010), featuring his new group, the Afro-Cuban Messengers .\n\nIn total, Chucho has won five Grammys and three Latin Grammys.\n\nIn 2012, Chucho reorganized his Afro-Cuban Messengers which currently feature Yaroldy Abreu, percussion, Dreiser Durruthy Bombal\u00e9 , bat\u00e1 drums and voice; Reinaldo Meli\u00e1n, trumpet, Gast\u00f3n Joya, bass and Rodney Barreto, drums.\n\nHis most recent production, Border-Free, is yet another expression of the continuing musical search and evolution of Chucho Vald\u00e9s as a pianist, composer, arranger and director.", "otherInfo": "On Friday, May 29 at 5PM PT, SFJAZZ presents a live stream of Chucho Vald\u00e9s' February 2019 concert.

Would you like to get together sometime and play them?\" to try to get a date with violinist Josie Quick. Josie saw through to his true intention, but she also saw that he was sincere about his music. Well, Tom went home and set to work arranging his music with a violin in mind. A rehearsal date was set, and one of the first songs they did was to become the title song on their first CD, Ready, Willing, and Able.\n\nTom had been in a number of rock bands, and they had always met an early demise. He was ready to try a different tactic for getting a band going. This time he was going to create a core of two people that could work together, and build from there.\n\nJosie had been wanting to get more into playing jazz violin. The spontaneity of improvisation was intriguing to her. Problem was, there wasn't a lot of opportunity for getting together with other jazz musicians. Her violin was always drowned out by the other instruments, and electric violins and violin pickups hadn't yet come into use.\n\nThe time was right for these two to get together. Tom's use of open tunings and fingerstyle guitar gave Josie the inspiration to improvise contrapuntal melodies. At first their music was a combination of folk and classical, which can be heard on their first CD.\n\nAs time went on ttheir sound evolved to encompass any musical inspiration that came their way. Determined to break the mold of typical acoustic guitar and violin music, they dive into the blues, rock and roll, jazz, and anything else they can think of.

With their blend of progressive rock and improvisatory jazz, soaked in Indian and Middle Eastern styles, CTS blends disparate elements into an utterly original whole. A relentless touring schedule has earned them a fervent following around the world, with fans ranging from jam-band hippies to corpse-painted headbangers.\n\nTheir latest album, You Are Literally a Metaphor, is the culmination of a fifteen-year musical journey. Packed with the same fury and dazzling virtuosity of their previous work, Metaphor is also a portrait of three musicians reaching new levels of maturity.\n\nFrom the bluesy swing of \u201cWhen You\u2019ve Loved and Lost Like Frankie Has\u201d to the ethereal electro-synths of \u201cSketches From a Blind Man\u201d, CTS\u2019s minimalist pop instincts stand shoulder-to-shoulder with progressive metal and freewheeling improvisation in a true expression of their omnivorous musicality. Three of Metaphor\u2019s nine songs are Eastern European traditionals, but could easily be mistaken for the band\u2019s original tunes, so singular has their sound become.

Comprised of Jo Padilla (lead vocals), Ryan Lammers (guitar), Craig Schwartz Jr. (keyboards), Dean Sinclair (drums), and Cale Singleton (bass), August Hotel has been playing together since 2017, after Padilla sent a grainy smartphone video of themself singing to the rest of the band. Within a month, the band was in the studio working on their first EP, 2017\u2019s Charms.\n\nAfter an extensive schedule of live shows, the band took a step back to record new music, embracing their evolution and new experiences. More than two years later, August Hotel\u2019s forthcoming second EP has come together with four new songs that expand on the group\u2019s ability to weave together each member\u2019s specific musical background and influences. This EP examines different forms of loss\u2014the end of a relationship, the sacrifice of a trans activist, the loss of personal control when struggling with mental health, and losing a guitar on the train\u2014aiming to convey universal experiences via unique stories.\n\nLead single \u201cDisaster & Delight\u201d explores reconciliation after the end of a relationship through an infectious melody and cheeky \u2013 yet still sincere \u2013 lyrics. The EP\u2019s accompanying titles strike various tones and moods: urgency, elevation, and melancholy. Produced by Drew Polovick of Friday Pilots Club, this sophomore EP exemplifies the band\u2019s deep passion for the story telling qualities of their carefully crafted music. Constantly progressing as individuals and as a band to produce captivating and complex tunes, August Hotel is poised for a breakthrough.\n\nLive, August Hotel has shared stages with the likes of The Academic, Urban Cone, Nightly, Vesperteen, Young Rising Sons, Twin XL, and Knox Hamilton, as well as headlined clubs around Chicago and the Midwest.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Chris Valencia ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8523133.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Versatality is one of many words that embody DJ Chris Valencia.

Sex. Doomed Romance. These three simple phrases define the sound and thematic presence of Panic Priest.

Co-Produced and engineered by Brian Fox (Wingtips, Ganser), the new album intertwines classic genres such as Darkwave, Post-Punk and Goth while a richly layered modern Synth-pop sensibility elevates the album to something larger than simple nostalgic recreation. Performed and composed almost entirely by Armondo (with key contributions by Twin Tribes, Vincent Segretario of Wingtips and Gretta Rochelle of My Gold Mask), \u201cSecond Seduction\u201d is simultaneously personal yet fantastical. A cathartic account of Armondo\u02bcs real life experiences, stemming from personal heartbreak, life as a non-monogamous individual and even current political anxieties, be prepared to once again be tempted and lured into the world of Panic Priest.\n\n\nCABLES AND LACE\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CablesandLace\n\nThe Portal Opens at 7pm, PANIC PRIEST at 7:30 / AL1CE at 8:15 / CABLES AND LACE at 9:00 and Tea Time at 10pm.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee.

But the South Korea born, New Mexico raised performer hardly realized just how dynamically his skills on the instrument would mesh with his ultimate development as a rocker in the popular regional bands Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and now, his emergence as a powerful and emotional singer/songwriter in his own right. On his debut album These Illusions, Park plays violin and acoustic guitar in addition to reaching out to acoustic rock fans everywhere with his inimitable vocals. Because of the mostly personal nature of the songs, the compelling 11-track collection rolls like a fascinating chronology of the 27-year-old singer\u2019s life, beginning with tunes he wrote when he was an engineering student at New Mexico State in his now adopted hometown of Las Cruces. He was also building his catalog of songs as he played violin and contributed backing vocals for several years in two well known regional bands: the mostly cover band Live Bait and the \u201cscreamo\u201d metalcore/hardcore group Kiss To Betray. Playing in Live Bait, his violin came in very handy for those Dave Matthews songs and it helped him take songs like Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d to a transcendent level. Live Bait won the local college radio station KRUXFEST for \u201cBest New Alternative Band\u201d in 2005 and Kiss To Betray won the Las Cruces 2006 Battle of the Bands and later played at well known venues around the country like Headhunters in Austin, The Viper Room in L.A. and hotspots in Phoenix. As a solo artist, Park has since headlined regularly at local clubs like El Patio Bar and Hurricane Alley, the Albuquerque haunts the Launch Pad and Rally\u2019s Pub on 4th Street, and in Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix and even Colorado Springs. He recently posted two live performance videos on his myspace (myspace.com/danielparkmusic), one of which features his unique looping technique which allows him to play violin and guitar \u201csimultaneously\u201d on the same song. While Park enjoyed his time in Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and the notoriety he received as a featured performer, in some ways he felt he was always gearing up for his eventual breakthrough to the forefront as his own artist. In the months leading up to the breakup of Kiss To Betray, Park gathered his best material, entered what kiddingly refers to as \u201ca local ghetto studio\u201d and started to come to grips with These Illusions. While many of the tracks on the album have their roots in romantic relationships, the hypnotic and percussive, acoustic guitar driven title cut cuts to the core of his desire to find his own creative path in life\u2014even if it means going against the mainstream expectations of our society. Other songs tap slightly into his lifelong search for identity as an Asian born man adopted (along with two of his siblings) by a white American family. Other key tracks on These Illusions include the jangling, high energy \u201cTimes Have Changed,\u201d which laments the shift in life as his significant other chooses to move on. The graceful, easy strumming ballad \u201cWhat We Should Be\u201d is another heartbreaker about learning to accept the changes in a relationship when one person leaves to pursue his or her dreams\u2014while still celebrating the memories.

Hannah always knew she wanted to be an entertainer, but it wasn't until she was ten years old that she made her debut solo performance at her fourth grade Christmas Recital. She sang \"Tender Tennessee Christmas\". After that she was hooked. She focused on nothing else. At fourteen she picked up a Squire acoustic guitar that her younger sister had abandoned and quickly began learning to write. Over the next four years she performed at fairs, coffee houses, shopping malls and talent shows throughout the Upper Midwest. At eighteen Hannah moved to Nashville, TN to make her dreams a reality. She attended Belmont University in Nashville to study the business of music and vocal performance. After two years she decided to leave Belmont and delve deeper into the art of song writing. She also began performing her own material in and around Nashville. In 2010 Hannah released her first EP, a self produced project called, \"No Stopping, Standing, Parking\". It received rave reviews from the Nashville songwriting community. Soon after it's release, she was personally selected to attend the prestigious Horse & Writer Songwriting Invitational by one of Nashville's most successful songwriters, Skip Ewing. Hannah was a contestant on the 2011 season of the reality television show, \"The X Factor USA\". Her goal was to show America her unique version of country music. The results were evident when her fan base exploded and has continued to grow ever since. Hannah returned to Nashville to continue performing and writing. Her hard work paid off when she secured four song cuts on the debut album of country artist, Rachele Lynae, on Momentum Label Group. Hannah's newest project, \"The Freedom EP\", was released on Thanksgiving Day 2012. Her current single from the project, \"No Where Left to Roam\" has been sent to Country, Americana, College and Internet radio around the world and is receiving an enthusiastic response. \"The Freedom EP\" includes five original tracks and is available now on all major online stores including iTunes and Amazon, as well as her website.

Pepper/psychedelic era, and the Abbey Road period and beyond, with many shows also including a Shea Stadium set.\n\nThe band typically changes costumes twice, for a total of three period-perfect looks: the identical black chesterfield suits worn by the original lads during their Ed Sullivan Show debut, the colorful satin Sgt. Pepper uniforms and regalia worn by the Beatles during their psychedelic era, and the totally divergent clothing styles that marked the later Beatles and post-Beatles years. Select shows also feature the beige safari-style jackets and black trousers that have come to be known as the Beatles' Shea Stadium suits.\n\nThe band also periodically plays specialty shows for various Beatles-related anniversaries, such as shows that feature an entire Beatles album, played from start to finish, along with additional selections from the rest of the Beatles' extensive catalog.

He\u2019s stood on stages and tabletops, under the lights and in dimly lit corners, in large cities, small towns, a couple of state fairs, and one beauty pageant. He\u2019s played four hour shows single-handedly, and traded half-hour sets at a weekly house gig at a bar in Guatemala City with \u201csome guy named Luis, who sang songs like \u2018My Way\u2019 in Spanish. The pay was 15 quetzales and all the Gallo beer I could drink,\u201d according to Jim.\n\nAlong the way Jim has written songs for and appeared on Madison Square Garden TV\u2019s \u201cYankee Ticket\u201d pregame show, and Fox Sports Net\u2019s Minnesota Twins pregame show. Jim\u2019s music caught the attention of the Twins, and Jim\u2019s song Circle Me Bert was featured by the Twins in a 10,000 CD giveaway to fans attending a game. He has also written the music for a fishing show, and children\u2019s music for an up-coming educational video.\n\nJim\u2019s latest realease is entitled Into The Blue. It\u2019s rock/pop sprinkled with a bit of folk/country/jazz and garnished with a pinch of reggae on the side and served with a smile on the seriously humorous side of town. With song topics ranging from politics and religion (\u201cgod\u201d) to life as a dog (\u201cRoxygrrl\u201d), Into The Blue covers a lot of ground. Life, death, love, politics and religion--it's all in there.\n\nA true independent musician, Jim released Into The Blue on his own label, Door To Door Music, as he did with his previous releases, All Dressed Up And All Stressed Out (1996), Knives & Bleeding (1999). and Hello Hello (2002). Each release features songwriting that bears the mark of a variety of influences such as Lennon & McCartney, Bob Marley, Elvis Costello, Squeeze, even Hank Williams. A fan on Jim\u2019s CDBaby page summed it up this way:\n\u201cJim plays because he loves music. He plays with the same passion whether he is playing for thousands or a few fans. It is clear in every track that Jim is playing for his love of music and not just for all the hoopla. It is for this reason that this CD is a must have.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Jim Pellinger's Quarantine Cafe streams live every Friday night at 8pm CDT, on Facebook and simul-streamed on jimpellinger.com."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Black Tones ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10392060.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Garage Rock, Blues-Rock, Blues-punk, Afropunk, Rock'n Roll", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Black Tones album title Cobain and Cornbread is a description of the band that lead singer/guitarist Eva came up with playing at a show, in answer to the most commonly asked question, \u201cWhat does your band sound like?\u201d This tasty adroitly description sums up her and her twin drummer Cedric David\u2019s Seattle-spawned punk-blues. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t even sound like our influences,\u201d she explains, \u201cSo the best way I found to describe The Black Tones was to talk about our environment we were raised around, which was a bunch of southerners living in the Northwest.\u201d\n\nLouisiana-bred, though born and raised in Seattle, The Black Tones\u2019 reference to grunge god Kurt and the Native American quick bread cuisine, evokes \u201cSouthern influences in the grey of the Northwest,\u201d Eva says. \u201cIt sort of creates this offspring of rebellion and soul. We eat gumbo in our flannel shirts, and we eat red beans and rice while head-banging!\u201d\n\nMusic was a huge part of Eva and Cedric\u2019s childhood, their first shared fandom being for \u201cTurn Your Love Around\u201d by iconic vocalist and guitarist George Benson, which they would dance to together every time the radio played it. They enjoyed looking in at what their older siblings were digging on MTV, such as Jay Z, Nirvana, Blind Melon, Michael Jackson, and \u201c90s pop music was awesome too! And R&B like SWV, En Vogue, etc.,\u201d Eva says. In high school their tastes had drifted; Eva was introduced to Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd. After high school she researched and grooved on the old blues and folk that had influenced those classic rock bands. At the same time, she and Cedric were also big World-Wide Wrestling fans \u2014 \u201cwe loved wrestling! Cedric loved it before I did, but then I became a fanatic too.\u201d They really enjoyed the hard rock music used in bouts, drawing them closer to heavy metal.\n\nAbout this time Cedric had started to play the drums and wanted to hear the songs that Eva was writing, which she found exciting. He matched drum parts to songs she had only worked out so far on guitar, later on getting a bass player and another guitarist. As soon as they had a few arranged, they were ready to start performing. They went through some changes: The Black Tones as a four piece only lasted for a while, then became a trio, \u201cbut Cedric and I were the founders and the only consistently reliable members, so now we just keep it as a duo, while hiring other musicians to play instruments live with us.\u201d Eva had also been in an all-girl punk band called BUST, but she ended up channeling everything into The Black Tones with Cedric.\n\nThrough countless shows supporting a few early singles, The Black Tones felt they finally got their first big breakthrough opening for Death Cab for Cutie in an anniversary benefit for the Paramount Theater. \u201cThat was the biggest show we\u2019ve done!\u201d Eva exclaims. She gives credit for reaching that height to NighTrain, the all black female punk band that she says discovered and championed them when they had freshly started.\n\nFor Cobain and Cornbread, The Black Tones are returning from their singles to work with the renowned, glorious grunge producer Jack Endino, introduced to them by Eva\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and music writer Jake Uitti. Jake had interviewed Jack and sent him their song \u201cWoman in Black\u201d without Eva\u2019s knowledge and Jack replied how much he loved it and wanted to work with The Black Tones.\n\n\u201cI was never really big on recording in a studio,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m a live show nut, I just love performing. Being in studios was always very stressful for me, but when we worked with Jack, that totally changed! It was the best recording experience I\u2019ve ever had. Jack is like a scientist, a chemist behind the soundboard. He had great ideas that strengthened each song. I\u2019ve never met anyone with an ear like his, it\u2019s unbelievable, though he\u2019s a calm, humble, kind, efficient, honest and very intelligent guy \u2014 I was so intimidated at first, I mean, here\u2019s the guy who recorded the Melvins, Nirvana, Soundgarden, and the list goes on. And now he\u2019s working with us and he\u2019s really into it!\u201d\n\nCobain and Cornbread also features help from their friend Mason Lowe from Bread & Butter, on \u201cChubby and Tubby\u201d (a frenetic garage rock instrumental ode to the landmark Seattle variety store) and \u201cWelcome Mr. Pink\u201d (the band\u2019s autobiographical anthem). \u201cMason has a great ear and was really amazing to work with.\u201d Ed Brooks mastered all the songs on the record, with Jack checking back in to make sure he was looped on everything. \u201cAs a band we are of course rooting for the record, but it\u2019s even more special when everyone else is as well!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something very unique about the songs (all originals save for a cover of \u201cRiver of Jordan\u201d) and sound unique about the minimalist sound Jack helped The Black Tones achieved, reminding one of the debuts from The Ramones to the Stooges to the Modern Lovers. Eva acknowledges the brute power of the album\u2019s sound, \u201cit\u2019s pretty vulnerable and raw and I like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are songs like \u2018Welcome Mr. Pink\u2019 where you can hear the click sound from me pressing down on the button to turn on my reverb pedal.\u201d Or in their righteous, ferocious Black Power anthem, \u201cKey of Black (They Want Us Dead),\u201d \u201cafter the second guitar chorus when I go back to the solo, I almost forgot to press my Wah Wah pedal back on so it comes in a little late.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not factory made or even ever scratch the surface of perfection, we\u2019re real people, this is real life and these little details remind me of the imperfections of life,\u201d she says. \u201cLife\u2019s real, life\u2019s the blues, coming from the heart.

The vocal performance by band co-founder Serena Pryne was so gut-wrenching and so emotionally draining, mining the very depths of her soul that she practically collapsed into the arms of superstar producer GGGarth Richardson when it was over. That vocal take and the similarly powerhouse performances from her bandmates, came to be the template and benchmark for the rest of the album. \u201cI knew it was a powerful song with a lot of emotion behind it and I was a little intimidated to record it\u201d said Pryne. \u201cHe let me do my thing and just pour everything I had into the microphone. He said I would know when I was done.\u201d From that moment on, that song set the tone for the rest of the record. \u201cI don\u2019t know if GGGarth knew it ahead of time and planned it with that song, because he would always reference Don\u2019t Ask if we were struggling at any other moment. He set the entire tone based on that track,\u201d said guitarist and band co-founder Nick Lesyk. The entirety of Windows and Stones is just as creatively, spiritually and emotionally intense and takes the listener on an aural and experiential journey that they won\u2019t soon forget. This too is emblematic of The Mandevilles\u2019 \u2018leave it all on the floor\u2019 approach to writing, recording and especially performing the music live. And it\u2019s music that couldn\u2019t be more straightforward and unpretentious in its approach and delivery. No studio trickery, experimental flights of fancy or self-indulgence - just rock and roll. \u201cBeing a Canadian, I think it\u2019s funny that I describe it as American rock and roll. I say that because it\u2019s reminiscent of Tom Petty, John Mellencamp, Bob Seger and Bruce Springsteen - all rolled into one. Our music comes from the same place.\u201d said Lesyk. Pryne and Lesyk are the creative nucleus of The Mandevilles and have been musical partners for nearly 15 years, although both bring significantly different musical influences to the table. \u201cSerena\u2019s influences are steeped more in the roots of rock and roll whereas mine are a little more contemporary. But there are a lot of commonalities: we love Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. And then there are newer songwriters like Ryan Adams and Jason Isbell,\u201d said Lesyk. As the frontwoman for the band, Pryne is the focal point and centre of attention for the band for both her force-of-nature stage presence and her amazingly dynamic and unmistakably authentic whisky-soaked voice. \u201cI played in a blues band when I was a kid. That definitely shaped the sound of my voice. Even though I don\u2019t listen to blues records all the time there is just something about it that I gravitate to \u2013 it was natural for me,\u201d Pryne said. \u201cAnd oddly enough I didn\u2019t really dig into a lot of female artists until I was in my mid-20s. Until then, Robert Plant was more of an influence on me. When I started to discover women in music it was Tina Turner initially. And Bonnie Raitt is huge. I just love the tenderness in her voice, which she can also turn into a real raspy growl.\u201d The Mandevilles is the latest incarnation of Pryne and Lesyk\u2019s musical merger, which began around the turn of the millennium in the Niagara Region of southern Ontario. After playing in cover bands separately and then together, the duo started penning their own material and formed the hard rock outfit Oliver Black. Soon thereafter they were courted by an American record label that soon went bankrupt, leaving the band at loose ends, and living in the United States. After moving to Europe for a short time, the band released an album under the name Serena Pryne and The Mandevilles which saw them begin an ongoing songwriting collaboration with Nashville-based Niagara Falls transplant Dave \u201cDwave\u201d Thomson. But with a revolving door of musicians and a yearning for something fresh, Lesyk and Pryne decided to return to Canada and reboot the band. Only guitarist Taylor Laslo was kept, and long-time friend Brett Bendo was brought in to play drums a couple of month before the band was set to fly to Vancouver to work at Richardson\u2019s The Farm Studios. After auditioning a number of prospective bassists, Waylon Glintz blew his future bandmates away and got the gig \u2013 three weeks before recording was to begin. Alongside Don\u2019t Ask, Windows and Stones features infectious, melodic rock tunes like the lead-off track, Hangovers, which as evidenced by the name, encapsulates the unpleasant result of an evening of overindulging. \u201cWe visit our friend Dave (Thomson) a couple of times a year in Nashville. During one visit he had a massive blow up with his then fianc\u00e9. But then they reconciled and we decided to have a party to celebrate. We bought several litres of rum and drank it all in one night. I think we almost killed him! The next day he didn\u2019t wake up until well into the evening and he looked like death. When he woke up we wrote the song in about 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d said Lesyk with a hearty laugh. A more blues-rock fueled version of the traditional country break-up song is I Stole Your Band. \u201cI was working as a seamstress and I was bored one day and kept singing this line \u2018I stole your band when you broke my heart. It was just one of those funny little anecdotes where I\u2019m saying to a fictional boyfriend \u2018if you do something stupid, I\u2019m going to steal your f***ing band,\u201d said Pryne. While The One was another defining moment for the Mandevilles as it was a song that truly brought all five members into the creative process. \u201cWhen we were in pre-production we had a magical moment which I never would have expected. It was in a completely different style when we first brought it to GGGarth, just a happy little folk song. He said it was good but didn\u2019t really go anywhere,\u201d Pryne explained. \u201cWe said let\u2019s take five minutes and work on it a bit. All of a sudden we just started playing and all five of us together created this whole new song. It was one of those inexplicable crazy moments. It\u2019s kind of a heavy song about death, but ambiguous as to what has died \u2013 a person, an idea, a dream a relationship \u2013 it means different things to different people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all us on this record. There are very few tricks, no Auto-tuning of the vocals, and we\u2019re all playing real instruments on every track,\u201d said Pryne. With this remarkable, well-crafted album that manages to be tight in its musicianship but loose in its vibe, The Mandevilles have taken one giant, definitive leap for rock and roll.

Zane began honing his chops in LA's vibrant music circuit on his 12th birthday and later refined his style at USC's prestigious Thornton School of Music, becoming one of the most in-demand guitarists on both coasts in the process. Possessing an exciting and extremely rare combination of creativity and virtuosity, along with an audiophile's ear for guitar tone and an extraordinary ability to sightread, Zane has been referred to as \"The best guitarist in NY and LA\" by Bono of U2. More recently, John Mayer handpicked Zane to play guitar on his current world tour and latest album, sans audition, after Mayer discovered Zane's fiery performances online. But with his newfound passion for writing and singing his own material, Zane is quickly gaining significant attention as a lead vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. While Zane's guitar playing has been described as daring, passionate, soulful, and jaw-dropping - tremendous labels for a young man many are proclaiming to be the next great guitar hero - Zane is now rapidly accumulating equally praiseworthy descriptions about his compositions and vocal abilities. As people witness Zane's evolution from gunslinging guitarist to full-fledged frontman, comparisons to the early days surrounding the release of John Mayer's debut EP \"Inside Wants Out\" have even been serendipitously drawn. Bob Lefsetz has raved about CARNEY - where Zane began his meteoric rise as a lead guitarist - likening the band's sound to \"a mysterious trip into the heart of darkness.\" But, Zane's original songs lean slightly away from the raw and brooding Rock and Roll that defined CARNEY as they gravitate towards his roots in Jazz, Blues and Pop. His songwriting style is grounded in visual storytelling, honesty, surrender and hope and his melodies, while imaginative and adventurous, are irresistibly catchy and instantly familiar. Zane's lyrics have been likened to those of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray LaMontagne, and his voice has been compared to singing icons Jeff Buckley, Damien Rice, and Jimmy Gnecco. This unique combination of masterful guitars, unforgettable hooks, and emotively provoking lyrics - all expressed with his profoundly moving and honest voice - is what makes Zane such a one-of-a-kind talent; one that seems poised to join not only the greats of his generation, but those who've come before him. Live performance is where Zane's most inherent gift shines; his undeniably infectious charisma - one that captivates the audience the instant he takes the stage.

As the frontwoman for the band, Pryne is the focal point and centre of attention for the band for both her force-of-nature stage presence and her amazingly dynamic and unmistakably authentic whisky-soaked voice. \u201cI played in a blues band when I was a kid. That definitely shaped the sound of my voice. Even though I don\u2019t listen to blues records all the time there is just something about it that I gravitate to \u2013 it was natural for me,\u201d Pryne said. \u201cAnd oddly enough I didn\u2019t really dig into a lot of female artists until I was in my mid-20s. Until then, Robert Plant was more of an influence on me. When I started to discover women in music it was Tina Turner initially. And Bonnie Raitt is huge. I just love the tenderness in her voice, which she can also turn into a real raspy growl.\u201d The Mandevilles is the latest incarnation of Pryne and Lesyk\u2019s musical merger, which began around the turn of the millennium in the Niagara Region of southern Ontario. After playing in cover bands separately and then together, the duo started penning their own material and formed the hard rock outfit Oliver Black. Soon thereafter they were courted by an American record label that soon went bankrupt, leaving the band at loose ends, and living in the United States. After moving to Europe for a short time, the band released an album under the name Serena Pryne and The Mandevilles which saw them begin an ongoing songwriting collaboration with Nashville-based Niagara Falls transplant Dave \u201cDwave\u201d Thomson. But with a revolving door of musicians and a yearning for something fresh, Lesyk and Pryne decided to return to Canada and reboot the band. Only guitarist Taylor Laslo was kept, and long-time friend Brett Bendo was brought in to play drums a couple of month before the band was set to fly to Vancouver to work at Richardson\u2019s The Farm Studios. After auditioning a number of prospective bassists, Waylon Glintz blew his future bandmates away and got the gig \u2013 three weeks before recording was to begin. Alongside Don\u2019t Ask, Windows and Stones features infectious, melodic rock tunes like the lead-off track, Hangovers, which as evidenced by the name, encapsulates the unpleasant result of an evening of overindulging. \u201cWe visit our friend Dave (Thomson) a couple of times a year in Nashville. During one visit he had a massive blow up with his then fianc\u00e9. But then they reconciled and we decided to have a party to celebrate. We bought several litres of rum and drank it all in one night. I think we almost killed him! The next day he didn\u2019t wake up until well into the evening and he looked like death. When he woke up we wrote the song in about 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d said Lesyk with a hearty laugh. A more blues-rock fueled version of the traditional country break-up song is I Stole Your Band. \u201cI was working as a seamstress and I was bored one day and kept singing this line \u2018I stole your band when you broke my heart. It was just one of those funny little anecdotes where I\u2019m saying to a fictional boyfriend \u2018if you do something stupid, I\u2019m going to steal your f***ing band,\u201d said Pryne. While The One was another defining moment for the Mandevilles as it was a song that truly brought all five members into the creative process. \u201cWhen we were in pre-production we had a magical moment which I never would have expected. It was in a completely different style when we first brought it to GGGarth, just a happy little folk song. He said it was good but didn\u2019t really go anywhere,\u201d Pryne explained. \u201cWe said let\u2019s take five minutes and work on it a bit. All of a sudden we just started playing and all five of us together created this whole new song. It was one of those inexplicable crazy moments. It\u2019s kind of a heavy song about death, but ambiguous as to what has died \u2013 a person, an idea, a dream a relationship \u2013 it means different things to different people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all us on this record. There are very few tricks, no Auto-tuning of the vocals, and we\u2019re all playing real instruments on every track,\u201d said Pryne. With this remarkable, well-crafted album that manages to be tight in its musicianship but loose in its vibe, The Mandevilles have taken one giant, definitive leap for rock and roll.

With his vocal range of seven plus octaves, ability to swing from a deep guttural baritone to soaring soprano riffs, knack for capturing life through lyrics, and commanding stage presence, he has carved a niche for himself in today\u2019s music world. A prolific songwriter, he has a large and varied catalog of songs ranging from heart-wrenching acoustic ballads to heart-pounding heavier rock. His music is published by EMI Music Publishing Canada (2004-present). Lukas first ventured onto the music scene with two Canadian bands, Cleavage (1995-2005) and Rise Electric (2005-2006), which helped prepare him for what was to come. He entered and won the competition television show Rock Star: Supernova (2006) which earned him front man status with Tommy Lee (Motley Crue), Jason Newsted (Metallica), and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). Their band Rock Star Supernova completed an album and a world tour of the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Following the tour, Lukas returned to Los Angeles and began writing and recording new music. The Love and Lust EP (June 2007) was released and he completed the solo acoustic Love and Lust Tour, making over two dozen stops throughout the United States and Canada. The new material was well-received by fans, and the band Stars Down was born (2008-present). After touring with his new band, Lukas began playing local gigs at such southern California hot spots as The Roxy, The Key Club, The Mint, and Viper Room. The year 2010 kicked off with a mini East Coast tour and Lukas working on his first full length album. Hollywood was released (July 2010) and debuted live at West Hollywood\u2019s famous Viper Room. The all acoustic Hollywood Stripped followed (August 2010). After moving to Nashville, in addition to local and out-of-town gigs, he wrote, recorded, produced, and released six additional recordings. The first three were Seed EP (December 2010), Story Teller (January 2011), and Super, Sex, Magic (February 2011). He also co-wrote, provided vocals, and recorded several music videos for a side-project, Switchblade Glory (April 2011). Lukas released Prophecy (November 2011) and Christmas Collection (December 2011) to complete a very busy year. But he wasn\u2019t finished, releasing the album 8 Days (April 2012) soon after. Lukas has appeared on many media outlets, including performing live at the 2006 Gemini awards, the CBS television series Rock Star: Supernova (18 million viewers worldwide), Ellen, Regis & Kelly, The Jimmy Kimmel Show, Entertainment Tonight, The Howard Stern Show, and ET Canada.

The blistering guitarist, soulful vocalist, singular songwriter and city bus driver fuses his muscular, rock-inspired blues guitar playing with his original, keenly detailed slice-of-life songs, blazing his own blues trail. With the 2016 release of his Alligator Records debut, The Chicago Way, Cannon burst onto the international stage as one the most electrifying bluesmen to emerge from Chicago in decades. His live performances unfailingly earn him heaps of critical praise and hordes of wildly enthusiastic fans. Cannon has played major cities all over the U.S., Canada, and Europe. He recently performed for the first time in Japan, delighting and surprising audiences with one unforgettable gig after another. Now, with the release of The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Cannon builds upon the foundation he\u2019s laid, creating and defining his vision of contemporary blues.\n\nThe Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp features twelve Cannon originals, ranging from the burning social commentary of the title track to the wryly told, up-to-the-minute truths of Insurance to the trademark Cannon humor of Stop Me When I\u2019m Lying and Ordinary Woman. He gets serious on the haunting The First 24, the Martin Luther King-inspired The Silence Of My Friends and on the moving final track, I\u2019m Not Scared. Cannon\u2019s blazing guitar and soul-baring vocals are front and center. His songwriting is inspired by his deep Chicago roots, the wisdom of his grandparents and his years of observing the public while driving a bus. His songs tell timeless stories of common experiences in uncommon ways.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the solos,\u201d Cannon says, \u201cIt\u2019s about the songs. People get used to everyday life, so it\u2019s easy to miss the things around them. I write about those things. I know the problems of Chicago, the hardship, 'cause we\u2019re always a scapegoat. But I choose to love and respect the city because of the Chicago blues giants that came here from down south. I\u2019m proud to be standing on the shoulders of every great Chicago blues musician who came before me.\u201d\n\nToronzo Cannon was born in the Windy City on February 14, 1968, and grew up in the shadows of the notoriously tough Robert Taylor Homes. Theresa\u2019s Lounge, one of the city\u2019s most famous South Side blues clubs, was nearby. As a child, Cannon would stand on the sidewalk outside the door, soaking up the live blues pouring out while trying to sneak a glance inside at larger-than-life bluesmen like Junior Wells and Buddy Guy. He also heard plenty of blues growing up in his grandfather\u2019s home, and listened to soul, R&B and contemporary rock on the radio.\n\nCannon bought his first guitar at age 22, and his natural talent enabled him to quickly master the instrument. Although his initial focus was reggae, he found himself increasingly drawn to the blues. \u201cIt was dormant in me. But when I started playing the blues, I found my voice and the blues came pouring out.\u201d He absorbed sounds, styles and licks from Buddy Guy, Albert Collins, Hound Dog Taylor, B.B. King, Albert King, Freddie King, Jimi Hendrix, J.B. Hutto, Lil\u2019 Ed and others. Although influenced by many, Cannon\u2019s biting, stinging guitar sound is all his own.\n\nCannon began his rise in the intensely competitive proving ground of the local club scene, where only the best musicians reach the top. Iconic blues artists from Muddy Waters to Howlin\u2019 Wolf to Koko Taylor to Hound Dog Taylor to Luther Allison all paid their dues in the Chicago blues bars before making their mark on the world. The same holds true today, as newcomers look to living legends like Buddy Guy, Jimmy Johnson and Lil\u2019 Ed Williams for inspiration in taking their music from Chicago to fans across the globe.\n\nFrom 1996 through 2002, Cannon played as a sideman for Tommy McCracken, Wayne Baker Brooks, L.V. Banks and Joanna Connor. But he was determined to prove himself. In 2001, while continuing to work as a hired-gun guitarist, he formed his own band, The Cannonball Express. By 2003, he was working exclusively as a band leader. Cannon\u2019s first three albums\u20142007\u2019s My Woman (self-released), 2011\u2019s Leaving Mood (Delmark) and 2013\u2019s Blues Music Award-nominated John The Conqueror Root (Delmark)\u2014document his rise from promising up-and-comer to star-in-the-making.\n\nAlmost immediately upon the release of The Chicago Way, Chicago media helped launch Cannon toward blues stardom. He was the subject of multiple newspaper and magazine feature stories and appeared on every local television station. National and international media soon took notice. CNN filmed Cannon leading a tour of Chicago blues clubs and then broadcast the piece around the world. England\u2019s MOJO magazine declared The Chicago Way the #1 Blues Album Of 2016, as did the readers of Living Blues magazine in their annual poll. The album and Cannon were also nominated for four Blues Music Awards (the Grammy of the blues) in 2017. And the world champion Chicago Cubs invited Cannon to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of the September 13, 2017 game. All the attention only makes Cannon more focused. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve become an ambassador for Chicago blues. People expect a lot from me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s good, because I\u2019m forced to keep upping my game.\u201d\n\nCannon has played the Chicago Blues Festival on ten separate occasions, initially as a sideman, then as a special guest, a sidestage band leader and finally as a main stage headliner. When he\u2019s home, he drives a Chicago Transit Authority bus by day and performs by night. Using every vacation day and day off and working four ten-hour shifts a week, Cannon arranges his schedule to gig out of town as much as possible. It isn\u2019t easy, but, like all of the Chicago greats who have come before him, blues is his calling. Blues Music Magazine declares, \u201cHis guitar playing has all the fire and spontaneity of the Chicago legends he carries; his songwriting is a timely and original look at the world he sees by day on a bus and in blues clubs by night, and his assertive voice is the perfect vehicle to deliver the message.\u201d\n\nNow, with The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Toronzo Cannon delivers his messages loud and clear. Between his searing chops, soul-satisfying vocals and vibrant and distinctive original songs, Cannon has grown from being a local attraction to become a world-renowned torch bearer for the blues. PBS Television\u2019s Chicago Tonight sums it up like this: \u201cCannon is just your typical CTA bus driver who moonlights as a sought-after Chicago blues musician. As a guitarist, singer and songwriter, he drives the sound of Chicago blues from the city to blues clubs and festivals around the world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CantStopTheBlues"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Beth Willis Rock Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10395335.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Acoustic, Country, American Pop, Rock", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Beth Willis kicks a** and takes names.

Some are party-rockers, using their natural and honed ability to feel out what the room needs and deliver it at exactly the right time. Some are tastemakers; responsible for showing you your next favourite track for the very first time, or maybe playing an old favourite in a way that makes it seem new again. Some are tricksters, who came up through the storied school of turntablism and belong to a small group keeping the niche art of scratching and juggling alive in the era of the digital DJ. And then there are the rare ones who bring a little bit of everything to the table\u2014or in this case, the turntables. Some call them \u201cthe DJ\u2019s DJ,\u201d and C-SIK is one of them.\n\nAfter starting his career as a turntablist battling in such competitions as the DMCs, over the last 10 years C-SIK has become one of Canada\u2019s most versatile DJ\u2019s. He began playing in clubs in 2007 and since then has become known for the undeniable style he brings to his sets, regardless if he\u2019s rocking an intimate basement jam or for a crowd of thousands. His crowd-reading ability and taste-making selections have brought him around the world to DJ in Toronto, San Francisco, Jersey City, Honolulu and everywhere in between. His competitive roots also led him to enter the Red Bull 3Style, where he won the Canadian title in 2014, going on to represent his country on the world stage in Azerbaijan.\n\nCloser to home he\u2019s been holding down coveted residencies at some of Calgary\u2019s best venues including Hifi Club and Untitled Lounge; and also co-founded one of the city\u2019s most successful old-school hip-hop and R&B parties, Rewind (which has consistently sold out its 1000+ person venue for eight years running). He\u2019s also passionate about sharing his love for his craft with the new generation, and since 2013 has been heading up the DJ program at Beat Drop, Calgary\u2019s first DJ and production school. He is also one of the founding members of Skratcher\u2019s Calgary chapter.\n\nWhether he\u2019s dropping a guest mix on Sway In The Morning, playing alongside De La Soul\u2019s Maseo or directly supporting Diplo; whether he\u2019s cuttin\u2019 it up to some classics or dropping the latest heaters\u2014C-SIK does it all with flavour and finesse.

First TV performance at age 6 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Alceo Bocchino with a Haydn concerto, and another two times the same concerto conducted by Eleazar de Carvalho and Isaac Karabtchevsky with the Orquestra Sinfonica Brasileira. At age 7 she performed Mozart KV488 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Edouard van Remoortel (Rio de Janeiro).\n\nIn the USA she received the \"special prize\" of the jury at the Van Cliburn competition, and she made an indelible impression with Beethoven\u00b4s piano concerto n.4 at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium.\n\nAfter the \"wonderkind\" and \"competitions\" happenings, she received invitations to perform in more than 25 countries. Her intelligence and brilliant musical feeling allow her to play a repertory of 61 piano concertos.\n\nIn 1990 she took up composing again, producing brilliant and at times mischievous cadenzas for her concertos. In 1994-95 she wrote her 15 Momentos Musicais and composed the Sonate Oubli\u00e9e with themes from her childhood. Her characteristics have remained unchanged: simplicity and spontaneity, feeling and imagination, technique, perfection without affectation, a delight for the eye and ear.\n\nIn February 1998 Rodrigues' Bach-CD was recorded. The critics describe her improvisations and paraphrases on works for the organ as: \"The sonorities go back to the scale of more than 3 centuries of piano literature and link perfectly well up with the richness in colour of an independent way of pianistic thinking, they have their own new life, a fascinating transfiguration, full of phantasy.\"\n\nAstonishment, admiration and even incredibility caused her Suite n.1 \"Rio de Janeiro\" for piano and orchestra, that was first performed on 9 August 2000.

Peddling a kind of jangly guitar pop not dissimilar to their Scottish contemporaries Aztec Camera and Orange Juice, they had three hit singles in the UK, all written by guitarist and founder member Bobby Bluebell (aka Robert Hodgens) - \"I'm Falling\" with Ken McCluskey , \"Cath\", and their biggest success \"Young At Heart\". The latter was co-written with Siobhan Fahey (with whom Hodgens was romantically linked for a while) and made it to No.8 in the UK singles chart on its original release in 1984. The band also released two albums, \"The Bluebells\" and \"Sisters\".\n\nThe band split up in the mid-1980s, but enjoyed an unexpected - albeit brief - revival in 1993 when \"Young At Heart\" was used in a Volkswagen TV commercial. Re-issued as a single, it was No.1 for four weeks and led to the band reforming temporarily to perform the song on Top of the Pops. A singles collection followed.\n\nAt the time of the 1990s revival, band member Lawrence Donegan - who trained as a journalist after the band's demise and is now golfing correspondent for The Guardian - wrote a newspaper article reminiscing about his days as a Bluebell which caused some friction between himself and the rest of the band. Amongst other anecdotes, he claimed that the group took part in a talent contest in Los Angeles in 1984, where a fellow contestant - an up-and-coming singer called Madonna - blew cigarette smoke into the band's faces and declared them to be \"losers\". The other ex-Bluebells are adamant that no such incident took place. Donegan has also published 'California Dreaming', a book based on his experiences selling used cars in Los Angeles.\n\nThe other members of the band stayed in the music business after the split. David McCluskey and his brother, Ken, formed a folk duo (www.myspace.com/mccluskeybrothers) . Robert Hodgens formed Up.

They were formed in Clydebank, Scotland in 1982. They took their name from the Scritti Politti song, \"Gettin, havin' and holdin'\".\n\nIn 1994 Wet Wet Wet had their biggest hit, with a cover version of the The Troggs single \"Love Is All Around\", which was a huge international success and spent 15 weeks at Number 1 in the British charts. Only Marti Pellow's insistence on deletion (he was bored of its chart domination, and overheard people complaining about it) prevented the song from possibly equalling and breaking, the record for the longest-standing Number 1 single, held by Bryan Adams.\nThe song was used on the soundtrack to the film Four Weddings and a Funeral. In the official UK best-selling singles list issued in 2002, it was placed 11th.\n\nDuring the rest of the 1990s the band maintained a strong UK following, although success in the singles charts became more sporadic. Pellow quit the band and went into rehab to battle a debilitating heroin addiction, while Tommy Cunningham resigned acrimoniously.\nPellow succeeded in kicking his habit, and returned to the public eye in 2001, with a solo album. In 2003, the Pellow and Cunnigham cautiously reformed with Graeme Clark and Neil Mitchell in order to work on a new record, and a single called \"All I Want\" which was released in October 2004.\n\nWet Wet Wet reunited in 2004 for a successful tour in the UK, and released a Greatest Hits album.\n\nIn 2005 Wet Wet Wet played at the Summer Weekender in England, and were one of the headline acts at Live 8 Edinburgh.\n\nWet Wet Wet's latest album Timeless was released in 2007.\n\nFor photographs and additional information visit Wet Wet Wet's official website, www.WetWetWet.co.uk .", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Honeyblood ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9133253.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Indie Pop, Indie, Pop, Alternative", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Buy our new album 'Babes Never Die' now! http://bit.ly/29NpXyz", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Wuh Oh ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Heartwork ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8424727.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Emotive Rock", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "UK Emotive Rock Debut album 'Things I Wish I'd Said' available now from www.heartworkmusic.co.uk", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Harri ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cairn String Quartet ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7382358.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Contempory, Classical", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Cairn String Quartet is an experience like no other \u2013 four of the UK's elite string players coming together to create a unique and inspirational orchestral show with a twist.

Nicky's resume boasts an impressive and lengthy discography of originals, remixes, edits and co-productions, proving again and again his ability to evolve with the ever-changing landscape of electronic music. Perhaps even more telling of his razor-sharp prowess and visionary mindset is the success and impact of his label Protocol Recordings, setting up recent collaborations with David Guetta, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike.\n\nIn the late 2000's, EDM was having its heyday, and Nicky Romero was at the forefront of the movement that would become one of the most significant cultural resurgences in decades. After releasing several singles early in his career, Nicky officially had his breakthrough moments with the viral anthem \"Toulouse\" and \"I Could Be the One\" (vs. Avicii), which to date has amassed over 185 million streams on Spotify alone. Nicky's meticulous skill as a producer led him to co-producing with legendary artists, both on Rihanna's hit \"Right Now\" and Britney Spears' \"It Should Be Easy.\" These early successes served to pave the way for the founding of Nicky's own label, Protocol Recordings.\n\nNicky created Protocol Recordings in 2012, and in the last six years it has grown from a record label to a truly multi-faceted household name in electronic music - but they're still only getting started. Nicky created Protocol to be a place of camaraderie between forward-thinking artists, always daring to break the mold through innovative sounds. Protocol's diverse list of artists currently includes Raiden, Maximals, Tom Tyger, Florian Picasso, Sunstars, Corey James and many more. To support the development of his artists, Nicky recently built Protocol Studios, a state-of-the-art complex with five production studios, a radio studio, and a live recording studio to encompass the end-to-end musical process.

Stamped with her affinity for finely crafted melodies and intricate storytelling, the project encompasses a blend of American music melding Rock, Soul, Rhythm and Blues, Country and Gospel. Maggie's recent album Change The Whole Thing was named by Rolling Stone as one of the \"Best Albums of 2018.\"\n\nThe resilient powerhouse recorded this album at the famed Starstruck Studios in Nashville, TN implementing an impressively demanding method highlighting an artist in complete command of her ever-evolving creative process: live with her 13-piece \u201cfamily band\u201d in one take, no overdubs, no bullshit and a sound that is best described by the following quote from Rolling Stone:\n\n\u201cMaggie Rose has come into her own with this current earth-conscious, trippy country-soul stage of her ever-evolving musical persona...Rose\u2019s performances [during CMA Fest and Bonnaroo] showed her embracing her inner soul diva, belting with fire on \u2018It's You\u2019 and the pulverizing \u2018Pull You Through.\u2019 Just to drive the point home, Rose and her band even stretched out on a swinging cover of \u2018The Letter,\u2019 doing a more-than-respectable impression of the funky Mad Dogs & Englishmen arrangement originally sung by Joe Cocker.\u201d\n\nLeading to the Fall album launch, Rose incrementally released four Digital 45s from her forthcoming project beginning in October 2017 to both satisfy and build the anticipation of her growing fanbase. The initial 45 earned her a spot in the Top 10 on Sirius XM with the \u201csmoldering\u201d A-side, \u201cPull You Through.\u201d The \u201cpulverizing\u201d single was hailed by Rolling Stone as a \u201csoulful ballad that rejoices in the healing powers of love...a bare-bones track [that is] really a showcase for the Dusty Springfield-worthy vocals of Rose\u2026\u201d.\n\nIn Spring of 2018, Maggie released \"It's You\" and \"Smooth.\" Rolling Stone once again praised Maggie Rose with \"It's You\" as \u201ca giant, throwback Soul ballad that shows off her dynamic vocals [containing] shades of Aretha Franklin,\u201d and also praised \"Smooth\" as \"a supremely funky rocker with hints of Grace Potter [and] Janis Joplin\".\n\nThe enthusiasm surrounding each Digital 45 release has continually increased the appetite of her fans while relentlessly expanding her following via radio, streaming platforms and through her captivating live performances. The full-length album will feature 12 songs, 12 live in-studio videos, with a full-access behind-the-scenes one-hour musical documentary which peels back the layers and allows the viewer an intimate look into the making of the album.\n\nRose has been named to YouTube\u2019s Emerging Artist and Artist in Residence 2018 programs, and Pandora named her an Artist to Watch 2018. In June, Maggie\u2019s creative breadth and versatility sparked the first-ever partnership between Prescription Songs and Sea Gayle Music, with the two companies signing a joint-venture publishing agreement with Rose. In July, she was tapped for an as-named synchronization deal that lends her voice to a national ad campaign focusing on Women\u2019s Empowerment.\n\nIn 2018, Maggie Rose has played over 150 dates across the world including\nBonnaroo Music and Arts Festival and The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, while sharing the stage with artists such as Kelly Clarkson, Julia Michaels, Brandy Clark, and Bob Weir of Grateful Dead.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "ATF ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/240841.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Col\u00e9 van dais ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10352089.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Rock, World Music, Pop, Indie, Alternative Rock, Adult Contemporary, African, Jazz", "Time": "4:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Cole van dais is an independent singer/ songwriter from South Africa performing original music, covers and tribute shows.\nFor more info and updates go to www.colevandais.com\n\nCol\u00e9 sings at festivals, theatres, country clubs, and corporate functions.

It\u2019s a musical relationship that has endured for over two decades, with band members playing in numerous projects together and apart. Following the 2012 release of their freewheeling Sounds Like This, the band took time off to work on various side projects. Zach Gill (keys/vocals) toured the world with the band\u2019s college pal Jack Johnson; Dan \u201cLebo\u201d Lebowitz (guitar/vocals) played shows with the Grateful Dead\u2019s Phil Lesh; Steve Adams (bass/vocals) toured and recorded with Nicki Bluhm & the Gramblers; Dave Brogan (drums/vocals) joined up with Utah band, Mokie. These and other endeavors have influenced the band\u2019s new album Tangle Of Time.\n\nMore than previous releases, Tangle Of Time really taps into what makes ALO unique. It\u2019s that special blend of classic songwriting and the ability to stretch out jams and distill dance floor grooves. It's heartfelt lyrics that make you smile, reflect and just want to sing along either way. It's four great musicians who all write and sing. And four friends who've been through a lot together and still support, challenge and inspire one another.\n\nEntering Allegiant Records in San Anselmo, California this past January with co-producer Dave Simon-Baker, the four members decided they\u2019d take a different recording approach. Instead of spending pre-production days jamming and co-writing, each member brought in their own demos, roughly three dozen in total, for the group to listen to, pick apart and eventually whittle down to the 11 songs that make up Tangle Of Time. Once they narrowed their focus, they turned their attention to arrangements and production techniques. Songs were tightened up, layers made more experimental and the end results validated their new approach.\n\nLebo described the shared respect and admiration the band felt during the recording process this way: \"There are four strong opinions in the room, but playing together for so long we've all become pretty good at the empathy thing at this point; we can be very Zen about it. We truly value being together at this point in our careers, and whatever we get from our solo and side gigs, no matter how much fun we have, it's not this.\"\n\nThat sort of maturity, the ability to take stock of your friends, loved ones, and collaborators, and truly appreciate them is certainly one of the cornerstones of Tangle Of Time. Lebo, Adams and Gill first started playing music together in middle school, and then with Brogan right after college. Somehow, these relationships have lasted, evolved and been made stronger every year. One can almost hear the group releasing a satisfied existential sigh throughout the album, finding acceptance, love and contentment with the world they've built.\n\n\"I really appreciate the guys right now, more so than ever,\" Gill shared, excitedly adding, \"Years ago the feeling was, 'I wanna get to my songs and see how they sound while we're all here', whereas now I'm rooting for everyone else's songs. It's great.\"\n\nThat approach of supporting each other\u2019s songs worked like a charm, capturing each member\u2019s distinct songwriting voice, while simultaneously expanding the notion of what an ALO song or album can be. Take for instance the one-two-punch of the synth-filled, spacey jam vehicle \"The Ticket\" and the pedal steel-driven easy-going happiness of \"Simple Times\". Although two ends of the sonic spectrum, both are classic Gill songs at their core but stretched wide and far by the band\u2019s collective effort.\n\nNot to be outdone, Lebo's guitar epic \"Undertow\" is a song that practically begs to be stretched out live, with its swirling double guitar outro intoxicating the listener to such a degree that you might find yourself on the band's website, dreamily purchasing tickets for an entire run of shows just to see where the song ventures live. Lebo pairs this with \"Push\", a jaunty yet thoughtful number with a playful guitar riff that's basically the musical equivalent of joy.\n\n\"Not Old Yet\" and \"Keep On\", Adams\u2019 contributions to the album, are also touchstones to the spirit of Tangle Of Time. The first is a light-hearted romp about keeping a positive perspective on life\u2019s long road of hurdles and surprises, while the second is an upbeat, forward-thinking sing-along with lines that could be the album's mantra: \"Wherever this takes us, I know/That we've got each other, we've still got a long way to go.\"\n\nBrogan's \"Coast To Coast\" is among the most intriguing songs on the record. He, along with co-writer buddy Ben Malan, came up with a layer-upon-layer soundscape consisting of beautifully esoteric textures. The funky but ominous track tells the surreal tale of a band on the run, with more ideas and energy than know-how. Brogan shared that the theme of \u201ctangled time\u201d materialized unexpectedly over the course of the sessions, elaborating: \"There's a point where there is more behind you than ahead of you, and you realize that time becomes a limiting factor.\"\n\nPut the record on your turntable, and you can clearly hear the band\u2019s excitement to get back on the road and explore these songs with their audience. Improvisation is a staple of what the band does, and as Adams stated: \"Being in that unknown is such a great life lesson beyond just the music. For all the careful planning and preparing we do, being in the moment is really when it all matters.\"\n\nThe band is also planning new ways to expand the theatrical shenanigans that have become a fantastic complement to the live show. From confetti canons to 12-foot beach balls, pre-show skits to elaborate theme nights, bubble suits to a laser-shooting ukulele (yes, really)... ALO is always on the hunt for new and exciting ways to interact with fans to make their shows truly special. Gill, the band's head prankster, put it this way: \"I want people to come to a show expecting to be engaged in a fun and creative way. When I see someone dancing or singing along or reaching out to hit a giant beach ball, I start playing to the dancer and at that point, it's really a circle of energy traveling back and forth from the stage. The larger theatrical concepts are ways of interacting with the audience on another level.\"\n\nOn Tangle Of Time the band has reached that other level, and are ready to bring everyone along.", "otherInfo": "60+ artists, one day!

There\u2019s one major distinction, however, that separates her from other similarly studied musicians. That is Holly\u2019s devotion to the legendary rock band Phish. Having attended over 300 shows by the Burlington-based quartet, she became obsessed by their famous rendition of \u201cTweezer\u201d from Lake Tahoe on July 31, 2013.

The process, both painstaking and fulfilling, inspired her to transform other Phish songs and well-known live jams into solo piano interpretations. Holly\u2019s breathtaking renditions of Phish classics like \u201cIt\u2019s Ice,\u201d \u201cThe Squirming Coil\u201d and \u201cHarry Hood\u201d serve not only as a tribute to the modern day kings of jam, but stand on their own as fully developed classical pieces.

The band\u2019s seventh album, Wildness, their first in seven years, entered the UK charts at Number Two, went gold, and kept them on tour around the world for the best part of 18 months.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gigging time, but also a lot of thinking time.\n\n\u201cWhere did it all go right?\u201d echoes Lighbtody. \u201cNo idea!\u201d the singer and songwriter laughs. \u201cAfter 10 years of no success, no one \u2013 least of all us \u2013 expected us these last 15 years to sell 17 million albums, headline festivals and play to thousands of people all over the world.\u201d\nAdd to that: one billion global track streams, five UK platinum albums, an Ivor Novello award and Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominations. And, in the shape of Chasing Cars, a modern classic recently anointed by the PPL as the most played song on UK radio of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWhen we released Final Straw in 2003, I think there was general goodwill around us from the media,\u201d continues Lightbody, \u201cas people knew the story of the previous 10 years and were kinda glad for us to get a shot on a major label,\" he notes of their move from indie Jeepster (also original home of Belle and Sebastian) to discerning Polydor imprint Fiction. That \u201csea-change\u201d set in motion the next phase of the band\u2019s existence. Still, in music, as in life, nothing is a given. \u201cOf course the good grace of the press is hard won and easy lost, but radio kept on playing us. That\u2019s been the real key to our success, I firmly believe. Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. On those shows we did some of the songs close to how they sound on the Reworked album \u2013 for example, the new version of You\u2019re All I Have came directly out of playing those acoustic shows.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re All I Have is the opening track from 2006\u2019s Eyes Open, the album that also featured Chasing Cars. On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain. Iain came up with the beautiful, John Martyn-style guitar, and his version floored me when I heard it the first time. Iain\u2019s guitar playing has always been a joy to listen to and to have it feature so prominently on this album is just amazing.\"\n\nAlso presented in simple acoustic simplicity is Chocolate, the third single from Final Straw, and produced here in classy, \u201ctime-stopping\u201d style by McDaid. \u201cChocolate has been a live favourite since we released it. It\u2019s a song all Snow Patrol fans know \u2013 I can\u2019t attest that they all love it but they know it!\u201d its co-author laughs. \u201cAnd we wanted to rework the songs that the fans are the most familiar with. There's not much point in reworking songs people don\u2019t really know as there's not really a stark contrast.\u201d\nThat said, \u201cwe will be doing something with the first two albums before the release of Reworked as those two albums do not feature for that same reason,\u201d Lightbody teases.\nWhat of the recent Twitter \u201caccusation\u201d that SP have \u201cdisowned\u201d those albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It\u2019s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2001), because they don\u2019t play the songs live?\n\u201cNot true at all,\u201d he replies with a shake of the head. \u201cWe are very proud of them. It\u2019s just that when we play those songs live they negatively affect the atmosphere of the gig. And as Star Trek taught us: \u2018The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat need to entertain and surprise also informed the approach taken to Called Out In The Dark. The curtain-raiser from 2011's Fallen Empires now comes with an inventive synth throb that echoes the original.\n\u201cI had worried a little that the whole record was getting very downtempo,\u201d admits Lightbody. \u201cThe nature of recording in hotel rooms and dressing rooms is that things will invariably be low-key. Hard to rock out with a family of four in the next hotel room trying to sleep!\n\u201cSo when it came to some of the songs we recorded towards the end of the new album, we wanted to explore a slightly higher tempo \u2013 without, of course, leaning too heavy into the original version. Called Out\u2026 is certainly the closest to the original version of any song on Reworked, but I think distinct enough to warrant its place. It has an electro bent like the original but steers clear of any of its predecessor\u2019s tropes. I asked Iain to lift it up and he sure did.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the three new songs. First up, the lovely, heart-stopping Time Won\u2019t Go Slowly.\n\u201cJohnny and I wrote this in his house in LA. We\u2019re both massive fans of Frank Ocean, so we wanted it to sound like Frank Ocean crossed with Frank Sinatra. All the Franks! It\u2019s a classic crooner track. We just wanted to try something starkly different from anything we have done before.\n\"As for the lyrics, I guess I\u2019ve not written about love for a while and needed a fix,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI like the idea of the inherent tragedy woven into the fabric of time: time speeds up when we're having a great time and slows down when we're miserable. Although it\u2019s all perception, of course, not reality. And I like that, too. That distortion. Our minds are powerful and sometimes terrible things. I guess the song tries to wrap its head around that great cosmic joke. Also it\u2019s just a love song.\"\nThen there\u2019s I Think of Home, a folk-flavoured piano ballad with vivid, evocative and deeply personal lyrics. Lightbody wrote it in 2014, as part of a five-song contribution \u201cto a night dedicated to my greatest literary hero Seamus Heaney when he opened the Seamus Heaney Home Place in Magherafelt. They wanted me to play a few songs at the opening night.\n\u201cI set my own rules for the songs\u2019 content,\" he expands. \"They had to be inspired by what Heaney had been inspired by: home, family, Ireland, The Troubles, hope, the soil\u2026\u201d\nI Think of Home was later considered for inclusion on Wildness, but none of the versions the band tried out in the studio fitted.\n\u201cBut then we went on tour with Wildness and at shows in Ireland and Irish strongholds like Boston, New York, Sydney and Melbourne, I would play I Think Of Home acoustically on my own in the middle of gigs. It would always go down well.\n\u201cSo when it came to Reworked we had lived with the song enough to feel like we could do a great version of it. And Johnny produced a stunning version of it. I had been playing it a certain way for so long it was hard for me to hear it any other way. That can be dangerous \u2013 stagnation can set in. So when that happens you have to let someone you trust take it from you and remake it. So, in the spirit of what we were doing, it was great to get a reworked version of a song that had never even been released.\"\nThe third new song is Made Of Something Different Now, which is quietly sweeping, quietly epic and wholly devastating.\n\u201cOne of my favourite tracks we have done in ages,\" nods Lightbody. \"In keeping with the Reworked attitude of trying new things, it\u2019s unlike much of what we\u2019ve done before. Lyrically, it\u2019s the story of a dear friend\u2019s heartbreak. My own heart, having not been in a relationship in ten years, is unrisked so unbroken. A damning self-portrait if ever there was one! Writing this song \u2013 with Johnny \u2013 made me realise my own lack of bravery in that department. Hasn\u2019t effected any change yet, mind you, but it did start me thinking at least\u2026 Anyway, as us Celts say, it\u2019s a belter,\u201d he grins.\n\nThe final word should go to Take Back The City. Gary Lightbody\u2019s hymn to Belfast is the song that opens Reworked and is sure to be an emotive live highlight when Snow Patrol take Reworked on the road later this year. As he reflects on 25 years of Snow Patrol, how have his feelings about the city changed in the 11 years since the song was released?\n\u201cWell, as the song says, I love Belfast tonight and always. There are still things that drive me crazy about the place. But I think that's the same for everyone\u2019s home city \u2013 although my home town, of course, is Bangor.\n\u201cMy love has deepened though not waned. I see the conflict that still goes on in people\u2019s hearts, my own included, and yet there is this drive in most people \u2013 most people \u2013 to put the past behind us and move on. To lift each other up.\n\u201cWe need that now more than ever with the looming clusterfuck that is Brexit and the devastation it has the potential to bring to the whole of UK, but to Northern Ireland more than anywhere else. We need that will to put the past behind us and lift each other.\u201d\n\nHear, hear. Equally, with these 16 inspiring, enveloping tracks, this is also moment to embrace the past \u2013 and, like the man said, to use it to lift each other. This is Reworked. This is Snow Patrol\u2019s history, and their legacy. And it\u2019s their inspired next step.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Leyla McCalla ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9571371.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Folk", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Leyla McCalla finds inspiration from a variety of sources, whether it is her Haitian heritage, living in New Orleans, or dancing at Cajun Mardi Gras.

Born in New York City to Haitian emigrant parents, Leyla was raised in suburban New Jersey. As a teenager, she relocated to Accra, Ghana for two years. Upon her return, she attended Smith College for a year before transferring to New York University where she studied cello performance and chamber music. Armed with Bach\u2019s Cello Suites, Leyla moved to New Orleans to play cello on the streets of the French Quarter.\n\n\nIt is the move to New Orleans that signaled a journey of musical and cultural discovery for Leyla. \u201cNew Orleans always felt like home to me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe more I learned about the history of Louisiana, its ties to Haiti and French speaking culture, the more sense of belonging I felt and continue to feel.\u201d Most recently, Leyla has fallen in love with the late Louisiana Creole fiddlers Canray Fontenot and B\u00e9b\u00e9 Carri\u00e8re and has explored their fiddling styles on the cello.\n\n\nLeyla\u2019s move to New Orleans also signaled a new stage in her career. It was while playing on the street that she caught the attention of Tim Duffy, the founder and director of the Music Maker Relief Foundation. He invited Leyla to join the Music Maker Relief Foundation family and introduced her to the Carolina Chocolate Drops, a renowned African-American string band. After appearing on the band\u2019s GRAMMY-nominated album Leaving Eden and touring extensively with the group, she now focuses on her solo career.\n\n\nVari-Colored Songs: A Tribute to Langston Hughes, Leyla\u2019s debut album, is set for a February 2014 release. The album, which has been years in the making for Leyla, was given a push after a successful Kickstarter campaign in which she surpassed her $5,000 goal by four times to ultimately raise over $20,000. Vari-Colored Songs consists of compositions she has written to Langston Hughes poetry, Haitian folk songs and original pieces. The album features musicians including Rhiannon Giddens and Hubby Jenkins of the Carolina Chocolate Drops as well as New Orleans\u2019 own Don Vappie on tenor banjo and Luke Winslow King on guitar.", "otherInfo": "Equal parts festivity, community coalescence and fundraiser for the work of EqualHealth, the concert will be an hour of connection and joy through music and friendship.

He runs a studio out of Tampa, hosts his own radio show The Miggs & Swig Show on iheart radio, and will be a vintage guitar collector and aficionado forever. However, he\u2019s bringing out his most powerful statement yet in 2015 with MIGGS.\n\n\u201cDammit, I care a lot,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cI want people to listen and feel like there\u2019s a melody, and it matters. Like somehow I gave them a piece of themselves. I told a story that makes them get lost in their moment. If I can do that, on even just one of these songs, I win. The rest of the time I want them tapping their feet or shaking their ass.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Songs, Stories, Sips, Support\n9pm EST\n\n\nYou nominate people you know who need a couple extra bucks, send their name to donate@miggs.com, join the live stream and donate a couple dollars to Don\u2019s Venmo or PayPal and he matches your donation and gives the money away.

Sure, the pair met in Montreal in 2008. But as anyone who's been to Nevada's Black Rock Desert will tell you, Burning Man years are like dog years, and by that measure, Blond:ish has been together for a lifetime. As a youngster growing up in Canada, Vivie Ann aspired to be a computer hacker. Equally unique in her goals, Anstascia sought the acceptance of nerds. Both say they failed miserably. Eventually, their broken-heart trails converged and they created a midweek party in Montreal. Every Wednesday, they would promote, party, and DJ at the nightclub Cherry. These days, Viv and Anstascia are savy travelers. Their original productions and DJ sets are inspired, in part, by their travels and spiritual encounters. Tribal dudes chant and hum on the duo's new track, \u201cMoonbow.\u201d Dave Gahan, lead singer of Depeche Mode, provides the vocals in Blond:ish's remix of the legendary English band's \u201cShould Be Higher.\u201d Plus, they're driven to share their passion with the world, one listener at a time. \u201cA lot of people have never heard of us. Some people don\u2019t take us seriously,\" Anstascia says. \"We\u2019re doing our best to show that our music speaks for itself.\u201d In 2015 they released their album \u2018Welcome to the Present\u2019 on Kompakt Records. The LPs journey of field recordings, traditional instruments and polyglot vocals results in a masterfully crafted, intoxicating soundscape unlike any other debut album out there. It only served to further their musical journey. 2017 sees remixes for DJ Sabo, a Modular Project remix of their classic Wizard of Love, \u2018Moonbow\u2019 on Monkey Safari\u2019s Homage label, as well as more new original music to come throughout the year. It is also the year they launch ABRACADABRA, their own event series and label which had its test run in Tulum January 2017 and will spend the season leaving its mark on Scorpios, Mykonos for 6 weeks of the summer.

D Generation charged onto the scene with downtown swagger while 'The Fine Art of Self-Destruction', his Ryan Adams\u2019s produced first solo album, combined this toughness with heart-rending lyrics reminiscent of Steve Earle and Tom Waits. Subsequent work refine rock in the vein The Hold Steady and The Strokes while cultivating a personal lyrical approach a la Wilco or Elliot Smith. In \u2018Sunset Kids,\u2019 the genres and influences gel and Jesse Malin steps assuredly into the role of street-savvy, roots-minded songster.\n\nA prolific writer and relentless road warrior, Jesse Malin continues to circle the globe with his New York based band and produce critically acclaimed studio albums.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}]
