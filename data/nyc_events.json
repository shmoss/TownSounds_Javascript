And that makes Rodg one of the rare-breed. The humble Dutchman is one of the best kept Armada Music secrets, delivering top-notch releases on a regular basis.\n\nAn impressive string of features on various Armada compilations proved to be the stepping stone for Rodg, renowned for a sound that sticks out. Since, he has put out a slew of genre-defying cuts, changing the game entirely through massive collaborations and solid remixes for artists such as Paul Oakenfold, Armin van Buuren, Solid Stone, Cosmic Gate and Ruben de Ronde.\n\nThanks to extensive support from a gamut of top-tier performers (e.g. Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Above & Beyond, Markus Schulz, Gareth Emery, Nicky Romero, W&W, Andrew Rayel and even Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and David Guetta), Rodg has been getting the recognition he deserves, even touted \u201cOne of the best producers of 2016\u201d by Armin van Buuren. Seeing his in-studio diligence pay off, Rodg released his debut album in mid-2016 and grabbed early support from Armin van Buuren, Gareth Emery and Above & Beyond, all the while riding the US airwaves with title track \u2018High On Life\u2019, which accumulated over two million streams on Spotify to date.\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t stop there. After countless collaborations with long-time friend and production partner Ruben de Ronde, on came a collaborative effort that dropped jaws and pushed their sound to an even higher level. With their joint album called \u2018Togetherr\u2019, Rodg and Ruben de Ronde emerged with a body of work that serves as a testament to their consistent high-quality output and became Mixmag\u2019s \u201calbum of the month\u201d with a 9 out of 10 rating.\n\nOn the live front, the Rodg sound has become inseparable from Armin van Buuren\u2019s live sets and the Dutchman himself has since brandished his own sonic blend at A State Of Trance shows in Utrecht, Ibiza, and Mexico, Armada Nights, and various other unforgettable shows at H\u00ef Ibiza, Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival and more. He is the workhorse of the Armada family and a mainstay on countless worldwide Dance compilations. He is the present and the future of Electronic Dance Music, yet seemingly always underrated.

Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011. Elephant Mountain has just recorded their new album and will be releasing it Spring/Summer of 2013. He's lent his vocal expertise to many local releases, and appears on MUSHROOMHEAD\u2019s album, \u201cBeautiful Stories For Ugly Children\u201d, singing on the track \u201cHoles In The Void\u201d\n\nAnd not to be outdone Joe has released three cd\u2019s of original material, \u201cJUST JOE SOLO EP\u201d (December 2011), \u201cMy Demons, My Burden, My Life\u201d (May of 2012) and \u201cGot Joe?\u201d (December of 2012).

In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture. As the resident DJ since 2004 of some of Vegas\u2019 hottest clubs and lounges including Rum Jungle, Jet Nightclub & Koi Nightclub inside of the Planet Hollywood. Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip. Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cFRIDAY NIGHT HYPE\u201d EVERY FRIDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

Artists covered in concert by Umphrey's range from Lionel Richie to Metallica to Toto to Snoop Dogg to James Taylor.\n\nFormed at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two popular Notre Dame rock bands. Early concerts consisted of both originals and cover songs, including Guns N' Roses's \"Patience\" and Vince Guaraldi's Peanuts theme \"Linus and Lucy.\"\n\nIn mid-1998, after only 8 months together, the band released their debut album complete with a tongue-in-cheek title, Greatest Hits Vol. III. The group decided to record an album immediately because it was easier to get live gigs with an official CD. Long out of print, the album contains many of Umphrey's future concert warhorses, such as \"Divisions\" and \"All in Time.\"\n\nShortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. By 1999, the band had gained notoriety outside of Indiana, especially with the release of the live album Songs for Older Women, which featured live tracks recorded over a two-night stand in November 1998.\n\nThe addition of Jake Cinninger in September 2000 helped bring the band's musical dynamic to a new level. Cinninger, an accomplished guitarist, brought a distinct heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar).\n\nThe band released another live album, One Fat Sucka, which contained live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.\n\nAround 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive jam sessions took place in a hotel in the \"Jimmy Stewart Ballroom\" during the wedding of fan/website designer Jeremy Welsh. Therefore, the band began to call their onstage improvisational excursions \"Jimmy Stewart.\" This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers and has been extensively outlined by \"McL\" in the \"Jimmy Stewart writeup\" on the fan message board known as \"The Bort\" at www.umphreaks.com.\n\n2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK. That summer, the first annual Bonnaroo Festival took place in rural Manchester, TN, and featured over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people. Umphrey's played to their largest audience to date. They would go on to play Bonnaroo in 2004 and again in 2006.\n\nThe band almost ended in late 2002 when drummer Mike Mirro announced he was leaving the band to attend medical school. After hundreds of tapes were reviewed by percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers, who has a masters degree in jazz drumming from DePaul University.\n\nIn 2004, the band released the critically acclaimed Anchor Drops, and released Safety in Numbers two years later in April 2006.\n\nIn April, 2007, Umphrey's released their fifth studio effort, The Bottom Half, an album of leftover tracks from the Safety in Numbers sessions. The album was supported with tours of the USA, Europe, and Japan.\n\nBrendan Bayliss is also working on a studio album with Jeff Austin of Yonder Mountain String Band.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.livexlive.com/live-events/festival/lfot-summer-camp-weekend-pass"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Khris Royal ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8964801.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Jazz, Funk, Rock, Rnb, Edm", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Khris Royal was born to be a musician.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

He emerged at Papunya in 1980 as a founding member of the pioneering Warumpi Band, which over three albums (Big Name No Blankets, Go Bush and Too much Humbug) and twenty years of performing thrust contemporary indigenous music into mainstream Australia. Yielding such classic songs as My Island Home, Blackfella Whitefella, Fitzroy Crossing, Jailanguru Pakarnu, Stompin Ground, From The Bush and Waru.\n\nHe has since become one of Australia\u2019s finest singer/songwriters, enjoying a solo career since 1989. He has released a remarkable string of albums - the latest being Blood & Longing.\n\nHis song writing is diverse- from the rollicking Good Light in Broome, the prayerful Native Born, and healing Myall Creek, the roots groove of Long Grass Band and Eddie Mabo, the journeyman monologues of Lights of Hay and Where My People Go, the contemplation of place in Burrumbeep Hill and Whispering Casuarina to the recent Cry My Darling and Byjantic Man.\n\nCollectively, Neil's work has done much to deepen Australia\u2019s contemporary music heritage.\n\nIn 1995, Neil Murray was awarded the APRA song of the year for My Island Home - originally written for the Warumpi Band and re-recorded by Christine Anu. My Island Home featured in the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the opening ceremony of the recent 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth games.\n\nIn 2007, Jailanguru Pakarnu- (Out From Jail) a song he co-wrote with Warumpi Band guitarist Sammy Butcher in the indigenous Luritja language- was honoured by the National Film and Sound Archives, Sounds of Australia series, as a significant recording in Australia\u2019s heritage. Credited as the first commercially released pop rock single in an indigenous language. In 2016, My Island Home, as recorded by Christine Anu, received the same honour.\n\nIn recognition of his influence, Neil Murray was awarded the 2017 Port Fairy Folk Festival Artist of the Year.\n\nNeil Murray\u2019s songs have been recorded by Mary Black, Jimmy Little, Missy Higgins, Liz Stringer, Christine Anu, Peter Denahy, Carus, Adam Brand, Amy Saunders, Powderfinger, The Tiddas, Ursula Yovich, Peter Brandy, Emma Donovan and the Warumpi Band.\n\nIn 2019, he is performing nationally for his Blood & Longing tour.\n\nWhispering Casuarina video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/etiA4IsaAD0\nneilmurray.com.au\nyoutube/neilmurraymusic", "otherInfo": "Neil Murray Live Streamed as part of The Saltwater Music Festival.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thesaltystage\n\nPLEASE NOTE THE TIME DIFFERENCE!\n2pm for WA, 4pm for Eastern states and 3.30pm for Central states!\n\nPAY WHAT YOU CAN - https://www.paypal.me/bulukbaraman"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Zeplin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8866852.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Techno", "Time": "6:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "soundcloud.com/zeplinproject\ntwitter.com/zeplinproject\ninstagram.com/zeplinproject", "otherInfo": "Live stream at https://live.bandsintown.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SHIBA SAN ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8455386.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Bass House, Teckno, Deep House, Tech House, Electronic, Minimal House, House", "Time": "6:10 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "There\u2019s much more to Shiba San than what meets the first listen. Leaving behind a 15-year long\ncareer of production experience in the French hip-hop scene, the Parisian producer became\nfascinated with the sounds of Chicago house and was inspired to create his own productions, infusing his hip-hop influence with the soul of house music.\n\nThen came \u2018Okay\u2019, the track that \u201cchanged the way we listened to music\u201d (Dancing Astronaut) and became the anthem of 2014. It claimed the No. 1 position on Beatport\u2019s House chart for 82 days, remained in the House Chart\u2019s Top 10 for over 180 days, was put on rotation by radio tastemakers like Pete Tong, Annie Mac and Danny Howard and received support from the likes of Claude\nVonStroke, Eats Everything, Green Velvet and nearly every major DJ under the sun. Upon its release, Rolling Stone deemed \u2018Okay\u2019 a \u201cglobal club sensation in waiting,\u201d a prophetic description that couldn\u2019t have rung more true as it remains a commanding moment in DJ sets even to this day.\n\nBut Shiba San is far from a one-hit wonder, following up \u201cOkay\u201d with the award-winning track \u201cBurn Like Fire\u201d (Best Underground Track 2015 IDMA/WMC). With releases out on labels known and loved for their irresistible tunes like Dirtybird and Suara, as well as his own imprint Basement Leak, he\u2019s since seen his career launch off far and beyond the city limits of Paris.\n\nStaying quiet on the public front, Shiba San remains a curious enigma to his international fan base, allowing the music to do the talking for him. In between releases and time spent concocting in the studio, the Miami-based producer remains a mainstay on the nightlife circuit, hitting iconic festivals including Coachella, EDC Las Vegas, Movement Detroit, The BPM Festival in Mexico, The\nWarehouse Project, Stereosonic, Spring Awakening as well as milestone venues like Output in New York, Ministry of Sound in London, Sankeys in Ibiza, Exchange in Los Angeles and The Mid in Chicago.\n\nEnding last year with two impressive Dirtybird releases \u2018Up & Down\u2019 and \u2018You Know What?\u2019, Shiba San began 2017 with a hearty compilation release on his own Basement Leak label featuring his standout tune \u2018Drop It\u2019 before embarking on a North American co-headlining tour with the esteemed MK. Later this spring, expect to hear a collaboration with Will Clarke on Dirtybird as well as a summer release on Lee Foss\u2019 Repopulate Mars.

He has released a series of chart-topping albums with sales of over a million copies, sells out the most prestigious concert halls worldwide, composed a string of award-winning film scores and routinely tops audience polls becoming an internet phenomenon. With a unique musical alchemy that draws on elements of classical, rock, electronica and world musics he has rendered traditional ideas of genre and audience divide obsolete and become not only one of the best known composers in the world today but almost certainly the best loved too.\n\nLudovico was born in Turin, Italy and trained as a classical composer and pianist at the Milan Conservatorio before continuing his studies with Luciano Berio, one of the most important composers of the twentieth century avant-garde. His career began with a series of prestigious commissions for institutions such as the USA\u2019s Tanglewood Festival and Paris\u2019 IRCAM but he turned away from what seemed a glittering classical career to forge his own musical path, giving him the freedom to reconcile his wider-ranging influences.\n\nIt was a bold strategy but one quickly rewarded, when Ludovico\u2019s electric harp suite \u2018Stanze\u2019 (1997) was first played on BBC Radio the switchboard jammed with listeners. It was a similar story with his next release \u2018Le Onde\u2019 (1998), a solo piano cycle he performed himself. A listener-organised campaign made it Ludovico\u2019s breakthrough and a permanent fixture atop the Classic FM charts. This upswell of grass roots activity, snowballing with the onset of the internet and social media, has allowed Ludovico to build a uniquely close relationship directly with his audience.\n\n\u2018Le Onde\u2019 also ignited Ludovico\u2019s career in Film & TV music and he has since composed many award-winning scores including \u2018Doctor Zhivago\u2019 (2002) and \u2018Sotto Falso Nome\u2019 (2004) which also became successful albums in their own right. In recent years Shane Meadows\u2019 acclaimed film \u2018This Is England\u2019 (2006) and its television sequel \u2018This Is England \u201886\u2019 (2010) have brought a BAFTA nomination for Ludovico and introduced his music to a huge new audience, Countless television programmes feature his music and the ad world has incorporated it in campaigns for brands including American Airlines, Vodafone, Sony Blu-ray and John Lewis.\n\nLudovico built on the impact of \u2018Le Onde\u2019 with a series of albums notable for their exuberant experimentation. \u2018Eden Roc\u2019 (1999) saw an array of guest musicians and instruments ranging from electric guitar to the Armenian duduk. \u2018I Giorni\u2019 (2001) deepened this engagement with world music in Ludovico\u2019s second collection for solo piano. His \u2018best of\u2019 collection from these first four albums \u2018Echoes: The Einaudi Collection\u2019 (2003) has since sold more than 100,000 copies.\n\nAs Ludovico\u2019s fame grew, his concert schedule naturally grew along with it and became an increasingly important part of his life. It immediately led to two new albums, Diario Mali (2005), a collaboration with kora virtuoso Ballak\u00e9 Sissoko and his first live solo album \u2018La Scala Concert 03.03.03\u2019 (2003), recorded in his adopted city of Milan.\n\nThe release of \u2018Una Mattina\u2019 (2004) saw more \u2018firsts\u2019, it was Ludovico\u2019s debut album on new and current record label Universal and also his most \u2018classical\u2019 to date. Largely written for solo piano, it leapt to the top of the UK Classical album chart and gave him his first sold-out UK tour.\n\nNow one of the most popular composers in the UK and throughout Europe, at home Ludovico\u2019s reputation scaled even loftier heights and thus on May 26th, 2005 in Rome, Ludovico Einaudi was awarded the \u2018Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana\u2019 (or \u2018OMRI\u2019) the senior order of Knighthood bestowed by the Italian Republic.\n\nThe stage was set for \u2018Divenire\u2019 (2007) his most musically ambitious album yet and his greatest commercial success to date. \u2018Divenire\u2019 gathered many of the musical \u2018streams\u2019 that had flowed through Ludovico\u2019s career and expanded on them with the help of The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and a battery of digital effects.\n\nOn release it became a phenomenon, topping classical charts throughout Europe and crashing the Italian pop charts. With sales in excess of 300,000 copies and a BRIT awards \u2018Album of the Year\u2019 nomination, Ludovico embarked on his biggest tour yet, 80 dates across Europe. One was captured for his second live album \u2018Live In Berlin\u2019 (2008) and it all culminated at a memorable concert at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall.\n\nWith people around the globe now clamoring to see him Ludovico became a permanent fixture on the road, traveling to new audiences in India, Japan and the USA. Along the way he formed a collaboration with Robert Lippock of post-rock band \u2018To Rococo Rot\u2019 and the results would be heard in two albums released in 2009, one featuring Ludovico as \u2018band member\u2019, the other as a solo artist.\n\nFirst was \u2018Cloudland\u2019 (2009) the debut from \u2018Whitetree\u2019 - comprising Ludovico on piano, Robert Lippok on electronics, and Robert\u2019s brother Ronald Lippok on drums - which has a sunny African feel amid the cutting-edge electronics and percussion.\n\n\u2018Nightbook\u2019 (2009) Ludovico\u2019s seventh solo album was a perfect contrast. Meditative and introspective it charts an inward voyage through dreams and the shadows of the psyche with evocative use of electronics. Ludovico calls it his \u2018Dark Side of The Moon\u2019 and though challenging, it too found immediate resonance with his audience who once again took Ludovico to the summit of the charts and back into the concert halls.\n\nThe \u2018Nightbook\u2019 tour produced \u2018The Royal Albert Hall Concert\u2019 (2010) a double CD and DVD documenting Ludovico\u2019s concert at the venue in March 2010. Drawing on every part of a now distinguished career, it shows a composer and performer at the very height of his creative powers.\n\nIN A TIME LAPSE \u2013 (2013)\nIn A Time Lapse was composed over a period of two years and recorded in October 2012 in a monastery near Verona, Italy.\nThe 14 pieces that compose the album range between piano, strings, percussion and electronics. As with the previous albums, In A Time Lapse develops as a suite with a concept that recalls the form of a novel divided in different chapters.\nEpic and emotional as Divenire, experimental and adventurous as Nightbook, In A Time Lapse moves even further exploring new textures and arrangements that blends different musical worlds into one. Within the classical style of Ludovico, in this album you can hear echoes of baroque and Italian folk music, late romantic strings textures, and a wide variety of colors between percussion and electronics, appearing throughout a journey that transport the listener through a deep reflection on the idea of time, with the words of Ludovico \"when you get conscious that our time is limited, it\u2019s the moment where you try to fill that space with all your energy and emotions and start to imagine beyond the limits and live every moment of your life fully as when you were a child\".\n\nThe album features Ludovico's band, the string orchestra I Virtuosi Italiani and violinist Daniel\nHope that appears in four pieces: Life and Experience together with I Virtuosi Italiani, Underwood, a touching duet with Ludovico, and Orbits where the solo violin climbs the sky towards infinity.\n\nWith albums topping innumerable charts and concerts selling out the world\u2019s most prestigious halls, country after country has taken Ludovico to its heart and seem certain to continue to for many years to come.\n\n\nFor more information contact: Karen Lee at Evolution Promotion - 978.658.3357 or at klee@evolutionpromotion.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "ATYYA ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8968433.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Deep Dubstep, Downtempo, Trap, Bass Music, Chillstep", "Time": "8:45 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "ATYYA - pronounced [ Ah-Tie-Ah ].

Since then, Rinaly has kept releasing singles on AVA White with titles such as \u201cLucid Dream\u201d, \u201cObservatory\u201d, \u201cRevolving Lantern\u201d, and \u201cAstrology\u201d which also got worldwide support from Armin van Buuren, Aly & Fila, Paul van Dyk, Andrew Rayel, Alex M.O.R.P.H., and many more.\n\nIn 2018, Rinaly got voted as the 87th best Trance DJ in the world at the most notable trance DJ ranking, Trance Podium Top 100 DJs, making her the best Trance DJ in Asia.\n\nThe following year has been great so far for Rinaly. The track \u201cForalskad\u201d (FSOE Fables) and her remix of Yang & Diana Leah's \u201cFuel The Fire\u201d (AVA White) with lots more to come. Finding fame way outside of her native Japan, Rinaly can easily be recognized as one of the DJ/Producers with the most momentum on the Trance scene worldwide.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Todd Terry ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10390139.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "House, Hip Hop, Club, Dance, Acid House", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Grammy Award nominated DJ/Producer Todd Terry has been engulfed in dance music since he first started listening to European dance music records while growing up in Brooklyn. Already devoted to turntables, he heard something different in those tracks, and he \u201cwent for the difference. I never got a break in New York, but England happened right away, so I catered to them.\u201d In any event, the Todd Terry sound was born.\n\nBy 1988, Todd Terry hit big in England and Europe, and his notoriety was making its way back to the U.S. In addition to DJ appearances, Todd was cutting his classic underground tracks A Day In The Life, Weekend, and Can You Party, released under monikers such as the Todd Terry Project, House Of Gypsies, and Royal House, all considered essential and ground breaking.\n\nIn the mid 90\u2019s, the Ministry of Sound\u2019s eponymous UK label released A Day In The Life, a collection of Todd Terry tracks that had been causing dance floor panic. That then led the way to a deal with Mercury Records allowing him to set up a context in which to work with his favourite singers and performers. The first release, Keep On Jumpin\u2019 on featured a vocal workout from super-divas Martha Wash and Jocelyn Brown, together for the first time ever. The song became a top 10 UK crossover pop hit and worldwide smash. Todd followed with the anthem \u2018Somethin Going On\u2019, a top 5 UK crossover pop hit.\n\nAll the while, Todd continued to break new ground as a Producer/Remixer. From SNAP to Annie Lennox to George Michael to Bjork, Todd\u2019s mixes bridge the ground between club cool and commercial accessibility. In 1995, his remix for Everything But The Girl\u2019s Missing became a worldwide smash, giving the British duo their first ever hit. He then rode the charts with mixes for Garbage (Stupid Girl), The Cardigans (Love Fool), Everything But The Girl (Wrong), 10,000 Maniacs (More Than This), Jamiroquai (Alright), The Cardigans (Been It), and The Lightning Seeds (You Showed Me),.among others. He also produced a Robin S track (Givin\u2019 You All That I\u2019ve Got) for the multi-platinum Space Jam soundtrack.\n\nTodd is one of the world\u2019s most celebrated figures in dance music. With almost two decades of dance floor domination under Todd\u2019s belt the quality of his productions goes from strength to strength.

Her musical talent was discovered early on and fostered by Helena Guimar\u00e3es Galo and Arnaldo Estrella (student of Alfred Cortot and friend of Villa Lobos), at the Conservatory of Antwerp student of Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge, student of Arthur Schnabel>Leon Fleisher>Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge.\n\nShe played a first recital at the age of 5 in the Teatro Mesbla in Rio de Janeiro. First TV performance at age 6 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Alceo Bocchino with a Haydn concerto, and another two times the same concerto conducted by Eleazar de Carvalho and Isaac Karabtchevsky with the Orquestra Sinfonica Brasileira. At age 7 she performed Mozart KV488 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Edouard van Remoortel (Rio de Janeiro).\n\nIn the USA she received the \"special prize\" of the jury at the Van Cliburn competition, and she made an indelible impression with Beethoven\u00b4s piano concerto n.4 at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium.\n\nAfter the \"wonderkind\" and \"competitions\" happenings, she received invitations to perform in more than 25 countries. Her intelligence and brilliant musical feeling allow her to play a repertory of 61 piano concertos.\n\nIn 1990 she took up composing again, producing brilliant and at times mischievous cadenzas for her concertos. In 1994-95 she wrote her 15 Momentos Musicais and composed the Sonate Oubli\u00e9e with themes from her childhood. Her characteristics have remained unchanged: simplicity and spontaneity, feeling and imagination, technique, perfection without affectation, a delight for the eye and ear.\n\nIn February 1998 Rodrigues' Bach-CD was recorded. The critics describe her improvisations and paraphrases on works for the organ as: \"The sonorities go back to the scale of more than 3 centuries of piano literature and link perfectly well up with the richness in colour of an independent way of pianistic thinking, they have their own new life, a fascinating transfiguration, full of phantasy.\"\n\nAstonishment, admiration and even incredibility caused her Suite n.1 \"Rio de Janeiro\" for piano and orchestra, that was first performed on 9 August 2000. She plaid and recorded in St. Petersburg the 5 concerto's for piano from Sergei Prokofiev with the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n1998 - 2014 she is invited in a.o. Amsterdam, Antwerp, Brussels, Den Haag, Lisbon, Moscow, New-York, N\u00fcrnberg, Rotterdam, St. Petersburg, Volgograd, Z\u00fcrich.\n\nOver the last few years Eliane Rodrigues has also won great acclaim as a conductor. She has trained with Herbert Slegers (theory), Alexander Dmitriev, Edward Serov, Dmitri Liss and Juozas Domarkas (practical), Gloria Rodrigues-da Silva, prima ballerina (choreographer/kinematics).\n\nShe can now lead the orchestra to produce great classical compositions as she has already done for example with Beethoven\u2019s piano sonatas.\n\nEliane Rodrigues is professor on the Royal Conservatory of Antwerp.", "otherInfo": "Come join Eliane at home and listen to various pieces of her vast repertoire!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nagaraj Talluri ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SonuNigam ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Grove ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8190956.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Brett Und Akustik F\u00fcr Hoffnung, Herz Und Seele", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Es groovt, hat verdammt viel Dynamik, Songs mit deutschen und englischen Texten, Melodien inspiriert von Weltschmerz, Liebe, Wut und Gl\u00fcckseligkeit, das ist GROVE.

Ihr Gesang und die Band bilden eine emotionale Einheit, sodass Ihre eigenen St\u00fccke tief ber\u00fchren, aber auch m\u00e4chtig rocken k\u00f6nnen. Mit dieser grandiosen eigenst\u00e4ndigen Mischung hat sich die Band bereits in die Herzen ihrer Zuh\u00f6rer gespielt. Grove \u2013 setzen einfach pure Emotionen frei. They groove, they have a stunning dynamics, lyrics written in German and English, tunes inspired by world weariness, love, anger, bliss, and pain. That\u00b4s GROVE.

Schnell war klar, dass das gemeinsame Potenzial voll ausgesch\u00f6pft werden musste. Mit Unterst\u00fctzung von Alex (ehem. Loungefly) am Bass, fanden die ersten gemeinsamen Akustik-Konzerte statt. F\u00fcr die perkussive Begleitung sorgte seinerzeit Hannes Weber, Drummer der Phunkas Symatrix. Weil sich die Rock \u00b4n\u00b4 Roll Seele langfristig nicht nur mit gediegenem Akustik-Sound zufrieden geben kann, wurden im Sommer 2009 die gute alte Paula und die druckfreudige Ricki entstaubt ;) und ihrer eigentlichen Bestimmung zugef\u00fchrt: dem dr\u00f6hnenden Fr\u00f6nen \u00fcber die guten alten R\u00f6hren. Aber \u201cOhne Drummer kein vern\u00fcnftiges Gitarrengejammer\u201c, so stie\u00df Stefan Reese (ehem. Sonic Front, Mindwise) am Schlagzeug hinzu, um dem bisherigen und zuk\u00fcnftigen Repertoire seinen Soundstempel aufzudr\u00fccken. Es entstehen u.a. die Songs \u201cEssenziell\u201c und \u201cInfancy, Maturity & Uncertainty\u201c, die mit Unterst\u00fctzung von Lars Oppermann (Eat No Fish, Superstarfuckers, Dan Hiob Experiment, High Speed Karmageddon) in 2010 dann die ersten Tracks auf ihrem aktuellen Demo werden. 2011 wird Martin als zweiter Gitarrist angeheuert um den Grove-Sound auch LIVE noch fetter zu gestalten. Pressestimmen: \u201cMan w\u00e4hnt sich in der Flower-Power-\u00c4ra. Sp\u00e4te Sechziger, Singer-Songwriter-Rock mit politischer und gesellschaftskritischer Aussage. Aber immer entspannt.

He emerged at Papunya in 1980 as a founding member of the pioneering Warumpi Band, which over three albums (Big Name No Blankets, Go Bush and Too much Humbug) and twenty years of performing thrust contemporary indigenous music into mainstream Australia. Yielding such classic songs as My Island Home, Blackfella Whitefella, Fitzroy Crossing, Jailanguru Pakarnu, Stompin Ground, From The Bush and Waru.\n\nHe has since become one of Australia\u2019s finest singer/songwriters, enjoying a solo career since 1989. He has released a remarkable string of albums - the latest being Blood & Longing.\n\nHis song writing is diverse- from the rollicking Good Light in Broome, the prayerful Native Born, and healing Myall Creek, the roots groove of Long Grass Band and Eddie Mabo, the journeyman monologues of Lights of Hay and Where My People Go, the contemplation of place in Burrumbeep Hill and Whispering Casuarina to the recent Cry My Darling and Byjantic Man.\n\nCollectively, Neil's work has done much to deepen Australia\u2019s contemporary music heritage.\n\nIn 1995, Neil Murray was awarded the APRA song of the year for My Island Home - originally written for the Warumpi Band and re-recorded by Christine Anu. My Island Home featured in the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the opening ceremony of the recent 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth games.\n\nIn 2007, Jailanguru Pakarnu- (Out From Jail) a song he co-wrote with Warumpi Band guitarist Sammy Butcher in the indigenous Luritja language- was honoured by the National Film and Sound Archives, Sounds of Australia series, as a significant recording in Australia\u2019s heritage. Credited as the first commercially released pop rock single in an indigenous language. In 2016, My Island Home, as recorded by Christine Anu, received the same honour.\n\nIn recognition of his influence, Neil Murray was awarded the 2017 Port Fairy Folk Festival Artist of the Year.\n\nNeil Murray\u2019s songs have been recorded by Mary Black, Jimmy Little, Missy Higgins, Liz Stringer, Christine Anu, Peter Denahy, Carus, Adam Brand, Amy Saunders, Powderfinger, The Tiddas, Ursula Yovich, Peter Brandy, Emma Donovan and the Warumpi Band.\n\nIn 2019, he is performing nationally for his Blood & Longing tour.\n\nWhispering Casuarina video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/etiA4IsaAD0\nneilmurray.com.au\nyoutube/neilmurraymusic", "otherInfo": "Neil Murray Live Streamed as part of The Saltwater Music Festival.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thesaltystage\n\nPLEASE NOTE THE TIME DIFFERENCE!\n2pm for WA, 4pm for Eastern states and 3.30pm for Central states!\n\nPAY WHAT YOU CAN - https://www.paypal.me/bulukbaraman"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SoDown ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8880511.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Bass Music With Soul.", "Time": "6:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A staple in the Colorado music scene, Ehren River Wright, better known as SoDown is tattooing his own signature on the world of dance music.

Leaving behind a 15-year long\ncareer of production experience in the French hip-hop scene, the Parisian producer became\nfascinated with the sounds of Chicago house and was inspired to create his own productions, infusing his hip-hop influence with the soul of house music.\n\nThen came \u2018Okay\u2019, the track that \u201cchanged the way we listened to music\u201d (Dancing Astronaut) and became the anthem of 2014. It claimed the No. 1 position on Beatport\u2019s House chart for 82 days, remained in the House Chart\u2019s Top 10 for over 180 days, was put on rotation by radio tastemakers like Pete Tong, Annie Mac and Danny Howard and received support from the likes of Claude\nVonStroke, Eats Everything, Green Velvet and nearly every major DJ under the sun. Upon its release, Rolling Stone deemed \u2018Okay\u2019 a \u201cglobal club sensation in waiting,\u201d a prophetic description that couldn\u2019t have rung more true as it remains a commanding moment in DJ sets even to this day.\n\nBut Shiba San is far from a one-hit wonder, following up \u201cOkay\u201d with the award-winning track \u201cBurn Like Fire\u201d (Best Underground Track 2015 IDMA/WMC). With releases out on labels known and loved for their irresistible tunes like Dirtybird and Suara, as well as his own imprint Basement Leak, he\u2019s since seen his career launch off far and beyond the city limits of Paris.\n\nStaying quiet on the public front, Shiba San remains a curious enigma to his international fan base, allowing the music to do the talking for him. In between releases and time spent concocting in the studio, the Miami-based producer remains a mainstay on the nightlife circuit, hitting iconic festivals including Coachella, EDC Las Vegas, Movement Detroit, The BPM Festival in Mexico, The\nWarehouse Project, Stereosonic, Spring Awakening as well as milestone venues like Output in New York, Ministry of Sound in London, Sankeys in Ibiza, Exchange in Los Angeles and The Mid in Chicago.\n\nEnding last year with two impressive Dirtybird releases \u2018Up & Down\u2019 and \u2018You Know What?\u2019, Shiba San began 2017 with a hearty compilation release on his own Basement Leak label featuring his standout tune \u2018Drop It\u2019 before embarking on a North American co-headlining tour with the esteemed MK. Later this spring, expect to hear a collaboration with Will Clarke on Dirtybird as well as a summer release on Lee Foss\u2019 Repopulate Mars.

He has released a series of chart-topping albums with sales of over a million copies, sells out the most prestigious concert halls worldwide, composed a string of award-winning film scores and routinely tops audience polls becoming an internet phenomenon. With a unique musical alchemy that draws on elements of classical, rock, electronica and world musics he has rendered traditional ideas of genre and audience divide obsolete and become not only one of the best known composers in the world today but almost certainly the best loved too.\n\nLudovico was born in Turin, Italy and trained as a classical composer and pianist at the Milan Conservatorio before continuing his studies with Luciano Berio, one of the most important composers of the twentieth century avant-garde. His career began with a series of prestigious commissions for institutions such as the USA\u2019s Tanglewood Festival and Paris\u2019 IRCAM but he turned away from what seemed a glittering classical career to forge his own musical path, giving him the freedom to reconcile his wider-ranging influences.\n\nIt was a bold strategy but one quickly rewarded, when Ludovico\u2019s electric harp suite \u2018Stanze\u2019 (1997) was first played on BBC Radio the switchboard jammed with listeners. It was a similar story with his next release \u2018Le Onde\u2019 (1998), a solo piano cycle he performed himself. A listener-organised campaign made it Ludovico\u2019s breakthrough and a permanent fixture atop the Classic FM charts. This upswell of grass roots activity, snowballing with the onset of the internet and social media, has allowed Ludovico to build a uniquely close relationship directly with his audience.\n\n\u2018Le Onde\u2019 also ignited Ludovico\u2019s career in Film & TV music and he has since composed many award-winning scores including \u2018Doctor Zhivago\u2019 (2002) and \u2018Sotto Falso Nome\u2019 (2004) which also became successful albums in their own right. In recent years Shane Meadows\u2019 acclaimed film \u2018This Is England\u2019 (2006) and its television sequel \u2018This Is England \u201886\u2019 (2010) have brought a BAFTA nomination for Ludovico and introduced his music to a huge new audience, Countless television programmes feature his music and the ad world has incorporated it in campaigns for brands including American Airlines, Vodafone, Sony Blu-ray and John Lewis.\n\nLudovico built on the impact of \u2018Le Onde\u2019 with a series of albums notable for their exuberant experimentation. \u2018Eden Roc\u2019 (1999) saw an array of guest musicians and instruments ranging from electric guitar to the Armenian duduk. \u2018I Giorni\u2019 (2001) deepened this engagement with world music in Ludovico\u2019s second collection for solo piano. His \u2018best of\u2019 collection from these first four albums \u2018Echoes: The Einaudi Collection\u2019 (2003) has since sold more than 100,000 copies.\n\nAs Ludovico\u2019s fame grew, his concert schedule naturally grew along with it and became an increasingly important part of his life. It immediately led to two new albums, Diario Mali (2005), a collaboration with kora virtuoso Ballak\u00e9 Sissoko and his first live solo album \u2018La Scala Concert 03.03.03\u2019 (2003), recorded in his adopted city of Milan.\n\nThe release of \u2018Una Mattina\u2019 (2004) saw more \u2018firsts\u2019, it was Ludovico\u2019s debut album on new and current record label Universal and also his most \u2018classical\u2019 to date. Largely written for solo piano, it leapt to the top of the UK Classical album chart and gave him his first sold-out UK tour.\n\nNow one of the most popular composers in the UK and throughout Europe, at home Ludovico\u2019s reputation scaled even loftier heights and thus on May 26th, 2005 in Rome, Ludovico Einaudi was awarded the \u2018Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana\u2019 (or \u2018OMRI\u2019) the senior order of Knighthood bestowed by the Italian Republic.\n\nThe stage was set for \u2018Divenire\u2019 (2007) his most musically ambitious album yet and his greatest commercial success to date. \u2018Divenire\u2019 gathered many of the musical \u2018streams\u2019 that had flowed through Ludovico\u2019s career and expanded on them with the help of The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and a battery of digital effects.\n\nOn release it became a phenomenon, topping classical charts throughout Europe and crashing the Italian pop charts. With sales in excess of 300,000 copies and a BRIT awards \u2018Album of the Year\u2019 nomination, Ludovico embarked on his biggest tour yet, 80 dates across Europe. One was captured for his second live album \u2018Live In Berlin\u2019 (2008) and it all culminated at a memorable concert at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall.\n\nWith people around the globe now clamoring to see him Ludovico became a permanent fixture on the road, traveling to new audiences in India, Japan and the USA. Along the way he formed a collaboration with Robert Lippock of post-rock band \u2018To Rococo Rot\u2019 and the results would be heard in two albums released in 2009, one featuring Ludovico as \u2018band member\u2019, the other as a solo artist.\n\nFirst was \u2018Cloudland\u2019 (2009) the debut from \u2018Whitetree\u2019 - comprising Ludovico on piano, Robert Lippok on electronics, and Robert\u2019s brother Ronald Lippok on drums - which has a sunny African feel amid the cutting-edge electronics and percussion.\n\n\u2018Nightbook\u2019 (2009) Ludovico\u2019s seventh solo album was a perfect contrast. Meditative and introspective it charts an inward voyage through dreams and the shadows of the psyche with evocative use of electronics. Ludovico calls it his \u2018Dark Side of The Moon\u2019 and though challenging, it too found immediate resonance with his audience who once again took Ludovico to the summit of the charts and back into the concert halls.\n\nThe \u2018Nightbook\u2019 tour produced \u2018The Royal Albert Hall Concert\u2019 (2010) a double CD and DVD documenting Ludovico\u2019s concert at the venue in March 2010. Drawing on every part of a now distinguished career, it shows a composer and performer at the very height of his creative powers.\n\nIN A TIME LAPSE \u2013 (2013)\nIn A Time Lapse was composed over a period of two years and recorded in October 2012 in a monastery near Verona, Italy.\nThe 14 pieces that compose the album range between piano, strings, percussion and electronics. As with the previous albums, In A Time Lapse develops as a suite with a concept that recalls the form of a novel divided in different chapters.\nEpic and emotional as Divenire, experimental and adventurous as Nightbook, In A Time Lapse moves even further exploring new textures and arrangements that blends different musical worlds into one. Within the classical style of Ludovico, in this album you can hear echoes of baroque and Italian folk music, late romantic strings textures, and a wide variety of colors between percussion and electronics, appearing throughout a journey that transport the listener through a deep reflection on the idea of time, with the words of Ludovico \"when you get conscious that our time is limited, it\u2019s the moment where you try to fill that space with all your energy and emotions and start to imagine beyond the limits and live every moment of your life fully as when you were a child\".\n\nThe album features Ludovico's band, the string orchestra I Virtuosi Italiani and violinist Daniel\nHope that appears in four pieces: Life and Experience together with I Virtuosi Italiani, Underwood, a touching duet with Ludovico, and Orbits where the solo violin climbs the sky towards infinity.\n\nWith albums topping innumerable charts and concerts selling out the world\u2019s most prestigious halls, country after country has taken Ludovico to its heart and seem certain to continue to for many years to come.\n\n\nFor more information contact: Karen Lee at Evolution Promotion - 978.658.3357 or at klee@evolutionpromotion.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "ATYYA ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8968433.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Deep Dubstep, Downtempo, Trap, Bass Music, Chillstep", "Time": "8:45 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "ATYYA - pronounced [ Ah-Tie-Ah ].

The first release, Keep On Jumpin\u2019 on featured a vocal workout from super-divas Martha Wash and Jocelyn Brown, together for the first time ever. The song became a top 10 UK crossover pop hit and worldwide smash. Todd followed with the anthem \u2018Somethin Going On\u2019, a top 5 UK crossover pop hit.\n\nAll the while, Todd continued to break new ground as a Producer/Remixer. From SNAP to Annie Lennox to George Michael to Bjork, Todd\u2019s mixes bridge the ground between club cool and commercial accessibility. In 1995, his remix for Everything But The Girl\u2019s Missing became a worldwide smash, giving the British duo their first ever hit. He then rode the charts with mixes for Garbage (Stupid Girl), The Cardigans (Love Fool), Everything But The Girl (Wrong), 10,000 Maniacs (More Than This), Jamiroquai (Alright), The Cardigans (Been It), and The Lightning Seeds (You Showed Me),.among others.

Ihr Gesang und die Band bilden eine emotionale Einheit, sodass Ihre eigenen St\u00fccke tief ber\u00fchren, aber auch m\u00e4chtig rocken k\u00f6nnen. Mit dieser grandiosen eigenst\u00e4ndigen Mischung hat sich die Band bereits in die Herzen ihrer Zuh\u00f6rer gespielt. Grove \u2013 setzen einfach pure Emotionen frei. They groove, they have a stunning dynamics, lyrics written in German and English, tunes inspired by world weariness, love, anger, bliss, and pain. That\u00b4s GROVE. A keen sense of authentic and catchy songwriting attracts the audience like a magnet; these five Hanoveranians definitely know how to rock. GROVE\u2019s sound is carried by Eve\u2019s amazing, clear, pure and powerful voice which masters soft, low tones as perfectly as roaring and growling. Her singing melts into the clear rhythm of GROVE\u2019s accompanying musicians, and stirs up emotions that any true Rock\u00b4n\u00b4Roll-soul could wish for. With their stunning and distinct mixture of deeply touching and rocking songs GROVE accomplishes to capture their listeners\u2019 hearts. GROVE \u2013 emotion unleashed!

Schnell war klar, dass das gemeinsame Potenzial voll ausgesch\u00f6pft werden musste. Mit Unterst\u00fctzung von Alex (ehem. Loungefly) am Bass, fanden die ersten gemeinsamen Akustik-Konzerte statt. F\u00fcr die perkussive Begleitung sorgte seinerzeit Hannes Weber, Drummer der Phunkas Symatrix. Weil sich die Rock \u00b4n\u00b4 Roll Seele langfristig nicht nur mit gediegenem Akustik-Sound zufrieden geben kann, wurden im Sommer 2009 die gute alte Paula und die druckfreudige Ricki entstaubt ;) und ihrer eigentlichen Bestimmung zugef\u00fchrt: dem dr\u00f6hnenden Fr\u00f6nen \u00fcber die guten alten R\u00f6hren. Aber \u201cOhne Drummer kein vern\u00fcnftiges Gitarrengejammer\u201c, so stie\u00df Stefan Reese (ehem. Sonic Front, Mindwise) am Schlagzeug hinzu, um dem bisherigen und zuk\u00fcnftigen Repertoire seinen Soundstempel aufzudr\u00fccken. Es entstehen u.a. die Songs \u201cEssenziell\u201c und \u201cInfancy, Maturity & Uncertainty\u201c, die mit Unterst\u00fctzung von Lars Oppermann (Eat No Fish, Superstarfuckers, Dan Hiob Experiment, High Speed Karmageddon) in 2010 dann die ersten Tracks auf ihrem aktuellen Demo werden. 2011 wird Martin als zweiter Gitarrist angeheuert um den Grove-Sound auch LIVE noch fetter zu gestalten.

Two years in the making \u2018We Resonate\u2019 out on Talitres (UK/EU) and Sweetdreams Press (Japan), is an uplifting celebration of life and by far her most collaborative. It sees Rachael joined by Laura Marling\u2019s sideman Marcus Hamblett, experimental Japanese multi-instrumentalist ICHI, Alessi Laurent-Marke of Alessi\u2019s Ark, Rozi Plain, Emma Gatrill of Sons of Noel and Adrian, and Thomas Heather of Woodpecker Wooliams. Born from the richness of Rachael Dadd`s semi-nomadic lifestyle, partly recorded live in a studio followed by playful overdubbing in Rachael\u2019s front room, \u2018We Resonate\u2019 carves out a niche of its own, crossing genres from folk, through pop and experimental. Pulsing with poly-rhythms on prepared-piano, homemade xylophone, voice, clarinets, typewriter, boxes of matches, steel drum, tap-dancing, clapping, and even the heartbeat of Rachael\u2019s baby in the womb, it reveals that her love of African field-recordings www.rachaeldadd.com \u2000 R A C H A E L D A D D W E R E S O N AT E and the spirit embodied within them has seeped into the diverse mix of influences, along with Steve Reich, Tune Yards, and the Japanese underground/ improv scene. \u201cBeing a travelling musician is a furnace for making music. Witnessing how people build things together, watching the changing landscapes from city to wilderness and back to city, becoming connected to other people\u2019s cultures, it all makes it easier to go against the grain of what you grew up with. I feel at home using the pentatonic scale. I veer towards leaving behind the wash of guitar mid-frequencies that I think dominate so much of modern western music.\u201d Rachael\u2019s songwriting hones in on themes of communication, collaboration, nurture and optimism, but the worth of living is emphasized in even greater magnitude within the album\u2019s moments of desolation (unanswered walkie-talkies on a song about flood victims), in its moments of questioning (\"I see you`re flexing the muscle of these modern machines but are you sure you\u2019re fit to drive them?\"), and in its moments of protest (an overblown clarinet and a salute to Ivor Cutler calling \"all the women of the world take over!\"). Overall though optimism spreads its warm sunbeam and sets with a golden light over the ebbing and swelling of \"let it rise, let it fall...\" \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have light and dark to make something truthful, to make something resonate. I was living in Japan when the tsunami hit and the Fukushima nuclear plant blew up. Witnessing the Japanese people\u2019s strength, positivity and collaboration in the face of threat influenced my songwriting. During this time I saw a photograph exhibition of Ama-san, the diving women who work in teams holding their breath for 2 minutes, to dive for sea creatures without scuba gear. The essence of those beautiful and powerful images stayed with me throughout the making of the album and are what the artwork by Betsy Dadd is based on.\u201d Rachael has performed to audiences of up to 3000 and in recent times has taken to the stage at countless festivals including Glastonbury, End of The Road, Green Man, Wilderness, No Direction Home, Truck, Boomtown, Ouvre La Voix (France), Mandstock (Italy), and is gearing up to play Woodford (Australia) after a month tour of Japan. Outside of festivals, Rachael has played numerous headline tours in the UK, Europe, and Japan, and has also toured in the company of David Thomas Broughton, Alessi\u2019s Ark, Francois & The Atlas Mountains, This Is The Kit, and Rozi Plain. She is an experienced collaborator and organiser: she co-curated The Local\u2019s SHHH festival in Bristol, achieving her goal to be inclusive of many cultures and forms of expression; she programmed 'Rachael Dadd and Friends' at King\u2019s Place - a fundraiser for Japan's Tsunami victims; and she\u2019s curated a group exhibition 'DIY is all you need' with fellow musicians and artists. Having graduated from art school with first class honors, Rachael is also a practicing and exhibiting artist always putting emphasis on the record sleeve and often making handmade limited editions, thinking conceptually and regularly collaborating with RCA graduate animator and sister Betsy Dadd.

Grammy-nominated composer, a world-class DJ and an ambassador for his native Detroit. Yet the common thread that runs through Craig\u2019s broad musical canon and creative projects is a resounding fascination with futurism. Carl Craig has cultivated a unique path as an artist, entrepreneur and civic leader, guided by his tendency toward forward\nthinking.\n\nCraig released his first track in 1989. One of his earliest mentors and first collaborator was Derrick May, whose imprint Craig also released some of his early music on.\n\nIn 1991, wanting pure artistic freedom, Craig set up his own label Planet-E and released \u20184 Jazz Funk Classics\u2019, under the moniker 69, as the label\u2019s first release. From here his wild exploration of sound intensified\u2026\n\nA Gemini true to form, with a mind that never sits still, Craig has released a diverse range of experimental and groundbreaking music under a plethora of aliases including 69, BFC, C2, Innerzone Orchestra (\u2018Bug in the Bassbin\u2019 was credited as the spark that inspired the evolution of drum\u2018n\u2019bass), No Boundaries, Psyche, Paperclip People, Tres Demented, Urban Tribe and many more. He has also produced albums for the legendary Detroit Jazz collective Tribe as well as orchestrator / pianist Francesco Tristano and French producer Agoria.\n\nLive he has collaborated with Les si\u00e8cles orchestra at Cit\u00e9 de la Musique in Paris. A meeting of techno and classical music, the concert was described as \u201chistorical\u201d, Craig went on to repeat the formula in Milan and Germany. He regularly performs live as experimental outfit Trio with Moritz Von Oswald and Francesco Tristano, sometimes as Narod Niki alongside Villalobos, Luciano, Richie Hawtin, Zip and others, and regularly does part live and part DJ with Luciano. Additionally he\u2019s\ntaken to occasionally bringing keyboardists like Mike Banks (UR), Amp Fiddler and Tristano into the DJ booth with him for special one-off gigs. He also improvised live to an Andy Warhol film at the Unsound Festival in New York. In 2011, Craig went live as 69 for the first time ever, fusing masks, darkness and the music of 69, Craig created 69\u2019s own entity and previewed the show to a few select festivals and clubs around the world.\n\nHis remixes discography boasts some of the most desirable names in music \u2013 LCD Soundsystem, Hot Chip, Junior Boys (nominated for a Grammy Award), Gavin Russom & Delia Gonzalez, Theo Parrish, Tori Amos, Can, Goldfrapp, Friendly Fires, Caribou, Tiga, Unkle, Yello and more.\n\nAs well as an outlet for his own productions, his Planet-E imprint has given a home to a wide range of Detroit-based artists including Francesco Mora Catlett, Naomi Daniel, Flexitone, Jason Hogans, Kenny Larkin, Monty Luke, Moodyman, Mike Agent X, Oliverwho Factory, Ezana Harris, Recloose, Reference, Kevin Saunderson, Big Tone, Tribe, Urban Tribe, and Chaz Vincent.\n\nStaying strong to his Detroit roots, where he still lives today, Craig helped launched the Detroit Electronic music Festival in 2000 and remains a strong force at the festival today. He has also created and launched his non-profit 501-C3 Carl Craig Foundation: \u201cThe concept is to find ways to re-educate kids about what\u2019s interesting musically that you can\u2019t get on the radio\u2026 To develop a new music scene that follows the legacy of Detroit music being diverse and interesting, to spot out the most talented young musicians coming out of high school and lend small financial grants to encourage music education at a higher level.\u201d\n\nWhen Craig explains his philosophy, his wry sense of humor seeps into his explanations of far-reaching concepts that merge worlds together. \u201cI have a very special career. When I feel that I\u2019m tired of going on the road I can go in the studio. When I\u2019m tired of concentrating on the studio I can go on the road. I can work with concert pianists, jazz musicians or rock guys. Very few people\nhave that range of interests. Very few people juggle a career that they choose specifically.\u201d No one else can pull it all together quite like Carl Craig.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Martin Green ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8129383.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Experimental, Folk", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Composer / Musician / Producer / Member of Lau", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Blankenship Family ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8721945.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Gospel", "Time": "2:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Traveling and Telling About The Wonderful Love Of Jesus!", "otherInfo": "The Blankenships Live for 30 minute concert."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ Syrah ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:45 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "boranimals ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Deejay Intel ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8175120.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "All Things Music", "Time": "3:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "DJ Intel, born Jason Deuchler, is a man that knows his way around the ones and twos. Coming up near Chicago in the early 90s, Intel grew up in the early days of Hip Hop with a fascination for turntablism. He quickly hit the decks with a set of turntables and a mixer he \u201cborrowed\u201d from his brother, and started off on the path that Chicago DJ legends like PNS and Tone B Nimble paved. Between the house parties and the B-boy battles, Intel quickly made a name for himself across the Midwest.\n\nIntel still holds down the decks for the B-boys, but his scope and style--fueled by his limitless passion and innovation--have evolved. The kid honing his craft on hand-me-down tables now shares (or steals, depending on your perspective) the stage with Hip Hop legends (Lupe Fiasco, Afrika Bambaataa, Wu-Tang Clan, ?Love), EDM greats (Amon Tobin, Kid Koala, Nero, The Prodigy) and three time world DMC champion DJ Qbert, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. He holds down quite a few residencies in Chicago, including the world famous Smart Bar, rips up stages at huge music festivals (Lollapalooza, North Coast Music Fest, SXSW) and works everything from charitable events to openings to fashion shows for clients like: Adidas, Red Bull, Scion, AT&T and Microsoft.\n\nWNUR and the DJZTRIP.com community both voted DJ Intel \u2018Best MixTape DJ.\u2019 The New York Post and Entertainment Weekly both love him. The people at his Face Melt parties love him. When DJ Intel gets to work you never quite know what to expect, but one thing\u2019s for sure-- you\u2019re going to love it too.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "W&W ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10381950.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Edm, Bigroom, Dance", "Time": "3:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "After meeting up in 2007, Willem van Hanegem and Ward van der Harst came together to form W&W and haven\u2019t looked back since.

Voted #14 in DJ Mag\u2019s Top 100 DJs poll in 2018, they continually perform at leading festivals such as Tomorrowland and EDC, and even had their own headlining tour this year.\n\nW&W continue to prove their status as innovators and tastemakers in the scene under their alias NWYR, where they release blistering productions and live sets from their trance-inspired roots. They also curate music for their brand-new label, Rave Culture, which includes hosting their own bi-weekly radio show on Dutch broadcasting station SLAM!, which has gained them over 300,000 listeners per show plus coverage across North America via SiriusXM.\n\nNow shifting into a new phase with a tidal wave of new productions and incinerating live sets, the rise of their new Rave Culture label and the impact of their NWYR alias, W&W are cementing their place amongst dance music\u2019s top acts in signature style: transcending boundaries and never looking back.", "otherInfo": "We're working on a special XR Livestream from the Rave Culture City.

They were later joined by Tony to become Above & Beyond.\n\nAnjunabeats was formed when Jono Grant and Paavo Siljamaki met at Westminster University and discovered a mutual love of electronic music. The pair kicked off the label in 2000 with \u2018Anjunabeats Volume 1\u2019, a massive club success which instantly ear-pricked the likes of Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold and Paul van Dyk. The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label. It provided the perfect outlet for their numerous production projects \u2013 Oceanlab, Aalto, Freestate, Nitromethane, POS, Rollerball and Tranquillity Base \u2013 and every release was warmly received by elite DJ\u2019s and club-goers across the globe.\n\nIn late 2002 James Grant joined the Anjunabeats management team and the label began to expand its output, signing a series of fresh artists. The first external track to be released was Rusch and Murray\u2019s much talked about \u2018Epic\u2019 \u2013 a track made entirely across Internet forums by two producers who\u2019ve never met \u2013, with subsequent signings including Finnish trance maestro Super8 (who later joined forces with DJ Tab), talented UK duo Smith & Pledger and Dutch Deep Tech Genius, Stephen J.Kroos.\n\nSince then, the roster has expanded to over 30 artists and Anjunabeats has earned a reputation as one the most consistent dance labels in the world, with its releases proving to be essential tools for many of the world's top DJs. In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

He rapidly broke through onto the Garage pirate radio stations and forums gaining instant recognition, and was subsequently snapped up by international promoters to perform tours of Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Russia. Majestic has since crossed into a multitude of dance music genres from UK Garage to House to Drum & Bass and Dubstep performing with leading artists across the scene such as Sigma, DJ EZ, Dream Teem, Agent X, MJ Cole, Judge Jules, Micky Slim, Jack Beats, Laidback Luke, The Wideboys, Netsky, High Contrast, Loadstar, Shy FX, Skream, Bar9, Nero and Jacob Plant to name a few.\n\nAs well as a legendary MC known for being risqu\u00e9 in spreading his word, Majestic is also making waves as an artist in his own right. His single \u201cIn The VIP\u201d written and produced with the Wideboys that took a satirical look at the VIP Club culture, was released on Skint Records. After receiving serious hits on YouTube and Radio Support from MistaJam, DJ Target, Kissy Sell Out and Steve Smart on heavy rotation, the record also made its way onto the MOS Bass Culture annual.\nMajestic\u2019s lyrical flow then caught the eye of American Dubstep superstar Skrillex who sampled Majestics legendary, almost anthemic, \u201cRuffneck Bass\u201d spit for his latest massive single of the same title, played by the worlds biggest DJs and over 50m views online.\n\nAfter signing up to be Dubstep wonderkid, Jacob Plant\u2019s official hype man, the pair released, \u201cMosh Pit\u201d on Speakerbox. Majestic has been in the studio collaborating on a number of cutting edge tracks they intend to PA live at their shows. They have already performed for massive student brand Under The Radar on their tour dates up and down the country, as well as for Fresher\u2019s events at all the leading Universities in the UK. Plus having just wowed the crowd at Brighton\u2019s Shakedown festival performing on the main stage in front of 8000 revellers, in-between Razorlight and Example, they are certainly heading for superstar status!\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder Majestic is in demand to perform Live, with Mistajam quoting Majestic as being the \u201cbest live MC in the game\u201d after requesting him to perform alongside him at Exit festival in Serbia and Eddie Temple Morris bringing him onboard The Big Reunion Shows this winter not to mention continuing tours with The Wideboys, the hype has only just begun. After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece. Majestic is also opening for the Prodigy as part of his festival looks with Kiss FM UK.\n\nSo with the Majestic message travelling fast, hyping the crowd into a frenzy, Majestic takes on the role of grand puppeteer, from waiving lighters in the air to chanting back at the DJ, his commands are dutifully followed and quite a sight to behold. Through years of hard graft, quite literally behind the scene, Majestic has studied the sound of the underground for well over a decade. Majestic is realising his destiny as one of the biggest talents to come out of the UK underground scene, infinitely more than just the best live MC in the game.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Firin' Squad ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nahko ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9616250.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Chris Vee ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7197505.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Whatever Floats My Boat", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Greensky Bluegrass ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8927028.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Americana, Rock, Psychedelic Rock, Jam Bands, Bluegrass, Alt-country, Alternative", "Time": "4:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "After 18 years together, up to 175 shows per year, nearly 1,000 different setlists, six studio albums, and a litany of live releases, Greensky Bluegrass embodies more than just music for members Anders Beck [dobro], Michael Arlen Bont [banjo], Dave Bruzza [guitar], Mike Devol [upright bass], and Paul Hoffman [Mandolin]. Truthfully, it embodies an ironclad creative bond, familial brotherhood, and a lifelong commitment to fans. At this point, it goes without saying the band means everything (and more) to the Kalamazoo, MI bluegrass mavericks.\n\nSo, with a wink and a smile, they offer up a cleverly titled seventh full-length, All For Money, in 2019.\n\nHoffman dispels the obvious first: \u201cClearly, we aren\u2019t a band all for money. We did it for romantic reasons such as love, catharsis, and because it mattered to us and the listeners. We wanted to have fun with the paradox of the title though. We\u2019re truly blessed and humbled to have our dreams come true and do what we do. However, it would be easy to make decisions based on our needs to eat or the desires of others, but that\u2019s not doing it for love. We love what we do, and we\u2019re grateful for the love we receive in return from the people listening.\u201d\n\nAs time goes on, the guys continue to do things for the \u201cright reasons,\u201d and that mindset resonates louder and louder amongst a growing fan base. A live force of nature renowned for bringing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll showmanship to high-energy bluegrass, the group has sold out hallowed venues such as Red Rocks Amphitheatre and the legendary Ryman Auditorium in addition to igniting stages everywhere from Bonnaroo and New Orleans Jazz Festival to Austin City Limits and Outside Lands. Their unpredictable performances remain the stuff of legend attracting diehard devotees who typically travel far and wide to experience multiple gigs. In 2014, If Sorrows Swim bowed at #1 on the Billboard Top Bluegrass Albums Chart, while the 2016 follow-up Shouted, Written Down & Quoted cracked the Top 3. Along the way, they have also earned praise from Billboard, AXS, Westword, and more.\n\nOn All For Money, Greensky once again aimed to progress. This time around, the musicians kept the show top of mind as they composed the music.\n\n\u201cWe have a motto where we want every show to be harder, better, longer, and faster,\u201d admits Hoffman. \u201cWith All For Money, I felt like we were serving the performance more by writing and arranging material in a way we would intend to play it on stage. We tried to incorporate a lot of what we already do live, which is different for us in the studio.\u201d\n\nThey recorded March-May at Echo Mountain Sound in Asheville, NC. In the studio, they worked with longtime friend Dominic John Davis as producer. According to Hoffman, Davis offered a fresh perspective on \u201chow to balance the studio and concerts.\u201d Amplifying the sonic palette, signatures such as dobro tone, bass grooves, and banjo took the spotlight.\n\nThe first single \u201cDo It Alone\u201d feels equally at home on a festival stage as it does blaring through your soundsystem. Backed by a robust groove, the song transforms traditional bluegrass instrumentation into a rich sonic backdrop highlighted by a mandolin awash in a trio of effects as well as rich echoed vocals and emotive lyrics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been trying to write a windows-down rock \u2018n\u2019 roll tune for a while,\u201d explains Hoffman. \u201cI got out an old guitar of mine, re-strung it, and immediately spit the song out. It\u2019s meant to be an anthem. I ask myself, \u2018Why do I do it alone?\u2019 It\u2019s because I\u2019ve got a whole room of thousands singing at the top of their lungs with me. Whenever I write something emotional that might be difficult to sing, I\u2019m reminded of the fact the crowd is there. Hopefully, it\u2019s a reminder for other people as well and we all have something to chant together.\u201d\n\nHot on its heels, the intriguing and irresistible \u201cMurder of Crows\u201d takes flight on kinetic performances as it delivers an emotionally charged message and provocative narrative. \u201cThis is a song that Aaron and I wrote about disconnection, drifting apart, loss, and remorse,\u201d Dave Bruzza reveals. \u201cIt also touches on a cry for help and how it was not heard in time. A friend told me crows had funerals. He explained that farmers used to nail a crow to the fence or barn door to get rid of them eating the crops. Thee birds would gather, pay their respects, and fly off never to\nreturn. It was interesting. I began to think why people disappear in our lives. It came together with the mysterious letter someone received, and it all made sense to turn this into a story.\u201d\n\nAlso originally penned by Bruzza, \u201cIt\u2019s Not Mine Anymore\u201d\u2019 illustrates the group\u2019s virtuosity with a \u201cmetal\u201d spirit. Elsewhere, \u201cWish I Didn\u2019t Know\u201d hinges on a trance-y Mandolin passage that proves instantly hypnotic, and \u201cDo Harm\u201d taps into an upbeat bounce by way of an an off-kilter rhythm. Meanwhile, the title track spirals into psychedelic territory during a head-spinning two-minute midsection before culminating on an important statement.\n\n\u201cIt feels liberating to be honest about it,\u201d he remarks. \u201cWith the title track, we were asking more of the listeners than we ever have, but the line \u2018If you need a voice, I\u2019m yours friend\u2019 is meant for them.\u201d\n\nIn the end, all the right reasons continue to drive Greensky Bluegrass.\n\n\u201cAs songwriters and musicians, we have a need for people to be on board, and we\u2019re not just regurgitating the same shit,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cWe\u2019re pushing ourselves every time. I hope they want to listen to the record and hear the songs live. I hope they know we\u2019re doing this for us and them.\u201d", "otherInfo": "We'll be airing sets from years past and celebrating the spirit that you all bring to this event!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Billy Strings ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9112978.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Guitar Virtuoso, Folk, Jam Bands, Bluegrass, Americana", "Time": "4:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Billy Strings has been hailed as the future of bluegrass, transcending tradition and genre with his high velocity, flat-picking guitar technique and intense, confessional songwriting.

Inspired by such visceral singers as Janis Joplin and Tina Turner, she left school at sixteen to follow her own dreams. Dilana soon found herself with a promising music career in Holland, becoming one of the country's most coveted live acts. Recording and releasing the album Wonderfool in 2000 yielded five singles, four videos and a string of touring and festival gigs throughout the region, celebrating her natural talents as a songwriter and performer.\n\nBy way of Houston, Dilana arrived in L.A. and auditioned to compete on TV's \"Rock Star Supernova.\" Quoted in the Hollywood Press, \"The moment she stepped on the Mayan Theatre stage for Episode 1 and performed 'Lithium,' Dilana instantly became the show's frontrunner.\" Her powerful vocals and commanding stage presence amassed legions of new fans from around the world. That acclaim inspired Dilana to further pursue her musical passions with characteristic tenacity.\n\nDilana has performed with rock's biggest legends including Tommy Lee and Mick Mars (M\u00f6tley Crue), Dave Navarro (Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). In 2007, she won over the masses with opening slot performances for Aerosmith and Beth Hart. She launched two solo tours spanning North America and Western Europe that both consistently sold out and earned stellar reviews in the press and in 2009, Dilana ended a third successful year performing by touring her native South Africa.\n\n\nFollowing the release of seven singles, Dilana spent much of 2008 in the studio. In November 2009, she unleashed the album Inside Out, featuring 12 original tracks and her first full-length album in nine years. As new opportunities presented themselves, Dilana jumped at the chance to venture into film acting. The singer/songwriter won the BEST ACTRESS award at the Action On Film International Film Festival as well as winning both the BEST ACTRESS award and the BEST MUSIC award at the American International Film Festival for the 9 songs she wrote and performed in the rock drama: Angel Camouflaged.\n\nDuring her extensive world touring, Dilana performed in Afghanistan for the troops in 2009 and 2010.

The band's moniker is a twist on the name of a second cousin of singer and guitarist Brendan Bayliss named Humphrey McGee.\n\nIn late 2004, the band was declared by Rolling Stone Magazine to be the successors to the jam band throne previously held by Phish.\n\nThey are much more influenced musically by progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, Yes, Dream Theater, and Genesis, as well as heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden. The band also \"identifies The Police, The Beatles, The Monkees, Nick D'Virgilio, and Led Zeppelin as primary influences with a reverence the members describe as 'Biblical.'\" [2] However, there really isn't a style of popular music that Umphrey's does not cover. Artists covered in concert by Umphrey's range from Lionel Richie to Metallica to Toto to Snoop Dogg to James Taylor.\n\nFormed at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two popular Notre Dame rock bands. Early concerts consisted of both originals and cover songs, including Guns N' Roses's \"Patience\" and Vince Guaraldi's Peanuts theme \"Linus and Lucy.\"\n\nIn mid-1998, after only 8 months together, the band released their debut album complete with a tongue-in-cheek title, Greatest Hits Vol. III. The group decided to record an album immediately because it was easier to get live gigs with an official CD. Long out of print, the album contains many of Umphrey's future concert warhorses, such as \"Divisions\" and \"All in Time.\"\n\nShortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. By 1999, the band had gained notoriety outside of Indiana, especially with the release of the live album Songs for Older Women, which featured live tracks recorded over a two-night stand in November 1998.\n\nThe addition of Jake Cinninger in September 2000 helped bring the band's musical dynamic to a new level. Cinninger, an accomplished guitarist, brought a distinct heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar).\n\nThe band released another live album, One Fat Sucka, which contained live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.\n\nAround 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive jam sessions took place in a hotel in the \"Jimmy Stewart Ballroom\" during the wedding of fan/website designer Jeremy Welsh. Therefore, the band began to call their onstage improvisational excursions \"Jimmy Stewart.\" This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers and has been extensively outlined by \"McL\" in the \"Jimmy Stewart writeup\" on the fan message board known as \"The Bort\" at www.umphreaks.com.\n\n2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK. That summer, the first annual Bonnaroo Festival took place in rural Manchester, TN, and featured over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people. Umphrey's played to their largest audience to date. They would go on to play Bonnaroo in 2004 and again in 2006.\n\nThe band almost ended in late 2002 when drummer Mike Mirro announced he was leaving the band to attend medical school. After hundreds of tapes were reviewed by percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers, who has a masters degree in jazz drumming from DePaul University.\n\nIn 2004, the band released the critically acclaimed Anchor Drops, and released Safety in Numbers two years later in April 2006.\n\nIn April, 2007, Umphrey's released their fifth studio effort, The Bottom Half, an album of leftover tracks from the Safety in Numbers sessions. The album was supported with tours of the USA, Europe, and Japan.\n\nBrendan Bayliss is also working on a studio album with Jeff Austin of Yonder Mountain String Band.", "otherInfo": "We're teaming up with Live From Out There to bring you Summer Camp Virtual Festival: A 20 Year Retrospective featuring live music, throwback performances, interviews, unique moments, giveaways, and a virtual gathering you won't soon forget...

This fresh-faced native of Southampton, England, was merely playing into his love of funkadelic hip-hop and crooning urban stylings when he started writing songs as a teenager. His love for Terence Trent D'Arby, Sisqo, and Donnell Jones allowed him to put his creative love for art, culture, and history into a musical beat all his own. And the new millennium belonged to him and garage had been redefined.\n\nBorn Craig Ashley David on May 5, 1981, David was slicing and dicing ragga and R&B on the local station PCRS 106.5FM and found himself playing club gigs prior to rubbing elbows with some of music's finest. It was during this time he hooked with Artful Dodger's Mark Hill. After winning a national writing competition, Craig was more than ready to start producing with Hill. His big break came when he put his own additives on Damage's \"I'm Ready,\" a B-side to \"Wonderful Tonight.\" Soon thereafter he remixed his own version of Human League's \"Human\" and started himself a regular spot in area clubs during the weekends. \"Rewind\" was another underground smash, specifically a definitive move for David. His respect for Stevie Wonder, Faith Evans, and R. Kelly was most apparent, however his own vocal talent was beginning to shine. He and Hill's specialty show on Capital Radio provided another outlet for David to shape his musical work of genius. \"Fill Me In\" proved yet another hit, shooting straight to number one in summer 2000. David was now the youngest British male solo artist to have a number one single. He was 19-years-old.\n\nA deal with Wildstar Records in the U.K. sparked toward the end of the summer as \"Re-Rewind\" and \"7 Days\" gained praise in late November. A stateside agreement with Atlantic also led to more global hype. He had sold 3.5 million records worldwide and garage was finally becoming massive overseas and it was David's debut Born to Do It that was at the head.\n\nBut not all were pulling for this R&B prodigy. Aside from winning three awards at the MOBO's in October, Craig David walked away empty handed at the 2000 Brit Awards in February 2001. He was up for six nominations, including Best British Male Solo Artist, Best British Newcomer, and Best British Single for \"7 Days,\" but industry politics fell into operation. Many mainstream stars came to David's defense, artists such as Elton John, U2, and Robbie Williams, professing their disgust for the ill recognition for David and his musical efforts in the past year. Death threats soon followed for the superstar in spring 2001 as he took the stage in a show in London. An anonymous caller claimed a soldier would injure David with tear gas and hand grenades. Still, his record sales continued to soar in the U.K. with sales of Born to Do It increasing over 100 percent after his dismal beginning months of 2001. He bombared American Shores with a deal with Atlantic and released Born to Do It stateside in summer 2001. Mainstream radio flocked to him immediately. Missy Elliott, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, and Usher called themselves fans.\n\nThe next year, things didn't simmer down for the now international pop star. Craig David returned with a sophomore effort Slicker Than Your Average in November 2002. This particular album saw a much grittier side from David. Debut single \"What's Your Flava?\" also became one of the year's hottest singles.\n\nIn 2005 he released his 3rd album \"The Story Goes...\", the first single of the album, \"All The Way\", returned him to the top three, and the second single, \"Don't Love You No More (I'm Sorry)\", tied with \"7 Days\" as his longest running single in the charts since \"Rewind\", spending 15 weeks inside the UK top 75.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Krystle Dos Santos ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8164394.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Soul-blues, R&b, Soul, Soul Jazz, Pop", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cYou can hear her voice across all oceans and terrain\u2026.[Krystle] takes the new, mixes it with the old, and creates something undefined.

Having enjoyed success through the late 90s and 00s producing house music under a variety of different aliases, Tim launched Satin Jackets as a vehicle to finally explore his lifelong love of disco.\n\nInspired by the clean productions of artists like CHIC and studio genius Trevor Horn, Tim set to reintroduce that polish and sheen back into the modern disco scene. \u201cI had always been fascinated by how glossy people like Nile Rogers made their music,\u201d Tim explains. \u201cIt always sounded like the musical equivalent of a fashion magazine\u2019s cover. I\u2019d been making more underground music for a while but really wanted to go in totally the other direction and create a really smooth, polished sound.\u201d\n\nThe result was \u2018You Make Me Feel Good\u2019, a sublimely laidback slice of Balearic House that introduced Satin Jackets to the world. Released on storied Belgian label Eskimo Recordings, who had previously helped launch the careers of artists like Aeroplane and Lindstrom, the single quickly established Tim as one to watch amongst the thriving nu-disco scene.\n\nFollowing on from this auspicious debut a string of acclaimed singles, and remixes for some of the genre\u2019s biggest names including Goldroom and Blank & Jones, would regularly emerge from Tim\u2019s remote forest studio. Whilst the face behind Satin Jackets may have remained a mystery his warm sound was fast becoming very familiar to music lovers around the world.\n\nFirmly established as one of Eskimo\u2019s flagship artists Tim would define the Satin Jackets\u2019 sound with his debut album \u2018Panorama Pacifico\u2019 in 2016. Featuring collaborations with artists including Scavenger Hunt, NTEIBINT and Marble Sounds the album won praise from the likes of Mixmag, DJ Mag and Groove, led to gigs around the world and to date has been streamed on Spotify more than 30 million times.\n\nNever one to rest on his laurels though Tim has continued to refine the Satin Jackets\u2019 sound. Following the success of \u2018Panorama Pacifico\u2019 he\u2019s steadily built up a close-knit family of collaborators including British singers David Harks and Emma Brammer and US vocalist Niya Wells, and continued to go from strength to strength with singles such as \u2018Northern Lights\u2019 and \u2018Mirage\u2019 all clocking up millions of plays.\n\nWith album number 2 scheduled for release in early 2019 Tim can\u2019t wait for people to hear the new record. \u201cEven in just the last couple of years I\u2019ve really made some big changes to how I produce music. Compared to the first album you could say that everything under the hood has changed,\u201d he explains. \u201cEvery day, with every production I\u2019m learning new things and when I listen to these new tracks, the depth in the mixes, the clarity, I like to think of the new album as Satin Jackets but in 3D. \u201c\n\nFrom wanting to recreate the sound of magazine covers to appearing on them, the past few years has been quite some journey for the still enigmatic producer, but despite the ever-growing army of fans from every corner of the world Tim remains grounded. Hidden away in the unlikely surroundings of one of Germany\u2019s ancient forests, out of sight but fully in control, Tim is producing music that reflects the glamour and glitz of 70s Manhattan, artfully updated for the 21st century.", "otherInfo": "Dance From Home brings you performances from world-class DJs while offering a simple way to make a difference in the current crisis.

Led by the incomparable singer and songwriter Paul Rodgers, arguably the finest singer in rock 'n ' roll and a huge songwriting talent.\n\nFormed in 1973, Bad Company came to life when Rodgers was looking to start anew after the disintegration of his legendary band Free. His powerhouse vocals and songwriting were a main ingredient during Free's impressive five-year run; a period of time that saw the release of seven extremely influential albums that featured Free's minimalist blues-rock approach. Included among Free's dynamic body of work is the 1970 smash, \"All Right Now,\" one of the most recognizable rock anthems ever recorded. Lyrics and melody by Rodgers. He was Free\u2019s main songwriter.\n\nRodgers had met Mott The Hoople guitarist Mick Ralphs and after jamming together and listening to new songs that Ralphs had penned and songs that Rodgers had penned, Ralphs made the decision to leave Mott and form a new band with Rodgers. The duo recruited former King Crimson bassist/vocalist Boz Burrell, added drummer Simon Kirke and christened themselves Bad Company, the name inspired by Rodgers. Rodgers\u2019 brought in Led Zeppelin manager Peter Grant and Bad Company became the first band signed to Zeppelin's Swan Song label. \"I had to fight to get the management and the record company to accept the name Bad Company,\" explains Rodgers. \"They thought it was a terrible name. Peter Grant called a meeting and the band met beforehand. I told them that I had been through this before with Free as Island Records had wanted to call us the Heavy Metal Kids. We agreed to go in and tell them that we were going to be called Bad Company and that was the end of the story. As soon as Peter heard how strongly I felt about the name, he became very supportive and he and I turned the record company around.\"", "otherInfo": "Join us on Facebook for a Memorial Weekend Fan Flashback live stream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ten Eighty Trees ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Le Youth ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7175798.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Electronic, Dance Music", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "90's sounds refracted through a thoroughly modern aesthetic.

I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tim Key ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9619281.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Julia Jacklin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6951613.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Sydney,Australia", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "New album 'Crushing' out now. Buy LP/CD from http://www.juliajacklin.com or stream online.\n\nThe second full-length album from Australian singer/songwriter Julia Jacklin, Crushing embodies every possible meaning of its title word. It\u2019s an album formed from sheer intensity of feeling, an in-the-moment narrative of heartbreak and infatuation. And with her storytelling centered on bodies and crossed boundaries and smothering closeness, Crushing reveals how our physical experience of the world shapes and sometimes distorts our inner lives.\n\n\u201cThis album came from spending two years touring and being in a relationship, and feeling like I never had any space of my own,\u201d says the Melbourne-based artist. \u201cFor a long time I felt like my head was full of fear and my body was just this functional thing that carried me from point A to B, and writing these songs was like rejoining the two.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to her 2016 debut Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win, Crushing finds Jacklin continually acknowledging what\u2019s expected of her, then gracefully rejecting those expectations. As a result, the album invites self-examination and a possible shift in the listener\u2019s way of getting around the world\u2014an effect that has everything to do with Jacklin\u2019s openness about her own experience.\n\n\u201cI used to be so worried about seeming demanding that I\u2019d put up with anything, which I think is common\u2014you want to be chill and cool, but it ends up taking so much of your emotional energy,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cNow I\u2019ve gotten used to calling out things I\u2019m not okay with, instead of just burying my feelings to make it easier on everyone. I\u2019ve realized that in order to keep the peace, you have to speak up for yourself and say what you really want.\u201d\n\nProduced by Burke Reid (Courtney Barnett, The Drones) and recorded at The Grove Studios (a bushland hideaway built by INXS\u2019 Garry Gary Beers), Crushing sets Jacklin\u2019s understated defiance against a raw yet luminous sonic backdrop. \u201cIn all the songs, you can hear every sound from every instrument; you can hear my throat and hear me breathing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really important to me that you can hear everything for the whole record, without any studio tricks getting in the way.\u201d\n\nOn the album-opening lead single \u201cBody,\u201d Jacklin proves the power of that approach, turning out a mesmerizing vocal performance even as she slips into the slightest murmur. A starkly composed portrait of a breakup, the song bears an often-bracing intimacy, a sense that you\u2019re right in the room with Jacklin as she lays her heart out. And as \u201cBody\u201d wanders and drifts, Jacklin establishes Crushing as an album that exists entirely on its own time, a work that\u2019s willfully unhurried.\n\nFrom there, Crushing shifts into the slow-building urgency of \u201cHead Alone,\u201d a pointed and electrifying anthem of refusal (sample lyric: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be touched all the time/I raised my body up to be mine\u201d). \u201cAs a woman, in my case as a touring musician, the way you\u2019re touched is different from your male bandmates\u2014by strangers and by those close to you,\u201d notes Jacklin. On the full-tilt, harmony-spiked \u201cPressure to Party,\u201d she pushes toward another form of emotional freedom. \u201cWhen you come out of a relationship, there\u2019s so much pressure to act a certain way,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cFirst it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve gotta take some time for yourself\u2019\u2026but then if you take too much time it\u2019s, \u2018You\u2019ve gotta get back out there!\u2019 That song is just my three-minute scream, saying I\u2019m going to do what I need to do, when I need to do it.\u201d Crushing also shows Jacklin\u2019s autonomy on songs like \u201cConvention,\u201d an eye-rolling dismissal of unsolicited advice, presented in elegantly sardonic lyrics (\u201cI can tell you won\u2019t sleep well, if you don\u2019t teach me how to do it right\u201d).\n\nElsewhere on Crushing, Jacklin brings her exacting reflection to songs on loss. With its transportive harmonies and slow-burning guitar solo, \u201cDon\u2019t Know How to Keep Loving You\u201d ponders the heartache in fading affection (\u201cI want your mother to stay friends with mine/I want this feeling to pass in time\u201d). Meanwhile, on \u201cTurn Me Down\u201d\u2014an idiosyncratically arranged track embedded with hypnotic guitar tones\u2014Jacklin gives an exquisitely painful glimpse at unrequited devotion (\u201cHe took my hand, said I see a bright future/I\u2019m just not sure that you\u2019re in it\u201d). \u201cThat song destroyed me in the studio,\u201d says Jacklin of \u201cTurn Me Down,\u201d whose middle section contains a particularly devastating vocal performance. \u201cI remember lying on the floor in a total state between what felt like endless takes, and if you listen it kind of sounds like I\u2019m losing my mind.\u201d And on \u201cWhen the Family Flies In,\u201d Jacklin shares her first ever piano-driven piece, a beautifully muted elegy for the same friend to whom she dedicated Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win. \u201cThere are really no words to do justice to what it feels like to lose a friend,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cIt felt a bit cheap to even try to write a song about it, but this one came out on tour and it finally felt okay to record.\n\nDespite its complexity, Crushing unfolds with an ease that echoes Jacklin\u2019s newfound self-reliance as an artist. Originally from the Blue Mountains, she grew up on her parents\u2019 Billy Bragg and Doris Day records and sang in musicals as a child, then started writing her own songs in her early 20s. \u201cWith the first album I was so nervous and didn\u2019t quite see myself as a musician yet, but after touring for two years, I\u2019ve come to feel like I deserve to be in that space,\u201d she says.\n\nThroughout Crushing, that sense of confidence manifests in one of the most essential elements of the album: the captivating strength of Jacklin\u2019s lyrics. Not only proof of her ingenuity and artistic generosity, Jacklin\u2019s uncompromising specificity and infinitely unpredictable turns of phrase ultimately spring from a certain self-possession in the songwriting process.\n\n\u201cAs I was making this album there was sort of a slow loosening of pressure on myself,\u201d Jacklin says. \u201cThere\u2019ve been some big life changes for me over the last few years, and I just found it too tiring to try to cover things up with a lot of metaphors and word trickery. I just wanted to lay it all out there and trust that, especially at such a tense moment in time, other people might want to hear a little vulnerability.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nicki Sbaffoni Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8549363.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Pop, Folk Rock, Cover Band, Acoustic", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With a mantra of \"strum and wail\u201d, Nicki Sbaffoni consistently surprises and delights audiences with powerful and creatively twisted versions of all your favorite songs.

The duo have been hard at work on their upcoming album, recorded in California by Noah Shain (whose most recent production Badflower\u2019s \u2018Ghost\u2019 recently occupied the Number 1 spot in the US rock chart). Their second album showcases how diligently the band have honed their sound since their debut, developing musical layers and refining production to create something utterly unique.\n\nThe rising twosome are now ready to gather more friends and fans with the mind-blowing power of their new release, Whiskey. The track, a raw personal lament on Dolly's tumultuous relationship with alcohol, rages with the band\u2019s trademark ferocity as whirring hooks race alongside tremendous beats. The immense power of front-woman Dolly\u2019s vocals married with Guitarist Mickey Danger\u2019s riotous riffs blast into your ears, propelling the track forward at break-neck speed. Of the track, Daggerz comments: \u201cI wanted to describe how I'd become dependent on alcohol to feel ok. I got so used to drinking whiskey straight out of the bottle before jumping on stage. I thought being wasted was the only way I could perform as a riotous female.

High from the adrenaline of our show then so low the next day...I could see a nasty end for myself if I didn't pack it in.\"\n\nWhiskey, with its seething frenzied energy, is an electrifying single that will instantly hit you with powerful force.

Don\u2019t they sometimes play jazz? Aren\u2019t half of them dead or something?\u201d\n\nSo bear with us, sunshine, cos you clearly need educating.\n\nThe story starts with Paul-Ronney Angel, a man with a double-barrelled first name.

(Before he left they tried him in the Norwegian Army \u2013 he lasted a total of five hours.)\n\nAfter that, Angel washed up in London during the dying breaths of Thatcherism and took advantage of all that swinging London had to offer: he sold The Big Issue, busked Johnny Thunders & Robert Johnson numbers in Soho bus stops and played guitar for anyone who\u2019d have him.\n\nThe Urban Voodoo Machine came to him in 2002 as a fully-formed idea.

This is where Scott Doonican the story-teller, entertainer and showman, gets the opportunity to take the band's extensive back-catalogue of comic-songs and perform them, stripped-back, on just his battered 'Workhorse' acoustic guitar or his little banjulele in his hand. Here, the Doonicans' side-splitting song-smithery, comes to the fore, often accompanied by with an abundance of cracking yarns, giving a charming insight to the inspiration behind them.\n\n\n\nInto his third decade of bringing smiles and belly-laughs to audiences across the UK; from Barnsley to Barnstaple, from Glasgow to Glastonbury Festival, Scott continues to wow audiences with a fine selection of The Bar-Steward Sons' greatest hits, including the likes of \u201cThe Lady In Greggs\u201d, \"How Deep Is Your Glove?\", \"Nandos\", \u201cPaint 'em Back\", \"Walking In Manpiss\" and \u201cIf I Could Punch A Face\u2026 It\u2019d Be Justin Bieber\u2019s\u201d.\n\n\n\nWith over 1000 shows under his belt to date, Scott Doonican is driven by the desire to leave his audiences with a big grin on their faces. He subscribes to the same wise words of his spiritual father, Val Doonican, that, \"When you entertain the public, it's no good just having good music or singing, you must also have entertainment value, so people will go home having a good time\".\n\n\n\nSo, can you trust him? To be silly, yes. To behave, hell no.

Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week.

The band\u2019s seventh album, Wildness, their first in seven years, entered the UK charts at Number Two, went gold, and kept them on tour around the world for the best part of 18 months.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gigging time, but also a lot of thinking time.\n\n\u201cWhere did it all go right?\u201d echoes Lighbtody. \u201cNo idea!\u201d the singer and songwriter laughs. \u201cAfter 10 years of no success, no one \u2013 least of all us \u2013 expected us these last 15 years to sell 17 million albums, headline festivals and play to thousands of people all over the world.\u201d\nAdd to that: one billion global track streams, five UK platinum albums, an Ivor Novello award and Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominations. And, in the shape of Chasing Cars, a modern classic recently anointed by the PPL as the most played song on UK radio of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWhen we released Final Straw in 2003, I think there was general goodwill around us from the media,\u201d continues Lightbody, \u201cas people knew the story of the previous 10 years and were kinda glad for us to get a shot on a major label,\" he notes of their move from indie Jeepster (also original home of Belle and Sebastian) to discerning Polydor imprint Fiction. That \u201csea-change\u201d set in motion the next phase of the band\u2019s existence. Still, in music, as in life, nothing is a given. \u201cOf course the good grace of the press is hard won and easy lost, but radio kept on playing us. That\u2019s been the real key to our success, I firmly believe. Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. On those shows we did some of the songs close to how they sound on the Reworked album \u2013 for example, the new version of You\u2019re All I Have came directly out of playing those acoustic shows.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re All I Have is the opening track from 2006\u2019s Eyes Open, the album that also featured Chasing Cars. On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain. Iain came up with the beautiful, John Martyn-style guitar, and his version floored me when I heard it the first time. Iain\u2019s guitar playing has always been a joy to listen to and to have it feature so prominently on this album is just amazing.\"\n\nAlso presented in simple acoustic simplicity is Chocolate, the third single from Final Straw, and produced here in classy, \u201ctime-stopping\u201d style by McDaid. \u201cChocolate has been a live favourite since we released it. It\u2019s a song all Snow Patrol fans know \u2013 I can\u2019t attest that they all love it but they know it!\u201d its co-author laughs. \u201cAnd we wanted to rework the songs that the fans are the most familiar with. There's not much point in reworking songs people don\u2019t really know as there's not really a stark contrast.\u201d\nThat said, \u201cwe will be doing something with the first two albums before the release of Reworked as those two albums do not feature for that same reason,\u201d Lightbody teases.\nWhat of the recent Twitter \u201caccusation\u201d that SP have \u201cdisowned\u201d those albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It\u2019s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2001), because they don\u2019t play the songs live?\n\u201cNot true at all,\u201d he replies with a shake of the head. \u201cWe are very proud of them. It\u2019s just that when we play those songs live they negatively affect the atmosphere of the gig. And as Star Trek taught us: \u2018The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat need to entertain and surprise also informed the approach taken to Called Out In The Dark. The curtain-raiser from 2011's Fallen Empires now comes with an inventive synth throb that echoes the original.\n\u201cI had worried a little that the whole record was getting very downtempo,\u201d admits Lightbody. \u201cThe nature of recording in hotel rooms and dressing rooms is that things will invariably be low-key. Hard to rock out with a family of four in the next hotel room trying to sleep!\n\u201cSo when it came to some of the songs we recorded towards the end of the new album, we wanted to explore a slightly higher tempo \u2013 without, of course, leaning too heavy into the original version. Called Out\u2026 is certainly the closest to the original version of any song on Reworked, but I think distinct enough to warrant its place. It has an electro bent like the original but steers clear of any of its predecessor\u2019s tropes. I asked Iain to lift it up and he sure did.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the three new songs. First up, the lovely, heart-stopping Time Won\u2019t Go Slowly.\n\u201cJohnny and I wrote this in his house in LA. We\u2019re both massive fans of Frank Ocean, so we wanted it to sound like Frank Ocean crossed with Frank Sinatra. All the Franks! It\u2019s a classic crooner track. We just wanted to try something starkly different from anything we have done before.\n\"As for the lyrics, I guess I\u2019ve not written about love for a while and needed a fix,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI like the idea of the inherent tragedy woven into the fabric of time: time speeds up when we're having a great time and slows down when we're miserable. Although it\u2019s all perception, of course, not reality. And I like that, too. That distortion. Our minds are powerful and sometimes terrible things. I guess the song tries to wrap its head around that great cosmic joke. Also it\u2019s just a love song.\"\nThen there\u2019s I Think of Home, a folk-flavoured piano ballad with vivid, evocative and deeply personal lyrics. Lightbody wrote it in 2014, as part of a five-song contribution \u201cto a night dedicated to my greatest literary hero Seamus Heaney when he opened the Seamus Heaney Home Place in Magherafelt. They wanted me to play a few songs at the opening night.\n\u201cI set my own rules for the songs\u2019 content,\" he expands. \"They had to be inspired by what Heaney had been inspired by: home, family, Ireland, The Troubles, hope, the soil\u2026\u201d\nI Think of Home was later considered for inclusion on Wildness, but none of the versions the band tried out in the studio fitted.\n\u201cBut then we went on tour with Wildness and at shows in Ireland and Irish strongholds like Boston, New York, Sydney and Melbourne, I would play I Think Of Home acoustically on my own in the middle of gigs. It would always go down well.\n\u201cSo when it came to Reworked we had lived with the song enough to feel like we could do a great version of it. And Johnny produced a stunning version of it. I had been playing it a certain way for so long it was hard for me to hear it any other way. That can be dangerous \u2013 stagnation can set in. So when that happens you have to let someone you trust take it from you and remake it. So, in the spirit of what we were doing, it was great to get a reworked version of a song that had never even been released.\"\nThe third new song is Made Of Something Different Now, which is quietly sweeping, quietly epic and wholly devastating.\n\u201cOne of my favourite tracks we have done in ages,\" nods Lightbody. \"In keeping with the Reworked attitude of trying new things, it\u2019s unlike much of what we\u2019ve done before. Lyrically, it\u2019s the story of a dear friend\u2019s heartbreak. My own heart, having not been in a relationship in ten years, is unrisked so unbroken. A damning self-portrait if ever there was one! Writing this song \u2013 with Johnny \u2013 made me realise my own lack of bravery in that department. Hasn\u2019t effected any change yet, mind you, but it did start me thinking at least\u2026 Anyway, as us Celts say, it\u2019s a belter,\u201d he grins.\n\nThe final word should go to Take Back The City. Gary Lightbody\u2019s hymn to Belfast is the song that opens Reworked and is sure to be an emotive live highlight when Snow Patrol take Reworked on the road later this year. As he reflects on 25 years of Snow Patrol, how have his feelings about the city changed in the 11 years since the song was released?\n\u201cWell, as the song says, I love Belfast tonight and always. There are still things that drive me crazy about the place. But I think that's the same for everyone\u2019s home city \u2013 although my home town, of course, is Bangor.\n\u201cMy love has deepened though not waned. I see the conflict that still goes on in people\u2019s hearts, my own included, and yet there is this drive in most people \u2013 most people \u2013 to put the past behind us and move on. To lift each other up.\n\u201cWe need that now more than ever with the looming clusterfuck that is Brexit and the devastation it has the potential to bring to the whole of UK, but to Northern Ireland more than anywhere else. We need that will to put the past behind us and lift each other.\u201d\n\nHear, hear. Equally, with these 16 inspiring, enveloping tracks, this is also moment to embrace the past \u2013 and, like the man said, to use it to lift each other. This is Reworked. This is Snow Patrol\u2019s history, and their legacy. And it\u2019s their inspired next step.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Aranza ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/146614.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sonic Boom Six ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8411353.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Ska Punk, Reggae, Punk, Ska", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "From Manchester\u2019s dynamic musical landscape comes the most compelling soundclash to rise from the underground for years. Few bands can so smoothly mix dancefloor-savvy elements of reggae, jungle and ska with the rigorous commentary of hip-hop whilst retaining enough grit and aggression to be an active fixture of the UK\u2019s punk scene. Only Sonic Boom Six are propelled by the melodious rapping of Laila K who (characteristically contrary to the stereotype of a young asian female from Hulme) is one of the most incendiary vocalists to ever bounce around a moshpit of Mohawks. A true product of their environment - the sound of a thousand city-centre clubnights and student party mash-ups invigorate the righteous fury of distorted guitars and dubby grooves \u2013 SB6 create a sound as authentic as it is unique.

Arcade Perfect drops on November 12th, 2007 on the band\u2019s own label imprint, Rebel Alliance (distributed by Code 7). Speaking on the new material Laila comments \u201cit\u2019s been the first time we\u2019ve felt like the record speaks for itself whereas in the past our records have kind of been an extension to the live show.\u201d Ben continues \u201cWe\u2019ve spent so much time playing to fresh crowds in across Europe - where they genuinely know nothing about you and you have to entertain non-stop for an hour and a half or more - that our writing was influenced by that vibe. We wanted to keep the inventiveness of our older stuff for the current fans whilst also being able to make a room full of kids in a squat dance their arses off when they hear these songs for the first time.\u201d\n\nThis outlook extends into the band\u2019s distinctive tradition of the mixing the narrative and wordplay of hip-hop with an unflinching commentary of their surroundings that snarls with the studded spirit of 77. \u201cI\u2019ve always been as influenced by rappers lyrically as I have by rock artists\u201d explains Barney, \u201cI\u2019m definitely drawn to the idea of talking directly about an issue rather than shrouding the whole thing in poetry. I think it\u2019s the most effective way to get a point across\u201d. SB6 include their comrades Johnny One Lung (the Filaments) Itch (the King Blues) Babar Luck (ex-King Prawn) and Matt Reynolds (Howards Alias) in the action; a chorus of dissent from the scene they have been involved with over the last five years. Sonic Boom Six released their first two EPs on Moon Ska Europe before signing to Deck Cheese Records in the UK for their acclaimed debut album, The Ruff Guide to Genre-Terrorism which they promoted a Radio One Punk Show session and gigs alongside such as Mad Caddies, Hard-Fi, Flogging Molly and RX Bandits as well as festival appearances at Glastonbury, Rebellion and the Lock-Up Stage at Reading and Leeds festivals.\n\nIn addition to Sonic Boom Six, the band perform acoustic reggae sets as Babyboom; a project that specialises in playing fundraisers, houseparties and holding musical workshops\u2026 but won\u2019t turn their nose up at busking for a few extra pennies during tours. Laila, Ben and Barney are also members of Suicide Bid, the ongoing dub-punk collective who are beginning work on their third full-length. A continuation of the DIY approach at the heart of band\u2019s ethos, SB6 arrange the Ruff and Ready package tour which provides a collective platform for some of the most intensifying underground bands around and toured to resonant success in 2007 and is set to return in Spring 2008. Touring in the past year has placed Sonic Boom Six on festival stages at Fusion (D), Rockade (D), Mondiali (IT), City Invasion (UK), Rock Im Dorf (A) and the Lock-Up stage at Reading and Leeds festival as well as support slots at high-profile shows with Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake and Bad Brains.

The Motet respect and revere this time-honored phenomenon. Fusing fiery funk, simmering soul, and improvisational inventiveness, the Denver, CO seven-piece\u2014Lyle Divinsky [vocals], Dave Watts [drums], Joey Porter [keyboards], Garrett Sayers [bass], Ryan Jalbert [guitar], Parris Fleming [trumpet], and Drew Sayers [saxophone]\u2014have continually provided an escape for listeners over the course of seven full-length albums since 1998, including their latest release Totem and with an upcoming 2018 release. That extends to countless sold out shows and festivals everywhere from Bonnaroo, Electric Forest, and Summer Camp to All Good Music Festival and High Sierra Music Festival as well as 16 consecutive years of themed Halloween concerts.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re listening to us, I want your mind to be taken away from wherever you are during the day and into some other place,\u201d states Dave. \u201cIt\u2019s all about that.\u201d\n\nAfter quietly building a diehard and devoted following, 2016 represented a watershed year for the musicians. They welcomed Lyle and Drew into the fold and released Totem, which drew acclaim from Relix, AXS, 303 Magazine, and many others. For the first time, The Motet sold out the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater\u2014the holy grail venue of their hometown\u2014cataloged on Live at Red Rocks. Sell-outs followed everywhere from The Fillmore (San Francisco) and Tipitina\u2019s (New Orleans) to Brooklyn Bowl (Brooklyn), Park West (Chicago), and Crystal Ballroom (Portland). The group locked into an unbreakable groove.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been a band that just blew up overnight,\u201d Dave goes on.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very tenacious about our movement forward. We\u2019ve been through many different iterations throughout the years. Right now, it feels like we\u2019ve got the lineup that\u2019s making an impression on our scene. Lyle is the perfect match for us. He\u2019s got musicality and this raw energy we all resonate with. He ignited this spark to put work in and write inspiring music.\u201d\n\nThat spark lit again in 2017. Following Jam Cruise and a second Red Rocks gig, the band fired up the new single \u201cSupernova.\u201d Strutting between hypnotic horns and swaggering guitars, the track sees The Motet blast off to another galaxy. Quickly racking up over 150k Spotify streams in a month\u2019s time, it instantly excited fans.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.livexlive.com/live-events/festival/lfot-summer-camp-weekend-pass"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DUNE (Official) ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10391847.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Harder Styles Of Dance, Happy Hardcore, Rave, Techno, Electronic", "Time": "8:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "www.dune.dance", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rita Laranjeira ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9140633.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Sintra, Portugal", "Time": "8:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "I study at the Sintra Music Conservatory and currently attend the 5th degree of Violin, Orchestra, Musical Educatin and Choir.\nI represented Portugal at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in Minsk, Belarus (2018). \u201cBest experience ever!!!\u201d\nFrequently attend workshops at EDSAE and several formations:\n- Musical Theater Course with the actress and singer Wanda Stuart, project Kids on Broadway\n- Musical Theater Workshop at Act School with the actress Sissi Martins\n- Fashion, Casting and Representation at ProModel\n- Acting and acting for TV at Modact with director Paulo Brito\nI have singing and piano lessons at Academia Atelier da M\u00fasica to obtain the \u201cGrade Exam\u201d and \u201cPerformance Certificate\u201d diplomas from RSL (RockSchool).\nI was reinforced at the Lisbon Youth Choir in Operas and Concerts staged at the National Theater of S\u00e3o Carlos, CCB and Coliseus, with Maestro Nuno Margarido Lopes.\nFollow me on social media:\nwww.instagram.com/ritalaranjeiraoficial\nwww.youtube.com/ritalaranjeira\nwww.facebook.com/ritalaranjeira05", "otherInfo": "Rita Laranjeira's Live stream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Stephen B Lawrence ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8490594.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "8:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-songwriter Stephen B.

In the club he mixes up the likes of new stars Dusky and Huxley with the next level, underground gems he sources from labels and producers across the world, crafted with the kind of experience that only comes from two decades of DJing. The same fervent, crate-digging attitude he\u2019s always been known for can also be found on his radio show, where he champions new talent and obscure tracks he picks up on his travels, having first roadtested them in the booth.\n\nHis label, UNDR THE RADR, launched in 2014 with his own \u2018Dangerous Thoughts\u2019 track (under his S-Man guise), also saw the collaboration \u2018Drop The Needle\u2019 with Man Without A Clue & Kevin Knapp. The collaborations with Huxley (\u2018The Calling\u2019) and Tough Love (\u2018In The Name Of Love\u2019) followed suit, continuing the theme of exploring new ground that was shown with his \u2018Amour\u2019 single for Riva Starr\u2019s Snatch label.\n\nFrom a humble beginning in NYC to multi-year residencies in Ibiza; from digging in dusty crates to headlining festival main-stages around the world, Roger is truly a self-made man and and dance music star. The crafting of Roger Sanchez, the DJ, started in the late 80s in Corona, Queens, where as a young man he was enticed by the early roots of hip-hop sprouting all over New York. Attending parties by the Bronx River and other jams as a break-dancer and graffiti artist, Sanchez was introduced to DJ\u2019ing through friends, trying his hand in an organic environment where his creativity behind the decks flourished from a few singles into an ambitious catalogue of over two thousand original productions and remixes.\n\nThese tracks have not always been under his own name, though. Roger has released music under a slew of monikers, including S-Man, Roger S., The Nu-Solution, Underground Solution, DV8, Ego Trip, El Mariachi, The Funkjunkeez, Tribal Infusion, Twilight, and Transatlantic Soul amongst others. Each new name has allowed him to push his music in unique yet blended directions, allowing him to carve parallel and weaving paths through the tastes of the times while enjoying opportunities to break out of the known.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s DJ\u2019d knows that you have to put in work, both to sharpen your skills and to find those unique cuts that no one else has. Early on, Roger became a dedicated crate digger, searching for obscure samples and break beats in influential NYC record stores like Rock & Soul and Vinylmania.\n\nFormerly a talented student of the arts who attended the Pratt Institute\u2019s School of Architecture, music culture grew to encompass Roger\u2019s life as he began to sell his own mixtapes on the sidewalks of Broadway in order to finance his earliest gigs. With encouragement from his father, an engineer, Roger put his thoughts about a career in architecture on hold and launched himself into music full-time. His first 12-inch, \u201cDreamworld\u201d, came out on the Outer Limits imprint in 1990 under the name Egotrip. It was around this time, that Sanchez began to take producing seriously as a compliment to his DJ\u2019ing. He soon released \u201cLuv Dancin\u201d for Gladys Pizarro on the iconic Strictly Rhythm records under the name Underground Solution, which led to his first tour.\n\nRoger hasn\u2019t stopped grinding since, using his decades of experience to build enticing remixes for a wide range of artists such as Michael Jackson, The Police, Diana Ross, Jamiroquai, Maroon 5 and even the So-Cal punk-pop outfit, No Doubt, for which he won a Grammy in 2003 for Best Remixed Recording with the song \u201cHella Good\u201d.\n\nAn early pioneer of podcasting, Roger was awarded the first-ever Best Podcast Award at the International Dance Music Awards in 2007. In addition to his bi-weekly podcast, he also hosts a weekly terrestrial and online radio show, which attracts over 10 million listeners across a worldwide audience. The Release Yourself Radio Show is broadcasted in 30 markets on every continent, including countries as diverse as Brazil, Russia, Mexico, the UK, Germany and Australia. In addition to broadcasting, he creates podcasts and mixes from the road, dominating a tour schedule that would exhaust even the most hardened of festival warriors. This man is on a mission to spread the musical word to every corner of the globe. In addition to his tireless touring, broadcasting and producing schedule, Roger has held prominent residencies on the island of Ibiza since the year 2000 at some of the biggest superclubs on The White Isle, including Pacha, Space and Amnesia; after taking a break in 2015 he\u2019ll return there in 2016. With a true international appeal, real fans look to house music leaders like Sanchez to keep music\u2019s honesty at the forefront of their vision. Furthermore, he has carefully assembled celebrated compilation albums under the Release Yourself title every year since 2002, showcasing his own work alongside tunes from both established and new talents.\n\nEver evolving on his hustle, always pushing himself, and others, to do better, the S-Man sums it up perfectly when he states: \u201cI\u2019m always moving forward, but never losing sight of where I\u2019ve been.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bad Bad Hats ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8716873.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Pop, Indie Pop", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "New album \"Lightning Round\" out August 3rd via Afternoon Records!", "otherInfo": "Our weekly YouTube series, featuring covers, originals, Q+A and more.

Now, on their fourth studio album Crush, drummer Adam Deitch, guitarists Adam Smirnoff and Eric Krasno, bassist Erick \u201cJesus\u201d Coomes, keyboardist Neal Evans, saxophonist Ryan Zoidis, and trumpet players Eric Bloom and Rashawn Ross deepen that sound by channeling the sonic freedom and infectious energy oftheir incendiary live show.\n\nProduced by Lettuce and Co-Produced recorded/mixed by Joel Hamilton at Brooklyn\u2019s Studio G, Crush first came to life on the road, with the band developing new material and testing it out live as they toured. \u201cWe\u2019ve all noticed that our music goes into a lot of different directions onstage, and we wanted to capture that in a way that we never really have before,\u201d says Coomes, who names classic psychedelia and \u201890s hip-hop among Lettuce\u2019s key inspirations on\nCrush. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more wide-open in terms\nstyle, but it still stays true to the funk.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to 2012\u2019s Fly, Crush finds Lettuce brilliantly infusing their psychedelic and hip-hop sensibilities into bass-heavy funk. With its spidery guitar work and hypnotic beats, \u201cPhyllis\u201d is a delicately sprawling epic that embodies what Deitch refers to as \u201ca chill-hop vibe that\u2019s kind of the flip-side of all that powerful uptempo funk that people might expect from us.\u201d On \u201cGet Greasy,\u201d Lettuce give a nod to the\ngroove-fueled EDM subgenre known as future funk, building off its highly danceable rhythm with a blissfully loose and horn-laced arrangement. And on \u201cHe Made a Woman Out of Me,\u201d guest vocalist Alecia Chakour lends her bluesy growl to a scorching take on Bobbie Gentry\u2019s 1970 country-soul classic.\n\nWhether paying homage to Led Zeppelin on the fiery and guitar-driven \u201cSilverdome\u201d or delivering a deeply riveting and richly textured hip-hop medley with \u201cOresteia,\u201d Lettuce maneuver through Crush\u2019s kaleidoscopic sound with sophisticated ease and powerful synergy. \u201cMore so than any of the records we\u2019ve done before, this album is very much about the improvised grooves and improvised solos,\u201d says Krasno. \u201cInstead of going at it like, \u2018Here\u2019s a melody, now here\u2019s a guitar solo, here\u2019s another\nmelody, here\u2019s a sax solo,\u2019 everyone\u2019s leaning on each other in a way that\u2019s completely unspoken. It\u2019s all of us moving as one unit and creating this new sound together.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lettuce, that sense of unity and togetherness has much to do with a camaraderie that\u2019s only intensified over the lifespan of the band. Formed in 1992, when several band members attended a summer program at Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music as teenagers, Lettuce was founded on a shared love of legendary funk artists like Earth, Wind & Fire and Tower of Power. After returning to Berklee\nas undergrads in 1994, Lettuce started playing in local clubs and steadily built up a following that soon extended to cities across the country and then throughout the world. Releasing their studio debut Outta Here in 2002 and its follow-up album Rage!in 2009, the band dedicated the coming years to balancing their frequent touring with involvement in a host of other musical endeavors (including Evans and Krasno\u2019s role as founding members of acclaimed soul/jazz trio Soulive).\n\nIn recent years, Lettuce have watched their fanbase expand as they\u2019ve hit bigger and bigger stages and earned their name as a can\u2019t-miss festival act.

In all he does so with restraint, whether on country tinged acoustic ballads (the excellent \"Amen\") or aching confession-drenched numbers\"[1] \"Battered Wooden Body\" was recorded in Oxford, Mississippi at Tweed Recording Studio and was engineered by Andrew Ratcliffe whose discography includes (The Black Crows, The Damnwells, American Aquarium)\n\nIn 2012, Shallow left A Few Good Liars and started writing and recording songs that would later be released as his first solo self-titled album, Travis Shallow, to regional critical acclaim in the southeastern United States.\n\nShallow went back to Tweed Recording Studio with Andrew Ratcliffe engineering to record his solo debut album. This solo album was acoustically driven with an accompanying band to highlight the songwriting and lyrical prowess. \"Shallow is a singer whose vocal personality is ultimately a category unto itself, like a Willie Nelson, an Otis Redding. He could sing anything and make it sound great, make it well worth listening to. His self-titled album has seven songs like that.\"[2] Shallow's solo album has a maturity to it that catapulted Shallow into being a weathered musician's musician.\n\nAfter the release of his self-titled album in March 2016, Shallow took the show to the people performing intimate shows, stripped down with him and an acoustic guitar. Shallow also landed himself some national opening spots after releasing his debut solo album with legend Gregg Allman from The Allman Brothers, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real (son of legend Willie Nelson), Jerry Joseph, Todd Snider, and fellow native North Carolina band, American Aquarium.\n\n\"One look at Travis Shallow and you could be deceived. Long hair, blue jeans, worn cowboy boots and sunglasses, toting a guitar case, it makes you think he\u2019s always wanted to be a musician, swagger and all.\"[3]\nShallow is now writing for and fronting a new line-up, Travis Shallow & The Deep End, with a studio album titled, The Great Divide, released on October 31, 2017.

It was a bit of good luck.\u201d\n\nThese grainy, absorbing images play over the exhilarating whirl of \u201cDivebomber\u201d, a song inspired by the World War II film of the same name, and one of several on his new album that evoke a sensation of sharp ascent, of giddy height, the free-fall thrill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rush, if you fly fast enough. With a rush of blood, you can bet you forget everyone.\u201d\n\nFinn did not set out on his third solo album with a theme in mind. But by the time he came to call it after another track on the record, \u201cDizzy Heights\u201d, it had become inescapable. \u201cIt crept up on me. I started noticing it in lots of places.\n\n\u201cYou start off with a number of different threads and angles and demos, and they dictate the terms of the record. It\u2019s only in the course of the process that you maybe get a feeling there\u2019s a type of song emerging, or an atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe cloud jumpers epitomise, too, the Finn creative process: an attachment to a work-ethic and prosaic rigour - \u201ca willingness to be disciplined, punctual and focused\u201d \u2013 but designed for the arrival of something more, \u201cto capture the little flashes of complete happenstance or good fortune that come your way \u2013 often from a mistake\u201d.\n\nAn indirect inspiration for the height motif is mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1953, five years before Neil was born. \u201cHilary had a huge impact on my generation of New Zealanders,\u201d says Finn. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the New Zealand DNA about trying to scale impossible heights. It\u2019s something that can be very positive, but also has its downside.\u201d\n\nAmid its vertiginous, richly melodic swirl, Dizzy Heights contemplates love (\u201cBetter than TV\u201d), loss (\u201cFlying in the Face of Love\u201d), ageing (\u201cRecluse\u201d) and allure (\u201cLights of New York\u201d). It peeks, too - in \u201cIn My Blood\u201d, for example - into the abyss.\n\nNeil Finn was 18 when he was invited by his older brother Tim to join the trailblazing art rock band Split Enz. His career since might be measured as a series of bounds, the best-known being Crowded House, which he founded with Paul Hester and Nick Seymour after the breakup of Split Enz in 1984. Four albums, among them Crowded House and Together Alone, brought the group popular and critical acclaim around the world.\n\nAlong the way, there have been a host of collaborations, including with brother Tim and wife Sharon, and an array of names from Johnny Marr, Ed O\u2019Brien, Eddie Vedder and most of Wilco. There have been two solo records, Try Whistling This and One Nil (or One All). And yet Dizzy Heights unmistakably marks a fresh leap.\n\nWith wife Sharon (bass) and sons Liam (guitar) and Elroy (drums), Finn travelled in two bursts to producer Dave Fridmann\u2019s Tarbox Road studio in upstate New York, to record songs composed at his Auckland studio, Roundhead. With Fridmann (Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips), and in collaborations with young New Zealand musicians Connan Mockasin and SJD, Finn has assembled a textured, heady sound, furnished and elevated by woozy strings and soaring vocals.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it a solo record in a stripped back singer-songwriter sort of way,\u201d says Finn. \u201cI had a feeling Dave would be good at adding some odd shapes to the music. Which I always welcome \u2013 making things a little more expansive ... He is good at subverting things, and making things sound a bit messed up and not as obvious, rather than being too tasteful, which is always a temptation.\u201d\n\nFinn remembers an important English teacher, from four decades ago at his high school in Te Awamutu, a small rural town in New Zealand\u2019s north island. His name was Ron Martin, and he raced them through the School Certificate syllabus in a matter of weeks, to clear space for reading, writing, arguing, making films (\u201cHe [later] gave me a Super-8 movie I\u2019d made in his class, and I\u2019d done a kind of dramatised version of the song \u2018Aqualung\u2019 by Jethro Tull ... I was dressed as a tramp with an old coat\u201d).\n\nSays Finn: \u201cWe had a very spirited debate one day in class about whether having big aspirations, big dreams, was a good idea given it can ultimately lead to disillusionment and isolation and at worst bitterness. There was quite a lot of variance of opinion, and I definitely came out for the, yeah, you\u2019ve got to have the big dreams and big aspirations and it doesn\u2019t matter, what the hell.\n\n\u201cI think of that sometimes when ambition, or having big dreams, seems slightly shallow and vain. Because the motivations they shift \u2013 imperceptibly sometimes ...\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like those boys, jumping off that cliff. I keep thinking back to the one who runs to the edge and stops twice, before leaping off. Life carries on being like that.\u201d\n\n- TOBY MANHIRE", "otherInfo": "Neil Finn is back for more Fangradio live audio streams on Mixlr, Tuesdays and Saturdays at 3pm PT.\n\n\"Tuesday will be broadcast from my place, more or less solo.

Pianist Kenny Hensley learned to fly planes and enrolled in kung-fu training in China, while bassist Chris Zasche packed up a camper and went off the grid in the Canadian Rockies. Drummer Tyler Williams put down stakes across the country and immersed himself in the burgeoning music scene in Richmond, Va., while vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Charity Rose Thielen honed her compositional skills by writing for such legends as Mavis Staples.\n\nAfter his own cross-country trip to reconnect with family and friends, vocalist/guitarist Jonathan Russell traveled to Haiti and found inspiration working with the non-profit Artists For Peace And Justice. \"When I found out we were going to have a significant amount of time off, I saw it as an opportunity to touch base again -- to listen to what other people were saying and what they were going through,\" he says. \"I really wanted to make sure that I reconnected with a world that was starting to feel farther and farther away.\"\n\nWhen they regrouped last summer in Stinson Beach, Ca., to start writing together again, \"it almost felt like we were a new band, trying things we hadn't tried,\" Zasche recalls. \"We stayed at a bungalow on the beach. We'd wake up, have coffee and go boogie boarding. We were ready and excited to be back together.\"\n\nThat renewed sense of purpose can be felt throughout Signs Of Light, the group's first release for Warner Bros. Records. \"This album isn't about us now having achieved our dreams,\" says Thielen. \"The day we started being able to live off our art was the day we achieved our dreams, in my mind. This is the album where we really fell into our true voices as those artists.\"\n\nRecorded in Nashville with producer Jay Joyce (Eric Church, Cage The Elephant), Signs Of Light, crackles with the upbeat, sing-a-long energy of the Head And The Heart's finest work. Lead single \"All We Ever Knew,\" which was written during the \"Let's Be Still\" era but never captured to the band's satisfaction until now, is sure to be a crowd-pleaser, while \"Turn It Around\" seems primed to be a future concert staple, matching its inspirational message with a lush and multi-layered soundscape.\n\nThroughout, the colors are brighter, the electric guitars are louder and the musical touchstones more universal. The propulsive, smile-inducing ode to Los Angeles \"City Of Angels\" and the head-nodding \"Rhythm & Blues\" nod to classic Fleetwood Mac, while the organ-flecked \"Dreamer\" is a timeless-sounding ballad that could have been beamed straight out of an old jukebox.\n\n\"Jay was really adamant about getting a great performance,\" group member Jonathan Russell says. \"We have all the tools in the world to make something sound real or more excitable, but it's never really as true as the band in the room for the whole take. 'City Of Angels' - we had previously re-cut that song and played it so many times. But within two takes in Nashville, we nailed it. It felt like we were playing on a massive stage in front of tons of people.\"\n\nElsewhere, Thielen's \"Library Magic\" could almost be seen as a letter to the other five members, acknowledging the ups-and-downs of life in a successful band while celebrating the unique and constantly evolving bond between them. \"I wrote that song after having our first real time off as a band,\" she says. \"It touches on the storied relationships between band members trying to survive living in a van off of accelerated time and gas station crafts for years straight, but it also applies to any of life's relationships.\"\n\nThe Head And The Heart's 2011 self-titled debut album captured a nascent but undeniable creative partnership between six strangers thrown together by little more than a shared love of music. It became one of Sub Pop Records' best-selling debut releases ever, and rocketed the band to acclaim well beyond its then-home base in Seattle. The formative experiences that followed both on and off the stage heavily informed the 2013 follow-up \"Let's Be Still,\" which continues to remind Russell of \"the stale beer, bleach and potato chips from all the venues we saw once this became our livelihood.\"\n\nOn Signs Of Light, that gamut of emotions is felt most deeply on the Josiah Johnson-penned title track, which none of the other members had ever heard until they happened to walk in on him playing it over and over at the piano during pre-production in El Paso, Texas. \"It was one of those moments where no one talks,\" Russell remembers. \"No one needs the chords; no one is looking up. You simply pick up your instrument and play. The next thing you know, nearly 10 minutes have gone by and you have no idea how or why or what just happened.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sublime with Rome ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9511702.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Reggae-pop, Alternative, Ska Punk, Reggae", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Our new album BLESSINGS is out now \u266b Watch/Listen \u2192 https://RED.lnk.to/Blessings", "otherInfo": "Join us live Memorial Day Weekend for a virtual BBQ and a full band performance on nugs.tv to benefit the MusiCares Relief Fund!

Claude VonStroke's 'Who's Afraid of Detroit?' was one of the biggest tracks of 2006 and the label it came out on is Dirtybird Records, the Bay Area brainchild of VonStroke and DJ/producer Justin Martin. VonStroke and Martin have been injecting avarian squelch, funk and swagger into the tech house template for just over a year now, but while VonStroke was 2006's unofficial best newcomer, don't be surprised if Martin doesn't fly the coop soon too.\n\nIt might be a fresh sound, but Martin is not exactly a spring chicken. He's actually been releasing records since 2003 \u2013 his first single was 'The Sad Piano' issued on Ben Watt's London label Buzzin' Fly. Its simplicity and groove made it a favourite of DJs along the lines of Derrick Carter, Pete Tong and Mark Farina, while Charles Webster\u2019s classic remix of the cut even found favour with the Germans, popping up on Steve Bug's 'Bugnology'. Since then Martin has racked up two more twelves on Buzzin' Fly and a couple of jacking house tracks and remixes on labels such as Classic and Freerange. He also promises an artist album in 2007.\n\nWhile San Francisco might not thought be thought of as a dance hotbed, there's always been enough going on to turn the most curious heads onto the culture. The early drum n bass scene turned Martin away from jazz and hip hop and onto the rave culture of the nineties, a short sharp shock which inspired him to take up DJing and producing. But the truth is Martin had always been musical \u2013 as a child he studied the saxophone and classical piano, a musicality which shows in both his productions and DJ sets. \"Justin started playing the pots and pans at the age of 2,\" his MySpace puts it. \"Now he is a DJ.\"\n\nMartin's rise has been prominent enough to even make an older tradition of West Coast house take notice. He's also a new face on Om Records, home to big West Coast househeads such as Miguel Migs, Andy Caldwell and Fred Everything. Martin\u2019s remix of Iz & Diz's 'Magnificent' is pretty slamming, and the label has also chosen him to mix a volume in their latest compilation series 'Om: Winter Sessions', on which he spins tracks and remixes from Switch, Jesse Rose, and Phonique.

Jeremy Sole is on a mission to show how music is a singular universal language, and that each culture\u2019s rhythms and melodies are no more than slang--different accents of the same mother tongue. His DJ sets, remixes and original compositions juxtapose world sounds and experimental beats into a sonic ritual - a celebration of life out loud. As a teenager, Chicago-born Jeremy Sole's loft parties were a culture clash of creative urban youth. Jeremy's upbringing was seeped in the rich Chicago history of Blues, Jazz, Disco and Funk - and he reveled in that sacred space where they all blend together. He matured as a turntablist in Jazz, Dub, and experimental hybrid bands. Meanwhile his obsession grew to include music from every corner of the world. In 2001 Sole moved to Los Angeles, and with his broad musical palette, felt right at home in the spiciest melting pot in the country. As Co-Founder and resident deejay of \"AFRO FUNK\u00c9\", Sole and his partners have drawn a loyal crowd every week for the past 9 years. This is his arena for Afrobeat, Latin, Brazilian, Indian, Jamaican and other authentic and remixed world rhythms. Hundreds of international guests have joined them, from deejays Chebi Sabbah and Cut Chemist to impromptu jam sessions with Zap Mama and Stevie Wonder. Collaborating with Eric \"Wiseacre\" Tucker, Sole returns to his underground roots with \"theLIFT\" - roaming monthly, all-night warehouse events with heavyweights like Bonobo, Nickodemus and King Britt gracing their stages. What started at his small downtown loft, grew to well over 1,500 people by their one-year anniversary. Since then, theLIFT has taken place in Miami, NYC, Palm Springs, Portugal, London, and San Francisco. Jeremy has had the honor of sharing the stage and the studio with hundreds of his creative inspirations, including Roy Ayers, Ben Harper, Tony Allen, Stevie Wonder, Seu Jorge, Fat Freddy's Drop, Parliament, Lee Scratch Perry, and Quantic. Gilles Peterson (BBC Radio1), widely known as the most influential tastemaker of our generation, listed Sole as \"#2 DJ OF THE YEAR 2011\" at Peterson's prestigious \"Worldwide Awards\". Sole's DJ performance at Coachella 2012 played a large part in further embedding his name as a pioneer in the burgeoning \"Global Bass\" scene. Sole was the last DJ to open for Ray Charles, deejayed for Sly Stone's birthday party, and had the distinct honor of mixing at the California Democratic Party's Election Night Celebration - playing for over 10,000 people at the exact moment when Barack Obama officially became the 44th President. Sole spent most of 2006 in the studio producing with Ms. Lauryn Hill. After hearing him mix, she asked if he had ever considered getting into radio, \"because this is the music the people need to hear\u201d. A few months later, KCRW called to ask him that exact same question, and he agreed to join the ranks of what New York Times dubbed the \"most influential radio station in the country,\". You can tune into Sole every Wednesday at midnight in Los Angeles on 89.9 KCRW (or worldwide, streaming and archived at www.kcrw.com/jeremysole). Sole has also produced official remixes for BECK (US), FEMI KUTI (Nigeria), NATURAL SELF (UK), NOVALIMA (Peru), JAZZANOVA (Germany), THIEVERY CORPORATION (US), ROCKY DAWUNI (Ghana), QUANTIC (Colombia) and others. In 2011, EMI enlist Sole to remix DAVID BOWIE'S \"Golden Years\". The result features Ticklah (of Antibalas and Amy Winehouse) with the Daptone musicians for an all-analog reworking of the 1976 classic. In Sole's most ambitious project to date, he enlisted some of LA's most sought-after musicians to birth an organic, turntable-led, 9-piece ensemble featuring steel drums, a 4-piece horn section, violinist and more. This massive undertaking he calls \"MUSAICS\", a musical mosaic of many genres interlaced into a spiritual dancefloor ritual. Their debut concert was held at the renowned Getty Museum, and a live album has been recorded to crystalize the improvisational style they embody. More on that in the days to come... ----------------------------- \"Jeremy Sole was a revelation.\" - Gilles Peterson \"If I was a DJ full time, I would most likely spin like Jeremy Sole.

Now, on their fourth studio album Crush, drummer Adam Deitch, guitarists Adam Smirnoff and Eric Krasno, bassist Erick \u201cJesus\u201d Coomes, keyboardist Neal Evans, saxophonist Ryan Zoidis, and trumpet players Eric Bloom and Rashawn Ross deepen that sound by channeling the sonic freedom and infectious energy oftheir incendiary live show.\n\nProduced by Lettuce and Co-Produced recorded/mixed by Joel Hamilton at Brooklyn\u2019s Studio G, Crush first came to life on the road, with the band developing new material and testing it out live as they toured. \u201cWe\u2019ve all noticed that our music goes into a lot of different directions onstage, and we wanted to capture that in a way that we never really have before,\u201d says Coomes, who names classic psychedelia and \u201890s hip-hop among Lettuce\u2019s key inspirations on\nCrush. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more wide-open in terms\nstyle, but it still stays true to the funk.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to 2012\u2019s Fly, Crush finds Lettuce brilliantly infusing their psychedelic and hip-hop sensibilities into bass-heavy funk. With its spidery guitar work and hypnotic beats, \u201cPhyllis\u201d is a delicately sprawling epic that embodies what Deitch refers to as \u201ca chill-hop vibe that\u2019s kind of the flip-side of all that powerful uptempo funk that people might expect from us.\u201d On \u201cGet Greasy,\u201d Lettuce give a nod to the\ngroove-fueled EDM subgenre known as future funk, building off its highly danceable rhythm with a blissfully loose and horn-laced arrangement. And on \u201cHe Made a Woman Out of Me,\u201d guest vocalist Alecia Chakour lends her bluesy growl to a scorching take on Bobbie Gentry\u2019s 1970 country-soul classic.\n\nWhether paying homage to Led Zeppelin on the fiery and guitar-driven \u201cSilverdome\u201d or delivering a deeply riveting and richly textured hip-hop medley with \u201cOresteia,\u201d Lettuce maneuver through Crush\u2019s kaleidoscopic sound with sophisticated ease and powerful synergy. \u201cMore so than any of the records we\u2019ve done before, this album is very much about the improvised grooves and improvised solos,\u201d says Krasno. \u201cInstead of going at it like, \u2018Here\u2019s a melody, now here\u2019s a guitar solo, here\u2019s another\nmelody, here\u2019s a sax solo,\u2019 everyone\u2019s leaning on each other in a way that\u2019s completely unspoken. It\u2019s all of us moving as one unit and creating this new sound together.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lettuce, that sense of unity and togetherness has much to do with a camaraderie that\u2019s only intensified over the lifespan of the band. Formed in 1992, when several band members attended a summer program at Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music as teenagers, Lettuce was founded on a shared love of legendary funk artists like Earth, Wind & Fire and Tower of Power. After returning to Berklee\nas undergrads in 1994, Lettuce started playing in local clubs and steadily built up a following that soon extended to cities across the country and then throughout the world. Releasing their studio debut Outta Here in 2002 and its follow-up album Rage!in 2009, the band dedicated the coming years to balancing their frequent touring with involvement in a host of other musical endeavors (including Evans and Krasno\u2019s role as founding members of acclaimed soul/jazz trio Soulive).\n\nIn recent years, Lettuce have watched their fanbase expand as they\u2019ve hit bigger and bigger stages and earned their name as a can\u2019t-miss festival act. And in making Crush, the band had no trouble harnessing the spirit of their explosive live show. \u201cSome of these shows we\u2019ve played over the past couple years have been so amazing, it\u2019s like you go home a different person,\u201d says Coomes. \u201cI\u2019m sure\nremembering those moments in our minds and our hearts helped bring out something special when we were recording these new songs.\u201d\n\nSo while Crush offers everything from all-out party jams to headphone-ready journeys into space funk, each track was born from an unabashed joy and love of live performance. \u201cThat energy we get when it\u2019s prime time and we\u2019re about to go onstage and we\u2019re just excited beyond belief\u2014that all came out on this new album,\u201d says Deitch. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that the band is rising, and it\u2019s a really beautiful thing.", "otherInfo": "1/24/2020 Replay Livestream: https://nugs.tv/default.aspx"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dirtwire ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10066863.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Blues-rock, World Fusion, Electronica", "Time": "10:22 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dirtwire sits on the front porch of Americana\u2019s future, conjuring up a whirlwind of sound using traditional instrumentation, world percussion, soundscapes, and electronic beats.

These newly mixed and mastered recordings feature the original line-up: Warren Haynes, Allen Woody and Matt Abts. \u201cHaving listened to them recently, for the first time in decades, a big smile came over my face. These recordings capture the rawness and excitement of the earliest stage of Gov\u2019t Mule,\u201d explains Haynes.\n\nRecorded during the infancy of Gov\u2019t Mule, the demos heard on The Tel-Star Sessions are from a time when Mule was an adventurous side project, formed during a year when Warren Haynes and Allen Woody had some down time from their work with the Allman Brothers Band. Becoming one of the most enduring, respected and active bands in the world was the furthest thing from the band's imagination; the plan was to record a low-budget album and play a few shows. It's now clear that they had stumbled upon something special, but at that point Mule was an experimental rock trio: Haynes, Woody and drummer Matt Abts, who Haynes brought in after playing with him in the Dickey Betts Band. Fans will love the chance to hear their early improvisational interplay, an impressive skill that has since become a signature of Gov't Mule's albums and live shows.\n\nCollaborating with Allman Brothers sound engineer Bud Snyder, and taking legendary producer Tom Dowd's advice to record all instruments simultaneously live in a room, Gov't Mule holed up in the Tampa-area studio. They recorded a mix of early originals such as \u201cBlind Man In The Dark,\u201d \u201cMonkey Hill,\u201d and \u201cLeft Coast Groovies\u201d along with covers by ZZ Top (\u201cJust Got Paid\u201d), Free (\u201cMr. Big\u201d), and Willie Dixon (\u201cThe Same Thing\u201d). Says Warren, \u201cAlong with our discussions about the \u2018power trio\u2019 being missing from the current musical landscape were the discussions of how the sound of the bass guitar had gotten progressively \u2018cleaner\u2019 since the \u201980s (or late \u201970s), and how that affected the overall feeling of the music.\u201d Their influences leaned heavily on the likes of Cream, Jimi Hendrix Experience and ZZ Top, but Mule\u2019s search to bring back a familiar sound is mingled with grunge and alt-rock influences that had just emerged in the early-mid \u201890s. Little did they know that the magic created during these sessions would spark such a prolific musical journey.\n\nThe band recorded three increasingly ambitious studio albums and performed countless shows before Woody died in August, 2000. After briefly pausing to ponder their next move, Haynes and Abts began recording The Deep End, two CDs featuring guest bassists, ranging from the Who\u2019s John Entwistle to the Grateful Dead\u2019s Phil Lesh.\n\n\u201cEverything we\u2019ve done collectively has led up to where we are now,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut those Deep End sessions, and the experience of playing with so many bassists and adapting to different sounds and approaches had a profound effect on Gov\u2019t Mule and what we\u2019ve done since.\u201d\n\nDanny Louis, a longtime collaborator, became a full-time member of Gov\u2019t Mule in 2001, and the group has been a four-piece ever since. Bassist Jorgen Carlsson has been with the group since 2008, solidifying the lineup.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the music we\u2019re doing now is very similar to the music we were making in the earliest years with the obvious exception that we are no longer a trio,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cIn some ways we\u2019ve come full circle and in other ways it only makes sense if you step back and connect the dots. And that seems right to me. You want to keep growing and you never want to be static, or done changing.\u201d\n\nWarren Haynes\u2019 unparalleled ability to bring together different musicians into a cohesive whole or to pull off epic musical happenings is one of the many reasons why Haynes stands apart from the many great front men and guitarists who have graced the musical landscape. Combined with his guitar and vocal mastery, these skills have made him an in-demand presence and indispensible musical ally for many.\n\nGov't Mule has showcased its virtuosity, intelligence and breadth for more than two decades, which have encompassed 15 studio and live albums, millions of album and track sales and thousands of performances. The band has become a human encyclopedia of timeless American music while adding to that canon with their signature sound.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.livexlive.com/live-events/festival/lfot-summer-camp-weekend-pass"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Storm Large ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7851557.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Storm Large", "Time": "10:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Storm Large: musician, actor, playwright, author, awesome.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Illicit Ghost ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10389092.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Indie Alt Pop", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "ARTIST | PRODUCER | SONGWRITER | VIOLINIST\n\nFollow Illicit Ghost:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/illicitghost\nhttps://www.facebook.com/illicitghost\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/2CQiz8RKaVtO87GvUKnZ0r?si=nZdKayOgSYS1gphZ4hED7w", "otherInfo": "I'm hosting artist interviews each Saturday with musicians who are featured on my Anti-Anxiety Spotify playlist.

It speaks to our truest selves, binds us together with the ones we love, and brings out the best part of who we are. Bobby Jo Valentine is a singer/songwriter who chases after this particular kind of music. He writes songs that travel light, but that \u201cgrow deeper and deeper with each further listen\u201d, the music publication Soundtrack to My Day describes. The poetic nature and focus of his stories and songs is something that, along with notable awards, has resulted in an incredibly loyal following of true patrons to his art, supporting Bobby in every way as he seeks to write more music that means something good, and sounds like the beautiful, terrifying world that we live in.\n\nHope-folk. Soul-pop. Poetic rock. Bobby Jo Valentine\u2019s music exists outside the lines of any genre, but the music\u2019s thoughtful lyrics and catchy melodies reach listeners on all paths of life. The authentic, universal, uncanny nature of his songs have won him Song of the Year at West Coast Songwriter\u2019s Association three times \u2013 in 2011, 2015, and 2017. He\u2019s sold 18,000 albums and performed more than 1,000 concerts\u2014all without a record label\u2014and all because of devoted groups of fans and friends who grow in number after every concert.\n\nHis wide range of expression has made it hard for the industry to package, but it\u2019s the same reason his songs are gaining a loyal following around the nation. A few songs have broken through the static. Bobby\u2019s music has appeared on radio and television, including a commercial for the recent Ford Fusion \u00a9, ABC\u2019s The Morning Blend, and the award winning film The Groom\u2019s Cake. His music has received airplay from KGO, KRSH, and other radio stations nationwide.\n\nBorn into a Baptist church of strict lines and sharp edges, and coming out of that culture to discover who he really is, Bobby is now a believer of a different sort: a believer in the wild, strange, beautiful nature of the world. Faith has come to mean something much deeper, wider, and less cut-and-dried than when he started. Now, Bobby finds that he often has more to learn from the people who don\u2019t believe as he does than from those who do. Along with theatres, house concerts, and many other venues, churches around the nation frequently invite Bobby to offer his stories and songs, challenging us to question why we believe what we do and, most importantly, how that helps us be better humans in the world around us. Among others, he has been invited to perform for The Wild Goose Festival, the national Gay Christian Network conference, the international 2016 Emerge conference, the Kinship Festival, and the 2016 UCC Gathering in Southern California. He is ecstatic any time he can discuss the big questions, challenge the easy answers, and inspire people to move closer to love.\n\nSpeaking of love, Bobby loves a good love song, and is in great demand as a performer for weddings gay and straight, all over the country. He was named \u201cBest in 2015\u201d for ceremony music by The Knot, and has received more than 35 five-star reviews for his romantic, soulful singing.\n\nBobby is a proud supporter of equal rights for all people. He believes that we\u2019re all in this together; that \u201cthe arc of the universe is long, but bends toward justice\u201d; and that real justice means justice for everyone. Bobby is a constant supporter of LGBT rights and performs at Pride festivals and benefits and for LGBT youth programs all over the US. He has also been invited to perform for many child protection, child homelessness, and domestic violence prevention non-profits, including the national Safe Place Network.\n\nWhen he isn\u2019t touring the nation singing his songs for everyone who will listen, Bobby lives on the windy coastline of Northern California. His new albums \u201cFox Eyes, Whale Heart\u201d and \"Maybe Stars\" are available worldwide on iTunes and on his website.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Matty Bernier ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10321838.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Many Different Genres", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Matty Bernier aka Matty B has over 200 5 Star reviews.

While the vocals and songs on Slings and Arrows are outstanding, the slide guitar work is the real revelation. \u201d NO DEPRESSION\n\nABOUT MICHELLE MALONE\n\nMichelle Malone is an award-winning American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and producer in the rock, folk, blues and pop idioms. She is also the founder of SBS Records.\n\nMalone was born and raised in Atlanta, GA by a musician mom with whom she toured in the summers. She grew up listening to her mother and grandmother sing in the church choir every Sunday when they werent on the road. She dropped out of high school at 16 to begin work on her rock and roll degree. After a few brushes with the law and some unsavory characters, Michelle decided to go back to high school and became the valedictorian for a small class. She attended Agnes Scott College with dreams of becoming a doctor, but was offered a record deal with Clive Davis at Arista Records, which looked alot more interesting to her than more school.\n\nWhen it came time to craft her own sound, she took those religious and secular roots, blended in enough folk, blues and rock to satisfy, and came up with a rootsy high-spirited sound that brings acoustic and electric slide and passionate vocals together harkening back to the lost recordings of Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi, and Lucinda Williams.\n\nAfter several major label releases, Malone is now an independent artist with 15 studio records to date and an impressive resume which includes hi profile performances with everyone from Gregg Allman to John Mayer, the Atlanta Symphony to Ellen Degeneres, various awards including best albums, 4x best singer, 3x best acoustic guitarist, and 2 Grammy ballot nominations. Her songs have appeared in such films as Bam Bam and Celeste, All Over Me, Shotgun Jesus and television programs True Blood, Dawson's Creek, Felicity, Brooklyn South. They have been recorded by Indigo Girls (for which she received both gold and platinum records), Antigone Rising, and Vistoso Bosses.\n\nMalone has always made time for philanthropic endeavors such as running the Paris marathon for Team In Training/The Leukemia Society, and cycling with Team Earth Challenge from Atlanta to Yucca Mountain, NV in protest of the nuclear waste dumping. In 2012 she started a college scholarship fund for girls in need. She currently contributes to various women's and children's non-profit organizations, and donates time to local Georgia music organizations and schools.\n\nMalone has performed for TedX Peachtree, sang the National Anthem for The Atlanta Braves and The Houston Comets, been honored with a Signature guitar slide modeled and named after her by Rocky Mountain Slides, was the keynote speaker at a SoCal high school graduation, has been the rhythm guitarist and mandolin player for Kristian Bush (Sugarland), a satellite member of the Indigo Girls, is endorsed by Supro USA Guitars and amps Reunion Blues, and Breedlove guitars and mandolins. Michelle's latest recording, Slings and Arrows, was released March 2018 and debuted at #8 on the Billboard Blues charts.\n\nFor tour dates, info and booking or, please visit www.michellemalone.com/contact", "otherInfo": "Join me for a Facebook live stream concert! 7pm eastern standard time at Michelle Malone Music!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Carter Cruise ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7866692.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Bootymakingmusic", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "will DJ for pizza", "otherInfo": "Audiusfest is a 3-day online festival taking place Fri May 22 - Sun May 24, celebrating & rallying the Audius community.

With the official release of \"Three Day Weekend\", KTB's catchy songs have been turning heads with radio play on all the local radio stations and over 100,000 views of their youtube channel\n\n\"This band has never been busier and shows no signs of slowing down, and again whether it be helping out a worthwhile cause or heading out to the cottage, we know our abilities and put them to good use every chance we get.\"\n\n\u201cWe all have the sickness,\u201d chuckles Hails. \u201cPlaying music is the centre of our universe and the vibe that is created when the four or more of us get together and jam is addictive. People really pick up on the honesty of Killin\u2019 Time.\"\n\n\u201cI am not a rich man so instead of donating money I donate my time as often as I can,\u201dconfides Hails. \u201cWe aren\u2019t looking to be the next big thing we are just doing the only thing we know how to do.\"\n\nThey may not be looking to be the next big thing but with their infectious and entertaining live shows, a work ethic second to none and a charitable soul, The Killin' Time Band is a great band that loves what they do and it shows.\n\nThe Killin' Time Band is:\nBrad Hails - Vocals & Guitar\nJaret Koop - Vocals & Guitar\nBrian Bennie - Bass & Vocals\nPaul Dickinson - Drums\n\n\n*All quotes from were from an interview with Ric Taylor of View Magazine.", "otherInfo": "Every Saturday night at 7pm join me live from the basement for the Saturday Sermon!

The reflective piano ballad \u201cFriend\u201d opens the album with Witt sifting through feelings of attraction for someone she knows should be just a pal and not a lover, while the aching vocal showcase \u201cConsolation Prize\u201d pairs torchy piano with taut electric guitar accents as Witt muses over the ways in which we edit our pasts to fit the present. Revisionary history, indeed \u2014 the album title comes from a lyric in that song.\n\n\u201cWe can constantly be revising how we remember things, and maybe that\u2019s not so bad,\u201d says Witt, whose TV credits include The Sopranos, Friday Night Lights and Law & Order: Criminal Intent. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s how we move on.\u201d\n\nProduced by Ben Folds, Revisionary History was years in the making. Some of the songs date back to the mid-\u201900s, which gave her plenty of time to hone them in concert before heading to Folds\u2019 studio in Nashville, where she recorded the album in two week-long chunks in the spring and late fall of 2013.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got such a unique and specific vision for how those songs should best be presented,\u201d Witt says of Folds. \u201cI had no doubt that he was going to bring to it his own vision for the sound of each song, but he also wanted it to be a truthful reflection of what I do. The record sounds very much like me.\u201d\n\nWitt credits Folds for digging into the essence of each song for musical arrangements that sometimes brought out their hidden sides: the folky stomp on \u201cBlind,\u201d for example, highlighted the rootsy touches in a song Witt had been performing for years, while the mournful trumpet and marching drumbeat perfectly captured the mood on \u201cDown,\u201d a tune inspired by the smart but troubled character Witt played on Season Five of the Emmy-nominated FX series Justified, featuring the Emmy-nominated New York rapper and actor T.O.N.E-z\n\n\u201cWhen I heard it all put together, it made me cry,\u201d Witt says. \u201cAt the end, when the trumpet comes in, it sounds like a soul making its way up.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the girl-power anthem \u201cAbout Me,\u201d which shows the influence of Folds and Billy Joel in the robust piano and Witt\u2019s defiant determined vocals; or the lush, sultry \u201960s-style pop tune \u201cTheme From Pasadena,\u201d which Witt wrote with Folds for the movie Cold Turkey (Witt starred opposite Peter Bogdanovich and Cheryl Hines in the indie drama, which was originally to be called Pasadena). In fact, Revisionary History boasts such an array of sounds and styles that there\u2019s no pigeonholing Witt as a musician.\n\n\u201cI love all different types of music, so the songs that I come up with and am drawn to when I\u2019m writing are naturally all over the place,\u201d says Witt, whose movie credits include 88 Minutes with Al Pacino and Two Weeks Notice with Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.\n\nWitt has been a music lover since she was a little girl growing up in Worcester, Mass. She began playing piano when she was 7, competing in international piano competitions into her teen years. After she moved to Los Angeles at 14, she supported herself by playing in the lobby lounge of the Beverly Wilshire hotel until she landed her first regular acting job on the CBS show Cybil when she was 16. It took a few more years before she began consistently writing her own songs, and it wasn\u2019t until 2008 that she started performing them. Her first gig was opening for Jimmy Webb at a benefit in New York. Moving from standards and show tunes to original songs was a big leap for Witt.\n\n\u201cThere was a considerable fear factor,\u201d she says. \u201cAs an actor doing theater and doing live television, it wasn\u2019t about performing for people. It was about performing my own music. That\u2019s incredibly vulnerable.\u201d\n\nWitt\u2019s fears that audiences wouldn\u2019t respond proved very much unfounded, and the vulnerability of opening up to strangers helped her make the all-important connection that turned them into fans. 'The most that I can hope for is telling these stories that are incredibly personal, but saying them in a way that somebody else can relate to their own experiences,\" says Witt.\n\nbio:\n\nAlicia Witt has had a 3-decade long career, starting with her acting debut in David Lynch\u2019s classic \u2018Dune\u2019.\n\nWitt was most recently seen on Season 4 of the Emmy-award winning Showtime series \u2018House of Lies\u2019 opposite Don Cheadle. This past season, Alicia also appeared on the new DirecTv series \u2018The Kingdom\u2019, on the hit CBS show \u2018Elementary\u2019, and in 2015 in the new TNT series \u2018The Librarians\u2019, a role which she will be reprising on Season 2.\n\nIn 2014, Alicia joined the 5th Season of Emmy-award winning FX series \u2018Justified\u2019 with Timothy Olyphant. Alicia played Wendy Crowe, the smart and sexy paralegal sister of crime lord Darryl Crowe (Michael Rapaport) who takes matters into her own hands to bring him to justice in the Season 5 finale. Last summer she appeared at the Geffen Playhouse in the Los Angeles debut of Tony-nominated Neil Labute play \u2018reasons to be pretty\u2019. The four-hander also starred Amber Tamblyn, Shawn Hatosy and Nick Gehlfuss, and was directed by Randall Arney, Artistic Director of the Geffen.\n\nTo viewers of the Hallmark Channel, Alicia may be best known for her Christmas films \u2018Christmas at Cartwright\u2019s\u2019 (2014) and \u2018A Very Merry Mix-Up\u2019 (2013), which have become their highest rated of all time.\n\nIn 2013, Alicia appeared opposite Peter Bogdanovich and Cheryl Hines in the independent family dramedy 'Cold Turkey', in a performance which NY Daily News critic David Edelstein hailed as one of the best of 2013, and garnered the headline \u2018See Cold Turkey For Alicia Witt\u2019s Performance\u2019 in the Village Voice. Also released in 2013 was the film 'I Do', which had a nationwide theatrical release after screening at 25 festivals worldwide and winning 10 awards. Alicia has two songs featured in this film as well.\n\nAlicia is an accomplished singer/songwriter. A classically trained pianist, for the past 7 years she has been performing her original piano-driven rock all across the world, and has opened for Ben Folds Five, Jimmy Webb and John Fullbright. Her newest album, \u2018Revisionary History\u2019, is produced by Ben Folds and released through Compass Records on May 5, 2015. Her self-titled first EP came out in 2009 and her Kickstarter funded album, 'Live at Rockwood' was released following a self-booked national tour in 2012. Her music can be found at www.aliciawittmusic.com.\n\nOther recent credits include the 2012 Samuel Goldwyn film 'Cowgirls n Angels', with James Cromwell, and Seasons 4 and 5 of the Emmy award winning Friday Night Lights on NBC. Alicia starred opposite Al Pacino in the 2008 feature film '88 Minutes' for director Jon Avnet. That same year she played Detective Nola Falacci opposite Chris Noth on NBC\u2019s 'Law & Order: Criminal Intent' for half a season, taking over for Julianne Nicholson while she was on maternity leave.\n\nOther roles include Paramount\u2019s 'Last Holiday' with Queen Latifah and Timothy Hutton, and New Line\u2019s critically acclaimed film \u2018The Upside of Anger\u2019, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, opposite Joan Allen & Kevin Costner. She also starred in Warner Bros\u2019 hit romantic comedy, 'Two Weeks Notice', opposite Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.\n\nWitt appeared on-stage in fall 2006 at London\u2019s Royal Court Theatre in Terry Johnson\u2019s 'Piano/Forte'. She made her West End debut with Neil LaBute\u2019s 'The Shape of Things'. She was also seen on stage in 'Dissonance' at the Williamstown Theatre Festival. In April 2015, Alicia took the stage at the Gramercy Theatre for the 24 Hour Musicals off Broadway, for the 4th time.\n\nIn 1994, Witt appeared in the critically acclaimed 'Fun', which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival. The film, directed by Rafal Zielinski, depicts a tale of two disturbed young girls whose quest for fun leads them to murder. Witt received the \u201cSpecial Jury Recognition\u201d Award at Sundance and a nomination for an Independent Spirit Award. In 1998, she starred in Columbia Tristar\u2019s hit horror movie, 'Urban Legend.\n\nOn television, Witt starred for four seasons as Cybill Shepherd\u2019s daughter Zoey on the hit CBS sitcom \u2018Cybill\u2019. She also guest starred on the phenomenally successful HBO series, \u2018The Sopranos\u2019, and the Emmy award winning \u2018Ally McBeal\u2019, in which she sang with Randy Newman. Witt combined her acting talents with her skills as a pianist in the romantic comedy, 'Playing Mona Lisa'.\n\nAlicia made her directorial debut with the short film 'Belinda\u2019s Swan Song', which she also wrote. The film premiered at the 2006 Rhode Island International Film Festival and was screened at 9 additional festivals around the world, including the Los Angeles International Short Film Festival.\n\nShe also appeared in 'Mr. Holland\u2019s Opus', opposite Richard Dreyfuss, as clarinet player Gertrude, as well as 'Four Rooms' (Miramax) with Tim Roth, Madonna, and Lili Taylor, and directed by Quentin Tarantino, Allison Anders, Robert Rodriguez, and Alexandre Rockwell.

Also known for their phenomenal live show, the Nashville-based duo are now gearing up to make their Rounder debut with a sophomore album showcasing their boundless energy and tremendous generosity as songwriters and performers.\n\nDespite the deep sense of communion that infuses their music, Michael and Tanya hail from wildly different backgrounds. Originally from just outside Washington, D.C., Tanya discovered her supreme vocal skills at a young age and promptly pursued a career in music and acting. Meanwhile, Michael grew up in Cleveland and D.C., spending part of his childhood in homeless shelters and later enlisting in the U.S. Army. While stationed in one of Saddam Hussein\u2019s palaces several years after 9/11, he gained access to a piano and quickly captivated his fellow troops with his powerful vocal presence. Soon tasked with writing and performing songs in memoriam to his unit\u2019s fallen soldiers, Michael cultivated a distinct songwriting voice that he further developed upon returning home. After he and Tanya shared the stage at a music festival, the two began creating music together, eventually marrying and forming The War And Treaty. Their EP Down to the River arrived in July 2017, and the duo made their full-length debut with Healing Tide\u2014a widely acclaimed effort. The Associated Press called them, \u201c\u2026a powerhouse R&B duo who sound as though they were born to sing together,\u201d while Billboard went on to claim that, \u201cThe music world\u2026has definitely shown that it\u2019s ready to love The War and Treaty.\u201d\n\nThe War And Treaty have shared two new tracks from their forthcoming album that bring even more depth and dimension to their music.

Tapping into the kinetic energy they first revealed in playing backyard shows all around the Inland Empire, the Ontario, California-based band blends punk and surf-rock into a finespun sound that\u2019s viscerally charged yet gracefully melodic. And in their lyrics, Ariel View share stories of drinking too much and missing the wrong people and dreaming of running thousands of miles away, with sisters Harmonie and Heaven delivering each of their lines with both raw sensitivity and defiant self-assurance.\n\nRecorded at Route 2 Recording Studios in L.A. and produced by Joe Reinhart (Hop Along, Remo Drive), Until My Lungs Are Cleared takes its title from a song that Harmonie wrote when she was 14-years-old. With its gauzy guitar tones and languid rhythms, the track unfolds in a delicate reverie that hints at Ariel View\u2019s psych-rock-inspired sensibilities\u2014a dream state that\u2019s disrupted by the palpable pain of Harmonie\u2019s lyrics (e.g., \u201cI'll forget you one day so I could finally sing all these songs/That remind me of you\u201d). And while Harmonie describes \u201cUntil My Lungs Are Cleared\u201d as \u201ca song about being a bad kid, and going out with friends and partying and just wandering around,\u201d Nadine notes its intense emotional impact. \u201cIt\u2019s this horribly sad breakup song about how you can\u2019t live without this person, and you\u2019re just waiting until the day when you\u2019re okay enough to sing the song you used to sing together,\u201d she says.\n\nOn \u201cFriday Nights\u201d veers into a much grittier mood, taking on a breakneck momentum as Harmonie reflects on the ending of a two-year relationship. \u201cI watched that whole relationship and saw how toxic it was\u2014it made me so sad to see my sister go through that,\u201d says Heaven. \u201cWhen I heard the lyrics to \u2018Friday Nights,\u2019 I knew what every line meant. It hits so hard because it comes from a very real place.\u201d\n\nOne song later, on \u201cSummertime,\u201d Until My Lungs Are Cleared offers up an anthem built on bouncy beats, airy harmonies, and self-possessed lyrics (\u201cMe and my friends will make it every night\u201d). But with Harmonie pointing out that \u201cmost of these songs are breakup songs,\u201d the album assumes a feverish urgency on \u201cMidnight\u201d\u2014a track that first appeared as a stripped-back acoustic number on Ariel View\u2019s 2015 self-titled debut, then emerged as a lo-fi demo on 2017\u2019s Leo. \u201c\u2018Midnight\u2019 is interesting to look at, because it\u2019s gone through so many stages,\u201d says Nadine. \u201cOn the first version, Harm is way younger and she\u2019s got this little-kid voice, and now with the new version you can really see the growth of the band, and what Ariel View is today.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2014, Ariel View began as a two-piece featuring Harmonie and a former member who left the duo soon after they\u2019d released their debut. \u201cWhen that happened my dad told me I should have Heaven join,\u201d Harmonie recalls. \u201cShe was only 12-years-old at the time and I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t want this kid in my band\u2019\u2014but then she started playing with us, and it was actually really good.\u201d (Both lifelong musicians, the Martinez sisters have played in a number of cover bands with their father\u2014including a Smiths cover band and a Beatles cover band\u2014with Miranda and Nadine sometimes also joining those groups onstage.)\n\nAs they began playing more shows\u2014and shaping a sonic identity largely inspired by alt-rock bands like The Strokes and The Growlers\u2014Ariel View cycled through many guitarists and drummers, eventually bringing Nadine into the fold. \u201cOne of their former drummers is a coworker of mine,\u201d says Nadine, who works at Sam Ash Music. \u201cThe band did a photo shoot and I thought they looked cool, so I got on Instagram and DM-ed them like, \u2018Hey, can I be in your band?\u2019\u201d Within a week of hearing back, Nadine learned all of Ariel View\u2019s songs and met with them for a jam session, then immediately joined as their drummer. Not long after that, they found their lead guitarist in Miranda, who played in a local band called MoonFuzz. After admiring her guitar skills for months on end, Heaven received an Instagram message from Miranda, asking if she wanted to get together and play. After a few jam sessions, Heaven asked Miranda to join the band. With their lineup solidified at last, Ariel View landed their deal with Epitaph soon after the release of Leo, and set to work on Until My Lungs Are Cleared at the start of 2018.\n\nOver the years, Ariel View have gone from playing backyard parties to taking the stage at festivals like Top Acid Fest\u2014where, at the 2018 festival, the band dealt with a bomb scare during their set. \u201cThere were a lot of skinhead punks that year, and somebody brought a fake grenade,\u201d says Nadine. \u201cThe SWAT team showed up and there were helicopters everywhere, and Harm and I just looked at each other like, \u2018Fuck it, let\u2019s just play through it\u2014if we die, we die.\u2019 But we didn\u2019t die, and it was great.\u201d\n\nAs a queer-identified band, Ariel View are passionate about supporting and empowering the LGBTQ community, and creating an inclusive space at all of their shows\u2014a spirit of solidarity that deeply informed the songwriting on Until My Lungs Are Cleared. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of people come up to us and tell us how our songs have helped them feel more comfortable with being themselves, which is a really great feeling,\u201d says Harmonie. \u201cI know that I personally go to music to feel like someone else understands what I\u2019m feeling, and that it definitely relieves my anxiety. So if our music can make other people feel better and a little less alone, that would be the best reward.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kris Delmhorst ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6079986.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "KD plays guitars and sings, and is occasionally joined by various dashing and talented individuals.", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Kris Delmhorst is an American singer-songwriter who is part of the Boston folk scene.

This seeker of the life-changing novel and the perfect pair of beat-to-hell boots; this connoisseur of the cool classic movie and the greasiest dive-bar cheeseburger, disciple of the museum\u2019s masterpiece and the panhandler\u2019s wiliest street-pitch? This guy who lives it, loves it, takes it all in and pours out something so tight and right you just gotta hear it again and again? Well, let\u2019s just tell it straight: Rick Brantley is a singer-songwriter who can seriously, seriously write and sing; a rocker who can really, truly rock. A young man worth listening to. Rick Brantley was born and raised in the musical mecca of Macon, Georgia, a preacher\u2019s son, soaking up the strains of gospel music, fire-and-brimstone sermons and the echoes of musical legends: Blind Willie McTell, Otis Redding, The Allman Brothers. \u201cMy Dad dug the local heroes, and was big on pop/rock hitmakers of the 70\u2019s, too, like Three Dog Night. We had a little home recording studio; music was such a part of everything\u201d, Rick says. He was also inspired by singer-songwriters like Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel. \u201cYou learn from those guys and they lead you to Kristofferson, Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt,\u201d he adds. Brantley learned his lessons well: barely out of high school, his own songs and red-hot band performances led to a publishing contract and new home base in Nashville. Since then, his songs have been covered by artists ranging from Meat Loaf to country crooner David Nail, while he\u2019s continued honing his stage chops as both full-tilt rock-show frontman and acoustic solo performer, opening for acts as diverse as John Hiatt, Zac Brown Band, Better Than Ezra, and Steve Earle. It\u2019s the rock side that takes the wheel for Brantley\u2019s newest EP, Hi-Fi. The six-track musical meal leans into the wind, pairing his rock howl with hope and harmonica. Beginning with \u201cFine So Fine,\u201d Hi-Fi emits a warm optimistic glow \u2013 maybe, together, we\u2019ll all be okay. It\u2019s a sentiment that\u2019s echoed throughout the record: \u201cLittle Bit More\u201d is a love call to arms, while \u201cHoles\u201d sheds sunshine on imperfections. There\u2019s something vaguely familiar about Hi-Fi, a warm orange gospel that evokes bench seats and warm steering wheels and settles snugly between nostalgia for the glory days and joy at the potential of tomorrow. Then there\u2019s \u201cHurt People.\u201d The song, which leads the EP as a single, digs deep into the gritty, sometimes uncomfortable place born of knowing someone well. It\u2019s a testament to Brantley\u2019s ever-present need to understand the world around him: he\u2019s an acute listener, and he\u2019ll tell you that getting to know people at the merch table is his favorite part of every show. In \u201cHurt People,\u201d that richness comes to life, honed in the stark depth of forgiveness by way of understanding. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone that, like [Hi-Fi producer and co-writer Mark Selby], is such a method actor,\u201d says Tia Sillers, the award-winning songwriter who co-wrote five of the six songs on Hi-Fi. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to write a song about a person, we have to go back to birth. We have to know this person\u2019s second aunt, we have to know what happened to them in fourth grade, and we have to deliberate these things.\u201d \u201cOf course all of that can\u2019t be in the song, because it\u2019s a short form\u201d Selby adds, \u201cbut the back story of these people are all there in their minds, they\u2019ve been worked out.\u201d Listening to Hi-Fi, you may just feel like a bit of your story was woven in too. So back to our original question: what to make of this talented Rick Brantley? If enough of us hear him, see him, watch him own another stage. . . well, we might just make him a household name.

The band also earned itself a rabid following, with fans especially enamored of Lynn\u2019s feisty vocals and brutally personal lyrics about challenging relationships with lovers and family members as well as her relationship with herself. \u201cPeople really treasure that album,\u201d Baker says. \u201cWe got tons of letters from people saying it saved their life. They\u2019re people who are conflicted and searching and they connect with Patty\u2019s lyrics more than anything.\u201d\n\nWhen it came time for The Wind and The Wave to make their second album, Baker says he and Lynn felt \u201csome bit of an obligation to deliver that again.\u201d The band definitely delivered on their sophomore album, Happiness Is Not A Place, and the result is the sound of a band that has stretched itself and grown. Lynn managed to dig a little deeper with her lyrics, exploring her difficult feelings on commitment, and family, while acknowledging her own frantic mind. And the band\u2019s sonic palette is nervier, thanks to the album being recorded live by producer Butch Walker. \u201cTo me, it sounds reckless with a rock and roll spirit and attitude, an \u2018I don\u2019t give a fuckedness,\u2019 if you will. I wanted it to make sense to our fans, but to feel like a step forward musically. And I think we accomplished that. It\u2019s really rough around the edges, and there\u2019s a lot of urgency and pent-up stuff that probably came from both Patty and my nervousness about making a record with an outside producer.\u201d\n\nAfter being dropped by two major labels, all expectations and second guesses went flying out the window. The band\u2019s third full length album, Human Beings Let You Down, was a record made in hotels and backstage dressing rooms across the US. \u201cGetting married was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d says Lynn, \u201cBut it also brought out a lot, good and bad, and therapy helped me work through it. That\u2019s what the song Neon Prayer Flags is all about.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotta tough to be Patty, or anyone in her life, because if something\u2019s amiss, she\u2019s going to write about it. And you\u2019re going to know it\u2019s about you, and you\u2019re going to feel weird about it,\u201d Baker says with a chuckle. \u201cEveryone\u2019s in the line of fire. Patty and I are two people who, while we strive to be joyful and positive, can be very much morose and negative, and that definitely comes out in the songs.\u201d\n\nThe band is currently working on their fourth album, and will embark on a series of acoustic mini tours in 2020, called The Feelings Club.", "otherInfo": "Hey friends and fam!

I loved Sergio Mendes\u2019 songs, liked John Hartford on the Glenn Campbell Show and really got into James Taylor and Joni Mitchell who I still consider my two main influences. I also loved the singer-songwriters of the time including Carole King and Laura Nyro and later fell in love with Steely Dan\u2019s music, and just wore out my copy of Hubert Laws\u2019 Rite Of Spring. I was completely self-taught, by llistening to records and playing them over and over, teaching myself tablature from a great James Taylor book and modal tunings from Joni Mitchell\u2019s For The Roses song book. I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit. Other long term members include drummer Ray Levier and keyboardist Peter Vitalone, both of whom have been with KJ since\u201998 and \u201899. I am always interested in stretching myself and performing my music in different ways. The Lucky 7 recordings feature some wonderful pairings of great players that I don\u2019t always get to tour with but who have appeared in with me at The 55 and are wonderful friends too.\nKJ manages between 120-140 performances a year. New music, places to play and new festivals are what she\u2019s about these days \u201c\u2026 so we can keep on performing for new audiences.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school.

The critically acclaimed debut Love & Hope & Sex & Dreams was released in 1986. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the band had several singles in the top 40 \"mainstream rock\" charts. In the mid-1990s, the band had two top 10 songs in the \"Adult contemporary\" charts. The BoDeans took some time off in the late 1990s so Neumann and Llanas could record solo albums. Llanas founded Absinthe, with the help of Milwaukee musicians Jim Eannelli (guitars and bass) and Guy Hoffman (formerly of Oil Tasters and Violent Femmes).

Since the 1970s, Lovano has been one of the world's premiere tenor saxophone players, earning a Grammy award and several nods on Down Beat magazine's critics' and readers' polls.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Ohio, Lovano was exposed throughout his early life to jazz by his father, Tony \"Big T\" Lovano. John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, and Sonny Stitt were among his earlier influences. He developed further at Berklee College of Music, and then served a big band apprenticeship with Woody Herman's Thundering Herd and the Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra.\n\n\"Big T\" Lovano, a fine Cleveland tenorman, was his first inspiration. He taught Joe all the standards, how to lead a gig, how to pace a set, and to be versatile enough to always find work. Joe started on alto at age six and switched to tenor five years later. He attended Berklee before working with Jack McDuff and Dr. Lonnie Smith. After three years with Woody Herman's Orchestra, Lovano moved to New York and began playing regularly with Mel Lewis\u2019 Big Band. This influence is still present in his solos. He often plays lines that convey the rhythmic drive and punch of an entire horn section.\n\nOne of the top saxophonists of the 1990s, Joe Lovano continues to grow and explore as a musician. He has a husky tenor tone based in the tradition, but an approach to improvisation that is modern and daring.

Folks from the no new jails organization later formed a community bail fund, focusing on fighting the racial disparities in the Dane county jail system, a jail system with one of the worst racial disparities in the country.

A conformed church housed a bar in the front full of rogue townies, and a lounge in the back.\n\"Turn your phones off,\" the host of the lounge barked into the microphone. \"Turn them off, sit back, and pay attention. This guy is quiet, and he's going to tell you some stories.\"\nAnd my eyebrows raised when his hoarse voice breathed life into a quiet, rapt crowd. With his eyes closed, he sang songs - chunks of him offered up to a willing mass.\n\"I'm not a singer,\" he said eventually, looking down at his guitar. I leaned in to listen harder. \"I'm not a guitarist. I'm a song writer.\"\nIn his songs were stories and in his stories were words pushed together that took my breath away, and in his stories were words that oozed the Blood from the Before, and in his stories were ripped edges.\nI wanted to know it all. I wanted to know the names of the chunks and I wanted to inspect the hole in his chest and I wanted to know where those melodies come from and I wanted to know how he chooses the words.\nI wanted to know what he has written on the scraps of paper in his wallet and I wanted to know if his handwriting changes when he knows it's a good one.\nIt was a listening lounge, and we were supposed to be quiet and listen, but he played a song we all knew. And we sang the words with him. We couldn't help it - not one single person.\nA crooked grin formed behind the microphone and I'm fairly certain that's why he does what he does. Not for the lights. Not for the cheers. For sure not for the money.\nHe does it for the people that hear the story and say, \"Yes. Me, too. I have been there, too.\"\nIn a town out in the middle of the cornfields of Iowa, a group of people sang the words back to him that he had written. A melody chunked out of one disaster from his life, and sewn together with a rhyme, and\nmaybe that's how you heal the hurt.\n...\nVulnerability. Standing up on a stage when you'd rather be holding a pen.\nSure looks an awful lot like courage.\n\n\n- Rebecca Cooper, Author", "otherInfo": "It's Josh Morningstar's 37th Birthday!

It's the same kind of self-assurance the soft-spoken Rodgers displays on his second independently released EP, available January 19th. Produced by Mickey Jack Cones (Dustin Lynch, Joe Nichols) and Chris Farren, the five-song collection showcases him as both a talented writer and interpreter, merging the electrified rock he heard on the baseball diamond with the thoughtful lyricism of country. Well before he was singing for his supper, the Batesville, Mississippi native was an accomplished baseball player who was a scholarship athlete at Northwest Mississippi Community College. Raised in the midst of country's '90s commercial heyday \u2013 his first concert was Garth Brooks at the Pyramid in Memphis \u2013 Rodgers always had an inkling that he might end up living in Music City, he just didn't know how or when. \"I can remember in high school I would tell people \u2013 this was before I played guitar or anything \u2013 I would just be like, 'Yeah, I'm gonna move to Nashville one day,'\" he recalls. And so he did, departing Mississippi with one of his college buddies to see if he could make it in Music City. Through the countless open mic nights and lean years that inevitably followed, Rodgers was able to develop the songwriting voice that would eventually earn his first publishing deal with Combustion Music. \"I went into songwriting boot camp,\" he says. \"That's all I did. I hardly played any shows or anything. I just focused on writing.\" In the meantime, Rodgers scored his first cut on Florida Georgia Line's Dig Your Roots, with \"Wish You Were on It.\" He also released his self-titled EP, featuring the streaming hit \"Midnight Daydream.\" All that intense focus shows on his second self titled EP. Opening track \"Ain't Really Over\" depicts a man in the hangover stage of a rough breakup and trying to move on. Framed by surging, distorted electric guitars and Rodgers' bluesy howl, it sets the tone for his melody-rich, introspective style of songwriting. On \"Cold Case,\" Rodgers draws a line between himself and country's long tradition of clever wordplay. Bouncing off the title's suggestion of criminal investigations, he's popping tops and pining over a woman who's up and vanished from his life. His solution? Downing as many beers as he can handle. \"'Cold Case' was just one of those things \u2013 somebody started playing a guitar and one of us just spit it out,\" says Rodgers. \"It kind of fell out of thin air.\" Rodgers' clear sense of his artistic identity also shines through on the outside songs \"Like You've Been There Before\" and \"Some Girls.\" It's easy to envision Rodgers singing about a younger version of himself in \"Like You've Been There Before,\" a rebellious kid getting some sage advice from his father to play it cool whether he's knocking a fastball over the fences or cautiously taking his first trip around the bases with a young woman. He sings it with the easy confidence of a seasoned vet, or as he says in the chorus, \"like it ain't no thing.\" \"Some Girls,\" on the other hand, calls back to \"Ain't Really Over\" except this time he's ended things and she's not handling it well \u2013 talking behind his back and playing childish games on social media. \"Some girls make it easy on you,\" he sighs, \"and some girls never do.\" The female woes reach their apex in the Rodgers co-write \"Missing One,\" which flips the title phrase on its head. Initially it's a missing copy of the Eagles' Desperado that she took when she left, then a single smoke from a pack of cigarettes that she forced him to give up. But it turns out he's actually missing something else most of all. Rodgers wrote the tune with pals Smith Ahnquist and Hunter Phelps, taking months to get it right. \"We started it in January and we didn't finish it until May,\" he says. \"We knew it was gonna be a clever idea, but we had to get it right. It was a hard one, but a fun one.\" That dedication, coupled with Rodgers' finely-tuned ear for songs, makes him perfectly suited to lean forward into Nashville's ever-shifting winds while honoring his roots. \"I want to be known as the dude with good songs,\" he says. \"If a song gives you chill bumps or if it makes you cry or if it makes you happy, it's done its job.\" That may sound like a relatively humble mission for a performer with such promise, but hey, sometimes you just know.", "otherInfo": "Saturday Nights Live"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dirty Mae ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8751282.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Blues-rock, Indie Folk, Alt-country, Neo-vaudeville, Americana, Folk Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "OUR NEW ALBUM \"HOLY MAMA\" available everywhere music streams!\n\nA neo-vaudeville band born out of Harlem, New York, Dirty Mae is taking the Northeast by storm.

An acoustic re-imagining of the songs from the rock record, the tracks are presented in stark, stripped-down contrast to its predecessors.\n\n\u201cOnce Upon a Hell of a Time... is a Saturday night record,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThis version is for the hangover on Sunday.\u201d\n\nRe-contextualizing the songs offers a new window into the lyrics. What he once described as a \u201cparty-rock record for the brokenhearted\u201d transforms into a reflective and beautiful dive into false escapism, grief, love, and loss. \"The stripped-down record lends clarity and depth to his already nuanced lyrics, revealing a deep thinker who seeks honesty in his craft, and in life.\" - Beatroute\n\nThe recording came amidst a particularly busy time for Matt Mays. During a period when he headlined his first Massey Hall concert and supported sold out shows with The Gaslight Anthem all over North America, Matt teamed up with co-producer Eric Ratz to record at studios around Toronto between touring commitments.\n\nTwice Upon a Hell of a Time\u2026 was originally conceived as a straight-up solo interpretation, similar to the iTunes Session recorded with Ratz in 2011. As the songs took shape, however, Matt decided to incorporate extra vocals and instrumentation. Tapping musicians Aaron Goldstein (Daniel Romano, Lee Harvey Osmond) on pedal steel, Anthony Carone (Arkells) on piano, and guest singers Andrew Rodriguez, Kate Dyke, and Melissa Payne, the album\u2019s arrangements are lush and large without straying from the \u2018unplugged\u2019 vibe he sought from the outset.\n\nLead track \u201cOla Volo\u201d is inspired by a Vancouver-based mural artist of the same name who also created the original album art for both records. \u201cHer paintings and drawings all have a theme that I picked up on,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nature. To me, it\u2019s from another dimension, a very curious dimension that draws me in. Her pieces are very edgy and real-life at the same time. I had this feeling that I\u2019d like to be in one of her paintings, to live in that world that she\u2019s created.\u201d\n\nAfter departing seminal alt-country collective The Guthries back in 2002, Matt Mays alternated between solo projects (his self-titled debut, the unfinished film soundtrack \u2026When the Angels Make Contact) and band projects (the eponymous Matt Mays & El Torpedo record and 2008\u2019s Terminal Romance).

I hit the small rooms with a couple old guitars and a 5-watt Skylark amp. Sometimes with a band, and then I stand up. Mostly it\u2019s just me and my friend Billy Conway, the best drummer I ever heard. Then we both sit down and I stomp my foot. I own a Smith Corona typewriter and a Western Bell rotary phone, and I use both. I wore a pearl snap cowboy shirt in my Kindergarten school picture. Irony isn\u2019t my thing. I write songs about love, memory, God, desire, wilderness and loss.\n\nI grew up in Wisconsin. My Dad wore a tie to work and played a knock-off Gibson with a chunk of the headstock missing where he\u2019d backed over it with the car. Mom sang along. I knew all my Grandparents well into my thirties, and both my Great Grandmas. Winter Sundays were for church or ice-fishing, and summers we hauled an old travel trailer up to the north woods. School was a drag, and I mostly drew pictures. When I was 11 I bought a cassette copy of Little Richard\u2019s Greatest Hits. At 17 I learned to play all the songs on John Prine\u2019s 1971 debut in my room with the door locked and subway posters of British New Wave bands looking morbidly on. At 19 I stole a copy of Townes Van Zandt\u2019s \u2018Live & Obscure\u2019. At 24 I made a record and start traveling around the country. I have two older brothers. They don\u2019t sing but they both fish.\n\nI live out in New England now in a little town with a river through the middle. I can\u2019t get home without crossing good water and it fairly makes up for living east, which isn\u2019t in my blood. We have a chicken coop and a little barn and an old car that runs.

In her fourth straight year of touring Holder explored collaborations with Little Brave, Daniel Thomas Phipps and others while sharing her music with concertgoers across the country, gaining new followers from Wyoming to Massachusetts and everywhere in between. The tour also included a short stop in Brooklyn to film a video for her haunting soliloquy, Moon. The video, released in mid-October, tells the spine-chilling story of scorned lovers performing a backyard ritual to surprising results. After spending the year on the road, Holder decamped to a ranch in South Texas for a period of isolation and to write a fresh batch of songs for this year\u2019s newest offering, which is expected to release in the early Fall. And in case you missed her whirlwind tour don\u2019t fret, Holder will be back on stage in 2015 sharing her light and love with music fans everywhere. https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/from-my-veins-will-fall-ep/id1029216492", "otherInfo": "facebook.com/aliholdermusic\ninstagram: @aliholder"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Zach Brock ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10390483.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Acoustic, R&b, Pop, Appalachian, Progressive Jazz, Jazz, Electric Jazz, Funk, Rock, Classical, Crossover Jazz, Electro-acoustic", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Heralded as \u201cthe pre-eminent improvising violinist of his generation,\u201d Zach Brock is an violinist and composer whose music draws on the traditions of jazz, classical, world, and popular music.

The multi-faceted Renaissance man proves it on his upcoming new studio album, aptly titled A Whole Lot More To Me, a record that furthers Morgan's reputation as one of the genre's most commanding vocalists.\n\nWhile his singing on such hits as the multi-week Number One \"That\u2019s What I Love About Sunday,\" \"International Harvester,\" \"Bonfire,\" \"This Ole Boy\" and \"Wake Up Lovin' You\" was exemplary, Morgan has somehow found a new level and vocal range in the studio. On his forthcoming LP, his third with label home Black River Entertainment, he's making the most relevant, authentic and moving music of his career. It's a point that \"When I'm Gone\" drives home, as Morgan sings about living life with no regrets.\n\n\"I\u2019ve got a renewed energy with this record,\" he says emphatically. \"In fact, I'm at the pinnacle of my career \u2014 producing, singing and touring. And this song epitomizes that. It's about living to the fullest, and when people hear it, I know they'll relate it to their own lives.\"\n\nHis newest single, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home Soon,\u201d is an epic love song and one of many radio-ready hits on Morgan's highly anticipated project. He's written nearly half of the album's dozen tracks, and makes all of them his own. \"I'm That Country\" exudes Southern charm; \"Remind Me Why I'm Crazy\" showcases Morgan the crooner; \"I Can't Wait to Stay\" exults the joys of a small-town life; and \"A Whole Lot More to Me\" is a musical autobiography. The collection\u2019s \u201cWhen I\u2019m Gone,\u201d has already met critical acclaim with Music Row calling it a \u201cpowerhouse performance of a pile-driving song.\u201d Each highlights his artistic renaissance.\n\nMorgan laughs at that word, however: \"artistic.\"\n\n\"I have friends who are very artistic people, sometimes oddly so, and I never wanted to be that guy, to be so artistic that I'm odd,\" he says smiling. \"But it's good to know that I've evolved musically and, with this new record, I've created something with longevity.\"\n\nIndeed, Morgan's A Whole Lot More To Me, co-produced with Byron Gallimore (Tim McGraw, Sugarland, Faith Hill) and released via Black River Entertainment, is a timeless recording. As was their goal, Morgan and Gallimore, with whom he worked for the first time, succeeded in making music that will sound fresh a decade or more from now. These are songs that define a man.\n\nMorgan uses the honesty of the concert stage as an analogy for how he assembled what will be his seventh studio album. \"It would look funny if you went to one of my concerts and I stood out there in skinny jeans. I'm not 21 years old, and I shouldn't pretend to be,\" he says. \"But I also know this music will fit right in on country radio today. I'm singing music that is real and believable and at the same time relatable to all types of fans. That's hard to do, but you can do it if you stay true to who you are.\"\n\nAnd Craig Morgan knows exactly who he is, a man with many sides. Along with being an entertainer, he's an adventure junkie and hosts the popular Outdoor Channel series Craig Morgan: All Access Outdoors, entering its seventh season this summer. He's also a 17-year Army and Army Reserves veteran, a passionate champion of the military, a philanthropist and a celebrated motivational speaker.\n\nHe\u2019s a busy man with a knack for attention to detail. Carefully choosing each lyric on this album is no exception. There is not a single wasted verse \u2014 let alone word \u2014 on the follow-up to 2012's This Ole Boy. \"Every word is valid and relevant on this album,\" he says. \"It's a quality continuation of what I've done in the past.\"\n\nThe most obvious bridge to Morgan's back catalog is the spiritually minded \"Country Side of Heaven.\" The song is inspirational country at its finest, with a soaring chorus that at once elevates both listener and artist.\n\n\"It has a very charismatic, inspirational vibe about it \u2014 but not preachy,\" Morgan says. \"The energy feels spiritual by the time you get to the end and there is an emotional attachment within you that makes you want to hear it again and again.\"\n\nMorgan says the song, as well as album tracks like the emotionally charged \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home Soon\u201d and the empowered-woman tale \"All Cried Out,\" act as a through-line, a path for fans to connect the dots of his career: \"You develop a fan base and they get acquainted with a certain thing from you, and they want that. This album is full of those.\"\n\nAnother standout on the project is \u201cHearts I Leave Behind,\u201d which features Morgan\u2019s gritty and poignant vocals with the soulful Christian rock band Third Day\u2019s lead singer, Mac Powell.\n\nThe hard-touring artist has already been testing out the songs on the road, to stellar results. \"When I'm Gone\" becomes a call to action; \"Country Side of Heaven\" is an audience sing-along; and \"Nowhere Without You,\" written by Michael McDonald, stands as an epic power ballad.\n\n\"It's such an emotional song, one that I can see being played at weddings for a long time,\" he says. \"I feel something in my chest when I hear it. It moves me \u2014 and that's what music is supposed to do.\"\n\nEspecially in the hands of an artist as gifted as Morgan, who can effortlessly toggle between the breezy fun of radio staple \"Redneck Yacht Club\" and the poignancy of \"That's What I Love About Sunday.\" He mixes both approaches in the album's standout track, \"A Whole Lot More to Me.\" A smoldering, jazz-influenced love song with an everyman attitude, it shines a light on a different side of the artist, and country fans in general \u2014 one that likes a fine Cabernet as much as a cold beer, and indulges in sushi by candlelight as regularly as barbecue by the bonfire.\n\n\"As a country singer, we sometimes get stereotyped as nothing but trucks and tailgates, but that doesn't mean that's all there is to us,\" he says, summing up the album. \"I want people to hear this record and go, 'Wow, there is a whole lot more to these country folks.'\"\n\nAnd in Morgan, those folks have no better messenger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Diarrhea Planet ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6595253.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Rock, Diarrhea Planet, Punk", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Like watching School of Rock for the first time, every time.", "otherInfo": "Watch Diarrhea Planet's FINAL show - Shred Thee Well - Performed Live at Exit/In on 9/8/2018!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "KatMaz ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7081439.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Indie Rock, Indie Folk, Indie Pop, Indie Electronic", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Katmaz uses the visual sense to create emotional, thought provoking music that has a cinematic quality.

", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8374944.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Rock Jamband", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "In 2001, the solid, catchy song writing skill behind moe.'s crisp musical attack was rewarded with a four-star review in Rolling Stone for their album DITHER. The band responded with their next album not by resting on any laurels it may have earned, but by taking a new chance, pushing the limits of not just song writing, but song crafting. A desire to bridge the seemingly incompatible worlds of chaos and control led to 2003's WORMWOOD, an experiment in combining live tracks with studio manipulation. The risk paid off, earning four stars in Blender Magazine. Now, with the new release THE CONCH, moe. takes it yet further with the next logical step in exploring this unorthodox, albeit successful, approach.\n\n\"The idea was to take the elements of WORMWOOD that worked, both musically and technically, and exploit those ideas a little bit further and see if we couldn't do it under less chaotic, more controlled circumstances this time,\" says guitarist Al Schnier.\n\nThat quest for control within chaos permeates all aspects of creating THE CONCH \u2013 from the band's musical and interpersonal democratic process to the album's very name. \"The Conch comes from Lord of the Flies,\" says bassist Rob Derhak. \"The Conch is a symbol of keeping things civil. We sort of took all these elements of us playing as if one of us has a conch and then it's taken away and it turns to chaos. That is very similar to our lives. That song is a microcosm of the album and our lives.\"\n\nWithout moe.'s conscious effort to maintain control, the last fifteen months could easily have found a lesser band devolving into discord. The original recording sessions for THE CONCH took place during the spring of 2005; however, due to the band's rigorous touring schedule, the project continued at several different locations across the country.\n\n\"Some people do albums in a really short amount of time and it winds up sounding kind of homogeneous,\" says guitarist Chuck Garvey. \"This album was done over such a long period of time that there's evolution. The drums were all done at the same time, but a lot of the other work on the album was spread out so we kind of had different ears and a different attitude each time we worked on it.\"\n\nIt is this spirit that manifests on THE CONCH and gives the album a versatile cohesiveness.\n\n\"There's such a variety of music on it that I don't think one song will define the album,\" says Schnier. \"You take a song like 'Blue Jeans Pizza' and as great as it is and as great as the recording is, it doesn't define the rest of the album. It's the only song where these guys sing in falsetto for the entire song. One might be misled to think that all of the songs have Bee Gees-like vocals on them. Then you take a song like 'Tailspin' or 'Lost Along the Way' and it doesn't define something like 'Wind It Up'.\"\n\nThe ebb and flow of THE CONCH also includes highlights such as the gentle \"Where Does the Time Go?\", \"The Pit\" and \"Brittle End.\"\n\nEach song will, of course, continue to evolve onstage, to be joyfully dissected by fans in person or through live recordings. Those include releases on moe.'s popular \"Warts and All\" series, which, like studio albums, are available on the band's own Fatboy label.\n\n\"That's the greatest thing about owning the record label that you're on, that we're certainly the big fish in the pond now, and it's nice being in control,\" says Schnier, recalling the group's two major-label albums in the mid-'90s.\n\n\"This is the first time that we weren't constrained by time or money or any external circumstances. We finished each song to completion to our satisfaction and that's really the first time that we've done that,\" Schnier says.\n\n\"In hindsight, I feel like we were making a documentary of where we were in terms of our artistic output at that point. But it's not just a straight documentary. It's not just a news report, but it's like we really had the time to shoot the whole thing in black and white and really have it look beautiful,\" he says. \"It's like a really well-made documentary that you could watch again and again. The story is there, but it looks beautiful too. It's really well-shot and well edited and I kind of feel like that's what we've done with the songs here.\"\n\nThe first two weeks of recording took place at the State Theatre in Portland, ME, where the goal was to capture rhythm tracks in the natural reverb of the historic venue. Then a live audience was brought in for two sold-out shows, which included some mass crowd participation. If you listen closely, you can hear the results of these painstaking efforts on THE CONCH.\n\n\"We had a few things in mind where we actually wanted to engage the audience,\" Schnier says of the group's collective role in producing the album. \"There's one piece that really combines audience participation with the band's recordings and all the pieces just happened to fit together rather nicely. We were able to have the audience be a part of the album and that was something that was important to us.\"\n\nThat's a poignant observation, when you think about it. The audience has always been a major part of the live moe. experience. It was the fans' votes that determined the four Jammy Awards the band has won -- Best Live Album (L), Live Performance of the Year (Bonnaroo 2002), Best Studio Album (WORMWOOD) and Live Performance of the Year (Tsunami Relief Concert 2005). So it seems only fitting that it would be moe. who would pioneer ways to make the fans feel like an active part of the band, not just part of a scene.\n\n\"We have a very dedicated fanbase that's in it for the long haul, that's in it for the music. We've never had much of a traveling circus. Somehow our tours have a much different feel.\"\nThat's lucky for moe., because the band certainly has the kind of musical and conceptual imagination -\u2013 and deep catalog of songs \u2013- that lets fans bask in the glow of multiple shows, including a share of special events.\n\nThe quintet has drawn upwards of 6,000 fans to two-night stands at such storied venues as New York's Beacon Theatre, Chicago's Aragon Ballroom and Denver's Fillmore. The group has headlined Colorado's legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Atlanta's Fox Theatre and at the 2006 Bonnaroo festival in Tennessee, moe. performed on the main-stage before a crowd of nearly 80,000. This year will culminate in grand fashion with an evening of moe. at New York's prestigious Radio City Music Hall.\n\nYet moe. also transcends the four-walled experience of even the most historic of sites. The first week in January, the group and its fans will head to the Caribbean for a week of shows aboard the Norwegian Jewel cruise ship. And each Labor Day weekend for the past five years the group has also presented its own moe.down festival, inviting such kindred spirits as Flaming Lips, Medeski Martin & Wood, Matisyahu, Ani DiFranco, David Grisman, Violent Femmes and They Might be Giants to supplement heaping helpings of moe. In contrast to Bonnaroo, Schnier says, \"The idea is kind of like a moe. family picnic.\"\n\nThat family vibe begins with the five men that make up moe. \"We're brothers,\" Derhak says. \"We love each other dearly and hate each other fiercely, and we can't live without each other.\"\n\nThe music as it now exists couldn't live without any one of them either. While originally a dueling guitar-driven quartet, moe.'s sound has become significantly more textured over the years, with several shifts in influences and personnel. Original drummer Jim Loughlin returned in 1999 as a multi-instrumentalist and percussionist alongside fifth and current drummer Vinnie Amico, a subtly strong beat-keeper with minimalist flair. Loughlin provides breadth as well as drive, especially when playing electronic vibes to a Zappa-esque effect. \"A lot of the percussion stuff becomes this immense steamroller,\" Garvey says. \"They mix a lot of different styles in a very easy way.\"\n\nGarvey, meanwhile, provides a range of even-keeled riffing to blistering solos, matched by Schnier's range of twang to, well, blistering solos. In recent years, Schnier has added an array of keyboards to his set-up, as well.\n\nAnd finally, at center stage, bassist Rob Derhak weaves fluid, funky lines that provide the bottom-end glue, sealing the chemistry between the longtime bandmates.\n\nThe group's signature extends to vocals as well as instrumentation. Derhak, Schnier and Garvey trade lead vocals with contrasting styles -- and a balanced quality. \"Certainly singing in key is a good place to start,\" says Schnier, \"but it's also being creative with your harmonies and vocal parts.\"\n\nIt's no wonder that the quintet constructs broad, cohesive studio CDs that stack up song by song. \"The songwriting has been a focus for us for years and years now,\" he says. \"Early on, we fell into the trap of writing a song that was merely a platform for a jam, and there's no longevity in that.\" Derhak, Garvey and Schnier split the writing, but the group contributes to the finished product. \"Even if I write a song from beginning to end at home and bring it in,\" Schnier says, \"there's still a collaborative effort involved in getting that song up and running.\"\n\n\u201cA true definition of a band,\u201d Derhak says, \"is everyone contributing all they can \u2014 no matter what it is \u2014 to every song.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.livexlive.com/live-events/festival/lfot-summer-camp-weekend-pass"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mikaela Davis ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9062580.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Rock & Roll Is Here To Stay", "Time": "12:40 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cThis record is kind of about writing a record,\u201d Mikaela Davis says. The 26-year-old is home in her native Rochester, New York, reflecting on Delivery, her highly anticipated full-length album, as well as the hard journey the classically trained, defiantly original harpist had to travel to become the writer AND performer, she was meant to be.\n\n\u201cA lot of these songs came from feeling stuck and also like people were pulling me in a bunch of different directions,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cI wanted to say, \u2018Just wait for me. I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\nMikaela\u2019s plea for patience\u2013\u2013a little bit sweet, a little bit angry and raw\u2013\u2013fed a fierce 10-song collection. A joyride that pulls from rock, 70s and 80s pop, and funk, Delivery manages to be both daring and comfortable, full of not just risks, but hooks.\n\nProduced by Grammy winner John Congleton (St. Vincent, Angel Olsen, David Byrne, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah), Delivery is a triumphant next chapter. \u201cJohn tries to find that moment instead of the perfect take,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cThat made it all sound really special.\u201d Childhood friend Alex Cot\u00e9 (drums, percussion) and Shane McCarthy (bass) play on the record - already close from years of touring. Recently, Mikaela\u2019s ensemble became a family affair with the addition of Shane\u2019s older brother Cian McCarthy on guitar.\n\nMikaela\u2019s unconventional path to working songwriter began before high school, growing up in Rochester. With plans to join a symphony, she studied harp performance at Crane School of Music, but halfway through, she decided the traditional harpist\u2019s path wasn\u2019t for her. Following graduation, Mikaela moved to Brooklyn, following in the footsteps of artists who\u2019ve come before her. But in the city, she could never quite find her footing. She kept busy, toured, and recorded an album that would eventually be shelved. Feeling confused and alone, she retreated back to Rochester, unsure of her next move.\n\nThen, the last place Mikaela wanted to be saved her. Rochester\u2019s artistic community embraced her, encouraged by bandmates including Alex Cot\u00e9 and the group Joywave, she hit her stride. Rochester became Mikaela\u2019s sanctuary.\n\nDelivery benefits from it all. \u201cNow, these songs kind of wonder what I should be doing\u2013\u2013it\u2019s me trying to get myself back to why I started writing in the first place,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cWriting made me feel better and safe when the world around me was falling apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust let my songs resonate with you somehow. That would make me so happy.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Barnyard Stompers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9183255.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Americana, Outlaw Country, Dirty Blues, Country, Southern Rock, Blues, Folk, Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hard working, traveling outlaw circus!

Hook, line, and sinker. Landon and Dan had no choice but to spend the rest of their pre-pubescent years crouched on the basement steps, not wearing earplugs. It didn\u2019t matter if the music was good or bad or too loud to tell. J. Mascis and D. Boon and Paul Westerberg were alive in that basement, cranked through budget amplifiers and out of tune.\n\nFast forward three decades and Landon and Dan are still making music together. Little Brazil is their most accomplished and longest running project - fifteen years. Over that time the band has built an impressive resume. They\u2019ve released four full lengths and done the national tours, both headlining and as support.\n\nThose credentials don\u2019t matter now though. What\u2019s important is the new record, Send the Wolves. It is the product of thirty years spent on basement steps, idolizing guitars; a reflection of what life is like when the initial thrill never goes away. When it\u2019s carried through adulthood. Through having children and marriage and bartending into bartending into bartending. That persistence of spirit lends a sincerity to Send the Wolves. It captures the feeling of going paycheck to paycheck, scrounging tips for the early tours, leaving with nothing and coming back with less. Those tours when the van breaks down on the side of the highway but it doesn\u2019t matter because you\u2019re out there doing it. Send the Wolves captures the triumphs, too. The packed shows. The reviews, features, interviews. The things that prove you\u2019re playing to something other than corn and soy and prairie. Throughout all the ups and downs, Landon and Dan have remained the same wide-eyed kids on the basement steps, just wishing they were big enough to pick up the instruments.\n\nSend the Wolves has been nine years in the making, with several members coming and going. The result is cohesive yet nuanced. There is a singular sound that is unique to Little Brazil, but Omaha\u2019s fingerprints are all over the album, with a handful of the city\u2019s finest adding guest contributions to the final cut. Those who helped shape Little Brazil over the years come from different musical backgrounds, age, and experience but they all have one thing in common: at a certain point when they were too young to know any better, they all fell in love with loud guitars in shitty basements. If you at all know the experience, Send the Wolves will punch you in the gut. And it\u2019s not a sucker punch. It\u2019s a good sincere uppercut, straight from the basement. I hope that spirit never dies.", "otherInfo": "Noah's Ark Was A Spaceship and Little Brazil will stream live sets from the Main Room at Slowdown on May 23."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nicki Sbaffoni Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8549363.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Pop, Folk Rock, Cover Band, Acoustic", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With a mantra of \"strum and wail\u201d, Nicki Sbaffoni consistently surprises and delights audiences with powerful and creatively twisted versions of all your favorite songs.

However, it wasn\u2019t until she picked up a guitar at age 12 that she discovered her true calling and began pouring out original songs. Drawing inspiration from her upbringing, current issues, and environmental concerns, she started to shape her signature sound and identity as an artist.\n\nSince, Madison has released a 5-song EP entitled \"Who Knows Where\" and has built a reputation as a road warrior, touring relentlessly as a solo performer, duo, or with her band, The Mud Guppies.

During this time, he has also managed to release 4 artist albums and some of the most iconic house music tracks of the last two decades.\n\nMost people know Claude VonStroke for his smiling DJ persona touring every major city, festival, and basement after-party around the world. But Claude has also influenced the very fabric of the dance community, A&Ring an impeccable roster of acts like Justin Martin, Fisher, Shiba San, Catz n Dogz, Riva Starr, Tim Green, Breach, Eats Everything, Walker & Royce, Shadow Child, and countless others. (And even naming a few of these artists.) Today, his Dirtybird label continues to surprise and innovate in the underground dance scene, releasing an enigmatic combination of house, funk, dirty bass, and electronica.\n\nVonStroke has released four original artist albums, a remix album, and a live album recorded when he closed the famed Movement Festival in his original hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Some other music highlights include working on records with Bootsy Collins, Rihanna, Disclosure and Kevin Saunderson, as well as a few #1 and #2 hits on Beatport. His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world. He continues to innovate and curate new events with a 2 additional multi-day festival mirroring his Birdhouse radio show in Chicago, and his record BBQ event series that has been going since 2003!\n\nVonStroke also loves art; most notably pop-surrealist artwork that he has commissioned for the last 7 years on Dirtybird for all of the releases. Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude. Claude does not scowl or look mean while he DJs. He does not pretend to know everything and he truly loves his fans.

Although he is a versatile musician, having dabbled in a mesh of genres including folk, rock, and jazz, he considers himself a blues player at heart. Quinn started his musical journey in Delaware, where he was born and raised in a very musical family.\n\nQuinn\u2019s first instrument was trumpet, then the piano, and finally he became hooked on the common twang of the guitar at age 15. He continued his musical career all throughout high school, later moving to California to earn a degree in music. It was at this time that he became serious about songwriting, and began to hone his talent. This hard work and determination lead to the creation of his all-original, self-titled, debut album: \u201cQuinn Hedges\u201d (Circa 2006). Later, in 2011, he released his sophomore effort in the acoustic-based album, \u201cWithout You\u201d.\n\nWith all this experience under his belt, including playing in several different bands, rigorous gigging as a solo musician, and having written so much original music, Quinn decided it was high time to start his own group. Thus \u201cThe Quinn Hedges Band\u201d, came to be in 2009. The band release \u201cStep Outside\u201d in 2012, and eventually split in 2013.\n\nFrom 2013 through 2016, Quinn teamed up with his cousin, John B Hedges, and released his finest album to date, \"Slightly South of Stormy Clouds\" (Mixed by Grammy Award Winner Tim Sonnefeld & Mastered by the legendary Bob Ludwig).\n\nQuinn currently performs in the dynamic Sacramento-based rock band, \"The Outcome\", who recently released an EP titled, \u201cI\u2019ll Take It\u201d.\n\nSince 2003, Quinn has been playing in restaurants, dive bars, wine bars, wineries, clubs, theaters, weddings, private events, opened for numerous national touring acts, and even performed the national anthem at a Sacramento Kings vs. Los Angeles Lakers game.\n\nA renowned artist who is known for the truth and wisdom behind his lyrics, Quinn creates soulful and relatable music, which touches a wide array of audiences.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dan Whitaker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10024306.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Chicago, United States", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Weekly Instagram Live stream!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Craig Gerdes Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10275092.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Craig Gerdes", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Steeped in the white lines, black tar and diesel smoke of the American highway, Tough As Nails\u2014the latest LP from Craig Gerdes\u2014is raw and real, a document of a road-tested band fast on the rise. Ever since the central-Illinois songwriter released his lauded 2018 debut LP, Smokin\u2019 Drinkin\u2019 & Gamblin\u2019, he\u2019s been on tour almost constantly, playing upwards of 150 shows per year, including opening slots and festival support for top country and Americana artists from Tyler Childers and Paul Cauthen to Jamey Johnson and Cody Jinks, as well as a lengthy run with hard-rocker-turned-country-star Aaron Lewis.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of the road in this record,\u201d says Gerdes, who travels with his band and his wife Janel in the van. \u201cI love moving\u2014that part of traveling where you\u2019re actually rolling down the highway. It\u2019s when we feel most at home. Things are just different\u2014your sleep patterns and your mindset change. But the thing I love the most about being on the road is meeting different forms and facets of people\u2014talking to them and hearing their stories about where they come from and what they do. I find that intriguing. So there\u2019s a lot of that in this record, too. The title track and the album, when you boil \u2018em down\u2014that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. We wanted to speak to the people.\u201d\n\nFor Tough As Nails, Gerdes and his road band\u2014lead guitarist Jake Baxter, bassist Britton Wood and drummer Randy Noy\u2014hit St. Louis\u2019 Native Sound Studio revved up and ready to go, with producer/engineer David Beeman at the helm. Beeman had also worked with Gerdes on 2019 single \u201cTailgate n\u2019 Tallboys,\u201d a theme song commissioned by the festival of the same name, a six-day, 30+ band country concert, held annually in Peoria, Ill. \u201cTough as Nails was the first time that I was able to be like, \u2018Alright, boys, we\u2019re pulling off the highway and going into the studio for a week,\u2019\u201d Gerdes says. \u201cCapturing the energy of our live performances was crucial to me. So we just went in fresh off the road and banged out the meat and potatoes of it in three days.\u201d\n\nThe resulting LP\u2014spruced up by Robby \"Man of Steel\" Turner on steel guitar\u2014reeks of spilled Jack Daniels, truckstops, pool halls and tobacco-stained green rooms. Its second track, a hi-octane, four-on-the-floor cover of Roger Alan Wade\u2019s \u201cIf Guitars Were Guns,\u201d acts as a manifesto for Tough As Nails, a record that packs more grit and wallop than most of its country contemporaries: \u201cI play country music in my little cabin home in the hood, I play rock & roll because it makes me feel good / I play them ol\u2019 blues to take a load off my mind, I play what I please, out of tune and out of time.\u201d\n\nAs with any artist worth his salt, Gerdes\u2019 sound has been evolving since the last record. Smokin\u2019 Drinkin\u2019 and Gamblin\u2019\u2014anchored by Nashville pedal-steel icon Jim Vest\u2014was deeply indebted to the \u201970s country on which Gerdes was raised. But with Tough as Nails, he and his band just \u201clet it all go.\u201d \u201cWe approached it like we would a live performance,\u201d Gerdes says. \u201cI didn\u2019t put no reins on it or nothing like that. I just let it evolve into what it became. It\u2019s a mixture of all my different influences. With country music, the way I see it, it\u2019s a melting pot: rock & roll, Southern rock, rockabilly, the blues\u2014it all goes in there.\u201d\n\nThe new album\u2019s rock & roll leanings make sense when you consider the influences of the lineup that has solidified as Gerdes\u2019 backing band. Baxter, now in his 20s, has been playing guitar with Gerdes since he was a 16-year-old worshipping at the altar of Jimmy Page, Keith Richards and Duane Allman. And it\u2019s a similar story with drummer Randy Noy. \u201cOttawa, Ill., the part of the state Randy\u2019s from, is pretty blue collar, pretty rock & roll,\u201d Gerdes says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really know much about country music when he joined the band. His biggest influence is John Bonham, which is cool because I always wanted that kick, that drive to my sound. When we started playing together, I was like, \u2018Don\u2019t hold back just because you think we\u2019re playing country. Play them drums like they owe you money, brother.\u2019 We were able to capture that kind of energy on the new record.\u201d\n\nSit with him for five minutes and you\u2019ll know that Gerdes is a natural-born storyteller. Really, Tough as Nails is a documentary in album form. It deals with real people, real places and real struggles, collected along the Interstate as Gerdes and his band play an endless parade of one-night stands. The record is about family, community, honesty, tragedy, travel, the fleeting nature of existence, even silent visitations from the ghosts of our loved ones. Above all, though, Tough as Nails confronts the elusiveness of the American Dream in the 21st century, giving voice to the plight of the working poor, brought to life by an ex-steel worker from Pennsylvania, an out-of-work coal miner from Alabama, a suicidal veteran wrestling with PTSD in rural Ohio, and a teenage girl from god knows where trying to shake herself free from the grip of heroin. Track after track, it\u2019s a testament to fighting for your ideals, taking your blows and doing your damnedest to press on in the face of adversity.\n\n\u201cAll the stories in these songs are true,\u201d Gerdes says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the people. I wanted the album to speak directly to them, to things they\u2019ve gone through. In my mindset, country music has got to be real.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, with this same spirit of authenticity and connection in mind, Gerdes launched a weekly, hour-long Facebook live series called The Gatherin\u2019. \u201cJanel had the idea that we could reach people who couldn\u2019t make it to my shows,\u201d he says. \u201cWe do it every Tuesday night\u2014either from the road, or at home in my garage, interacting with people as we go. I play songs, they make requests, but most importantly, there\u2019s a back and forth. We talk about what\u2019s going on in their lives. And we try to help in any way we can.\u201d\n\nGerdes refers to the people who tune in regularly not as fans, but kinfolk. Many of them have started to identify as \u201cThe Gatherin\u2019 Family.\u201d Through this community, lasting friendships have been made, with Gerdes and Janel, the band members, and with each other. \u201cLife can be tough and we all need each other,\u201d Gerdes says. \u201cMusic is a great vehicle for that. If that\u2019s a way we can bring people together, that\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do\u2014make a difference in their lives through the music, and bring them together around a common passion. And the more they\u2019re together, the more they find out just how much they have in common!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hollier ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10280160.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Rock, Indie Rock And Roll", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "John Hollier is a songwriter from central Louisiana.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Noah's Ark Was A Spaceship ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Alternative, Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Noah's Ark Was A Spaceship and Little Brazil will stream live sets from the Main Room at Slowdown on May 23."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cary Morin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9212936.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Americana, Folk, Roots, Native Americana Fingerstyle Blues, Folk Blues, Contemporary Blues, Fingerstyle Guitar, Blues, Acoustic Blues", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Cary Morin\nCary Morin brings together the great musical traditions of\nAmerica and beyond like no other, from the rocking,\nelectrified world groove of The Atoll, to the pared-down\nacoustic blues of Sing It Louder, which showcases Morin\u2019s\ndeft fingerstyle guitar.\nSing It Louder revisits Morin\u2019s musical origins in Great Falls,\nMontana, where he cut his teeth picking guitar standards at\nneighborhood get-togethers.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Barefoot Movement ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7406956.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Americana, Folk", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Heartfelt, energetic, and down home.

With his vocal range of seven plus octaves, ability to swing from a deep guttural baritone to soaring soprano riffs, knack for capturing life through lyrics, and commanding stage presence, he has carved a niche for himself in today\u2019s music world. A prolific songwriter, he has a large and varied catalog of songs ranging from heart-wrenching acoustic ballads to heart-pounding heavier rock. His music is published by EMI Music Publishing Canada (2004-present). Lukas first ventured onto the music scene with two Canadian bands, Cleavage (1995-2005) and Rise Electric (2005-2006), which helped prepare him for what was to come. He entered and won the competition television show Rock Star: Supernova (2006) which earned him front man status with Tommy Lee (Motley Crue), Jason Newsted (Metallica), and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). Their band Rock Star Supernova completed an album and a world tour of the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Following the tour, Lukas returned to Los Angeles and began writing and recording new music. The Love and Lust EP (June 2007) was released and he completed the solo acoustic Love and Lust Tour, making over two dozen stops throughout the United States and Canada. The new material was well-received by fans, and the band Stars Down was born (2008-present). After touring with his new band, Lukas began playing local gigs at such southern California hot spots as The Roxy, The Key Club, The Mint, and Viper Room. The year 2010 kicked off with a mini East Coast tour and Lukas working on his first full length album. Hollywood was released (July 2010) and debuted live at West Hollywood\u2019s famous Viper Room. The all acoustic Hollywood Stripped followed (August 2010). After moving to Nashville, in addition to local and out-of-town gigs, he wrote, recorded, produced, and released six additional recordings. The first three were Seed EP (December 2010), Story Teller (January 2011), and Super, Sex, Magic (February 2011). He also co-wrote, provided vocals, and recorded several music videos for a side-project, Switchblade Glory (April 2011). Lukas released Prophecy (November 2011) and Christmas Collection (December 2011) to complete a very busy year. But he wasn\u2019t finished, releasing the album 8 Days (April 2012) soon after. Lukas has appeared on many media outlets, including performing live at the 2006 Gemini awards, the CBS television series Rock Star: Supernova (18 million viewers worldwide), Ellen, Regis & Kelly, The Jimmy Kimmel Show, Entertainment Tonight, The Howard Stern Show, and ET Canada.

His words can be hilarious, as on I\u2019ll Start Tomorrow, on which he postpones his doctor\u2019s clean-living advice. But they can also be heartfelt, on the gospel-tinged kiss-off of That\u2019s Love To Me. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to write songs that remind us to love ourselves,\u201d he considers. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who voted for who, what your religion is, who you love\u2026\u201d\n\nOn this white-knuckle ride, only The Train could keep the material on the tracks. \u201cI ended up with a hit-squad of downright amazing musicians,\u201d he reflects, \u201cthat shared my curiosity for all corners of the roots genre. We wanted to capture how we feel performing, right smack-dab on this record, and I believe we\u2019ve done that. Now I just try to keep up.\u201d\n\nIn truth, Wainwright has always been an artist that sets the pace. Born into a musical family in Savannah, Georgia, the formative influence of his father\u2019s vocals and grandfather\u2019s rolling boogie-woogie piano compelled him into a life of music.

His insatiable interest in music discovery, sheer love for entertaining and curiosity have led him all around the world, and the resulting perspective is a reflection of his passion for entertaining and creating progressive roots music in an effort to move the art-form forward. Composer, producer, vocalist, and award wining entertainer and piano player; Victor Wainwright is a raucous high-octane, dynamic performer and crowd pleaser with soul to spare.\n\nThe name of Victor Wainwright's band - and the sleeve image of their albums - is also the most fitting of metaphors.

Charles is a singer-songwriter born and raised in West Virginia. Nowadays, if you want to find him, you\u2019d look in any dive bar, caf\u00e9, or live music venue in Appalachia.\n\nCharles didn\u2019t find music at an early age like many other artists. It wasn\u2019t until he was nineteen that he picked up a guitar and began singing songs. He did however, grow up trout fishing in Upshur County streams, hunting on the Allegheny ridges, tagging along with his grandfather on the farm, and listening to old-timer\u2019s talk about their days in his grandparent\u2019s general store. Charles Wesley\u2019s father was a coal miner until his birth and his mother was a schoolteacher. Little did he know, this background would come to play a major role in the songs and stories that captivate rooms full of listeners today.\n\nIn 2014, Charles began to play bluegrass music professionally thanks to a strong, unique voice that he\u2019d only recently discovered. He played bluegrass music from the banks of the Mississippi to whiskey bars in Manhattan, and everywhere in between. Charles then turned his attention to crafting his own songs. Eventually, he founded Union Sound Treaty in the latter part of 2015. Union Sound Treaty began performing regionally soon there after and began work on what would become an impressive debut album.\n\nCharles continues to perform with Union Sound Treaty and as a solo artist all across Appalachia and beyond. He\u2019s grateful to have shared the stage with artists such as Shooter Jennings, David Allan Coe, Luke Combs, Tyler Childers, Sundy Best, Waymore\u2019s Outlaws, Aaron Watson, Colter Wall, and many more. Charles plans to release his first solo project in 2018. Whether he\u2019s performing solo for a room full of patrons who\u2019ve quieted to a barely audible murmur or a music hall full concert goers breaking in their boots to the rhythm of a Union Sound Treaty tune, Charles Wesley turns heads and opens ears everywhere he plays.

A multicultural collaboration between producer Na\u2019el Shehade and vocalist Via Rosa, the project plays to the complementary dynamics of their unlikely pairing, blurring the lines between R&B and dance-pop, heartbreak and bliss.\n\nRosa grew up in a musical household; her parents played in a reggae band, they toured as a family, homeschooling Rosa into her early teens, limiting her listening primarily to Sade, oldies, Brazilian and Afrobeat music. After moving to Chicago, she connected with hip-hop collective THEMPeople. Born in Chicago, Shehade fell in love with DJ culture as a kid and took up music production and engineering; his interest eventually led to professional opportunities, including studio work with Chance the Rapper, Kanye West, and music projects for MTV and Bravo.\n\nIn early jam sessions the chemistry was clear; Rosa\u2019s soulful delivery interlocked with Shehade\u2019s chic Chicago house-infused production style. A lovesick sound emerged over two EPs \u2014 Gallows in 2016 and Lies After Love in 2018 \u2014 and caught the ear of Ghostly International.

Jackson\u2019s lyrics paint tales of lives filled with passion and joy as much as of a life tainted by sorrow and disappointment \u2013 his life. Jackson sings of heaven and hell, beauty and grit \u2013 Jackson sings of real life.\nBorn one of eleven siblings to parents of migrant workers, his life began in Moody, Texas, a small town just north of Austin. It was a nomadic existence stripped of the comforts and security that most take for granted. Jackson\u2019s roots instead became deep seeded in his love for music, a passion passed on to Jackson at an early age by his father who would steal away whenever possible to see and hear country greats like Waylon, Willie, and Billy Joe Shaver perform, often with Jackson in tow.\n\nJackson's adolescence was spent bouncing from one migrant labor town to another, finally settling in a small farming town in Washington State. After graduating high school, he moved back to Texas for a while but soon left to try and make his mark in Nashville. There, Jackson found work as a songwriter, but life for Jackson was still a steep uphill climb, and after a couple of tough and frustrating years, Jackson had to face the hard truth that Nashville was not the \u201chome\u201d for which he had spent his whole life searching.\n\nFrom New York City to Los Angeles, Jackson has finally found his rightful home, ironically right back where his life began -- in Texas.\nCombining his real life experiences with old school country elements, and throwing in the flavors of punk and southern rock to create a style all his own, Jackson Taylor continues to break the rules of traditional country music with his straightforward lyrics, \"take it or leave it\" approach, intense live performances, and the drive and determination of a freight train. The end result can not be pigeon holed into any style and can only be rightfully defined as what it is: \u201cJackson Taylor Music\u201d.\n\nRecently signed to the Smith Entertainment Group (Stoney LaRue and No Justice, catalogue on Cross Canadian Ragweed and Randy Rogers Band, the Live at Billy Bob\u2019s Texas line), Jackson Taylor is ready to take country music by storm with his latest release, aptly entitled Dark Days, which was produced and engineered in the mountains of Washington State at Cascade Studios. The CD (produced by Jackson Taylor and Ronnie Belaire, and engineered by Allen Larsen) contains 12 tracks and features the debut single \u201cLonely,\u201d a tale of emotion that Jackson knows all too well. Other tracks include \u201cOutlaws Ain\u2019t Wanted Here No More,\u201d which is a true account of Jackson's experiences in the country music industry that eventually pushed him to take his own musical path. Also featured on the new album is a cover of the tune \u201cHonky Tonk Heroes,\u201d written by Billy Joe Shaver, one of Jackson\u2019s favorite music outlaws.\n\nBilly Joe Shaver summed up it up best when he said, \u201cJackson\u2019s songs are so real and honest, you know straight off he's been there and done that. He writes and sings like he lives, great songs that I believe will live forever.\"", "otherInfo": "Live from YouTube, Facebook & our website.\n\nHere are your links:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6uvJhiSP3grhY-6rGKiWVQ?view_as=subscriber\n\nhttps://www.officialjacksontaylor.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jacksontaylorandthesinners"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Francesco Yates ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10380738.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "R&b, Pop", "Time": "2:25 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Francesco Yates is only 24 years old but he\u2019s already received the highest possible recommendation a musical artist could. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely gonna be just a huge, huge, huge pop star,\u201d Pharrell Williams has said of the Toronto native. \u201cBut not in the way people have been thinking of pop music in the past ten years.\u201d It\u2019s a lot to live up to, but Francesco does, both in his songwriting and his impressively evocative musicianship.\n\nThe young singer has been making music since he was much younger, but everything clicked at age 11 when Francesco saw the movie School of Rock. Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pigeons Playing Ping Pong ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10178813.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "High-energy Psychedelic Funk", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Pigeons Playing Ping Pong brings end-of-the-world enthusiasm to their high-energy psychedelic funk.

Before touring the globe and amassing millions of hits online with his series of beloved tracks and mixes, the young man came up as a true disciple, absorbing hip hop and RnB culture since his childhood and finding ways to make the music his own. Since the age of fourteen, when he first began to DJ and the following year when his brother introduced him to music production software, his output has been relentless. As he explains, \u201cafter he showed me the basics, from that day on I couldn\u2019t stop making beats,\u201d pumping out a beat a day for the next couple of years and soon after self-releasing a series of EPs and beat tapes that quickly began to expand his reach. Official releases on HW&W and Jakarta Records soon spread his name like wildfire and some instant-classic remixes by the likes of Missy Elliot, Janet Jackson, TLC, Danny Brown and others have cemented his reputation and his sound; an undeniable swing of the drums comparable to Dilla\u2019s, a signature soulful touch in the melodies, and a healthy dose of funky bass lines. In the past year, he was approached by Brodinski to drop the single \u201cFree Things In Life\u201d on the hotly-tipped French label Bromance, has headlined tours in Europe, Australia and North America, and released his newest single and video \u201cAt All\u201d which has already conquered dance floors worldwide and introduced his face to the world with an unforgettable video. Now, as he continues to bridge the gap between the dance world and hip hop/RnB, he is prepping a solo album for 2015 and a series of high profile collaborations that will confirm his position as one of the most important producers in today\u2019s musical landscape.

The album comes after extensive touring of over 20 countries in Europe and North & Central America since their last album, and heavy rotation on alternative dancefloors with their most recent release \"On Blackened Wings\" hitting #1 in the DAC (German Alternative Charts) in 2015.\n\nAt the core of SHIV-R are Pete Crane (vocals & music) and Ben Bulig (music), driven by the need for self-expression and pushing for musical evolution. The music hits PRODIGY-style depth charges and EBM club elements on its way to IAMX-style expressiveness and vocal hooks that wouldn't sound out of place if sung by MARILYN MANSON. Presented with a provocatively dark, lace-filtered visual style, the group is altogether monstrously seductive.\n\nThe 12 songs on \"Requiem for the Hyperreal\" weave a dark, dynamic tapestry that varies from the industrial drive of \"Malediction\" to the musicbox slither of \"Milk and Honey\", with Pete Crane's lyrics describing a personification of fear over swampy textures in the song \"Here in the Dark\" and carving out a manifesto for self-creation over the heavy, broken beats of \"Something to Say\".\n\n\"Cheshire Grin\" will be the first single from the album dropping on August 25. Otherwordly sound design billows against hard-hitting industrial structures in the darkly maddening title song.

Over the last 6 years, JmaC has released five full-length albums, each one a new evolution in sound and approach.

Tras sus primeros escarceos con los sonidos electr\u00f3nicos con tan s\u00f3lo 16 a\u00f1os, sus habilidades t\u00e9cnicas, su especial conexi\u00f3n con el p\u00fablico y su amplio y diverso abanico de estilos musicales pronto le convertir\u00edan en uno de los artistas m\u00e1s vers\u00e1tiles y polivalentes de la escena nacional. Como el buen vino, De La Swing ha madurado con el paso del tiempo y su progresi\u00f3n sonora le ha catapultado hasta poder presumir de compartir tiempo y escenarios con varios de los nombres m\u00e1s importantes de la escena mundial; y es que compartir cabina junto a artistas como Marco Carola, Loco Dice , Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Laurent Garnier, Joseph Capriati, Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch, Paco Osuna o Vitalic, o actuar en festivales y eventos tan emblem\u00e1ticos y reputados como Monegros Desert Festival, Eastern Electrics Festival, Kingsday Madness, We are Together, Plages Electroniques, Ultra Cape Town/Johannesburg & Origin Festival son prueba fehaciente del asentamiento sonoro y arrollador \u00e9xito a escala mundial del madrile\u00f1o. Incorpor\u00e1ndose a la familia Row en 2010 como residente y pilar fundamental de un club como Elrow de Barcelona, la trayectoria de De La Swing ha experimentado un constante crecimiento mejorando exponencialmente y llegando a abanderar, -junto al resto de familia Row-, su residencia tambi\u00e9n en las fiestas especiales a cargo del club catal\u00e1n albergadas en Ibiza como El Row en Privilege Ibiza durante las temporadas 2012 y 2013, o un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s tarde en Space Ibiza. De La Swing es ese tipo de artista inconformista cuya carrera y evoluci\u00f3n musical es cuidada hasta el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo detalle y donde la profundidad, creatividad e innovaci\u00f3n sonora se abrazan sin acritud seg\u00fan pisa el escenario. Son su pasi\u00f3n y buen rollo hacia la m\u00fasica lo que impera en su d\u00eda a d\u00eda y lo que hacen de sus sets un aut\u00e9ntico viaje sonoro y \u00fanica su conexi\u00f3n con el p\u00fablico. Y es que si el de Madrid destaca con sus sesiones desenvueltas en un constante Groove y fusionando techno y house de la nueva escuela, sus producciones van un paso m\u00e1s all\u00e1. Con una mentalidad solida, f\u00e9rtil y arriesgada, De La Swing es el alma m\u00e1ter detr\u00e1s de labels tan en alza en el panorama nacional como Elrow Music, Florida Music & Ker Recordings, habiendo tambi\u00e9n colaborado y remezclado para sellos como Form, Drakos Recordings y Amazing Lab. Pero su amor por la m\u00fasica y el eclecticismo musical le ha hecho mostrar su otra cara art\u00edstica; su faceta m\u00e1s underground bajo el pseud\u00f3nimo \u2018Smoked Signal\u2019, habitualmente presente como residente del Ker Club de la Ciudad Condal y habiendo compartido vivencias y an\u00e9cdotas en su escenario con nombres como Martinez Brothers, Art Department, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Seth Troxler, Scuba o Los Suruba entre otros. English version: Born in Madrid in the 80\u2019s, Domingo Bellot starts his musical career at the age of 16. Influenced in its beginnings by techno and drum&bass, his technical skills, ability to connect with the crowd and he\u2019s diverse musical style has made him one of the most versatile DJ\u00b4s in Spain. Over the past 5 years De La Swing has shared turntables with different top level Djs as Marco Carola, Loco Dice, Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Laurent Garnier, Joseph Capriati, Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch, Paco Osuna or Vitalic among others, and has played at festivals like Monegros Desert Festival (Spain), Eastern Electric Festival (London), Kingsday Madness (Holland), We are Together (Marseille), Plages Electroniques (Cannes), Ultra Cape Town/Johannesburg & Origin Festival (South Africa), resulting rapidly a well-known and familiar Dj in countries as Spain, France, Italy and Holland. Since 2010 this Madrid born is one of the emblematic ElRow residents, the after hour based in the ever growing electronic hub of Barcelona, that has become one of the best clubs worldwide, brainchild of the organisers of Europe's only desert festival, Monegros, and owners of the acclaimed techno club Florida 135 in Fraga, Huesca. Equally important are his recent El Row residencies during the summer season in Privilege Ibiza -in 2012 and 2013- and Space Ibiza in 2014. De la Swing is that type of non-conformist artist which lives in a continuous sound evolution, where the depth, darkness and fun are always present in his sets and throughout which he shows his creativity and innovation on stage, driving his passion and vibrancy to create a different story every time, while establishing a unique connection with the crowd. While in the studio, De la Swing is a solid and fertile mind being in charge of different labels as Elrow Music, Florida Music & Ker Recordings, having also produced and remixed for labels like Form, Drakos Recordings and Amazing Lab. However, his skills and abilities go further on. We can also enjoy its more underground side with his aka \u2018Smoke Signal\u2019, usually as resident in Ker Club Barcelona once a month, sharing his talent with artists such as Martinez Brothers, Art Department, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Seth Troxler, Scuba or Los Suruba.

Kennedy Center in Washington DC, Lincoln Center in New York, MTV, Coke Studio, the TV show Good Morning Live in the USA and MBC TV in the Middle East. In addition, Farah represents Jordan annually on United Nations World Peace Day.\nTo this date, Farah has toured the Middle East, Europe, India, South America and the United States, spreading the message of peace through her music. In 2011 Farah internationally released her album entitled NOMAD, funded personally by His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan.

The recordings took place in the Middle East, Spain and the USA, including more than 30 internationally acclaimed musicians from five different continents.\nIn 2012, after the success of NOMAD, Farah presented the world premier of her new work, entitled The Arabian Jazz Project, featuring original compositions and traditional middle eastern tunes set to a jazz context. As a result of the success of The Arabian Jazz Project, Farah was chosen as one of New York's \u201cSummer Stars of Jazz\u201d and named \u201cthe Norah Jones of the Middle East\u201d by New York Time Out.\nIn June 2014, Farah released her latest album, Dunya, meaning \u201cworld\u201d in Arabic and Hindi.

Now a quarter-century into that career, Snider has done it again. After making rock records of one kind or another for seven years, both as a solo artist and with his band, Hard Working Americans, Snider has made another left turn and returned to his folk roots with the release in March 2019 of his thirteenth studio album as a solo artist, Cash Cabin Sessions, Vol. 3. As the title suggests, the album was recorded at the studio formerly owned by Johnny Cash and now owned by his son, John Carter Cash. Snider played all the instruments on the record, mostly guitar and harmonica, but he also played banjo on one song and overdubbed mandolin and percussion on some others. The only other people on the album are Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires, who contributed backing vocals to several songs. Among the highlights of the record are a trio of talking blues numbers, which reinforce the fact Snider has come full circle with the album because it was the song \u201cTalking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues\u201d from his 1994 debut, Songs For The Daily Planet, that first launched the native of Portland, Oregon, into the national consciousness.

We hope Canada will share her with us.\u201d (Hot Indie Music Review) Krystle Dos Santos has taken her experience from the Canadian College of Performing Arts, and transformed it into the beginnings of a career already full of achievements. Unveiling her talents to the public with her 2008 full length self-titled debut, Dos Santos was instantly recognized as a force by the Western Canadian Music Awards, winning the Urban Recording of the Year. That same album charted for six weeks on CJSR FM88\u2019s Urban chart and was top ten on 92.5 The X in Kamloops, BC. One of the single\u2019s from the album even appeared in an Episode of ABC\u2019s Samantha Who? But to simply classify Dos Santos as a recording artist would be neglecting one of the most intriguing aspects of her talents. Whether facing the crowd on her own or with her full ensemble of band-mates as she is more accustomed, Dos Santos uses a sultry tone and eccentric array of melodies to create an intimately magnetic connection with her audience. She is able to further engage her audience by shifting seamlessly through genres, embodying her musical influences-Nina Simone, Etta James, Alicia Keys-culminating into a powerful live experience that fuses jazz, soul, pop, funk and blues into an arena of styles and sounds that takes listeners from mid-20th century Harlem, right up to present day L.A. With key performances at the Edmonton International Jazz Festival, Whistler International Film Festival, and the Honey Jam Showcase in Toronto, Krystle has had many opportunities to put her live shows on full display. She has already toured extensively throughout western Canada, singing stories of pain and love, joy and redemption, all told through a voice that precisely reflects the emotion of her music. It is nearly impossible to be a true fan of Krystle Dos Santos without taking part in the experience she creates with her live performances. Dos Santos completed her second album in the first quarter of 2011. Femme Fatale, as it was aptly titled, again revealed Dos Santos versatility and her ability to capture the audience with an eclectic mix of dance and funk, but always with the soulful jazz vocals for which she has quickly become renowned. Dos Santos\u2019 interpretation of her influences has made it difficult to categorize her style. Compared presently to Jill Scott or Corrine-Bailey Rae or even Erykah Badu, Krystle is able to personalize her sound and message, adding her own character to her music to create a uniquely refreshing sound. Her vibrant personality has been utilized outside of music in various add campaigns and modeling opportunities. It also helps that Krystle is as stunning as she is talented; one of those rare beauties that command attention with little more than a moments glance. But make no mistake, Krystle Dos Santos is a musician first and foremost. With a smoky voice that can fluctuate to fit any style and a live show that demands the audience stand-up and take notice, Dos Santos is ready for the masses to feel her music. She is currently working on her third studio release, and will no doubt continue to strive until her name and her music is known to the world.

When Freddie was 15, the family moved to a more upscale neighborhood in New Orleans. Freddie\u2014along with his brother Adam and sister Crystal Ross\u2014were immersed in music at home by their mother, who often sang along to her Gladys Knight and Patty LaBelle records around the house. But it was the Baptist church choir where a young Freddie flourished. \u201dMy mother made sure I never missed practice,\u201d recalls Freedia.

After starting as a back-up dancer for Katey Red, the original \u201cSissy Bounce\u201d rapper, Freedia knew Bounce was his calling and eventually broke out on his own.\n\nBig Freedia is in the studio wrapping up her new ep Queen of Bounce and her first TV series, Queen of Bounce will air this Oct on Fuse TV.

With lyrics about the experience of being human, her music has a way of connecting with pretty much anyone on a deeply personal level.

After growing up in San Diego, she moved to Santa Cruz for college (go slugs!) and after a fifteen year love affair with the town, moved on to San Francisco where she's lived since 2012. She\u2019s toured the U.S. and Europe, plus recorded and toured with her own French band (The Carbone Band), along with an Artist in Residence in Saint Herblain, France.

She\u2019s performing frequently in San Francisco with her new energetic groove-rock band, Amy & The Elements. At other times she uses a looper where she can instantly record, playback and perform atop her own performance with harmonies and instruments. And very often she\u2019ll pair things down and simply perform a solo acoustic show highlighting the purity of her songs.\n\nAmy\u2019s musical history stretches back to age five, when she began singing in her school choir. She took up piano at age six and has been studying music ever since. She finally picked up the guitar when she began songwriting at twenty-two.\n\nDuring her long residence in Santa Cruz, she supported local organizations through two benefit concerts called Take Back Your Forest. Collectively they raised six thousand dollars for the Sempervirens Fund, an organization that purchases and protects redwood forest in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

She does it through her texts, her poems, her melodies.\n\nHer mother, originally from Madagascar gave her the taste for poetry and reverie, her French-German father ingrained the longing for risk and drama. This cultural mix shaped her adventurous soul.\n\nA model and actress in Europe then in New York, where she attends the renowned Lee Strasberg Theater Institute, life\u2019s torments bring her all the way to Los Angeles. There, as she tries to find authenticity, she questions her whole life and puts her acting career on hold, in order to focus on her childhood dream: to be a singer.\nWith a classical music background acquired during childhood, and with an opera vocal training Maylin goes head on: She is reborn \u00ab singer/songwriter \u00bb as she puts her first band together with Omar Torrez (Tom Waits) on guitar, and David Leach (Ben Harper) on percussion.\n\n- In 2005, she releases her first album \u00ab On My Way to See You \u00bb produced by Robin Di Maggio (Tracy Chapman, David Bowie, Steve Vai\u2026) and Baraka Di Candia (Sting). She performs at festivals such as SXSW in Austin (TX), PopKomm in Berlin.\nHer music gets played on college and independent radio stations in California (KPFK, KXLU) and in Canada.\n\n- In 2007, she moves to Paris with a leitmotiv : integrate her folk and blues influences (Nina Simone, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, Tom Waits...) to her new artistic signature.\nShe takes a course in harmony at l\u2019EDIM (Paris), finds new co-writers and a starts a band with guitarist Antonin Huerre. Antonin and Maylin work together for a few years on her new sound, Jeremy Nattagh (bass, percussions) joins them on stage.\n\n- In 2012 Maylin produces a second album. The name of the album \u00ab Run Hippy Run \u00bb seems obvious for this fianc\u00e9e of travels who constantly strives to move forward : \u00ab I am like a spinning top, if I stop, I fall. \u00bb\nDuring that time, Maylin\u2019s band performs in France on a regular basis and goes on two US tours.\n\n\nEn 2015, Maylin feels the desire to push her limits and develop her art. She starts playing the guitar off and on stage and after many years of having considered English her natural creative tongue, she delves into French songwriting. She joins the \u00ab stylomaniaques \u00bb, the French- songs-writing workshop of her friend and mentor acclaimed-songwriter Claude Lemesle.\nThere, she experiences a renewed pleasure for writing songs in French with the candor of a child who is rediscovering her own mother-tongue.\n\nShe is currently embarking on a new journey with a new core band : Michael Ravassat on guitar and Ricardo Garatea on percussions, joined by a bass player and a drummer for a more \u00ab rock \u00bb sound .\nThey are preparing a third album in English and French\n\nMaylin also writes music for film and commercials in France and the US (documentary : \u00ab c\u2019est quoi ce cirque \u00bb, (independant movie: \u00ab Goddess of Love \u00bb, clothing brand : \u00ab Maker and Company \u00bb) and other artists\u2026\n\n\n\n\nComment raconter, en quelques lignes, les cheminements, les errances, les le\u00e7ons, les joies et les inspirations de toute une vie ? Maylin le fait au travers de ses cr\u00e9ations artistiques.\nD\u2019origine malgache, sa m\u00e8re lui donne le go\u00fbt de la po\u00e9sie et de la r\u00eaverie ; son p\u00e8re franco-allemand lui transmet celui de l\u2019audace et du drame. Ce m\u00e9tissage a forg\u00e9 son \u00e2me aventuri\u00e8re.\n\nFinaliste fran\u00e7aise au concours de mannequins \u00ab the look of the year \u00bb de l\u2019agence Elite et actrice en Europe puis \u00e0 New York, Maylin joue dans diverses productions cin\u00e9matographiques et t\u00e9l\u00e9visuelles telles que \u00ab La Reine Blanche \u00bb, \u00ab In God\u2019s Hands \u00bb, \u00ab October 22 \u00bb.\nA New York, elle suit les cours \u00e0 la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre \u00e9cole Lee Strasberg, puis les tourbillons de la vie la conduisent jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Los Angeles.

It would only be eight years later that Guns N' Roses would release their masterpiece, Appetite for Destruction, and in turn, open Brock's eyes to the possibility of a career in guitar soloing.\n\nBrock's first band, The Corporate Sugar Daddies, rose to cult status in the King George area of Virginia while he was in high school. The band released two albums, the breakout debut, Flow, and the follow up release, The Corporate Sugar Daddies. CSD broke up after being passed over for an appearance on NBC's Saved By The Bell - a crushing blow to the group that was already dealing with the pressures of being a hip, local high school act. The rejection from Saved by the Bell knocked the band down and they never really got up. The only thing left do was move on.\n\nAfter graduating from High School a year early, and finding that substitute teaching was not his bag, he decided to move South and go to college. Brock kissed King George goodbye and made his way to Savannah, GA for what would eventually become a turning point in his life. Brock enrolled in The Savannah College of Art and Design where he pursued and obtained a degree in video and film production as well as a minor in sound engineering. This of course is when and where Perpetual Groove was born, but that's another story.\n\nThe reluctant front man of the band has a wicked sense of humor, a passion for movies, music, video games and books about other musicians who share a passion for movies, music, video games and books about other musicians who share a passion for movies, music, video games and books about other musicians who share a passion for movies, music, video games and books about other musicians who......", "otherInfo": "Perpetual Groove frontman Brock Butler plays solo acoustic for 'Busking Down The House.'"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tony Furtado ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6364305.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Indie Rock, Alt-folk, Americana, Rock", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cTony Furtado is a major musical force without a doubt. He has his black-belt in voice and bottleneck guitar and his banjo playing scares the crap out of me.\u201d\n\u2013 David Lindley, musical adventurer\n\nVery few musicians of any stripe so personify a musical genre as completely as Tony Furtado embodies Americana roots music. Tony is an evocative and soulful singer, a wide-ranging songwriter and a virtuoso multi-instrumentalist adept on banjo, cello-banjo, slide guitar and baritone ukulele who mixes and matches sounds and styles with the flair of a master chef (he\u2019s also an accomplished sculptor, but that\u2019s another story). All of the music of America is in Tony\u2019s music. Relix hit the nail on the head when writing of Tony: \u201cTrue talent doesn\u2019t need categories.\u201d\n\nA native of Pleasanton, California, who now makes his home in Portland, Oregon, Tony Furtado took up the banjo at age 12, inspired by the Beverly Hillbillies TV show and a sixth grade music report. He first attracted national attention in 1987, when he won the National Bluegrass Banjo Championship in Winfield, Kansas. Not long after that, Tony opted for the life of a full-time professional musician, joining Laurie Lewis & Grant Street. A second victory at Winfield, in 1991, bookended his years with Grant Street.\n\nIn 1990, Tony signed a recording deal with Rounder Records, one of the country\u2019s preeminent independent record companies. Beginning with Swamped in 1990, he recorded six critically acclaimed albums for the label, collaborating with such master musicians as Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Tim O\u2019Brien, Stuart Duncan, Kelly Joe Phelps and Mike Marshall. During this period, Tony also performed and recorded with the band Sugarbeat and the Rounder Banjo Extravaganza with Tony Trischka and Tom Adams.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s\u2014influenced by such musical heroes as Ry Cooder, David Lindley and Taj Mahal\u2014Tony added slide guitar, singing and songwriting to his musical toolbox and began leading his own band. He is a tireless road musician who performs in a dizzying variety of formats: solo, in a duo or trio or with his full five-person band. He especially values the opportunities he has had to tour with such legendary musicians as Gregg Allman and with such esteemed slide guitarists as David Lindley, Derek Trucks and Sonny Landreth.\n\nTony has performed throughout the world at top venues and appeared at such prestigious music festivals as the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Jazz Aspen, Kerrville Folk Festival, Strawberry Music Festival, Winnipeg Folk Festival, Sisters Folk Festival, San Jose Jazz Festival and countless others. \u201cI love playing live,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my energy is focused on the love of playing music and rolling with the moment. It\u2019s a give and take from the audience to the stage, and back. And the music that is created is something that otherwise might not occur without that flow.\u201d\n\nTony has recorded and produced almost a dozen CDs for various labels such as Dualtone, What Are Records and Funzalo Records. Tony enthusiastically describes his newest CD, The Bell, as \u201cthe most personal of my career.\u201d To be released this summer on his own YousayFurtado Records, The Bell is an important release for several reasons: it represents a return to Tony\u2019s banjo-playing roots, with the banjo and cello-banjo more prominent than in recent years; the original songs concern such weighty themes as the loss of his father, the birth of his son and his own creative rebirth with the move to a new record label and management team; his working band is featured; and, most important of all, this is the first album in a long time on which Tony had complete artistic control.

Dav was lucky enough to fall into playing house parties for the huge MSU Ski Club, which led directly to working with a popular local cover band named Insol. The band introduced the East Lansing, MI bar scene to the up and coming DJ. Within the next few years Dav began mixing on turntables and became a regular at numerous spots around Michigan, all while calling Lansing home. This is when he began forming his unique style, mixing anything from Hip Hop and Old School, to House, to Disco and 80's! In 2007, DJ Dav was chosen by StudentCity.com and American Eagle Clothing to be their Acapulco, Mexico spring break DJ. On top of rocking the decks for 28 days straight he was also able to work with DJ AM, DJ Skribble and Fat Joe. He moved to Park City, UT in 2008 and quickly became a go to DJ in the popular destination resort town. Within the first few months the local paper was quoted as writing, \"With chops like his, people are bound to catch on quickly\". In 2011 he moved back to Detroit, the birthplace of techno, and began getting back into the technical aspects of DJing. Since winning the 2013 Michigan DJ Olympics in Lansing, MI, DJ Dav has become a highly sought after DJ in Detroit's open format scene. In the fall of 2014, he was selected by Grant Nelson to be a part of an amazing new online radio station, www.d3ep.com!

Their electrifying live shows are more than just a performance, they are an unrivaled jubilated experience. Backline\u2019d with a band equipped with old style instruments & props (a saloon piano, full brass horns, accordion and banjo), tappers, & jump n\u2019 jiving lindy hoppers, PARLOR SOCIAL pays detailed homage to the Harlem Renaissance. But the undercurrent of their urban & hip-hop beats reveals their sound is a uniquely new creation they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cneo-ragtime.\u201d\n\nPARLOR SOCIAL is fronted by Montreal-bred husband and wife team Dessy Di Lauro and Ric\u2019key Pageot. Dessy provides sultry vocals that flawlessly encapsulate the spirit of Uptown\u2019s early 20th Century cultural boom through the prohibition era, but she offers a timeless approach that\u2019s all her own. Serving as musical director and pianist/ accordionist, Ric\u2019key is either playing the squeezebox or tickling the ivories with an affable buoyant stride that promotes the infectiously festive atmosphere of their concerts.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder Dessy and Ric\u2019key are the embodiment of the aforementioned jazz icons they idolized\u2014Dessy grew up admiring and studying musical icons from Ella Fitzgerald to Stevie Wonder. After her mother placed her in the church choir at the ripe age of 4, Dessy\u2019s perennial rendezvous with music began. Singing and performing, or what she calls her \u201cgift from God,\u201d set her on a road to lyrical destiny\u2014a road that led her to background session singing with Patti Labelle, Deborah Cox, and The Neville Bros, and a coveted leading part on Cirque du Soleil\u2019s La Nouba show out of Orlando, Florida.\n\nRic\u2019key was raised in a musical family. His mother and his father, who was an accomplished touring bass player, enrolled Ric\u2019key in classical piano lessons at the age of 8. He later parlayed his skills into garnering several opportunities and milestones, including becoming the youngest musical director ever hired by Cirque Du Soleil when he joined the creation team to work on their groundbreaking arena touring production, Delirium. The large band consisted of an impressive line-up of eleven musicians and six lead singers, among them, Dessy.\n\nDessy and Ric\u2019key\u2019s musical paths eventually lead them to each other. What initially started as a professional relationship (Ric\u2019key produced Dessy\u2019s debut solo EP, A Study of a Woman\u2019s Soul), ended in a flourishing marriage. Dessy and Ric\u2019key began a new life together and set their sites on Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2010, produced and backed by her husband Ric\u2019key, Dessy released her first solo music video \u201cWhy U Raggin\u2019, which won two Hollywood Music in Media Awards, including Best R&B/Soul Song of the Year.

To help capture and shape her own unique sound, Miss Tess enlisted not only her trusty 1930s Weymann archtop, but also heavy input from co-producers Andrija Tokic (Alabama Shakes, Hurray for the Riff Raff) and Thomas Bryan Eaton, her full-time bandmate and musical partner. Combining Thomas\u2019s arranging ideas and skilled instrumental work with Andrija\u2019s studio full of vintage mics, tube amps, keyboards, and tape machines, the resulting record has a rich, buttery warmth well-suited to Miss Tess's voice and authentic, retro-contemporary songwriting style.\nAfter over a decade on the road, now making her home in Nashville \u2014 by way of Baltimore, Boston, and Brooklyn \u2014 Miss Tess has found a creative community that encourages and embraces wide artistic exploration and expression as much as she does.\n\n\u201cMiss Tess swings and swaggers, rooted in a retro groove that\u2019s equal parts blues, mid-century rock & roll and Booker T-worthy R&B.\u201d \u2013 Rolling Stone\n\n\u201cOld-time warmth, 21st-century sass.

And man, does he front a great rock n' soul band!\u201d - Will Kimbrough/\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to put a finger on any one sound that defines \u201cAmerican music,\u201d the compositions of Bill Toms are as close a template as any. The Pittsburgh native, along with his band Hard Rain, delivers a sound that takes the greatest of America\u2019s most beloved genres and melds them into a poetic representation of the best the country has to offer.\n\nWith his ninth full-length studio release, Good For My Soul (street date October 27), Toms channels a foot-stomping, wall-shaking blend of soul, blues, gospel, and rock vibes, all brought together with his lyrical specialty -- stories of everyday men and women doing their best to stay ahead while still managing to keep a dream or two in their heads.\n\nSoaring horns, gritty licks, toe-tapping rhythms, and Toms\u2019 own rough-hewn vocals will draw listeners in, as well as well-deserved comparisons to the greats such as Dr. John, Little Feat, Springsteen, Joe Tex, The Blasters, Otis Redding, and Rufus Thomas.\n\n\u201cThe idea of a horn section behind my songs has been something I\u2019ve thought about for a while,\u201d explains Toms. \u201cAlbert King, and all the Stax artists come to mind when I think of what true rhythm and blues can do. I wanted a piece of that; creating dynamics, and drama within the song; and fostering the deep emotion that a great horn section can give. The words also needed this place-- in order to be fully interpreted as the representation of \u2018my America,\u2019 and the people who make up my small part of this world.\u201d\n\nGood For My Soul was recorded in February 2017 by Oscar-winning composer Rick Witkowski, who also co-produced the set with Will Kimbrough (Rodney Crowell, Todd Snider). Both artists have collaborated with Toms frequently on parts of his earlier catalog.\n\nToms launched his musical career in 1987 as lead guitarist of Pittsburgh\u2019s legendary band Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers, During that period, he opened for and played with such legendary names as The Band, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Little Feat, and Stevie Ray Vaughn. While playing guitar, co-writing, and adding backup vocals for the Houserockers, Toms and the band recorded six studio albums and one live concert album. In 1995, The Houserockers released American Babylon, which was recorded and produced by Springsteen himself.\n\nAs a solo artist, Toms has opened for the likes of Buddy Guy, Levon Helm, Marshall Crenshaw, The Kennedys, Steve Forbert, and Ellis Paul. He\u2019s plotting a string of regional east coast dates to support Good For My Soul, as well as a full European tour in 2018.\nFor more information and tour dates, please visit www.billtoms.com", "otherInfo": "With a few special guests, Bill Toms will perform a live stream set from Excuses Bar and Grill."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Geo Vanasco ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8382222.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Tech House, Techno, Progressive House, Deep House, Bass Music, House, Electronic Dance Music, Tribal House, Breakbeat, Dance, Electro House", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A native of New York, Geo Vanasco has always had an ear, passion, talent, and respect for music.

Born and raised in Dallas, SaraBeth is a contemporary country singer and budding songwriter who is seamlessly making her mark in Nashville as an all-American, sweetly southern artist with an edge. Smart, beautiful and tremendously talented, SaraBeth is the breath of fresh air the music industry needs. When Dean Sams, member of award winning group Lonestar, first met SaraBeth, he knew he had just met a future star. He recognized her talent immediately and knew her robust potential. Soon after, Sams took SaraBeth into the studio to produce her debut album \"Anything Is Possible\", featuring her singles \"Kickin' and Screamin'\", \"Miss You Anywhere\", and \"That's The Sound\", creating a buzz across the US . Armed with strong original material and a top notch band, SaraBeth has garnered a very large, loyal following that continues to grow every day. SaraBeth doesn\u2019t want to take all the credit for her passion for music. She maintains that her family plays an essential role in her story, citing them as the source for a lot of her motivation. \u201cMy younger brother was drafted to play pro baseball for the Cardinals, my dad recently wrote a book on motivation and inspires people all over the world, and my mom is the glue that holds us all together. With all these incredibly successful and driven role models in my life, I thought, how can I NOT go after this dream?\u201d After crossing over into Nashville territory, SaraBeth began collaborating with some of the best, most respected songwriters in Music City, sparking her love for songwriting. Her sophomore single \u201cMiss You Anywhere,\u201d is one of her original songs, and she hopes to continue writing more in the future. \u201cEach song I've recorded was selected based on the lyrics and message,\u201d says SaraBeth. \u201cI want those who listen to my songs to walk away uplifted and encouraged. Life is too short to be negative!\u201d Being born and raised in the Texas music scene, SaraBeth knows country music. Her pride for her home state, coupled with her love for genuine, authentic lyrics, has influenced her style and kept her true to her roots. She has appeared on morning television shows such as Daytime (nationally syndicated), Good Day Dallas, D The Broadcast (Dallas), Fox 26 Morning News (Houston), Great Day SA (San Antonio), More at Midday (Nashville), Tennessee Mornings (Nashville) and nationally syndicated radio show, The Bobby Bones Show, and continues to raise awareness to her budding music career. In the past year alone, SaraBeth has opened for Brantley Gilbert, Craig Morgan, Aaron Watson, Randy Rogers Band, The Charlie Daniels Band, X Factor Winner Tate Stevens and many more. SaraBeth participated in the 23rd Annual City of Hope Celebrity Softball Game during CMA Fest alongside Florida Georgia Line, Scotty McCreery, Lauren Alaina and many other celebrated country acts and will be joining Lonestar on a tour that kicks off February 6th in Scottsdale, AZ, with dates on both the east and west coast.

In the late 1990s, he moved to Ottawa, where he developed a loyal following with a weekly show at the Manx Pub on Elgin St. In his live shows, he often uses looped live samples of his guitar and other instruments to create a richly layered solo performance. While at the Manx he often entertained with cover versions of songs by some of his favourite artists, including David Bowie, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, and the Rheostatics. At the same time, he began to amass an extensive repertoire of original tunes, and briefly joined local power-pop band Starling.\n\nAs a songwriter, he has released six albums, including an album devoted to covers David Bowie songs. His albums have often been recorded in a home-studio with him performing most, if not all, instruments. He is a talented guitarist who is universally lauded for his lyrics, having been compared to Elvis Costello and received accolades from renowned Canadian author Timothy Findley.\n\nIn 2004, Danny was nominated for Best New Artist at the Juno Awards following the release of his album \"Tales from the Invisible Man\" the previous year.

It\u2019s been that way since 2000, when they started fiddling together as pre-teens.\n\nThe sisters\u2019 past is as colorful and eventful as their future is bright.

With rigorous minimalism and maturity, chief songwriter Shaun Morgan \u2013 long one of rock\u2019s most unheralded melodists, has become a composer of deep emotion and clear-eyed vulnerability. The band too has developed into one of rock\u2019s most fearsome units, playing with precision, grit and authority, yet still light on their feet. After 15+ years of hardscrabble success, it\u2019s evident that Seether felt like survival was not enough. They had something to prove with this new album \u2013 somewhere farther to go.\n\nOne reason for the new approach must surely be Seether\u2019s close partnership with ace producer Brendan O\u2019Brien (Springsteen, Pearl Jam). More like a member of the band than a hired gun, O\u2019Brien repeatedly championed Morgan as one of music\u2019s most gifted songwriters and vocalists and Seether as one of rock\u2019s most extraordinary bands. His unrelenting faith in their talent and potential has been something of a North Star for Seether, helping them struggle through and outlast some very dark times.\n\nRecognizing that he needed to limit distractions, in early 2013 Morgan went about constructing a refuge in his New Hampshire home \u2013 a space where these new songs could develop and take shape. \u201cI actually built a room that I could write in,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI personally pulled out the carpet, put in wood flooring, decorated, and painted. After getting off the road, it was a process of preparation to get the environment just right. I made a place that I felt comfortable and creative in. I was able to be safe and isolated, concentrating on writing music instead of dealing with the distractions that come with daily life.\u201d\n\nLyrically, Morgan has never been afraid to look his demons in the eye. The people in these songs confront the truth with simmering rage; it\u2019s the fuel they need to make them feel alive. \u201cThe whole record is a collection of diary entries,\u201d Morgan revealed. \u201cIt\u2019s just where I\u2019m at and what I\u2019m going through. I\u2019m writing songs about getting through whatever situations I\u2019m in at the time. These songs deal with relationships and life situations.\u201d\n\nMorgan emerged with a collection of fleshed-out ideas that the musicians honed during rehearsals together in drummer John Humphrey\u2019s native Oklahoma. By the time they assembled with O\u2019Brien to record the album at Hollywood\u2019s Henson Studios in January 2014, their vision had clearly come into focus.\n\n\u201cIt felt so natural,\u201d explains Humphrey. \u201cWhen we get together, there\u2019s an indescribable chemistry. That\u2019s all over this album. The three of us can jam together and finish a song pretty quickly. We were really focused. These guys are my second family. We\u2019re tight musically and otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe band cut the entire album in sixteen days. The swift recording pace did not allow them to smother the tracks with overproduction, but rather gave the songs a chance to breathe. On working with O\u2019Brien, bassist Dale Stewart enthused, \u201cHe\u2019s like a fourth band member at this point. We understand each other. He likes to get in there and work quickly and he encourages us to be ourselves. We often followed our first instinct. That allowed us to capture the moment.\u201d\n\nThe album opener, \u201cSee You At The Bottom,\u201d quickly locks in with brutal force as Morgan\u2019s Beatles-meets-Nirvana wail comes screaming out of the speakers. From there, the album never lets up.\n\nGnashing riffs underpin another infectious chorus on the virulent first single, \u201cWords As Weapons.\u201d Morgan\u2019s remarkable ear for indelible melodies is truly the band\u2019s secret weapon. It\u2019s what makes Isolate and Medicate so damn listenable. Morgan makes unrelenting despair a fun listen.\n\n\u201cSame Damn Life\u201d \u2013 a boiling rejection of suburban sprawl juxtaposed against Morgan\u2019s surgery falsetto \u2013 is a pop metal surprise. \u201cI always felt like there was something there,\u201d Morgan said of the song. \u201cIt started from a riff and went into a vocal idea. I\u2019m a big fan of The Beatles. It\u2019s fun to do something with that pop element. Those are the songs that stick with you.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s centerpiece, \u201cCrash,\u201d is quite possibly the most beautiful song Seether has ever recorded. Gorgeous vocal lines and warm, fuzzed-out guitars cascading into pulsating wall-of-sound atmospherics mark an undeniable creative peak for the band. \u201cIt\u2019s different from what we\u2019ve done in the past and that excited all of us,\u201d Stewart says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t follow the stereotypical formula. It\u2019s pretty. It\u2019s heavy. It\u2019s emotional and deep.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for the band\u2019s fresh outlook is the strong support and enthusiasm they feel from new label partners The Bicycle Music Company/Concord Music Group. The brothers-in-arms feel was galvanized with their new team. \u201cIn one of our first meetings with the label, we played everybody five or six completed songs,\u201d Morgan remembers. \u201cThis marked the first time anybody outside of the band and Brendan listened to it. Afterwards, everybody was really excited and happy. Seeing the level of enthusiasm was great. That felt like the moment everything came together. It was a rebirth, in a sense.\u201d\n\nSeether has worked tirelessly to reach this point. The hard rocking outfit originally from Pretoria, South Africa has now released eight albums in all, two of which have gone Platinum and two more that are certified Gold along with a live concert DVD that has sold over 500,000 units \u2013 for total worldwide sales in excess of 4.5 million. The consistent hit makers have quietly amassed eleven #1 singles and seventeen Top 5 multi-format hits resulting in singles sales that top seven million \u2013 a level of success few artists working today can match. Seether has averaged 120 performances a year, crisscrossing the globe, emerging into headlining mainstays and featured performers on many of the world\u2019s biggest rock festivals.\n\nIsolate and Medicate will undoubtedly resonate deeply with the group\u2019s fiercely loyal fans. \u201cI hope everybody can feel this,\u201d concludes Humphrey. \u201cIt\u2019s a special album for us, and we put everything we had into it.\u201d\n\nMorgan completes the sentiment, \u201cI want them to walk away having enjoyed the music. I want them to get the same emotional sense and happiness we feel listening to it. It\u2019s so important and tied to memories we\u2019ve all had. When somebody listens, it\u2019ll hopefully make them feel good. They will know they\u2019re not alone.

That then led the way to a deal with Mercury Records allowing him to set up a context in which to work with his favourite singers and performers. The first release, Keep On Jumpin\u2019 on featured a vocal workout from super-divas Martha Wash and Jocelyn Brown, together for the first time ever. The song became a top 10 UK crossover pop hit and worldwide smash. Todd followed with the anthem \u2018Somethin Going On\u2019, a top 5 UK crossover pop hit.\n\nAll the while, Todd continued to break new ground as a Producer/Remixer. From SNAP to Annie Lennox to George Michael to Bjork, Todd\u2019s mixes bridge the ground between club cool and commercial accessibility. In 1995, his remix for Everything But The Girl\u2019s Missing became a worldwide smash, giving the British duo their first ever hit. He then rode the charts with mixes for Garbage (Stupid Girl), The Cardigans (Love Fool), Everything But The Girl (Wrong), 10,000 Maniacs (More Than This), Jamiroquai (Alright), The Cardigans (Been It), and The Lightning Seeds (You Showed Me),.among others.

Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music -

As a solo artist, Ken O\u2019Malley easily commands the room; with his band he also rocks the house. Quickly drawing the audience in, it is no wonder that the Irish News describes him \u201cwithout question, as the single most enduring, influential and proficient of all Irish musicians in Southern California\u201d and the University of St. Thomas at Houston acknowledges him to be \"widely regarded as the finest Irish folk singer/songwriter in the United States today.\"\n\nArriving in Los Angeles from Ireland over 30 years ago, Ken O\u2019Malley was immediately offered a spot at Molly Malone's, the legendary Irish venue in the city's Fairfax district, and he hasn't stopped playing since. Through the years, O'Malley has performed solo and as part of The Mulligans, Blended Spirits and, currently, The Twilight Lords. He's shared bills with such artists as Mary Black, The Chieftains, The Saw Doctors, Michael Flatley and Pierce Brosnan and continues to be an ever-popular and near legendary constant on Southern California's Celtic music circuit. In addition to his musical performances, he can also be found on stage and screen in productions ranging from Ray Bradbury\u2019s \u201cFalling Upward\u201d to the Paramount Pictures feature \u201cPatriot Games\u201d.\n\nIndeed, Ken O\u2019Malley was born to perform. In Dublin at the age of 15, he opened for legendary balladeer Paddy Reilly at the equally legendary Old Sheiling Pub. By the time he turned 18, he was gathering professional credits, among them a stint with Trudy's People, a group he formed that played Gaelic shows on RT\u00c9, Ireland's national radio and television network. His fluency in the Gaelic language was earned from his education by the Christian Brothers and his summers in the West of Ireland.\n\nA true ambassador of Irish culture, he infuses every performance with the rich history of his native land and audiences quickly become engaged with his compelling stories. One show producer put it this way: \u201cHe holds nothing back. Whether singing a passionate ballad, playing a solo on the mandolin, or explaining the gloriously sad history of Erin his homeland, Ken O\u2019Malley is all-in, wide open to the world, and as true as an arrow\u2019s flight.\u201d Another simply stated that \u201cKen O'Malley connected with our audience in a way none of our other artists have.\u201d", "otherInfo": "LIVE ONLINE PERFORMANCE -- TAKING YOUR REQUESTS!\nKen will present another live performance from his home on Sunday, May 24, at 2PM PDT (5PM EDT and 10PM Ireland and UK).\n\nNOW TAKING REQUESTS FOR YOUR FAVORITES!

Diana Trujillo as soon as they see her or listen to the sound of her voice. For the last five years Diana Trujillo has been touring around the United States as the lead singer of bay area Cumbia/ Fusion heavyweights, La Misa Negra. But on February 14th during a small break from LMN, Trujillo will be\nreleasing her first solo effort as Chika Di entitled \u201cBailala\u201d.\nInspired by traditional colombian music, pop and rock, at a very young age Diana could see herself performing for people around the world and envisioned music being her path without limitations. Chika Di has been living that dream and she is still just getting started.\n\nAs a singer / songwriter, she was eager to write new songs and wished to explore and mix sounds from Cumbia to EDM to Dance and Pop. Melody and rhythm would have to be the common thread for it to work and with \u201cBailala\u201d those wishes came true.\n\u201cBailala\u201d was produced and mixed by three time Grammy nominated producer /engineer Max Perry and mastered by John Greenham (Billie Eilish, Katy Perry). Trujillo and Max created a perfect balance of Pop, Latin and Dance and whether you understand Spanish or not, her melodies will just pull you in and make you want more.\n\u201cThe song is about not being afraid to let go and having fun...just move your body and don\u2019t trip off what people could think\u201d says the Colombian native. Lyrically the song was inspired by the people dancing in the streets of Medellin and just having fun.\nChika Di will be performing live this Spring in between dates with La Misa Negra. \u201cLa Misa Negra are my family and I am lucky to be able to grow with them and try new things. We all got something going on the side\u201d says Trujillo.\nChika Di\u2019s voice and energy are contagious and makes you just want to move and sing-along with her.

Combining Thomas\u2019s arranging ideas and skilled instrumental work with Andrija\u2019s studio full of vintage mics, tube amps, keyboards, and tape machines, the resulting record has a rich, buttery warmth well-suited to Miss Tess's voice and authentic, retro-contemporary songwriting style.\nAfter over a decade on the road, now making her home in Nashville \u2014 by way of Baltimore, Boston, and Brooklyn \u2014 Miss Tess has found a creative community that encourages and embraces wide artistic exploration and expression as much as she does.\n\n\u201cMiss Tess swings and swaggers, rooted in a retro groove that\u2019s equal parts blues, mid-century rock & roll and Booker T-worthy R&B.\u201d \u2013 Rolling Stone\n\n\u201cOld-time warmth, 21st-century sass.

The singer-songwriter rose to stardom on the country charts of the 1990s with such mega hits as Your Love Amazes Me, Standing on the Edge of Goodbye and She\u2019s Taken a Shine. His annual Christmas tour, entering its 23'rd year, brightens the holidays for thousands, as does his electrifying rendition of O\u2019 Holy Night.\n\nDuring the 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s, John placed 20 singles on the county charts, 6 of which went Top 5, with Your Love Amazes Me, scoring a #1 on the Billboard and Radio & Records Country Chart as well as Standing on the Edge of Goodbye and She\u2019s Taken a Shine earning the #1 slot in Radio & Records. He has earned multiple Gold and Platinum records over the years. John was nominated for the ACM Top New Male Vocalist in 1994, won a Grammy Award in 1996 for his participation in Amazing Grace: A Country Salute to Gospel Vol. 1, was nominated for another Grammy in 1995 for his smash hit Your Love Amazes Me and was nominated for the CMA Horizon Award and Top Male Vocalist Award in 1995. In 1997 he was nominated for Vocal Event of the Year (for Long Haired Country Boy with Charlie Daniels and Hal Ketchum) and in 2013 John was nominated for the Mainstream Country Male Artist by the ICM Awards. And thanks to the miracles of modern technology, he even sang a duet with the late, great Patsy Cline.\n\u201cI love what I do, with a passion not seen in quite some time. I\u2019m hopeful and excited about the future. I love singing and always will. I have a bus, an incredible stage presentation, a great band, hands-on management team and I\u2019m always all dressed up and ready to go.\u201d\nHe and his family moved back to Music City after several years in Georgia, and 2017 saw John pursuing a touring and personal appearance schedule that is more active than ever. Given his wide range of music and number of releases, John is fortunate in that he can book a solo show with just himself and guitar, a small-band acoustic show or a full-band engagement and has more than enough hit material to captivate a crowd and deliver an evening full of musical memories.\nJohn\u2019s enduringly powerful performances draw on a lifetime of making music and living life. Born in South Carolina and raised in Georgia, he began playing guitar at 13, performing shows at age 14 and making records at age 19. \u201cBy the time I was 17, I knew that music was what I wanted to do with my life\u201d; and he has done it well ever since.\nBetween 1979 and 1990 he recorded and marketed six albums on his own labels. The Graduation Song, which he wrote during his senior year in high school, became a perennial favorite at graduation ceremonies. It appeared on two of his early collections.\n\nThose early discs and John\u2019s strong regional popularity attracted attention on Music Row. Capitol Records signed him to his first major label contract in 1992. Berry\u2019s co-written hits A Mind of Her Own and Kiss Me in the Car introduced him to radio audiences in 1993. Then Your Love Amazes Me, What\u2019s in it for Me and You and Only You thrust him to stardom in 1994. Standing on the Edge of Goodbye, I Think About it all the Time, and If I Had Any Pride Left at All were all major hits the following year, with Standing on the Edge of Goodbye earning John the coveted 1995 Grammy nomination.\n\nBut it was his stunning performance of the title track of the 1995 CD O\u2019 Holy Night that led to his most enduring legacy to date. John began doing special Christmas tours that year and 2016 marks his 20th anniversary holiday concert tour. He has big plans to celebrate and involve the fans like never before for this anniversary celebration. He has also issued three more Christmas-music collections. If O\u2019 Holy Night is all that anyone remembers of me, that\u2019s fine with me,\u201d he comments about his perennial Christmas popularity. \u201cIt is a truly inspired piece of music.\u201d\n\nHappily, there were more successes to come. The hit Change My Mind earned John a Top-5 spot on the Country music charts in 1996. She\u2019s Taken a Shine became an even bigger hit in 1997. Both fans and the media took note again when There He Goes was released as a 1999 duet with Patsy Cline.\n\nIn 2002, Berry returned to making records for his own company, Clear Sky Records. Songs and Stories, a double CD was issued that year.\nIn 2003, John Berry released his I Give My Heart collection and its critically applauded wedding anthem Will You Marry Me. The disc also contained his versions of such classic love songs as Time in a Bottle, If, Love Look What You\u2019ve Done to Me, Faithfully, Lady and Let\u2019s Stay Together. I Give My Heart inspired still another popular concert series, The Love Tour.\n\nIn 2008, Those Were the Days, was released, marking John\u2019s return to mainstream country music. He created his first Christian-music CD in 2011. In 2012, John published the combination book and CD, again titled Songs and Stories. Over the years he has continued to tour steadily. \u201cWe just have a great group of fans who welcome us every year. They are always there.\u201d\n\nIn late 2015 John launched a crowd funded Kickstarter project that proved very successful. Overwhelmed by the fan response, John assembled an all-star studio team and cut both a Country album entitled What I Love the Most and a new album simply titled Christmas and released both in late 2016. Blessed with the ability to make the music he wanted to make (and not what a label dictated) allowed John the time to write and create what many music critics who have heard bits & pieces are saying could be his best, most complete project yet. \u201cI'm excited to have been able to release this new music and bring it to the fans through a new distribution agreement with Sony RED. It\u2019s a new time in the music business and technology allows me to be closer to my fans and interact in new ways. You know, God just keeps blessing me. There are new opportunities coming at every turn.\u201d\n\u201cWith time, I\u2019ve learned that the road to fulfillment is doing what I was called to do, love to do, and then doing it the best I can, regardless of the circumstances. And for me, that is making music and singing for people.\"\n\n2017 had John touring in several configurations (acoustic solo, acoustic trio and full band) as well as presenting his legendary Christmas Tour, marking its 21st year this year.\n\nAlso, in August of 2017 John launched a new, weekly internationally syndicated television show entitled Songs and Stories with John Berry that explored the songs and stories that changed the lives of his weekly guest. Superstar guests in Season 1 of the show include Billy Ray Cyrus, Billy Dean, Mo Pitney, Neal McCoy, Suzy Bogguss, Collin Raye, Craig Morgan, Mark Wills, Delbert McClinton, Clay Walker and Lee Roy Parnell.\n\nSongs and Stories with John Berry airs multiple times weekly to over 105 million homes across the United States as well as the UK and New Zealand on great networks like Heartland Television, The Family Channel, The Country Channel, ROKU, Phil Mack\u2019s Keep it Country (UK), Country TV (New Zealand) and Ride TV.\n\n2019 has John touring the country in all performance sectors along with a few surprises.\n\nStay tuned to all of his activities at www.johnberry.com", "otherInfo": "You're invited to tune in to the 11th installment in a series of very special Facebook Live events with John \"Papa Berr\" Berry at https://www.facebook.com/JohnBerryMusic https://www.facebook.com/OfficialRFDTV or https://www.facebook.com/centerstagemag this SUNDAY (5/24) at 6:00 pm CST (7:00 pm EST) for a program designed especially for the kids.

Bearing witness to small details and fleeting moments is what dignifies our everyday stories, rendering the mundane profound. This principle governs Erelli\u2019s approach to his craft, and is uniquely evident on his latest release, Mixtape, which features revelatory reinterpretations of songs by the Grateful Dead, Neko Case, Roy Orbison and others.\n\nErelli\u2019s two decade career highlights include 11 solo albums, stints accompanying Josh Ritter, Paula Cole and Anais Mitchell, and a pair of records he produced for GRAMMY-winning songwriter Lori McKenna. Ever since Billboard magazine heralded the \u201csimple, atmospheric grace\u201d of his Signature Sounds debut, Erelli\u2019s belief in the sacredness of an examined life has driven him between the ostensible extremes of lullabies and murder ballads, western swing and protest anthems. It has propelled him from the hallowed stages of the Newport Folk Festival, Grand Ole Opry and Royal Albert Hall, and beckoned him back home, to better nurture his 16-year marriage and be a father to his two young boys.\n\nWhether he\u2019s holding a pen or a Telecaster, Erelli\u2019s music welcomes even the casual listener, but those who choose to dig more deeply are richly rewarded. Perhaps that is what Folk Alley hears in Erelli\u2019s songs, when it encourages people to \u201clisten close; there's sure to be something in there to break your heart a split second before it leads you straight to grace.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Chris Pinnella ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10387565.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-24", "Genre": "Classical Crossover, Classical, Adult Contemporary, Jazz, Vocal", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ask any vocal artist you happen to see, and they will tell you it takes a certain kind of guts and gumption to step out in front of the freight train that is a symphony orchestra or sizable jazz organization -- to take the helm of a precision music machine whose hundreds of man hours of rehearsal and preparation now hinge upon that solitary figure at center stage. Sounds pretty scary -- but for Chris Pinnella it's the stuff of natural habitat; an environment that the versatile vocalist has thrived in, whether performing with symphony orchestras around the country, leading his own combos of anywhere from 8 to 15 players, or (for several tours of North America and Europe) lending his finely honed skills to the prog-rock / crossover locomotive known as the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. That association with the late Paul O'Neil's spectacularly scaled project netted the New Jersey native a platinum record for his contributions to 'The Lost Christmas Eve' tour, and a chance to perform for an audience of over 1 million people, during a particularly raucous New Year's Eve in Berlin.\n\nIn the process the seasoned young performer - a singer whose influences run from the epic arias of Pavarotti, to the elegant jazz phrasings of Tony Bennett and the next generation concert hall mastery of Bocelli and Groban - built his brand as a bandleader through gigs at venues that range from big city nightspots to theatres across the United States such as The Algonquin Arts Theatre in New Jersey as well as Axelrod PAC, The Great Auditorium, The Pollack Theatre, Rahway PAC, The Newton Theatre, House of Independents, The Grunin Center for the Arts, McLoone's Supper Club and numerous Luxury Private, Charity, Fundraising Galas and Events throughout the country. He has also played such prestigious NYC venues as Birdland, The Rainbow Room, The Explorers Club, The Rose Theatre at Jazz! At Lincoln Center, The Cutting Room, and Feinstein's / 54 Below. Recently, Pinnella was tapped by American Young Voices, singing with the group as one of their guests vocalists alongside massive student choirs ranging from 3000-8000 young singers touring major arenas, including a sold out evening at The Prudential Center in Newark, NJ.\n\nPinnella began his career professionally at the age of 16 after an audition for Maestro Fr. Alphonse Stephenson & the Orchestra of St. Peter performing with the orchestra on and off throughout his career. Chris went on to pursue music and received his degree from Marymount Manhattan College in NYC. Post college he worked off-Broadway and regional theatre and had the opportunity to portray the title role of Simeon in the New Musical 'Simeon's Gift' which was co-written by icon Julie Andrews and her daughter Emma Walton-Hamilton. Pinnella spent a month with Ms. Andrews and the 6-person cast at Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, NY working side by side until the shows premiere. Pinnella also worked alongside Emmy, Oscar winning arranger Ian Fraser and the Tony nominated John Bucchino and Tony nominated director Marcia Milgrom Dodge (B'Way's Ragtime) on the project.\n\nCurrently Chris is working on writing and arranging his debut EP which is set to drop in 2020. The 11-track debut will feature mostly original material as well as a re-worked covers, namely Pinnella's always requested version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' will be given an overhaul complete with gospel choir and full orchestra. Infusing elements of jazz, classical, alternative, rock, and pop, Pinnella has his sights set on making 2020 his best year yet.\n\n\"Pinnella has been compared to vocal superstars Josh Groban and Michael Buble, but there is no doubt about the fact that Pinnella has a style that is completely his own. Every time he takes the stage he proves that he's one of the strongest forces in the classical crossover realm.

He first began performing with a gospel quartet while still attending high school in the nearby town of Sarepta. He continued to sing gospel throughout his years at Louisiana Tech University, where he studied petroleum technology. After working on an oil rig for a few years after leaving school, he embarked on what he calls his \"true musical education\" -- playing one honky-tonk after another. While singing at Tillie's & Lucy's Pub in Nashville, Adkins was spotted by a Capitol Records executive and was signed to the label.\n\nHis early singles steadily climbed the charts, and 1997's \"(This Ain't) No Thinkin' Thing\" became his first No. 1 hit. After enduring a label shake-up at Capitol in the late 1990s, the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Adkins resurfaced with the Top 10 hits \"More\" in 2000, \"I'm Tryin'\" in 2001 and \"Chrome\" in 2003.\n\nHe released his Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 in 2003, a few months before being inducted into the Grand Ole Opry. He also checked himself into a rehabilitation center for a drinking problem and concluded the year by releasing the studio album Comin' On Strong.\n\nIn 2005, Adkins landed a surprise smash hit with \"Honky Tonk Badonkadonk\" from his album Songs About Me, which sold nearly two million copies as a result. Dangerous Man was released in 2006.\n\n(biography is taken from http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/adkins_trace/bio.jhtml)", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/national-memorial-day-concert/home"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Max Gomez ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8091014.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Folk/Rock/Acoustic, Singersongwriter/Americana Noir, love folk, Protest Songs, Blues & Country., Original Americana Roots Music, Folk, Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Max? ?Gomez? ?has? ?always? ?had? ?the? ?heart? ?of? ?an? ?old? ?soul.? ?As? ?a? ?child, the? ?first? ?songs? ?he? ?learned? ?to? ?sing? ?were? ?originally? ?recorded? ?in? ?the? ?50s? ?by? ?Johnny? ?Cash.? ?As? ?a teenage? ?guitarist? ?he? ?adopted? ?Big? ?Bill? ?Broonzy? ?as? ?his? ?blues? ?master.? ?And? ?as? ?a? ?budding? ?performer, he? ?apprenticed? ?in? ?the? ?rarefied? ?musical? ?climate? ?of? ?northern? ?New? ?Mexico,? ?where? ?troubadours? ?like Michael? ?Martin? ?Murphey? ?and? ?Ray? ?Wylie? ?Hubbard? ?helped? ?foster? ?a? ?folk?? ??and? ?Western? ?sound? ?both cosmic? ?and? ?cowboy.? ?You\u2019ll? ?find? ?his? ?hometown? ?of? ?Taos? ?and? ?nearby? ?Red? ?River? ?right? ?there? ?between Colorado? ?and? ?Texas? ?on? ?both? ?your? ?sonic? ?and? ?Google? ?maps.? ?Splitting? ?his? ?childhood? ?between? ?there and? ?a? ?farm? ?in? ?the? ?Flint? ?Hills? ?of? ?Kansas,? ?Gomez? ?is? ?at? ?home? ?in? ?the? ?heartland,? ?too.\n\nThe? ?youngest? ?of? ?five? ?brothers,? ?by? ?several? ?years\u2014\u201cThat\u2019s? ?why? ?I? ?got? ?into? ?\u2018old\u2019? ?music\u201d\u2014Gomez? ?got a? ?children\u2019s? ?guitar? ?for? ?Christmas? ?when? ?he? ?was? ?10.? ?The? ?family? ?moved? ?from? ?Santa? ?Fe? ?to? ?Taos? ?in the? ?\u201980s,? ?and? ?his? ?father,? ?Steve,? ?became? ?a? ?furniture? ?craftsman.? ?\u201cThere\u2019s? ?a? ?similarity? ?between? ?my dad\u2019s? ?work? ?and? ?mine,\u201d? ?says? ?Gomez.? ?\u201cHe? ?really? ?studied? ?what? ?he? ?did;? ?there? ?were? ?always? ?a? ?lot? ?of books? ?on? ?old? ?furniture? ?in? ?his? ?studio.\u201d\n\nGomez? ?reports? ?that? ?growing? ?up? ?in? ?Taos? ?was? ?\u201cwild.? ?It\u2019s? ?still? ?the? ?Wild? ?West? ?compared? ?to? ?any? ?city? ?or suburb.? ?You? ?can? ?get? ?away? ?with? ?just? ?about? ?anything? ?there,? ?and? ?we? ?were? ?turned? ?loose? ?as? ?kids.\u201d\n\nAt? ?14,? ?when? ?Gomez? ?performed? ?at? ?a? ?benefit? ?concert,? ?he? ?played? ?\u201cSunday? ?Mornin\u2019? ?Coming Down\u201d\u2014the? ?down-and-out? ?classic? ?by? ?future? ?labelmate? ?Kris? ?Kristofferson.? ?Soon? ?thereafter? ?he? ?was playing? ?at? ?a? ?late,? ?lamented? ?institution? ?of? ?a? ?venue? ?called? ?the? ?Old? ?Blinking? ?Light.? ?\u201cThe? ?school? ?I? ?went to? ?was? ?playing? ?in? ?that? ?bar,\u201d? ?he? ?says.? ?? ?Country? ?greats? ?like? ?Mentor? ?Williams? ?and? ?Lynn? ?Anderson frequented? ?the? ?place? ?that? ?led? ?them? ?to? ?become? ?fans? ?of? ?his? ?music.\n\nGomez? ?moved? ?to? ?Los? ?Angeles? ?at? ?18? ?to? ?pursue? ?his? ?music? ?career? ?and? ?began? ?writing? ?songs? ?and performing? ?around? ?the? ?city? ?at? ?many? ?notable? ?clubs.? ?He? ?wrote? ?some? ?songs? ?with? ?Shawn? ?Mullins, who? ?later? ?recorded? ?them.? ?\u201cThat\u2019s? ?when? ?I? ?began? ?taking? ?it? ?all? ?a? ?little? ?more? ?seriously? ?and? ?turned? ?my music? ?into? ?a? ?job,\u201d? ?says? ?Gomez.\n\nIn? ?his? ?early? ?twenties? ?he? ?began? ?recording? ?his? ?own? ?songs? ?with? ?producers? ?in? ?? ?New? ?York,? ?L.A.,? ?and Nashville.? ?His? ?debut? ?album,? ??Rule? ?the? ?World?,? ?was? ?released? ?in? ?2013? ?by? ?New? ?West? ?Records,? ?home to? ?the? ?likes? ?of? ?John? ?Hiatt,? ?Buddy? ?Miller,? ?and? ?Steve? ?Earle.? ?Soon? ?after,? ?Kiefer? ?Sutherland? ?directed the? ?music? ?video? ?for? ?the? ?single? ?\u201cRun? ?From? ?You.\u201d\n\nGomez? ?grew? ?up? ?in? ?a? ?rich? ?musical? ?environment,? ?but? ?represents? ?more? ?than? ?the? ?sum? ?of? ?his influences\u2014he\u2019s? ?got? ?that? ?ineffable? ?and? ?instantly? ?recognizable? ?x-factor? ?called? ?talent.? ?Melodies that? ?flow? ?naturally.? ?Trenchant? ?lyrics? ?that? ?express? ?wise-beyond-his-years? ?observations? ?on? ?the ways? ?of? ?the? ?heart.? ?Laconic? ?phrasing? ?in? ?a? ?cafe? ?mocha? ?timbre,? ?and? ?guitar? ?skills? ?that? ?can? ?stand alone.? ?In? ?short:? ?the? ?whole? ?package.\n\nJudging? ?by? ?the? ?company? ?he? ?keeps,? ?Gomez? ?is? ?there? ?positioned? ?to? ?emerge? ?as? ?a? ?prominent? ?voice of? ?Americana\u2019s? ?next? ?generation.? ?Since? ?the? ?release? ?of? ?his? ?debut? ?album,?

She was outspoken in her disapproval of the Vietnam war and later the CIA-backed coups in many Latin American countries.\n\nShe was also instrumental in the Civil Rights movement, marching with Dr. Martin Luther King on many occassions and being jailed for her beliefs. In 1963, her performance of \"We Shall Overcome\" at the Lincoln Memorial just prior to Dr. King's famous \"I Have A Dream...\" speech helped turn the song into a Civil Rights anthem.\n\nIn December 1972, she traveled to Hanoi, North Vietnam, and was caught in that country's \"Christmas Campaign,\" in which the U.S. bombed the city more times than any other during the entire war. While pregnant with her only son, Gabriel, she performed a handful of songs in the middle of the night on day one of the 1969 Woodstock festival.

Now he lives in Chicago where he performs for crowds large and small, singing intimate songs that tell stories about how this world has broken his heart, and also tell about the hope, love, and mystery that he's found among the pieces.\n\n~Matt Lang", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Four Tet ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8656726.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Four Tet is the name used by Kieran Hebden (born 1977 in Putney, London, UK) for his experimental electronic music-oriented solo efforts, to differentiate from his work with post-rock band Fridge.\n\nHebden's solo work typically utilises samples lifted from various sources including hip-hop, electronica, techno, jazz, and folk mixed with his own guitar playing. Four Tet shares some stylistic similarities with other musicians, such as Prefuse 73, who use computer editing techniques that give the music a staccato, cut-up feel. Hebden's music is notable for its rich, organic sounds and harmonious melodies as well as for eschewing the traditional pop-song format in favour of a more abstract approach.\n\nKieran Hebden began releasing material as Four Tet in 1998 with the 36 minute and 25 second single \"Thirtysixtwentyfive\" on Trevor Jackson's Output Recordings label. Later that year, he released a second single, the jazz-influenced \"Misnomer\". 1999's \"Dialogue\", again on Output, was Four Tet's first full-length album release and fused hip-hop drum lines with dissonant jazz samples. This was followed by the double A-side single \"Glasshead\"/\"Calamine\", which was to be Four Tet's last release on Output.\n\nIn late 1999, Warp Records released a tenth-anniversary compilation of remixes of Warp tracks; Hebden contributed a remix of \"Cliffs\", the opening track of Aphex Twin's \"Selected Ambient Works, Vol. II\". This relatively high profile exposure attracted a lot of new interest in Four Tet from fans of electronica and IDM, genres in which the Warp brand had a preeminent status.\n\nIn 2001, Four Tet's second album \"Pause\" was released on Domino and found Hebden using more folk and electronic samples, which was quickly dubbed \"folktronica\" by the media & press in an attempt to label the style (often also applied to artists such as ISAN, Gravenhurst and some of Canabrism's later work). The acoustic guitar track \"Everything Is Alright\" is the theme music for the National Public Radio talk show On Point, produced at WBUR in Boston, Massachusetts; it was also featured in a US Nike commercial in 2001-2002 and in the Sony Bravia commercial in 2005.\n\n\"Rounds\" was released in May 2003. It was Hebden's most ambitious album to date, incorporating diverse samples such as the mandolin on \"Spirit Fingers\", and even a rubber duck on the closing track \"Slow Jam\". Three singles were released from the album: \"She Moves She\", \"As Serious as Your Life\", and \"My Angel Rocks Back and Forth\". This last single was released as an EP featuring remixes by electronica duo Icarus and Isambard Khroustaliov along with additional Four Tet tracks \"I've Got Viking in Me\" and \"All the Chimers\". An accompanying DVD featured all of Four Tet's videos to date.\n\nAt the beginning of 2003, Four Tet opened for Radiohead on their European tour. A remix of the song Scatterbrain from Radiohead's latest album \"Hail to the Thief\" was included on their 2004 EP \"COM LAG (2plus2isfive)\".\n\nA live album named \"Live in Copenhagen 30th March 2004\" was released in April 2004 as a limited edition, available only through the Domino Records website.\n\nIn March and April of 2005, Four Tet performed two shows of improvisational music, in collaboration with jazz drummer Steve Reid, in Paris and London. He also appears on Steve Reid Ensemble 2005 album \"Spirit Walk\". This collaboration was extended into a series of international tours, and the release of two albums, \"The Exchange Session Vol. 1\" and \"The Exchange Session Vol. 2\" over the course of 2005 and 2006.\n\nHis fourth studio album \"Everything Ecstatic\" was released on Domino on 23 May 2005. The video for the lead single, \"Smile Around the Face\", features actor Mark Heap. The album brought with it another shift in style, leaving behind the breezy \"folktronica\" of \"Pause\" and \"Rounds\" for a darker, more complex sound. On 7 November 2005, Domino has released a DVD version of \"Everything Ecstatic\" featuring video clips for each track of the album plus a CD with new material.\n\nHebden has also remixed, under the Four Tet name, tracks by a wide range of artists including Madvillain, Bloc Party, Super Furry Animals, Beth Orton, Badly Drawn Boy, The Notwist, Boom Bip, Kings of Convenience, Explosions in the Sky, Radiohead, and Doves.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Justin Trawick ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7196522.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Justin Trawick and The Common Good\u2019s debut record, \u201cThe Riverwash EP\u201d, exemplifies the raw emotional live sound Trawick and the band have cultivated over the years playing in clubs and festivals up and down the East Coast.

His first step into the national spotlight came in 1991 when he became a founding member of the Aquarium Rescue Unit featuring Col. Bruce Hampton, a cult classic that has stood the test of time. That led to his membership in the classic rock group The Allman Brothers Band. Since 1997, his work with the band has earned him two Grammy nominations for best rock instrumental, in 2003 and in 2004. Over the years, Oteil has shared the stage with rock and blues legends such as Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, Levon Helm, Taj Mahal, Buddy Guy, Pinetop Perkins, Hubert Sumlin, Billy Gibbons, Chuck Leavell, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Johnny Winter, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow and Trey Anastasio. In 2012, Oteil received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award for his 17 year contribution to the Allman Brothers Band as the longest running bassist in the band\u2019s history.\n\nWhile touring and recording with the Allman Brothers over the years, Oteil still found time to collaborate with many other musicians. He formed his solo group, Oteil and the Peacemakers in 1998. From 1998 until 2007, the group toured extensively and released three albums. In 2001, Oteil joined Phish\u2019s keyboardist Page McConnell and The Funky Meters\u2019 drummer Russell Batiste to form Vida Blue. He also founded an improv based trio with Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann and Max Creek guitarist Scott Murawski in 2008.\n\nOteil reunited on stage with his brother Kofi after ten years of touring separately when Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi formed the Tedeschi Trucks Band in late 2010, featuring the Burbridge brothers in the rhythm section. The 11-piece super group released their first record, Revelator, in 2011 which won a Grammy in February 2012. The Tedeschi Trucks Band played Eric Clapton\u2019s iconic Crossroads Guitar Festival in 2011. Oteil\u2019s original composition \u201cLove Has Something Else to Say\u201d was including in the DVD release and on their Grammy-winning debut album. The Tedeschi Trucks Band released their second album (and first live album) in 2012, titled \u201cEverybody\u2019s Talkin\u201d.\n\nOver the years, Oteil has also recorded and shared the stage with jazz and jazz-rock fusion legends Herbie Hancock, Roy Haynes, Randy Brecker, John Scofield, Jerry Goodman, Bob Moses, Lenny White, Steve Smith, Bela Fleck, Jimmy Herring, Howard Levi, Victor Wooten and Branford Marsalis.\n\nGrateful Dead members Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart joined forces with John Mayer in 2015 to form \u201cDead & Company\u201d with Burbridge on bass and Jeff Chimenti on keys. The band toured the US in the fall of 2015 and the summer of 2016 and 2017. These tours included sold-out shows at Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Citi Field and a headlining spot at Bonnaroo Music Festival.

Formed several years ago by twins Roger and Logan Raskin, the union originally began as a mere writing project for producer Greg Ladany. But after several demos were cut and the brothers realized they were on to something, it became a permanent proposition, and the Raskins were born.\n\nAnd while seemingly the majority of today's chart toppers are sonically one-dimensional, the Raskins are a throwback to the days of when bands weren't as confined stylistically. Case in point, the bros list such wide-ranging artists as Kiss, the Buzzcocks, Jim Croce, the Temptations, Mel Torme, and Jane's Addiction as influences. As a result, the \"rock/retro/alternative/pop-rock/singer-songwriter\" tag that the Raskins like to go by is indeed well fitting.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding, and fans will be able to experience the Raskins on a pair of nearby speakers soon, as the duo's self-titled debut album was just released, while the leadoff single, \"We Had It All,\" dropped during their Spring tour with Scot Weiland. Songs such as \"We Had It All,\" \"Need Another Hero,\" and \"The Radio Song\" show the retro rock side of the band, while songs like \"Open Our Eyes,\" \"Reach,\" and \"Where Do We Go From Here\" show the diversity of the band's songwriting with acoustic type pop rock ballads.\n\n\"The first radio single and video we decided to go with was 'We Had It All',\" explains Roger. \"This song definitely shows a sound of the band which is most consistent with our biggest rock influences as well as the song being written with a specific topic in mind.\" And according to Logan, a follow-up single has already been selected. \"The second single will be 'The Radio Song,' which is a simple story written about a group of guys grinding with their band on the road - this being us - then all of a sudden, they hear their song on the radio for the first time and how that suddenly changes everything for them, mostly emotionally. We always wanted to write a song about that - most musicians can relate as well as most fans understanding that crucial emotion every musician yearns for.\"\n\nAs for the Raskins' plans once the album is released, it is a simple one, according to Roger. \"Clearly the future plans for the Raskins is to tour as much as possible, and bring our music to every city in the US, as well as all the local radio stations, doing promotional giveaways, rock shows, and signings for all our fans. We want to show the public that we our very accessible. Also eventually heading over to Europe to give our expanded fan base the opportunity to experience the Raskins live. The Europeans love them some rock n roll. Can't wait to share our music with all of them!\"\n\nLastly, Logan unveils that both the music and the bond of brotherhood will prevail for the Raskins. \"We work and strive extremely hard for success with our music. Through all the ups and downs, the trials and tribulations, the acceptances and denials. We always have each other. That is the main focus of the Raskins. We are doing music because we love it and it's our passion. For us we feel we have already had major success because we are doing what we love most in the world to do - write and perform our music for the world to see.\"Thus helping set the standard for the Raskins and continuing on this wonderful musical journey and allowing the world to enjoy all our music.\nWe love you all\n\nFor further information go to www.TheRaskins.com", "otherInfo": "Join The Raskins live online Sunday May24th 6pm PT 9pm ET for their long awaited acoustic performance.

The girls have always viewed the formation of the band as an act of fate; Each sister picked up their respective instruments and found their love of music at different stages in their lives.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "California Women\u2019s Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10287848.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "June Core Artist Page ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CantStopTheBlues"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Spafford ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8432574.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Psychedelic Rock, Rock, Electro Funk Therapy", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Composed of Brian Moss (guitar), Jordan Fairless (bass), Andrew \u201cRed\u201d Johnson (keys), and Cameron Laforest (drums), Spafford\u2019s patented \u201celectrofunk therapy\u201d has a little bit of something for everyone, offering tastes of rock, funk, electronic, bluegrass, gospel, and more.

The lyric is one that best encapsulates the front woman\u2019s bravado and fearlessness which dominates Deep Sea Diver\u2019s forthcoming sophomore LP, Secrets\u2014Out February 19th on their own High Beam records. In their desire to explore dualities, Deep Sea Diver urgently and deliberately move you from rock experimentation to dreamy soundscapes, Kraut-esque drum and bass grooves to angular danci-ness, and full fledged orchestration to bare bones simplicity. Dobson has the voice and authority to tie it all together, and turn it into a cohesive unit that soars yet remains beautifully delicate and intimate. Live, the band has received acclaim for their festival-ready power and presence, Jessica\u2019s larger than life guitar hooks, and their cascading layers that build upon each other until they reach their explosive peak.\n\nIn late 2013, Dobson put in her notice to former Shins boss, James Mercer, in order to give full attention to her own musical vision. Mercer agreed, saying \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, but I give you my full support. You\u2019ve gotta pursue Deep Sea Diver\u201d. While much was gleaned from the experiences in her many years spent playing with top tier musical outfits (Beck, the Shins, Spoon, Yeah Yeah Yeahs,) something was brewing that demanded a sort of dedication and alertness that couldn\u2019t be fully engaged while moonlighting as a side-woman for those greats. \u201cGood thing too,\" noted Stereogum, \"because Jessica is an incredible front woman.\u201d\n\nRecorded with Darrell Thorpe (Radiohead, Beck) and Luke Vanderpol at the Bank in CA, Jessica and band (comprised of husband Peter Mansen on drums, Garrett Gue on bass, and Elliot Jackson on guitar and synth) have together created an album that is colorful, energetic, and varied\u2014with an emotional depth and pulsating charge that demands the listeners full attention.

Love is an art,\" sings Vanessa Carlton on the title track of her sixth album, Love Is An Art. Like the record itself, the song is a meditation on the eternal seesaw that is human connection: the push, the pull, the balance, the bottoming out. It's that constantly evolving nature of love, expectations and compassion that Carlton analyzes from all angles on Love Is An Art, from romantic, to parental, to the friends that hold us up and the leaders that repeatedly let us down. And on tracks like the album's opener, \"I Can't Stay the Same,\" that also includes the relationship with the person staring back at us in the mirror, each and every morning.\n\n\"Love is the energy you put out into the world,\" says the Nashville-based Carlton, who was inspired in part by the 1956 book The Art of Loving by philosopher Erich Fromm, and by stories and struggles both in her interior world and the world around her. \"And it can be so incredibly messy at times.\"\n\nProduced by Dave Fridmann (MGMT, Flaming Lips), Love Is An Art finds Carlton reckoning with toxic relationships (the confessional \"Miner's Canary\"), eternal partnership (\"Companion Star\") and the children who fill the world with love and grace while politicians fill their pockets (the passionate \"Die, Dinosaur,\" written after the shootings in Parkland, Florida). And true to Carlton\u2019s skill as both a lyricist and an instrumentalist, the arrangements on Love Is An Art tell these tales as vibrantly as the words themselves: piano parts that speak of rage and tenderness, synths that burst and glow like dawn.\n\nLove Is An Art doesn't just explore connections \u2013 it was also born of one. Carlton wrote the album with the acclaimed Nashville-based singer-songwriter Tristen, camped out and working while her daughter napped. \"This record is about being out of my comfort zone,\" says Carlton. \"What's going to happen when we do things that people assume are not naturally a match, like working with Dave Fridmann? I loved the idea of working with someone who\u2019s known for a palette that isn\u2019t associated with me, but it was a fit the second we started working together. Or what could happen when I sit with another writer, and just collaborate?\"\n\nThe result is an extremely dynamic LP filled with sticky melodies and haunting phrases as well as experimental constructions: super high highs, super low lows, and song structures that break the mold from the expected. Unlike her previous, critically-acclaimed 2015 album Liberman, which Carlton describes as having a calming, almost meditative palette, Love Is An Art reads, and sounds, \"red.\" Huge. Passionate. The color of a beating heart.\n\n\"I want to run, but I won\u2019t get very far,\" Carlton sings on \"The Only Way to Love,\" the album's first official single. \"Cause I can\u2019t fight the force of my young beating heart. Like a soldier's steady march, answering the call. It\u2019s the only way to love.\" It's a song about loving with everything you've got \u2013 that love itself is precious and rare enough to commit to, above all. \"When you believe in a relationship, in a connection, you are actually believing in yourself,\" she adds.\nCarlton has constantly challenged that belief, in both herself and the expectations that surround her throughout her lengthy, accomplished career: she attended both the School of American Ballet and Columbia University, and was discovered as a singer-songwriter/pianist when a cassette tape demo was given to legendary music impresario Ahmet Ertegun. With her debut single \"A Thousand Miles,\" Carlton soared to the top of the Billboard charts and garnered multiple Grammy nominations, though that song is only a small fraction of the body of work and artistic identity she's developed since then, ever evolving and growing as a performer and songwriter. In the summer of 2019, she pushed that even further, making her Broadway debut as Carole King in Beautiful: The Carole King Musical.\n\nThere's a striking image on the cover of Love Is An Art: it's a delicate hand grabbing a tiger by the tail, but it's not meant to conjure the familiar colloquialism. Instead, it captures something different. It\u2019s a about going after something bigger than you, more powerful than you, something that you\u2019ll never be able to really control: but you grab it anyway. Something like love. That's the spirit of Love Is An Art \u2013 connections aren\u2019t easy to make, and sometimes we fail. But it's always worth trying. As Carlton sings on \"Die, Dinosaur,\" the hope comes when there's nothing left to lose.\n\n\"Why not grab the wild animal?\" Carlton asks. \"And see what happens?\"", "otherInfo": "Tune in to TheMcCarltons station"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Robin Jackson and the Caravan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10382962.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-25", "Genre": "Indie Pop, Indie Folk, Alternative", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Award winning Singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Robin Jackson, known for his wild, theatrical contributions to bands like Vagabond Opera and the March Fourth Marching Band, has brought a strong presence to the world of indie folk.

But Claude has also influenced the very fabric of the dance community, A&Ring an impeccable roster of acts like Justin Martin, Fisher, Shiba San, Catz n Dogz, Riva Starr, Tim Green, Breach, Eats Everything, Walker & Royce, Shadow Child, and countless others.

Often a festival headliner, his patient, provocative journeys - for both sunrise and sunset - have become the stuff of legend the world over from Lightning in a Bottle to Boom to Shambhala to his seven consecutive Costa Rican sunrises at Envision Festival.

Abandoned drinks rest on the lip of the dj booth while joints get sparked in the corners.\n\nThe tiny room is packed. Nobody quite knows how to describe the music yet.

Hooks and DC are about to have an epiphany that will change everything. They thirst for something new. They want to make people move to their sounds and not just bob their heads, but to grind, heave, shiver, stomp, and dance to their music.

From the roots of acoustic music to amped up rock n\u2019 roll and into the electronic revolution, the options available to the modern musician are more like a scientific lab, then the campfire jam from where it all started. From the controls of a tiny laptop, a performer now has the power to mix, change and loop sounds in a concert setting with great ease. This modern twist of technology is bringing a new level of music to the electronic dance party.\n\nWhile the genre of live electronica is relatively new on the music circuit, nobody is breaking the boundaries of live producing and improvisation like EOTO. Fusing elements of live instrumentation, house music, dubstep and electro into their dance ready sound, the band will be taking the country by storm beginning in late September for their perennial fall tour, performing 33 consecutive nights in a row.\n\nConsisting of Michael Travis and Jason Hann the duo mixes the organic sounds of live drums, bass and guitar through a variety of programs and gadgets to create a style of music that is more likely found in a dance club, then a live music theater. What sets EOTO apart from other artists in this emerging genre is how the music is created. While some artists may spend hours pre-mixing samples and elements of music for their live show, EOTO uses nothing pre-recorded, giving them the ability to approach each song with on-the-spot spontaneity and 100% live improvisation.\n\nBecause of the ever-changing sound and style of music, it\u2019s hard to describe a band like EOTO. In a recent discussion on the bands highly active Facebook page, the thousands of subscribed fans were asked to describe the band in their own words \u2013 descriptions ranged from mythical to visual, each in awe of the duo\u2019s ability to create high octane dance music in a live setting. A trait that has fans old and new catching multiple shows on a tour and packing venues wherever they play. Or maybe EOTO is selling out venues around the coast for the spirit of dance music they bring in general.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the members of EOTO have performed with a range of musicians second to none.

Dear and Ghostly International founder Sam Valenti IV met while the two were attending the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. In 1999, Dear collaborated with ghettotech pioneer Daisha on Ghostly's inaugural 12\", \"Hands Up for Detroit.\" In 2001 he released \"Irreparably Dented,\" his debut 12\" on Ghostly International's more dancefloor-oriented Spectral Sound subsidiary. The \"Stealing Moves\" 12\" followed in 2002. That same year, Dear signed a deal with legendary Canadian techno producer Richie Hawtin's influential Plus 8 label, where he released three 12\" singles as False. In 2003, he released the \"Girlfriend\" 12\" on Berlin's Perlon as Jabberjaw. Two more releases on Spectral Sound under his own name followed later that year, \"EP1\" and \"EP2.\" In late 2003, he issued his debut full-length on Spectral, \"Leave Luck To Heaven,\" to wide acclaim. The \"Backstroke\" EP followed in 2004. Dear's 2007 full-length, \"Asa Breed,\" found him working with a more song-based and pop-inclined sound.\n\nDear has also released several works through Spectral as his dirty-minded hard-techno alter ego, Audion. The \"Kisses\" EP was his first release under the Audion moniker in 2004; two more EPs, 2004's \"The Pong\" and 2005's \"Just Fucking\" followed. Songs collected from these EPs and new material appeared on Audion's debut full-length, \"Suckfish\" in October 2005. Audion produced a mix for the well-regarded FABRIC series in 2006; later that year he collaborated with Berliner Ellen Allien on a split single.", "otherInfo": "Join us for Movement At Home \u2013 a virtual edition of Movement Music Festival, taking place Memorial Day weekend, May 23-25 in partnership with Beatport.

Since forming in 2012, they\u2019ve toured internationally 10+ months of the year.\n\nTheir brand of rock and roll poetry can be a little hard to categorize, for people that insist on categorizing... their voices are undoubtedly the centerpiece - Nero's fractured country soul croon is wrapped in Russell's silver and gold tones for a harmony blend that is like nothing else in music today. Fired by the band it\u2019s a full tilt revival - streamlined poems, deep grooves, sharp hooks and joyful singing straight from the gut.\n\nBirds of Chicago\u2019s self-titled debut album, released at the beginning of 2013, was a critics' darling \u2013 with glowing praise rolling in from both sides of the Atlantic for Nero and Russell's evocative poetry and simmering vocals. The decision to put their respective bands (JT\u2019s \u201cJT & The Clouds\u201d & Allison's \"Po' Girl\") on hiatus and tour together was a pivotal move, applauded by their fans, and growing numbers of new listeners.\n\nAfter a year of hard touring, and much buzzed about appearances at summer festivals (Strawberry, High Sierra, Kerrville, Hillside, Delfest, Vancouver Island among others) the band decided to record a live album in front of their hometown fans. The result \"Live from Space,\" released January 2014, captures this rising band in absolute top form. By turns raw, raucous, whispered and hushed, it revealed the bands full dynamic range. Americana UK says, \"'Live From SPACE\u2019 leaves no genre unaccounted for, no touchstone unturned. A Cappella spiritual, soul, acoustic balladry, driving country rock - it\u2019s all there.

As the son of Irish singing sensation Dominic Kirwan, it comes as no surprise that Barry had showbiz aspirations from a very early age. Growing up, Barry was a committed member of his school\u2019s choir and devoted much of his time performing in school productions or competing in various solo singing feis\u2019. At the age of 5 he joined the Seamus Kerrigan School of Traditional Irish Dance where he stayed until the age of 18. Here Barry had the amazing opportunity to travel throughout Ireland taking part in a range of competitions, such as the All Ireland Dancing championships and Sc\u00f3r to name a few. A triple threat, Barry can also add acting to his ever increasing list of talents after the years he spent as a member of the Hazel Wand drama school in his hometown of Omagh. No stranger to the stage, Barry was destined to return and seize the spotlight later on in life. At age 11, Barry fell in love with drumming and excelled from grade 1-8 within the space of five years. His passion for the instrument led him to further study in London at Drumtech college, part of the British and Irish Modern Music Institute (BIMM) schools. Shortly after college Barry decided to join his father\u2019s band as his drummer and provided backing vocals for over 4 years. Constantly growing as a musician, Barry left Dominic\u2019s band in September 2010 and had the opportunity to live with his brother Colm in Nashville. During his time in the US he stayed with close friends, American country duo Joey & Rory where he had the incredible honour to play drums for 4 of their US shows. As January 2011 came to a close Barry had began to work with Ireland\u2019s princess of country, Lisa McHugh and performed with her until September 2011 before becoming the drummer and backing vocalist for the hit recording artist Derek Ryan. During his 4 and a half years working with the Derek Ryan band, Barry toured all around Ireland, the U.K and Australia. With every show in every city, Barry\u2019s desires became more apparent and in February 2016 he left the Derek Ryan band to pursue his own dream of a solo career in the Irish country music scene. For the past 4 months he has been touring with his father as the support act on the \u2018Here For A Good Time\u2019 tour throughout the UK and Ireland which has proven to be an excellent platform to prepare before his own live shows this summer. On 6th May 2016, Barry released his first solo single \u2018\u2018Keep It In The Middle Of The Road\u2019 from his debut studio album. The song shot to No. 1 spot on the Irish iTunes Country chart and No.2 in the UK iTunes Country chart - a foretelling of the successful career this rising star will undoubtedly have in the years ahead.
