A series of solo EPs \u2013 including 2011\u2019s breakthrough FAMILY \u2013 eventually led to 2014\u2019s self-produced full-length debut, LEDGES.

The right vocalist can make you fall in love at first listen, elicit tears, or bring you back to a different era altogether. A microphone and a stage remain the only necessities. That holds true for New York-based singer and songwriter Morgan James. On her full-length debut for Epic Records, Hunter, she casts an unbreakable spell with a powerhouse voice equally inspired by smoky soul, swaggering R&B, theatrical swing, and a virtuosic classical poise.\n\nThe Idaho native discovered her passion for music early on and pursued it\nwholeheartedly at the prestigious Juilliard School. While in the midst of the institution's rigorous academic program, she soon realized that her path would diverge from the classical world. \"I didn't want a career in opera, but Juilliard still shaped me,\" she confesses. \"The traditional training really made me a disciplined singer. I carry that with me to this day.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Morgan spent the next few years facing the proverbial struggles of being a young artist in New York. Low on money, she bounced back and forth between bartending and restaurant gigs while fighting to survive. Immersed in classic sixties and seventies soul records, she concurrently experienced a pivotal revelation. \"Out of that frustration came this other voice,\" she says. \"It was my true voice, and I feel like I discovered it in the middle of so much hardship just trying to be heard. I embraced who I was at that very moment.\"\n\nSoon, she would be heard in a big way. In 2008, Morgan booked her first Broadway show\u2014appearing in The Addams Family alongside Nathan Lane, as well as in prominent and leading roles in Wonderland, Godspell (Turn Back, O Man), and Berry Gordy's Motown The Musical as Teena Marie. The latter set the stage for her to\nproperly launch her solo career. Gordy recognized the vocalist's immense talent, and introduced her to Doug Morris and L.A. Reid, opening the door for a deal with Epic Records in 2012.\n\nAround the same time, Morgan booked a landmark show at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, where she paid tribute to Nina Simone with a set of songs that were closely associated with the legendary artist. The incendiary show was recorded and released as the critically acclaimed Morgan James Live on Epic Records. It also proved to be the perfect segue for her first studio album, released in June of 2014.\n\n\"I always knew to make a neo-soul pop record,\" Morgan says. \"The foundation is all real ingredients, and those roots of soul and R&B are pretty strong. It's the culmination of my musical life up to this point. The painful songs are straight out of a bad relationship with someone from my past. The joyful moments are wonderful memories. It's all coming from me. I've lived every one of these stories, and I love the genres I'm representing. It's one point-of-view\u2014mine.\"\n\nThe title track and album opener \"Hunter\" boasts a seductive hook with cinematic noir flair. Flaunting the singer's immense delivery and dynamic presence, it's an undeniable and classy come-on that proves as animalistic as it does magnetic. \"From a woman's perspective, it's such an empowering and sexy song,\" she smiles. \"It totally makes me feel like a warrior! Music is so sensual and life-affirming. That's what I look for. You don't often see a girl take this position, and that's what I love about it!\"\n\nMorgan assumed co-writing duties on eight of the collection's fourteen tracks and even performed all of her own background vocals and harmonies. From the empowering farewell of \"Fed Up On You\" to the mournful rumination of \"You Never Lied\", she continually bares it all\u2014both emotionally and musically. \"I sing like I'm never going to sing ever again,\" Morgan affirms. \"I wanted to capture that power and passion every time. At some moments, it might sound flawless; at others, it might sound like it's going to break. I'm revealing something about myself with\nevery song. You've got to do that. My favorite artists, whether Joni Mitchell or Michael Jackson, are and were, always honest.\"\n\nThere's a unique structure to the album. The first five songs boast electronic elements, while the last six don't have any. \"There's a gradient of the record that goes down,\" she says. \"By the time you get to the last song, it's just piano and voice. It starts with a song about power and ego, and it ends on one about surrender and selflessness. I have all of that in me. Maybe we all do.\"\n\nUltimately, her honesty permeates everything that Morgan James does, and it's why you'll always remember her voice. \"I want people to walk away from this album feeling fulfilled. That's the way it used to be. Often, I think I'm from another time,\u201d she says, her voice trailing off. \u201cI just want to bring back the power of the singular legacy voice.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "203 Broadway, Amityville, NY 11701", "Artist": "Reverend Jack ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9292939.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.417088, 40.678275], "Date": "Wed Apr 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-08", "Genre": "Southern Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "The Warehouse", "moreBioInfo": "Formed out of the Kentucky summer heat of 2016; Reverend Jack is bringing Southern Hard Rock back to the masses!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "233 Butler St, Brooklyn, NY 11217, USA, New York City, NY", "Artist": "Arthur Moon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8256495.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.986465, 40.682058], "Date": "Wed Apr 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-08", "Genre": "Aviva Jaye, Martin D.

But then once I started singing it got so quiet and the tattoo machines all went off\u2014everyone was listening to me. I was so overcome by it, I cried right afterward, but they were happy tears.

He has again partnered up with longtime producer and studio owner, Quinn McCarthy from The Creamery Studios in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.

For this questing artist, it\u2019s not about the rear-view but the road ahead. The next song. The next session. Tonight\u2019s show and tomorrow\u2019s bus ride. But as Dana sheds her musical skin with her triumphant fourth album Love Lives On, it seems a fitting juncture to rewind the reels and thumb a backstory as compelling as any in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. This life and times doesn\u2019t always make for easy reading. The triumphs are laced by tragedy, ugliness, injustice. But whatever the obstacles, music and love have been the beacons that guide her on.\n\nAs one of New York City\u2019s favorite daughters, it\u2019s tempting to imagine that Dana\u2019s career began amidst the subterranean throb in the clubs on the Lower East Side. It\u2019s true: that city was her birthplace and springboard to fame. But to truly grasp her artistic motivations, you\u2019d have to follow the family\u2019s car towards Florida, and rattle along the dirt tracks until you hit Wildwood: a backwoods town, population 2000, where black and white were split along battlelines and distrust simmered in the air. \u201cBack in the \u201970s, it was a sorta small, racist town,\u201d remembers Dana, who dropped a social hand-grenade by dating a black friend. \u201cWe were a big family from New York, Irish-Catholic, there was no one like us in the area. I tended to gravitate more towards the African-American community. I felt more accepted by them.\u201d\nDana and her five older siblings ran wild in the woods (she remembers herself as a \u201ctomboy with dirt under my nails\u201d). Yet this was no picture-perfect childhood, the family\u2019s mood and rhythm set by her father: a former Marine in daily conflict with his demons. \u201cHe was a very tortured soul who had one of the most brutal lives of anyone I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d explains Dana of the patriarch commemorated in Faithful Sinner, one of the songs she wrote for the album. \u201cHe was tortured by his father and molested by his mother. His beatings only stopped because his father took his own life. My father found him. With all that pain, he was most certainly a flawed parent. He could also be very angry and scary, especially when he drank. Still, we knew he loved us.\u201d\nIf the household was fractious, then music was always the balm. Ostracised at school, Dana found solace in the stomp-and-holler gospel of her local Baptist church, but it was the British classic rock blasted out by her siblings \u2013 The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Fleetwood Mac \u2013 that lit a lightbulb over her head. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew I had to do music,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen I started hearing that stuff, at 10 or 11, I stopped listening to other music completely. Later on, I appreciated my parents\u2019 music \u2013 Hank Williams, Ray Charles, Billie Holiday \u2013 but when I heard the old classic rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, I lost my mind over that stuff.\u201d\n\nDana\u2019s musical appetite was bottomless, and when fronting a band at a local Holiday Inn was no longer enough, the 19-year-old singer hatched a bolder plan. At this time, New York did not hold happy associations. The city had been the backdrop to the tragic death of Dana\u2019s beloved elder sister, Donna. \u201cShe and my brother Don had a band, quite popular in the South. She went up to New York City to find her fame and fortune. She took a lot of wrong turns and tragically ended her life.\u201d\n\nAny other 19-year-old might have run a mile from New York\u2019s bearpit music scene, but Dana used the pain as her fuel (\u201cDonna\u2019s suicide,\u201d she says, \u201ccatapulted me from despair to determination to fulfil our shared dream of music\u201d). Yet she still needed a foil. One fateful day, pounding the sidewalks of the Lower East Side, Dana heard the missing puzzle-piece, in the form of Jon Diamond: a heavyweight session guitarist who could already boast credits with Joan Osborne and others. \u201cI was walking by this little club and I heard his guitar from the sidewalk,\u201d she recalls of the musical partnership that flourishes to this day. \u201cI introduced myself to Jon on the break, told him I thought he was great, and that I had come to New York to be a singer. So, he invited me up to sing, and I faked Stormy Monday. Afterwards, he said, \u2018You have a good instrument, but you really need to learn what you\u2019re doing\u2019.\u201d\nAfter Jon exposed her to his encyclopedic blues vinyl collection, Dana\u2019s astonishing natural vocal prowess took on new depth and nuance. And so they were ready. Together, Jon and Dana hit the Lower East Side\u2019s live circuit like a wrecking ball, holding their own on bills featuring titans like James Cotton and Taj Mahal, and quickly earning a residency at the Red Lion club. Four nights a week, they shook the foundations until 3am, but there was already the sense they could be far more than a rocking covers band. \u201cEvery Tuesday night,\u201d Dana recalls, \u201cwe'd play all night, and that's where we wrote our first handful of tunes and we\u2019d try them out on the crowd.\u201d\n\nDrawn by the pair\u2019s original songs and incendiary performances, those crowds were soon stretching round the block, at mythologised hot-spots like Arlene\u2019s Grocery, The Mercury Lounge and B.B. King\u2019s Blues Club. In the studio, meanwhile, Dana and Jon planted their flag with 2003\u2019s Lonely For A Lifetime: an opening gambit that fizzed with potential, splicing a \u201960s Stax/Volt vibe with the driving grit of the Stones, and fusing the dark wit and wisdom of Bob Dylan, Tom Waits and Lucinda Williams. \u201cThey\u2019re about addiction and religious hypocrisy,\u201d she noted of tunes like Strung Out and Bible Baby, \u201cand like all the tracks on the album, deal with subjects that I have a deep personal experience with.\u201d\n\nBy now, all eyes were on her, and after being spotted by musicians from Broadway\u2019s orchestra pits, Dana won the lead in the hit musical Love, Janis, followed up by the role of Sadie in 2007\u2019s Golden Globe-nominated cult movie, Across The Universe. \u201cWe\u2019d been slugging away in New York,\u201d she recalls, \u201cand then I got the show playing Janis Joplin five nights a week. Jon taught me Piece Of My Heart and I went down \u2013 and that was it. That led to Across The Universe. The director, Julie Taymor, asked if I could act. So of course, I lied and said, \u2018Oh yeah!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe demands of stage and screen inevitably impacted on the band\u2019s studio output. But in 2011, the catalogue was thrillingly reignited by Love To Beg, crowned by the UK\u2019s Classic Rock magazine as blues album of the month on the strength of devastating songs like Keep On Rollin\u2019 and Keepsake, which addressed Dana and Jon\u2019s brief (and ill-fated) romantic coupling. \u201cWe fought like cats and dogs,\u201d she grins. \u201cThe first two weeks we were together, we were breaking up every day.\u201d\n\nStill deeper depths were plumbed on 2013\u2019s \u201cblisteringly good\u201d Bliss Avenue: an album that saw Dana battling back into the light after the death of her brother, and reaching for redemption on cuts like So Hard To Move and Vagabond Wind. \u201cIt really purged my soul,\u201d she said, \u201cin a starker, more naked way, lyrically and musically\u201d.\n\nIt takes a brave artist to rip it up and start again. But Love Lives On is the best kind of evolution, seeing Dana burst defiant from her darkest days with a sound inspired by the siren call of American soul. \u201cIt\u2019s a new beginning for me in every way,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to starting chapter two.\u201d\n\nRest assured, you\u2019ll find all the factors that have helped her conquer the modern music scene, with 13 new songs that offer heart-on-sleeve songwriting, stellar musicianship and the ragged vocal that Classic Rock described as \u201cjuke-joint dirty and illicit, evoking Joplin, Jagger and a cigarette bobbing in a glass of bourbon\u201d.\n\nBut this time there\u2019s a new creative freedom, borne of Dana completing her existing record contract, contemplating a blank canvas and crowdfunding the record that she was burning to make. \u201cI was at an interesting crossroads,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWhen my contract was up, I felt a sense of relief that I really held the reins for my next move. I need to be running things. I decided to start my own label called Get Along Records, and to get out of New York and go to the home of the music that inspired me to follow my passion: the Memphis Southern soul of Stax/Volt, Hi Records and Sun Studios. From Otis Redding to Al Green to Johnny Cash. All huge influences.\u201d\n\nFor better and worse, the record was also shaped by emotional extremes, as Dana weathered the loss of three beloved family members, before the storm clouds parted with the birth of her son. \u201cInitially, it felt the worst timing to have a baby,\u201d she says, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. The shift from grief to joy was the most powerful and empowering experience I\u2019ve ever lived. The opportunity arose to take all of the pain from the family loss, the miraculous love of a new baby and put it in a body of music. This album is all about hope and perseverance.\u201d\n\nWith her raw emotions at the surface, Dana hit the album sessions in Memphis with purpose. Armed with songs mostly penned with Jon, the singer found an immediate telepathy with producer Kevin Houston (North Mississippi Allstars, Luther Dickinson, The Bo-Keys, Ian Siegal) and a crack-squad studio band that took in original Hi organist Charles Hodges, Stax heavyweight Steve Potts on drums, keys wizard Glenn Patscha and first-call bassist Jack Daley. \u201cIt was so fast and easy,\u201d Dana reflects, \u201clike I\u2019ve never experienced before. Unbelievable mutual respect and admiration between everyone. Not one ego, ever.\u201d\nOn Love Lives On, the songs are the stars. The album opens in commanding style with Backstreet Baby, driven by grooving guitars, a spring-heeled horn section and a savagely beautiful vocal telling of a woman with \u201cnothing to lose\u201d. Cuts don\u2019t come funkier than Ain\u2019t Nobody\u2019s Fault But Mine, while Callin\u2019 Angels fuses upbeat gospel with a poignant lyric. \u201cIt has a verse for each family member,\u201d explains Dana. \u201cIt\u2019s become a song of conjuring our loved ones in our hearts at every show.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the bittersweet Sittin\u2019 On rides on clipped guitar, Sad Solution offers an effervescent strut, while the vulnerable and reflective title track \u2013 written by Dana as she watched her mother slip away in a Florida hospital following an 11-day vigil \u2013 traces the circle of life. \u201cThis song is about the experience of losing a mother and then becoming one. Letting go of the first love of my life. Lying next to her as she passed, wishing I had asked her so many things. Wishing I had more time.\u201d\n\nOut of darkness comes light. And out of that fascinating early career emerges an older, wiser Dana Fuchs, armed with the album of her life. New label. New studio. New sound. New possibilities for an artist who has so far only hinted at her potential. \u201cI sure hope those who\u2019ve been with me all along will feel as passionately as I do about it,\u201d she concludes. \u201cAnd that those who have yet to hear me will now come on board. Love Lives On is almost like a second child to me. It\u2019s who I am at this moment in time, captured on tape\u2026\u201d\n\nIn April, Dana is set to embark on her Love Lives On world tour in support of her forthcoming new album.\n\nLove Lives On will be released on Get Along Records on May 18th worldwide.\n\nCheck out http://danafuchs.com for music, video, tourdates and much more", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "185 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Boris Pelekh ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10074084.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988346, 40.722035], "Date": "Wed Apr 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-08", "Genre": "Jazz, Rock, Classical, Folk, Gypsy", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall Stage 3", "moreBioInfo": "Boris Pelekh is a Russian-born singer, composer, guitarist, most notable as the guitarist of the Gypsy Punk band Gogol Bordello.\n\nPelekh is also the frontman, guitarist and primary songwriter of rock band Hey Guy.", "otherInfo": "Boris Pelekh - Rockwood Stage 3"}, {"Address": "330 New York Ave, Huntington, NY 11743", "Artist": "Otan Vargas ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8992055.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.426084, 40.871037], "Date": "Wed Apr 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-08", "Genre": "Melancholic Rock, Grunge, Singer Songwriter Rock, Post Rock, Hard Rock, Acoustic, Singer Songwriter", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Crabtree's NY & Main", "moreBioInfo": "Tondo, Manila is a place where people struggle on a daily basis. It is well known as one of the poorest regions in the Philippines. Born and raised here, singer/songwriter Otan Vargas spent his formative years surrounded mostly by poverty and despair. It is this humble background which helps motivate him to this very day. Vargas\u2019 music is a powerfully simplistic combination of melancholy vocals accompanied by a brooding acoustic guitar. He writes songs about man\u2019s struggle, sorrow and pain and finding the strength to continue on. What started out simply as a means of personal therapy for himself has transformed into an inspirational beacon for adoring fans worldwide.\n\nVargas grew up immersed in music from an early age. His father is an accomplished international entertainer and his siblings all sing and play musical instruments. But it wasn\u2019t until the age of 17 that Otan would start playing the acoustic guitar. Around that time, he also began to follow his father to his shows in the Philippines. It was a great experience for him to see his dad perform live and learn how he handled business matters. But ironically, the family discouraged Otan from pursuing a career in music knowing firsthand how difficult the industry could be.\n\nIn 2006, Vargas travelled to the United States for the first time and would soon settle in with family members in New York. With no serious intentions of becoming a musician at the time, he recorded some videos of himself playing guitar and singing at a friend\u2019s house and uploaded them to YouTube for fun. By a strange twist of fate, the videos gained some popularity on YouTube and eventually ended up being viewed by Aaron Lewis \u2013 vocalist of the rock band Staind.\nOtan\u2019s big break came in 2009 when Aaron Lewis unexpectedly invited him on stage to play a song at the Borgata Hotel and Casinos in Atlantic City, NJ. His somewhat nervous, yet captivating rendition of Staind\u2019s hit song \u201cIt\u2019s Been Awhile\u201d elicited a standing ovation from the crowd. The video of that performance also spread quickly on YouTube. Shortly after, Otan would release his full-length debut album \u201cAlone\u201d in which he sings about enduring suffering, battling the voices within and trying to find a constant peace for his soul. The album was recorded mainly in one live take with an acoustic guitar and a single vocal microphone, a rarity in this digital age of multi-track recording. Otan describes his genre of music as \u201cOrganic Rock\u201d. The songs are focused more on the emotional content and lyrical meaning than the skill or technique involved. He says, \u201cwhen I write, I always follow where the song wants to go rather than following a certain structure or formula.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Vargas would perform his original songs for the first time in front of a huge audience of 5,000+ at the Jones Beach Bandshell in New York. And in 2011, he shared the stage with Corey Taylor of Slipknot/Stone Sour, Aaron Lewis of Staind, Lo Pro and Tesla for the \u201cIt Takes a Community Charity Concert\u201d at the Pines Theater in Northampton, MA.\n\nIn 2012, Otan released a new EP entitled \u201cSelected Sorrow.\u201d The EP contained the song \u201cHollow Destination\u201d which was featured in the documentary film \u201cBattlefield of the Mind.\u201d Produced by renowned videographer Fran Strine, the documentary touches on the plight of neglected US veterans who suffer from PTSD and homelessness. It offered a soundtrack which included well known artists such as Mike Mushok of Staind, Pete Murray of Lo Pro and several others including Otan Vargas.\n\nThe following year, Vargas would travel across country by train from his New York residence to perform at the legendary Whisky A Go Go in West Hollywood, CA for the world premiere of the documentary. Others performing on the same stage, were members of the bands Megadeth, Staind, Evanescence and Eye Empire.\n\nIn 2014, Vargas would record a second EP \u201cOrigins\u201d with producer Johnny April of Staind. The recording exhibited Vargas\u2019 growing range as a musical artist and included several guest musicians to create more of a rock band feel. He followed up the album with a two-week tour of the Northeast U.S., performing 13 shows in 15 nights.\nIn 2015, Otan would again take the stage alongside Aaron Lewis of Staind. This time in Oklahoma for the Boot Campaign Foundation, an organization that supports US troops and their families.\n\nThen in 2016, Vargas would continue his charitable concert appearances with a performance at the Grand Theatre in Foxwoods Resort and Casinos for the Reach Foundation. The concert featured members of the bands Seether, Staind, Three Days Grace and Saint Asonia.\n\nMost recently, Vargas\u2019 has recorded a new single called \u201cGround\u201d which features some veteran New York rock musicians including drummer Sal G. of Staind. Vargas experimented with a new formula for this heavy rock project. For the first time, he recorded only the vocal parts and did not include any acoustic guitar. Look for an official release in early 2017.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long, unexpected journey, but all these experiences have developed Otan into a well-respected musician in the rock world and beyond. His story reminds us that if you dream something, no matter who you are or where you come from, it can come true if you work hard and your intentions are pure.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "185 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Valentina Evans ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9895690.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988346, 40.722035], "Date": "Wed Apr 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-08", "Genre": "Acapella, Ranchera, Worldbeat, Blues, Folk, Bolero, Jazz", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall Stage 3", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cIf you melded Chavela Vargas, Ella Fitzgerald and Gal Costa together, you\u2019d find Valentina\u2019s voice there somewhere in between\u2026\u201d\n- Felipe Fournier, 2017 Latin Grammy award winning producer\n\nEqual parts singer, dancer and jaranera, Valentina epitomizes the m\u00e9lange parfait as a California-born, New York-raised daughter of Mexican and Jamaican immigrants.

And for Jukestone Paradise, they called in a few friends to lend their talents, including Ivan Neville, who lends New Orleans flavor to \u201cSky,\u201d and Rubblebucket\u2019s Alex Toth, who co-wrote the quirky and infectious \u201cDance Cardia.\u201d\n\nJust as Brooklyn has changed since the Pimps started, so has the band\u2019s sound. But as Williamsburg gentrifies, the Pimps of Joytime\u2019s diverse evolution keeps the neighborhood\u2019s spirit alive. That spirit goes into the Pimps\u2019 pot, over a soulful roux of rhythm and groove.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "900-978 Ocean Ave, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "Pink Talking Fish ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9187556.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00046, 40.21978], "Date": "Thu Apr 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-09", "Genre": "Fusion, Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Stone Pony Asbury Park", "moreBioInfo": "A Fusion of Pink Floyd, The Talking Heads and Phish!", "otherInfo": "Announcement party for Jams On The Sand!"}, {"Address": "1160 Broadway 5th floor, New York, NY 10001", "Artist": "Nerissa Campbell ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8394033.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988693, 40.744678], "Date": "Thu Apr 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-09", "Genre": "Folk, Jazz Blues, Alternative", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "The Jazz Gallery, NYC", "moreBioInfo": "Singer, Songwriter, learner of Balinese gamelan, guitar & ukulele, and lover of music, travel and learning.

Over the years They have shared the stage with John Mayer, Dave Matthews Band, Matchbox20, Counting Crows, The Wallflowers, Sheryl Crow, Toad the Wet Sprocket - to name a few. After a five-year breakup, the guys reunited in 2002 to test out the waters. They were very warm and city by city, Jack & Cary got back out there to play for grateful fans that thought they would never see them again. The two now have a totally renewed creative vigor, mutual respect and deep gratitude for their fans.\n\nThese good vibes shine through on their 25th anniversary live album \u201cLive 25.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s definitely been a creative time for the duo, and celebrating the past inspires the guys to move forward in new, inventive ways.

He began studying the piano at the age of eight, and five years later switched to electric guitar. He soon discovered his passion for improvisation and jazz, and during his high school years he began to travel regularly to Tel Aviv to study with Israel\u2019s leading musicians, and to participate in workshops and master classes. At the age of 16 he started performing professionally with jazz bands around the country and leading several projects with his original music. At 19, Yuval wrote an original composition for his hometown\u2019s string quartet and for the renowned Oud and Violin player Yair Dalal. His music was selected by one of Israel\u2019s leading composers and music educators Michael Wolpe, and was performed in concert halls across Israel. Soon afterwards he started studying at The Jerusalem Academy of Music and the Rimon Jazz School in Tel Aviv and participated in various musical projects. In 2005 Yuval moved to Paris. He quickly made his way into the local jazz scene and started playing in Paris clubs and venues. The following year he studied at the Jazz department of the Paris Region Conservatory, graduating two years later. Since 2008 Yuval leads his quintet, the Yuval Amihai Ensemble, with whom he performs music which is strongly influenced by his childhood in Israel. The ensemble has won numerous awards, including the Grand Prize and the 1st composition prize at the \"La D\u00e9fense\" National Jazz Competition in 2009, The 1st prize in the Saint-Germain Jazz festival Contest in Paris (2008), and the 3rd prize in the international jazz competition of Hoeilaart, Belgium. The band has performed in opening act concerts for renowned artists as Avishai Cohen, Bojan Z, Rabia Abu-Khalil and Kyle Eastwood, and played in numerous Jazz festivals, concert halls and jazz clubs in France and Europe, including Nancy Jazz Pulsations, La D\u00e9fense Jazz Festival, Sunset/Sunside Jazz Club (Paris), Jazz \u00e0 Staint-G\u00e9rmain-des-Pr\u00e8s Festival (Paris), Guitar Art Caf\u00e9 (Belgrade, Serbie), Budo Tomovic Theater (Podgorica, Mont\u00e9n\u00e9gro), National theaters of Amiens, Sceaux & Valencienne. In 2012 Yuval released his first album with his quintet, \"Yuval Amihai Ensemble\", which was acclaimed by critics and received the \"Chosen Album\" label by French leading jazz critics website CitizenJazz.com. This was followed by a full support by the SACEM organisation's grants program for self-produced albums. In 2015, Yuval records his second album \"LONGING\" with his new trio, including bass player Damien Varaillon and drummer Gautier Garrigue. The album was released May 25, 2015 (distributed by L'Autre Distribution).

For this questing artist, it\u2019s not about the rear-view but the road ahead. The next song. The next session. Tonight\u2019s show and tomorrow\u2019s bus ride. But as Dana sheds her musical skin with her triumphant fourth album Love Lives On, it seems a fitting juncture to rewind the reels and thumb a backstory as compelling as any in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. This life and times doesn\u2019t always make for easy reading. The triumphs are laced by tragedy, ugliness, injustice. But whatever the obstacles, music and love have been the beacons that guide her on.\n\nAs one of New York City\u2019s favorite daughters, it\u2019s tempting to imagine that Dana\u2019s career began amidst the subterranean throb in the clubs on the Lower East Side. It\u2019s true: that city was her birthplace and springboard to fame. But to truly grasp her artistic motivations, you\u2019d have to follow the family\u2019s car towards Florida, and rattle along the dirt tracks until you hit Wildwood: a backwoods town, population 2000, where black and white were split along battlelines and distrust simmered in the air. \u201cBack in the \u201970s, it was a sorta small, racist town,\u201d remembers Dana, who dropped a social hand-grenade by dating a black friend. \u201cWe were a big family from New York, Irish-Catholic, there was no one like us in the area. I tended to gravitate more towards the African-American community. I felt more accepted by them.\u201d\nDana and her five older siblings ran wild in the woods (she remembers herself as a \u201ctomboy with dirt under my nails\u201d). Yet this was no picture-perfect childhood, the family\u2019s mood and rhythm set by her father: a former Marine in daily conflict with his demons. \u201cHe was a very tortured soul who had one of the most brutal lives of anyone I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d explains Dana of the patriarch commemorated in Faithful Sinner, one of the songs she wrote for the album. \u201cHe was tortured by his father and molested by his mother. His beatings only stopped because his father took his own life. My father found him. With all that pain, he was most certainly a flawed parent. He could also be very angry and scary, especially when he drank. Still, we knew he loved us.\u201d\nIf the household was fractious, then music was always the balm. Ostracised at school, Dana found solace in the stomp-and-holler gospel of her local Baptist church, but it was the British classic rock blasted out by her siblings \u2013 The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Fleetwood Mac \u2013 that lit a lightbulb over her head. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew I had to do music,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen I started hearing that stuff, at 10 or 11, I stopped listening to other music completely. Later on, I appreciated my parents\u2019 music \u2013 Hank Williams, Ray Charles, Billie Holiday \u2013 but when I heard the old classic rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, I lost my mind over that stuff.\u201d\n\nDana\u2019s musical appetite was bottomless, and when fronting a band at a local Holiday Inn was no longer enough, the 19-year-old singer hatched a bolder plan. At this time, New York did not hold happy associations. The city had been the backdrop to the tragic death of Dana\u2019s beloved elder sister, Donna. \u201cShe and my brother Don had a band, quite popular in the South. She went up to New York City to find her fame and fortune. She took a lot of wrong turns and tragically ended her life.\u201d\n\nAny other 19-year-old might have run a mile from New York\u2019s bearpit music scene, but Dana used the pain as her fuel (\u201cDonna\u2019s suicide,\u201d she says, \u201ccatapulted me from despair to determination to fulfil our shared dream of music\u201d). Yet she still needed a foil. One fateful day, pounding the sidewalks of the Lower East Side, Dana heard the missing puzzle-piece, in the form of Jon Diamond: a heavyweight session guitarist who could already boast credits with Joan Osborne and others. \u201cI was walking by this little club and I heard his guitar from the sidewalk,\u201d she recalls of the musical partnership that flourishes to this day. \u201cI introduced myself to Jon on the break, told him I thought he was great, and that I had come to New York to be a singer. So, he invited me up to sing, and I faked Stormy Monday. Afterwards, he said, \u2018You have a good instrument, but you really need to learn what you\u2019re doing\u2019.\u201d\nAfter Jon exposed her to his encyclopedic blues vinyl collection, Dana\u2019s astonishing natural vocal prowess took on new depth and nuance. And so they were ready. Together, Jon and Dana hit the Lower East Side\u2019s live circuit like a wrecking ball, holding their own on bills featuring titans like James Cotton and Taj Mahal, and quickly earning a residency at the Red Lion club. Four nights a week, they shook the foundations until 3am, but there was already the sense they could be far more than a rocking covers band. \u201cEvery Tuesday night,\u201d Dana recalls, \u201cwe'd play all night, and that's where we wrote our first handful of tunes and we\u2019d try them out on the crowd.\u201d\n\nDrawn by the pair\u2019s original songs and incendiary performances, those crowds were soon stretching round the block, at mythologised hot-spots like Arlene\u2019s Grocery, The Mercury Lounge and B.B. King\u2019s Blues Club. In the studio, meanwhile, Dana and Jon planted their flag with 2003\u2019s Lonely For A Lifetime: an opening gambit that fizzed with potential, splicing a \u201960s Stax/Volt vibe with the driving grit of the Stones, and fusing the dark wit and wisdom of Bob Dylan, Tom Waits and Lucinda Williams. \u201cThey\u2019re about addiction and religious hypocrisy,\u201d she noted of tunes like Strung Out and Bible Baby, \u201cand like all the tracks on the album, deal with subjects that I have a deep personal experience with.\u201d\n\nBy now, all eyes were on her, and after being spotted by musicians from Broadway\u2019s orchestra pits, Dana won the lead in the hit musical Love, Janis, followed up by the role of Sadie in 2007\u2019s Golden Globe-nominated cult movie, Across The Universe. \u201cWe\u2019d been slugging away in New York,\u201d she recalls, \u201cand then I got the show playing Janis Joplin five nights a week. Jon taught me Piece Of My Heart and I went down \u2013 and that was it. That led to Across The Universe. The director, Julie Taymor, asked if I could act. So of course, I lied and said, \u2018Oh yeah!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe demands of stage and screen inevitably impacted on the band\u2019s studio output. But in 2011, the catalogue was thrillingly reignited by Love To Beg, crowned by the UK\u2019s Classic Rock magazine as blues album of the month on the strength of devastating songs like Keep On Rollin\u2019 and Keepsake, which addressed Dana and Jon\u2019s brief (and ill-fated) romantic coupling. \u201cWe fought like cats and dogs,\u201d she grins. \u201cThe first two weeks we were together, we were breaking up every day.\u201d\n\nStill deeper depths were plumbed on 2013\u2019s \u201cblisteringly good\u201d Bliss Avenue: an album that saw Dana battling back into the light after the death of her brother, and reaching for redemption on cuts like So Hard To Move and Vagabond Wind. \u201cIt really purged my soul,\u201d she said, \u201cin a starker, more naked way, lyrically and musically\u201d.\n\nIt takes a brave artist to rip it up and start again. But Love Lives On is the best kind of evolution, seeing Dana burst defiant from her darkest days with a sound inspired by the siren call of American soul. \u201cIt\u2019s a new beginning for me in every way,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to starting chapter two.\u201d\n\nRest assured, you\u2019ll find all the factors that have helped her conquer the modern music scene, with 13 new songs that offer heart-on-sleeve songwriting, stellar musicianship and the ragged vocal that Classic Rock described as \u201cjuke-joint dirty and illicit, evoking Joplin, Jagger and a cigarette bobbing in a glass of bourbon\u201d.\n\nBut this time there\u2019s a new creative freedom, borne of Dana completing her existing record contract, contemplating a blank canvas and crowdfunding the record that she was burning to make. \u201cI was at an interesting crossroads,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWhen my contract was up, I felt a sense of relief that I really held the reins for my next move. I need to be running things. I decided to start my own label called Get Along Records, and to get out of New York and go to the home of the music that inspired me to follow my passion: the Memphis Southern soul of Stax/Volt, Hi Records and Sun Studios. From Otis Redding to Al Green to Johnny Cash. All huge influences.\u201d\n\nFor better and worse, the record was also shaped by emotional extremes, as Dana weathered the loss of three beloved family members, before the storm clouds parted with the birth of her son. \u201cInitially, it felt the worst timing to have a baby,\u201d she says, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. The shift from grief to joy was the most powerful and empowering experience I\u2019ve ever lived. The opportunity arose to take all of the pain from the family loss, the miraculous love of a new baby and put it in a body of music. This album is all about hope and perseverance.\u201d\n\nWith her raw emotions at the surface, Dana hit the album sessions in Memphis with purpose. Armed with songs mostly penned with Jon, the singer found an immediate telepathy with producer Kevin Houston (North Mississippi Allstars, Luther Dickinson, The Bo-Keys, Ian Siegal) and a crack-squad studio band that took in original Hi organist Charles Hodges, Stax heavyweight Steve Potts on drums, keys wizard Glenn Patscha and first-call bassist Jack Daley. \u201cIt was so fast and easy,\u201d Dana reflects, \u201clike I\u2019ve never experienced before. Unbelievable mutual respect and admiration between everyone. Not one ego, ever.\u201d\nOn Love Lives On, the songs are the stars. The album opens in commanding style with Backstreet Baby, driven by grooving guitars, a spring-heeled horn section and a savagely beautiful vocal telling of a woman with \u201cnothing to lose\u201d. Cuts don\u2019t come funkier than Ain\u2019t Nobody\u2019s Fault But Mine, while Callin\u2019 Angels fuses upbeat gospel with a poignant lyric. \u201cIt has a verse for each family member,\u201d explains Dana. \u201cIt\u2019s become a song of conjuring our loved ones in our hearts at every show.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the bittersweet Sittin\u2019 On rides on clipped guitar, Sad Solution offers an effervescent strut, while the vulnerable and reflective title track \u2013 written by Dana as she watched her mother slip away in a Florida hospital following an 11-day vigil \u2013 traces the circle of life. \u201cThis song is about the experience of losing a mother and then becoming one. Letting go of the first love of my life. Lying next to her as she passed, wishing I had asked her so many things. Wishing I had more time.\u201d\n\nOut of darkness comes light. And out of that fascinating early career emerges an older, wiser Dana Fuchs, armed with the album of her life. New label. New studio. New sound. New possibilities for an artist who has so far only hinted at her potential. \u201cI sure hope those who\u2019ve been with me all along will feel as passionately as I do about it,\u201d she concludes. \u201cAnd that those who have yet to hear me will now come on board. Love Lives On is almost like a second child to me. It\u2019s who I am at this moment in time, captured on tape\u2026\u201d\n\nIn April, Dana is set to embark on her Love Lives On world tour in support of her forthcoming new album.\n\nLove Lives On will be released on Get Along Records on May 18th worldwide.\n\nCheck out http://danafuchs.com for music, video, tourdates and much more", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "47 Easton Ave, New Brunswick, NJ 08901", "Artist": "Nathan Bohach ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8872197.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.448888, 40.497958], "Date": "Thu Apr 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-09", "Genre": "Funk, Rock, R&b, Hip Hop, Country, Jazz, Blues, Fusion", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Bar\u00e7a City Cafe & Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Nathan Bohach is an artist in the New York City jazz scene.

His future became clear after being exposed to the music of Lionel Hampton, Milt Jackson and Stefon Harris but his greatest influence came from producer, recording artist and professor at Juilliard, Mark Sherman.\n\nNathan had the good fortune of meeting Sherman while an Undergraduate student at Marshall University. It was then that he began studying jazz vibraphone, with Sherman, in the tradition of the greats. This relationship with Sherman led him to Jersey City University as a graduate assistant where he will graduate in a few months. Now a resident of New Jersey, Bohach performs in the NYC metro area with various groups on both vibraphone and drum set a second instrument on which he is also quite accomplished. In addition to Sherman, Nathan has studied with Dr. Ben Miller, Rusty Burge and Ben Gillece. He has studied drum set with Jay Ware, Steve Hall and Tim Horner.\n\nNathan favors the styles of Jazz, Funk and Fusion and his playing and writing has been greatly influenced by the afore mentioned artists along with the music and playing of Bobby Hutcherson, Robert Glasper, Snarky Puppy, Roy Haynes, Staton Moore, and Stefon Harris.\n\nNathan has performed shows at venues such as The Stanhope House (NJ), Silvana (NY), Tomi Jazz (NY), The Empty Glass (WV), and more.

He soon understands the necessity to go to the roots of Jazz and in 2009 he is granted a Fulbright Scholarship to study at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary music on a merit scholarship.\n\nIn New York, the dream of meeting and playing with his idols becomes true and Yacine gets to learn from Chris Cheek, Donny Mc Caslin, Reggie Workman and with countless musicians who inspire him daily. But New York also exposes him to a myriad of different musics. Soon he is part of ex Fela Kuti' drummer Jojo Kuo' Afrobeat Collective, of late Cameroonian singer Martino Atangana's African Blue Note, of Haitian Kompa legends Tabou Combo. In their musics, he finds a deep echo to his North African roots and the Bikutsi rhythms from Cameroon become reminiscent of the trance rhythms and musics from Tunisia.\n\nThese influences urge him to find his own identity and his explorations of Cameroonian dance rhythms lead to the creation of the band AJOYO, a mystic brew of African tradition, jazz and soul. Yacine signs the music and lyrics of a repertoire that celebrates life, love and justice. The album is released in 2015 on Ropeadope Records and played on radios throughout the world from New Yorks' WNYC to French RFI, London's Jazz FM, National radio in Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria...\n\nIn the meantime, Yacine continues to play as a sideman both in the jazz repertoire with the likes of Sheila Jordan, Theo Bleckman and Becca Stevens and for various projects such as Japanese singer/songwriter Senri Oe (3 albums for Sony Japan).\n\nIn 2014 he is part of an intimate band picked by producer and arranger Robert Sadin to accompany Opera legend Placido Domingo on his remarkable record Encanto Del Mar. Yacine is featured both as a soloist and arranger of the Andalucian standard Lamma Bada and gets the chance to work closely with Ira Coleman, Mark Feldman, Rhani Khridja, Chico Pinheiro and Bridget Kibbey. This is also where he meets cellist Vincent Segal and gets the idea to explore the tunisian Stambeli repertoire with Vincent on cello and drummer Nasheet Waits.\n\nIn 2015 this project is granted the French American Jazz Exchange. The trio album will be recorded and released in 2017 with the French label Accords Croises.\n\nConcurrently to his activities as a performer and a composer, Yacine teaches song-writing at the French Heritage Language Program.

Is This Thing Cursed?, their first record in over five years, is a spirited conjuring of everything the band has summoned before, electrified with a new urgency. As it turns out, the most important modern rock band to combine heartbreak, power-pop, and a flirtation with the occult was just getting started.\n\nA few short years ago, Alkaline Trio put on a massive black celebration of close to a hundred songs, over sold out multi-night residencies in a handful of cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and Orange County, tearing through eight studio albums and nearly two decades of history. The devotion of the band\u2019s adoring cult following was repeatedly rewarded, as the twists of phrase and dark melodies that have become a part of the fabric of their lives danced around them in sweaty, intimate, seductive ceremony. For a subculture of outsiders, misfits, and lonely-hearts, songs like \u201cThis Addiction,\u201d \u201cTime to Waste,\u201d and \u201cRadio\u201d are perfect anthems.\n\nAlbums like From Here to Infirmary, Crimson, and Agony & Irony are classics. Now the portal to a new era opens with the fresh vibrancy of Is This Thing Cursed?, a furiously inspired collection of songs created in an unprecedented situation. For the first time in their history, Alkaline Trio booked studio time, arrived with little more than a few ideas, and created an entire album on the spot.\n\n\u201cEveryone always thinks that their newest record is their best record and I'm no different,\u201d says vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba. \u201cOf course we think it's our best record. We wouldn't put it out if we didn't think it was our best record. As far as where it sits in our \u2018catalog\u2019? Hopefully, it's a big step, but a logical one.\u201d\n\nVocalist, bassist, and co-songwriter Dan Andriano concurs. \u201cWe made a record in a way we\u2019ve never done it before and it worked. I'm really excited about it. Everything sounds fun and fresh. I suppose any band making their ninth record would like to hope that their longtime fans are going to be into it, but I really feel like we made a record that the old school fans are going to dig. I really, really do.\u201d\n\nGood Mourning (2003) cracked the Billboard Top 20. This Addiction (2010) debuted at Number 1 on Billboard\u2019s Rock, Independent, and Alternative charts. But even with strong record sales, radio play, and several late night talk show performances, the Alkaline Trio torch burns brightest for the diehards. It\u2019s a legion of fans that crisscross the globe for shows; faithful devotees who remain proudly connected to Skiba, Andriano, and longtime drummer Derek Grant.\n\nAs Noisey once summarized, ALK3 \u201ccut themselves from a unique enough black cloth to standout\u201d in a sea of punk lookalikes in the late 90s and early 2000s, mining the poeticism of Jawbreaker, the campy vintage goth of horror rock, and the three-chord driven punk bombast so beloved in their native Chicago scene.\n\nIs This Thing Cursed? hearkens to the creative process of the early days, when the band rehearsed in a tiny apartment on the edge of Chicago\u2019s Humboldt Park, at the intersection of Damen Avenue and Division Street, near D&D Liquor. The appropriately titled \u201cDemon and Division\u201d recalls the vibe of the song \u201cSan Franciso,\u201d one of the beloved tracks from the very first album, Goddamnit (1998).\n\n\u201cIt has an old Trio vibe to it. Somewhere in the back of my mind I was thinking I wanted it to sound like an old school Trio song,\u201d Skiba explains. In fact, much of Is This Thing Cursed? shares exciting psychic similarities with the discography.\n\n\u201cWe slowly realized that in a completely different way there were a lot of parallels between this new record and [2000\u2019s] Maybe I'll Catch Fire,\u201d Skiba confirms. \u201cThe process, the themes, there are just a lot of similarities from our perspective. It almost feels like a sister record to it or something, or like a first cousin.\u201d\n\nThe album was tracked in Los Angeles at The Lair. With its weird antiques, big wooden doorways, large velvet drapery, and eye candy sconces, Andriano describes The Lair as \u201cwhat it would look like if Alkaline Trio designed a studio.\u201d\n\nProducer Cameron Webb (Mot\u00f6rhead, Megadeth) was an essential part of the creative process, encouraging the band to power through their ideas and flesh out their songs with a mixture of spontaneity and certainty. Over the years, Alkaline Trio has worked with the A-list of the genre\u2019s producers, including Webb, Matt Allison (Smoking Popes, Rise Against), Josh Abraham (Thirty Seconds To Mars, Slayer), and Bill Stevenson (Descendents, A Day To Remember). But the advice of the late Jerry Finn (Blink-182, Morrissey) was a pivotal guiding force.\n\n\u201cJerry's sort of mantra was, 'first thought best thought.' Not that it works every time, but it works a lot,\u201d Skiba explains. \u201c[Another thing he taught us] is that just because something wasn't intentional, that doesn't mean it was a \u2018mistake\u2019\u2026 In the past we\u2019d spend a lot of time in preproduction. With this record we went in with pretty much nothing. Dan had a couple of demos. I didn't have a single complete demo for the new album, just a few ideas on my phone. We pretty much wrote the whole thing as we recorded it. We wrote a song or two a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat old school style writing process, combined with how we feel now about what we want when we listen to a record made for a nice combo,\u201d says Andriano.\n\nAs ever, the storytelling remains of paramount importance. As co-lyricists, both of the band\u2019s frontmen avoid empty imagery and flowery words absent of meaning. The songs always tell a story, a mixture of fact and fiction, reality and metaphor.\n\nThe title track began as something very personal for the group\u2019s bassist. \u201cEveryone gets to a point where you feel like you can\u2019t win, you\u2019re up against it,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s totally irrational but that\u2019s how you feel when you\u2019re completely lost in the throes of depression. You feel like everything you look at, everything you touch, all of it must be cursed. Then it becomes inward, like, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s me that\u2019s the problem. Is it this body of mine, this host that I walk around in?\u2019\u201d\n\nWebb suggested Skiba sing a verse on \u201cIs This Thing Cursed?\u201d as well. \u201cDan sings most of the song\u2019s vocals. It's his baby,\u201d the guitarist says. \u201cHe and I work really well together. As corny as it might sound, I'm sure there are a lot of times we're communicating without speaking. Sometimes things are left unsaid or I can tell that he doesn't want me to ask what it's about. There isn't really much that Dan and I wouldn't tell each other, but sometimes it's nice to have the mystery. [This song] is a rare occurrence where [the subject] never came up specifically.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlackbird\u201d is another product of the duo\u2019s collaboration. It was one of the few instrumentals Andriano had worked out before they arrived. He loved the music but wasn\u2019t happy with his own lyrics or melodies before he passed it over to Skiba, who was obsessed with the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird as a kid. Skiba drew the military airplane on everything, built model kits, and even as an adult, devoured books on it. Around the time the lyrics came together, \u201cBlackbird\u201d was the nickname for a girl he was dating. \u201cShe didn't look like a bird, but she has this sleekness, this sexiness, that I felt just reminded me in some way of that plane.\u201d\n\n\u201cI Can\u2019t Believe\u201d is brand new territory for Alkaline Trio. \u201cIt's about the current administration,\u201d says Skiba, who traditionally had shied away from political topics. \u201cIt\u2019s even more so about the people that continue to think that Trump is a good idea, regardless of all the racism, sexual abuse, and pig-nature of this person. So much damage has been done. I can't believe why anyone would think that's a good idea. It blows my mind. It's the first time I've ever written a song like that.\u201d\n\nAndriano wrote \u201cLittle Help\u201d about a type of person he\u2019s \u201cbeen close to becoming and I don\u2019t care to become.\u201d Another new song, \u201cPale Blue Ribbon,\u201d is even more personal. It\u2019s about the death of a friend. \u201cIt\u2019s about wishing I could go back and talk to him.\u201d As the song declares, \u201cThere\u2019s no prize for winning this race.\u201d\n\nIs This Thing Cursed? is filled with the type of naked self reflection and authentic personal revelations that have drawn so many punks, goths, alternative rock advocates, and music fans of all stripes to Alkaline Trio, assuring the band\u2019s continued relevance and vibrancy, now more than 20 years into their story. It\u2019s a passionate display of truth telling emotion set to timeless melodies that\u2019s inspired a type of reverence usually reserved for longer running icons and trailblazers.\n\nLike the Misfits \u201cfiend skull,\u201d the Black Flag \u201cbars,\u201d or the Bad Religion \u201ccrossbuster,\u201d Alkaline Trio\u2019s iconic Heart & Skull symbol is bigger than the band it represents. It\u2019s a badge of honor for diverse and defiant individuals who share a passionate commitment to the triumph of the outsider. Like the heart that surrounds the skull, while the band may celebrate the macabre, there\u2019s an ever-beckoning black light within their darkness. No matter how bleak things may seem, the music of Alkaline Trio is there, with a sly phrase and a sweet melody.", "otherInfo": "ALL AGE SHOW DOORS 7:00 PM"}, {"Address": "498 Court St, Brooklyn, NY 11231", "Artist": "Devadas ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7460118.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.998729, 40.676824], "Date": "Fri Apr 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-10", "Genre": "Folk, Kirtan, Spiritual, Rock, Christian-gospel, Christian/gospel", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Prema Yoga Brooklyn", "moreBioInfo": "Devadas is a kirtaniya, composer and artist hailing from Brooklyn, New York.

By that Fall they played an inaugural, now-infamous residency at American Beauty in New York City and then road-tested many of the songs on an extended northeast tour. One thing that became apparent right away was that there was going to be an exploratory spirit to their live shows and that the songs are, on one level, springboards for extended improvisation as well as vehicles for dance-floor workouts. Inspired by rock, funk, and jazz artists such as The Band, The Talking Heads, Phish, The Grateful Dead, James Brown, Fela Kuti, Miles Davis, Grant Green and countless others, the goal, in their own words, is to \u201cnot know where we\u2019re going\u201d because that feeling of excitement and adventure translates to the audience. Front and center in the mix is Hilliard\u2019s guitar, which is unmistakable in tone. He lists as early inspirations BB King and Jimi Hendrix, and using that as a jumping off point he brings jazz concepts to tell longer, more complex sonic stories.\n\nJeremy is no newcomer to the scene. He established his songwriting voice as a bandleader and lead guitarist for the band Turbine, with whom he made 4 studio albums and toured nationally for many years, including regular appearances on the some of the country\u2019s biggest stages such as Bonnaroo Music Festival, Telluride Music Festival, Gathering of the Vibes, Moedown, and many others. For his new group, he searched far and wide to find the perfect complement to his sound and finally found it in the great gospel organist Otis Williams. Williams is a master of his instrument from a very young age, as well as a musical Swiss Army knife. He is able to incorporate synths, vocals, samples, really any sound under the sun. Coming from the Bronx, the birthplace of hip hop, beat making and dance music are second nature to him. He also plays with a totally unorthodox harmonic approach that will make any listener sit up and take notice. Holding this all together, and the driving pulse of the band, is the bass playing of Eric Thachuk. The new band was lucky enough to meet him when he first moved to New York from Toronto where he worked as a top studio and touring musician. He somehow always knows exactly the right note to play to hold down the fort for all the harmonic and rhythmic interplay, and his elegant choices as an improviser give the music a sophisticated form. He is also a multi-talented musician, programming all the electronic drums on the bands\u2019 debut album. The newest member of the group is John Venezia on drums who is an up-and-coming killer on the kit. He recently finished at Philadelphia\u2019s University of the Arts and although you don\u2019t know it yet you need to see him live. After spending their first summer jamming, and then going out and getting 50 shows under their belt, the band knew that they wanted a full-length studio album to define their sound, and it would be all about the songs. So in early 2017 they hunkered down in Dave Brandwein\u2019s (Turkuaz) Galaxy Smith Studios in Brooklyn to finish writing and record what would become their debut album, Electric Bouquet.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "140 Stewart Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Black Tiger Sex Machine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8787902.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.926398, 40.710569], "Date": "Fri Apr 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-10", "Genre": "Electro House, Futuristic Thriller, Electronic", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Avant Gardner", "moreBioInfo": "Welcome to our Church.

As children of the 80s and 90s, they witnessed first-hand the rise of personal computers, the invention of the Internet, and the emergence of a global community. As adults, they also bore witness to the global cultural shifts that happened after 9/11, and then faced the financial crisis of 2008 as they were beginning to build their careers, families, and livelihoods. In the modern age of music, TNL straddles the divide between analogue and digital in their minds, hearts, and bodies. And their songs are also about straddling a line between youth and adulthood; they write about becoming an adult in the modern age, navigating waters that stretch into an ever-expanding universe.\n\nSonically, TNL is a unique blend of guitar-driven songs, layered with intricate piano, pop-rock vocals, and powerful yet sophisticated drums. It\u2019s American heartland rock for the modern era, for Gen Xers who miss guitars in Top 40 music, who identify with the familiar echoes of 1960s girl groups, and who seek out today\u2019s rootsy indie-rock.\n\nTNL was founded by songwriters Liza Zitelli Grabowski and Jon Ryan Grabowski, who began playing together in New York City in 2009. When childhood friend Paul began to join them for shows around NYC in 2010, along with Zitelli siblings Diana and Andrew, TNL was born.\n\nIn 2013, TNL independently produced and released their first EP, Less Radio (recorded at Sweet Sounds Studios in NYC). Less Radio is a rock record that expresses the inspirations and frustrations of the city and its satellites. Navigating urban and suburban landscapes, the characters of Less Radio are always in motion\u2014on stages and subways in \u201cSkyline Blues\u201d and \u201cTime Out, New York,\u201d on ghostly trains in \u201cPenn Station,\u201d and on lonely highways in \u201cDead End Rock.\u201d They even move in and out of the nostalgic past in \u201cCharlotte Arms\u201d and the dystopian, radio-less future of the haunting title track.\n\nThe blog RockNYC Live and Recorded named Less Radio #22 best album of 2013 and the song \u201cTimeout, New York\u201d as the #16 best song released in 2013. Blog founder and NYC music critic Iman Lababedi wrote, \u201cImagine Ronnie Spector fronting the E Street Band singing Springsteen-Goffin-King songs, and you will have an idea of what they are going for...It is like they are the last band in town writing new, young, classic rock worth a damn.\"\n\nWith the additions of Nick, Petros, Colin, and Amy over the next few years, TNL expanded its sound and released its first LP, Signals, on Feb 24, 2017. Recorded at Water Music Studios in Hoboken, NJ, Signals is a collection American stories set in the new millennium, as told by characters who consider the redeeming powers of community, love, music, and spirituality. The 8-song LP features an American heartland-rock sound\u2014lush and spirited piano, powerful yet sophisticated drums, and driving guitar and bass, with crisp vocals and harmonies.\n\nIn his review of the Signals, Jersey Beat music blogger Joe Wawrzyniak wrote, \u201cThe robust vocals project a winning blend of strength and vigor. The harmonic arrangements boast everything from meaty guitar riffs to rousing horn lines to mighty rolling drums. Whether it's the fist-pumping anthem \u2018American Summer\u2019 or the tremendous headlong rush of \u2018Into the Night,\u2019 there's plenty to relish on this hugely enjoyable album.\u201d\n\nA record-release show for Signals was held on Feb 25, 2017, at the legendary Maxwell's in Hoboken, to a sold out crowd.\n\nTNL\u2019s next full-length release is planned for 2020, with singles from the new record being released in late 2019. On October 25, 2019, TNL released \u201cHow It All Went Down,\u201d the first single from the forthcoming 2020 release. \u201cHow It All Went Down\u201d is a powerful, up-tempo rock song driving guitars, a powerful rhythm section, crisp vocals and harmonies, and lush piano. It touches on themes of loss, motherhood, and storytelling, working towards a cathartic emotional ending.\n\nWith Grammy-nominated Chris Badami producing the new material, with mastering by the renowned Scott Hull of Masterdisk, TNL looks to help carry on the story of American songwriting in the millennial age.", "otherInfo": "It may be Good Friday, but every Friday at HCK is a good Friday!!

He is a son of jazz legend Roland Alexander, an American post-bop jazz tenor saxophone player from Boston, Massachusetts. Taru started to play drums at the early age of seven years old surrounded by the greatest jazz musicians like Freddie Hubbard, Reggie Workman, Gary Bartz, and Kiani Zawadi. At the age of nine, he was studying drums under the leadership of master drummers Rudy Collins, Andre Strobert and Walter Perkins at the New Muse music school in Brooklyn, New York. By the age of thirteen, Taru started to perform professionally with his father Roland Alexander\u2019s quintet (Roland Alexander-tenor saxophone, Kiani Zawadi-trombone, Hilton Ruiz-piano, Paul Brown-bass). At the same time, he started to study drums with Justin DiCioccio at the La Guardia Music & Art High School in New York.\n\nWhile still studying at the age of sixteen, Taru recorded his first album as a sideman accompanying Fred Ho Afro-Asian Ensemble on the Black Saint record label. Soon after, he established himself at the New York jazz scene and became one of the soughs after drummers. He also toured the US with the Moe Better Blues Band & The Drums of Fire bands. Taru performed domestically and internationally with Abbey Lincoln, Betty Carter, Roland Alexander, Roy Hargrove, Carlos Garnett, Rodney Kendrick, Branford Marsalis, Danny Mixon, Gary Bartz, Carlos Garnett, Reggie Workman, Bill Saxton, Kenny Davis, Lonnie Plaxico, Bill Lee and many more\u2026\n\nDuring his three decades of professional successful career, Taru appeared as a sideman on more than fifty albums.

Indeed, since he debuted almost two and a half years ago on New York City hip hop station WWPR Power 105.1 FM, Norie\u2019s Sunday night show \u201cAnything Goes-Caribbean Edition\u201d, a vigorous blend of soca, reggaeton, roots reggae and dancehall, accented with a distinctive Brooklyn flavor, consistently tops the ratings for the 8-10 PM time slot according to Arbitron statistics.\nRespectfully referred to as Da Reggae Don, DJ Norie was born to Panamanian parents in Brooklyn, which is often referred to a Jamaica\u2019s 15th parish, due to its concentration of immigrants from reggae\u2019s birthplace. Raised in Brooklyn\u2019s East Flatbush area, Norie became familiar with the music of Shabba Ranks, Super Cat and Ninja Man (dancehall reggae superstars of the late 1980s and early \u201890s) by listening to coveted sound clash cassettes that furthered the popularity of the latest reggae hits and the renown of the era\u2019s premier Jamaican sound systems. \u201cListening to the cassettes of Stone Love, Kilimanjaro and other sounds I thought, I want to be a part of that,\u201d Norie recalled.\nBarely into his teens, Norie began working with a neighborhood sound doing odd jobs such as carrying speakers and other equipment to their various gigs around Brooklyn. He paid close attention to the deejays (or selectors in Jamaican parlance) observing their proficiency in choosing just the right tunes to elicit roaring responses from the crowd and keep them on the dance floor. When the selectors needed to take a break, Norie got the chance to display his burgeoning skills on the wheels of steel; however, these early career-training sessions took place unbeknownst to Norie\u2019s mother. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will get in trouble for saying this now but my mom used to work nights so I used to sneak out to play at these basement parties, and basically that is how I learned to select,\u201d Norie laughingly discloses. \u201cIt was kind of hard in the beginning; they used to line up four or five records, tell me what to play and when I played them, people used to go crazy. So it used to seem like, yeah, I can do this, even though I was scared as s*#t. But I did it anyway and it was a good experience.\u201d\n\nNorie\u2019s fears subsided with repeated stints at the turntables and eventually he was recruited by Spectrum Disco, working with selectors Redds and Super C; as Spectrum\u2019s popularity spread throughout Brooklyn and the greater New York area during the 1990s, so too did Norie\u2019s renown as an intimidating selector. In the late 1990s Super Claude, the founder of Afrique Sound Station, one of the most venerated sound systems in the New York area, recruited Norie to join the set. Alongside Afrique\u2019s remarkable team of selectors, which included Jagga B, Crazy Richie and Super Twitch, Norie\u2019s talents were taken to a wider audience that spanned many states and several countries. \u201cSometimes you have to make a move, enhance yourself and go for you, and Afrique is where my name really started from, its what took me to the level of traveling with the music,\u201d Norie reflects. \u201cI will never forget Spectrum Disco because that is where I came from but Afrique has been in the business for more than 20 years, they set the trend for \u2018nuff sounds and it is a blessing to have been a part of it.\u201d\nNorie has also played on numerous Brooklyn based pirate and Internet stations that exclusively play reggae and Caribbean music (he even started one of his own, My Radio 94.3 FM), a phenomenon indicative of the vast potential for Caribbean music in the New York area. But Norie\u2019s expertise in selecting dancehall also resonated with a mainstream listenership, as he found out when he joined up with (hip hop) DJ Self as one of six deejays comprising a collective called Da Union, which enabled him to take dancehall into several (Manhattan) clubs where it had previously been excluded. This led to a few guest appearances on Power 105.1 FM, and eventually his Sunday night show on the station, which has contributed to his enviable status as America\u2019s most influential radio personality for dancehall reggae. As such, Norie is usually the first to transform a core dancehall anthem into an international hit, which he recently did with Stephen and Damian Marley\u2019s single \u201cJah Army\u201d, featuring Buju Banton.\nNorie is also the personal deejay for Beenie Man, with whom he travels whenever the artist has a show outside of Jamaica and he has also toured with Elephant Man, Bounty Killer, Mavado and Serani. On March 30, 2011 at New York City\u2019s BB King\u2019s nightclub, Norie made history selecting the rhythms for seven time Grammy winner Stephen Marley\u2019s first performance done solely to backing tracks (that is, without his band\u2019s accompaniment); Marley headlined Norie\u2019s two year anniversary party for his Power 105 show, which was also the one year anniversary celebration for his immensely popular monthly live concert series, \u201cAnything Goes\u201d. \u201cStephen was a little hesitant at first, because he never performed to tracks before, but he did it and he was happy about it, so it is a great experience to have under my belt,\u201d Norie shares.\nNorie has recently partnered on several projects with Queens New York based VP Records, the largest independent reggae label in the world. He selects the music at each of VP\u2019s album release parties and the label\u2019s artists are regularly showcased at his \u201cAnything Goes\u201d series. For VP Records\u2019 \u201cReggae Gold 2011\u201d, a collection of the year\u2019s biggest reggae hits, Da Reggae Don provided a vibrant, 35-minute bonus mix CD, rife with artists\u2019 shout-outs to Norie (including 2011 Celebrity Apprentice winner/country superstar John Rich) and customized renditions of popular songs. Additionally, Norie has just started recording artists on his own dancehall rhythms and he plans to release those tracks as part of his own compilation series sometime in the near future.\nEach of Norie\u2019s endeavors is in pursuit of his ultimate goal: expanding the overall popularity of Caribbean music, especially dancehall reggae, the music that inspired his career path almost 20 years ago. \u201cMy radio show has served a lot of purposes; not only did it allow my fans to get to know me but it allowed me to give back to this music game,\u201d Norie explains. \u201cBut I would like to get further in radio, be more than just a deejay because then I can help reggae by impressing upon program directors that New York\u2019s Caribbean population is really an untapped market that no one is paying attention to so why not go out and support it? We don\u2019t have to follow the same trends that everyone has been doing for years and years, we can do things differently, add on and make it much stronger.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "39 E 58th St, New York, NY 10022", "Artist": "Stoon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8865245.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.971301, 40.762831], "Date": "Fri Apr 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-10", "Genre": "Hip Hop, House", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Lavo", "moreBioInfo": "Stoon is one of the most established DJs in the New York tri-state area.

But the group, founded by lifelong friends and musical compadres Jonny Orton (rhythm guitar, lead vocals) and Jeff Sullivan (bass, backing vocals) in 2007, is no doubt also referring metaphorically to the freshness of their unique, freewheeling mix of country, rock, blues and punk that\u2019s helped them break through the genre-specific muck most indie bands prefer to stay safe in.\n\nWith a sound that has been aptly described as \u201cJohnny Cash meets Kurt Cobain\u201d (wrap your sensibilities around that for a minute!), Sunshine Riot\u2019s exciting aesthetic of party music and heartfelt songwriting about finding optimism and digging out of life\u2019s most hellish circumstances has been lauded everywhere from their home region to just about every spot on their traveling itinerary. Feedback Fury in Michigan said, \u201cThis band has it all.\u201d The Observer in Nashville called them \u201cone of the most remarkable live acts Boston has seen in a long, long time.\u201d The Daily Dose in Providence made reference to their \u201cgreat, genre-defying songwriting,\u201d while The Noise from NYC, where Sunshine Riot plays frequently, sounded a bit envious when it said, \u201cNew York should adopt Sunshine Riot\u2026these guys are about to explode.\u201d\n\nSunshine Riot also sets themselves apart from the indie pack by hitting the road as often as possible \u2013 to the tune of 80-100 shows per year. Their hardcore DIY work ethic extends beyond the studio to their super-aggressive approach to self-booking these shows, which are up and down the I-95 corridor on the East Coast, through the Mid-West and down to the South East. The band often books shows with popular local artists, and has built their growing fan base throughout the country.\n\nSunshine Riot, which went through the typical indie band type personality and chemistry struggles in its first few years, began kicking it into high gear when they met and began working with George Dussault, a 16 time Grammy nominated producer, multi-instrumentalist, engineer, composer and founder of Galilee Productions. Dussault, who has worked onstage and in the studio with hundreds of artists, has long called Sunshine Riot \u201ca great soulful band, a favorite of mine.\u201d A year later, the group found the last missing puzzle piece in guitarist Mark Tetrault. After struggling for some time to define its musical vision, Tetrault\u2019s melodicism and intensity had an enormous effect on honing in on their current vibe.\n\n\u201cI think the difference is that our creed became that we just want to write good songs, not trying specifically to be punk, straight rock, blues, country, low-fi or anything else, because just writing a good song is hard enough,\u201d says Johnny, who writes most of Sunshine Riot\u2019s lyrics while the entire band collaborates on music. \u201cWriting with people is kind of an intimate experience, but also a little scary \u2013 and if you don\u2019t trust the people you work with, you\u2019re not going to write good songs. If you don\u2019t trust your collaborators, you\u2019re only going to write cautious music,\u201d the singer adds.\n\nWhile most of their songs in one way or another are personalized reflections of their real life battles between struggle and hope, they range in vibe from mainstream rock (\u201cOld School Blues\u201d) to blistering punk (\u201cSenorita Punk\u201d), edgy roots-rock (\u201cNatural Causes\u201d) and thoughtful rock-soul (\u201cElizabeth Stone,\u201d which features the dynamic R&B vocals of veteran performer Carl Smitty Smooth).

Musically, they\u2019re a cohesive, balanced package of punk in all its amalgamations, the trio acting as a unit that play off of each other and with each other, always asking what the next best move might be.\n\nHopped up on a steady diet of everything, SAVAK are broadcasting shared sentiments that we feel when we hear\u2014all the more illuminating during this dark and tumultuous timeline. It\u2019s a call to action for ourselves and for each other."}, {"Address": "1409 Queen Anne Rd, Teaneck, NJ 07666", "Artist": "All Hail The Yeti ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10172491.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.0048, 40.90166], "Date": "Sat Apr 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-11", "Genre": "Metal, Hard Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Debonair Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "As the moniker cryptically suggests, the music of ALL HAIL THE YETI evokes a hair-raising mixture of superstitious ritual and trippy backwoods folklore.

Still, Couvares is determined to age gracefully in an increasingly crestfallen era of draconian politics and disenchantment on his upcoming release, When This All Ends (out April 24), mixed by Charlie Stavish (Jenny Lewis, Interpol, Weezer) and mastered by Robin Schmidt (The 1975, The Japanese House, Ben Howard).\n\nWhen This All Ends is a coming of age tale for Couvares, who plans to keep exuberance intact but yearns to jettison reckless abandon and feckless joy, now a 26-year-old working-class citizen; and while he may not be The Only Living Boy in New York, he\u2019s not impervious to loneliness. Swallowing the dregs that remain of youthful naivet\u00e9, the unassuming crooner yields wistful, spirited coos akin to Ezra Koenig and Morning Benders era Chris Chu. Through character-driven exploits of the heart and semi-autobiographical accounts, Couvo\u2019s lyrics take precedence, though his big-hearted choruses on songs like \u201cStill Hanging On\u201d and \u201cGloria Steinem\u201d remain unaffected, and equally poignant.\n\nOn \u201cStill Hanging On,\u201d Couvares manages to wax humor alongside poetry, by capturing an awestruck revelation - the field noise of a would-be laureate outside of Roberta\u2019s Pizza & Bakery on Moore Street, who exclaims, \u201cWait, wait, wait - but also - we can do takeaway,\u201d as if struck by a bolt of lightning. Although Brooklyn is quite the bitter pill at times, Couvares invites all of his high school friends from Manchester, CT inside the studio to wrangle warmth and nostalgia on the chorus of \u201cStill Hanging On\u201d; the first half of the track presents minimal instrumentation, with caj\u00f3n, a charming piano cadence, acoustic and electric guitar balladry and soothing vocals, only to give rise to a bigger and jazzier arrangement, replete with a Clarence-esque sax solo, a full drum kit, and the aforementioned chorus of dear friends.\n\n\u201cTo all my friends that I grew up with, who I don\u2019t see anymore/To all those nights when we had no idea what it was that we were living for/You know those days are over/We\u2019re all just getting older/And I know those years are gone/My dreams, they\u2019ve been a little bent and bruised/But they\u2019re still hangin\u2019 on.\u201d\n\n\u201cGloria Steinem\u201d sedates the listener with sizzling auxiliary percussion, ethereal guitar swells, rapturous saxophone, and another big chorus that presupposes the taxing journey and romantic interest of a rich girl who exhibits a duality in the spirit of Roxanne Gay\u2019s Bad Feminist: on one hand, she\u2019s \u201ccoked out of her mind/Lower East Side all the time,\u201d and on the other, the narrator reveals, \u201cShe had this little letter that she wrote when she was seven/To the person she\u2019d become/How she would be a doctor, and a lawyer and a mother, and the president all at once,\u201d illuminating (quite literally) the ridiculous laundry list of gratuitous expectations society places on women, and the letter is - in turn - upended by a zippo lighter. Meanwhile, the narrator explains, \u201cAll she ever wanted was to be Gloria Steinem/ But the gig was already booked.\u201d It\u2019s the story of a rich girl and a poor boy, talking in circles as they try to relate to one another, and all the while, not being ready for any burdensome chapters that come with being an adult in real-time. Then again, who is?\n\n\u201cGoon Squad,\u201d which Couvares describes as \u201cthe heart of the record,\u201d continues the boy-meets-world-and-falls-in-love-with-a-girl, drunk-on-a-Summer-day-in-Brooklyn narrative, with just a dash of spite at the behest of blame, as the unreliable narrator is called out on truths that, perhaps hit too close to home; Couvares also begs the question, how does anyone truly know what\u2019s best for their significant other, as we try, earnestly, not to burst any bubbles, in the name of love? \u201cAnd if I\u2019m another boy like the rest/You\u2019re a question mark in a Summer dress,\u201d Couvares declares.\n\n\u201cThe older I get, the harder it is to feel anything,\u201d says Couvares, and as we all know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Skylarking aside - and when we strip all the trivial pursuits of escapism away from our lives - it\u2019s hard to proclaim what one should focus on when they pore over both socioeconomic status, and even harder to occasionally enjoy one\u2019s adulthood in the ghost of their youth, without first considering what\u2019s left behind, when this all ends.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Liberty State Park, Jersey City, NJ 07305", "Artist": "Kaya Nicole ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8864358.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.050941, 40.702635], "Date": "Sat Apr 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-11", "Genre": "Folk, Bossa Nova, Roots & Blues, Acoustic, Jazz, Soul", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Maritime Parc", "moreBioInfo": "Kaya is a singer, songwriter and guitarist born and raised in New York.

It is well known as one of the poorest regions in the Philippines. Born and raised here, singer/songwriter Otan Vargas spent his formative years surrounded mostly by poverty and despair. It is this humble background which helps motivate him to this very day. Vargas\u2019 music is a powerfully simplistic combination of melancholy vocals accompanied by a brooding acoustic guitar. He writes songs about man\u2019s struggle, sorrow and pain and finding the strength to continue on. What started out simply as a means of personal therapy for himself has transformed into an inspirational beacon for adoring fans worldwide.\n\nVargas grew up immersed in music from an early age. His father is an accomplished international entertainer and his siblings all sing and play musical instruments. But it wasn\u2019t until the age of 17 that Otan would start playing the acoustic guitar. Around that time, he also began to follow his father to his shows in the Philippines. It was a great experience for him to see his dad perform live and learn how he handled business matters. But ironically, the family discouraged Otan from pursuing a career in music knowing firsthand how difficult the industry could be.\n\nIn 2006, Vargas travelled to the United States for the first time and would soon settle in with family members in New York. With no serious intentions of becoming a musician at the time, he recorded some videos of himself playing guitar and singing at a friend\u2019s house and uploaded them to YouTube for fun. By a strange twist of fate, the videos gained some popularity on YouTube and eventually ended up being viewed by Aaron Lewis \u2013 vocalist of the rock band Staind.\nOtan\u2019s big break came in 2009 when Aaron Lewis unexpectedly invited him on stage to play a song at the Borgata Hotel and Casinos in Atlantic City, NJ. His somewhat nervous, yet captivating rendition of Staind\u2019s hit song \u201cIt\u2019s Been Awhile\u201d elicited a standing ovation from the crowd. The video of that performance also spread quickly on YouTube. Shortly after, Otan would release his full-length debut album \u201cAlone\u201d in which he sings about enduring suffering, battling the voices within and trying to find a constant peace for his soul. The album was recorded mainly in one live take with an acoustic guitar and a single vocal microphone, a rarity in this digital age of multi-track recording. Otan describes his genre of music as \u201cOrganic Rock\u201d. The songs are focused more on the emotional content and lyrical meaning than the skill or technique involved. He says, \u201cwhen I write, I always follow where the song wants to go rather than following a certain structure or formula.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Vargas would perform his original songs for the first time in front of a huge audience of 5,000+ at the Jones Beach Bandshell in New York. And in 2011, he shared the stage with Corey Taylor of Slipknot/Stone Sour, Aaron Lewis of Staind, Lo Pro and Tesla for the \u201cIt Takes a Community Charity Concert\u201d at the Pines Theater in Northampton, MA.\n\nIn 2012, Otan released a new EP entitled \u201cSelected Sorrow.\u201d The EP contained the song \u201cHollow Destination\u201d which was featured in the documentary film \u201cBattlefield of the Mind.\u201d Produced by renowned videographer Fran Strine, the documentary touches on the plight of neglected US veterans who suffer from PTSD and homelessness. It offered a soundtrack which included well known artists such as Mike Mushok of Staind, Pete Murray of Lo Pro and several others including Otan Vargas.\n\nThe following year, Vargas would travel across country by train from his New York residence to perform at the legendary Whisky A Go Go in West Hollywood, CA for the world premiere of the documentary. Others performing on the same stage, were members of the bands Megadeth, Staind, Evanescence and Eye Empire.\n\nIn 2014, Vargas would record a second EP \u201cOrigins\u201d with producer Johnny April of Staind. The recording exhibited Vargas\u2019 growing range as a musical artist and included several guest musicians to create more of a rock band feel. He followed up the album with a two-week tour of the Northeast U.S., performing 13 shows in 15 nights.\nIn 2015, Otan would again take the stage alongside Aaron Lewis of Staind. This time in Oklahoma for the Boot Campaign Foundation, an organization that supports US troops and their families.\n\nThen in 2016, Vargas would continue his charitable concert appearances with a performance at the Grand Theatre in Foxwoods Resort and Casinos for the Reach Foundation. The concert featured members of the bands Seether, Staind, Three Days Grace and Saint Asonia.\n\nMost recently, Vargas\u2019 has recorded a new single called \u201cGround\u201d which features some veteran New York rock musicians including drummer Sal G. of Staind. Vargas experimented with a new formula for this heavy rock project. For the first time, he recorded only the vocal parts and did not include any acoustic guitar. Look for an official release in early 2017.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long, unexpected journey, but all these experiences have developed Otan into a well-respected musician in the rock world and beyond.

As he unleashes his high-energy music to fans all over the world, Castro is inspired by the sounds he absorbed while coming of age on the rough and tumble side of San Jose, California. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, this was Castro\u2019s home turf\u2014his stomping ground. It was a place where the street-tough Mexican Americans and the counter-culture hippies came together to drink, smoke, laugh, party and listen to tunes\u2014the hippies with their blues and rock, the Mexicans with their soul music. Mixing the blues-rock he loved and the soul music he heard blasting out from the lowriders cruising the streets, along with the socially conscious message songs of the day, Tommy\u2019s own sound was born. He honed his guitar playing to a razor\u2019s edge on the city\u2019s competitive bar scene, where he learned how to capture an audience with his intensely passionate vocals, stellar musicianship and dynamic performances. Almost every major rock and soul act, from Ike & Tina Turner to Janis Joplin to Elvin Bishop to Taj Mahal, toured through the area, and Castro was at almost every show. He saw John Lee Hooker, Albert King and Buddy Guy & Junior Wells at the same local blues bar, JJ\u2019s, where he often jammed, dreaming of one day busting out.\n\nOver the course of his career, Tommy Castro\u2019s San Jose DNA has always inspired his music, whether he\u2019s squeezing out the deepest blues or the funkiest soul grooves. He and The Painkillers\u2014bassist Randy McDonald, keyboardist Michael Emerson and drummer Bowen Brown\u2014have played hundreds of shows to thousands of music lovers, always leaving his audiences screaming for more. All of his albums are filled with original blues, soul and West Coast rock, each song showing a slightly different side of Castro\u2019s multifaceted musical personality. Billboard says the band plays \u201cirresistible contemporary blues-rock\u201d with \u201cstreet-level grit and soul.\u201d\n\nOn his new album, Stompin\u2019 Ground, Tommy Castro opens windows into both his past and his always-evolving musical future. Produced by Castro and guitar wunderkind Kid Andersen and recorded at Andersen\u2019s soon-to-be legendary Greaseland Studio in San Jose, Stompin\u2019 Ground finds Castro letting loose on a set of 12 tracks featuring six originals and new versions of songs he learned and played as a young up-and-comer. He is simultaneously looking back with autobiographical originals and cover songs that inspired him, while forging a forward trail with modern lyrics atop blistering blues-rock. With The Painkillers firing on all cylinders behind him, Castro lays it all on the line from the opening notes of Nonchalant to the final, introspective Live Every Day. From the autobiographical My Old Neighborhood to the socially aware Enough Is Enough and Fear is The Enemy to versions of Elvin Bishop\u2019s Rock Bottom and Taj Majal\u2019s Further On Down The Road (two of his favorite songs from his earliest heroes), Stompin\u2019 Ground is pure musical pleasure. \u201cAs soon as we started cutting,\u201d Castro says, \u201cwe knew we were onto something.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the The Painkillers, Castro\u2019s friends Charlie Musselwhite (harp and vocals on Live Every Day), Mike Zito (guitar and vocals on Rock Bottom), Danielle Nicole (vocals on Soul Shake) and Los Lobos\u2019 David Hidalgo (guitar and vocals on Them Changes) add their talents to Stompin\u2019 Ground. \u201cI heard each one of my friends\u2019 contributions to these songs in my head as I was working on them. Happily, when I reached out and actually asked, everyone said yes.\u201d\n\nBorn in San Jose, California in 1955, Tommy Castro first picked up a guitar at age 10. He fell under the spell of Eric Clapton, Elvin Bishop, Taj Mahal, Mike Bloomfield and other blues-rockers. As he got older, Castro discovered the bedrock blues of Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Freddie King, Buddy Guy, Elmore James and the deep-rooted soul of singers like Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett and James Brown. By his teenage years, he was regularly heading to San Francisco to see his favorite artists at legendary venues like The Fillmore West and Winterland. He began playing in a variety of Bay Area blues and soul bands in his early 20s, making a name for himself as a hotter than hot live artist. In 1985 he became lead singer and guitarist for the locally popular blues band NiteCry, and began gigging regularly throughout Northern California.\n\nCastro joined Warner Brothers\u2019 artists The Dynatones in the late 1980s, gigging all over the country. He formed the first Tommy Castro Band in 1991, releasing his debut album in 1996 on Blind Pig. He hit the road hard, picking up new followers everywhere he went. In the mid-1990s The Tommy Castro Band served as the house band for three seasons on NBC Television\u2019s Comedy Showcase (airing right after Saturday Night Live), bringing him in front of millions of viewers every week. During the 1990s and into the 2000s, Castro released a series of critically acclaimed CDs for Blind Pig, Telarc and 33rd Street Records, as well as one on his own Heart And Soul label.\n\nCastro joined Alligator Records in 2009, releasing Hard Believer to massive acclaim. He won four of his six career Blues Music Awards including the coveted B.B. King Entertainer Of The Year Award (the very highest award a blues performer can receive). His song Hard Believer took first place in the blues category of the International Songwriting Competition. His next release, 2011\u2019s Tommy Castro Presents The Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue\u2013Live!, was a boisterous and searing collection of highlights from a series of live performances anchored by Castro and an all-star collection of blues giants, including Rick Estrin, Michael \u201cIron Man\u201d Burks and Joe Louis Walker. His relentless road-dog approach\u2014gig after gig, night after night\u2014has won him loyal, lifelong fans everywhere he plays. The Washington Post says Castro is \u201cphenomenal and funky\u201d with \u201csoulful vocals and inspired blues-rock guitar.\u201d\n\nCastro formed The Painkillers in 2012, creating a lean, mean four-piece lineup, capable of delivering soul-shaking, muscular music. The band released The Devil You Know in 2014 and Method To My Madness in 2015, with critics shouting praise and admirers cheering his every move. Castro had stripped his music down to its raw essence with the new, smaller band, sounding bigger than ever. On record and on stage, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers\u2019 road-hardened, seemingly telepathic musicianship bring an unmatched passion to Castro\u2019s blue-eyed California soul and hard-rocking, good-time songs. His hometown newspaper, The San Francisco Chronicle, describes Castro\u2019s music as, \u201cfunky Southern soul, big city blues and classic rock...silvery guitar licks that simultaneously sound familiar and fresh.\u201d\n\nWith months of tour dates across the U.S. and Europe, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers will be bringing the songs from their new album directly to their fans. No Depression says \u201cCastro plays gritty, string-bending blues like a runaway soul train...a glorious blend that rocks the soul and lifts the spirits.\u201d Blues Revue says simply, \u201cTommy Castro can do no wrong.\u201d With Stompin\u2019 Ground, he is clearly, once again, doing everything right.", "otherInfo": "Tommy Castro April 11th 10PM Eastern\nCant Stop The Blues\n\n\u201cCastro\u2019s aggressive, inspired attack on vocals and guitar is phenomenal.\u201d \u2013Washington Post\n\nWhether he\u2019s squeezing out the deepest blues or playing the funkiest soul grooves, legendary blues and soul giant Tommy Castro knows how to ignite a crowd. Over the course of his still-unfolding career, the guitarist, vocalist and songwriter has released 15 albums ranging from horn-fueled soul and R&B to piping hot blues to fiery rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.
