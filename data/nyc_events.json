In this case, it was the unique environment that he fostered at Terrapin Crossroads, the music venue that he recently opened in Marin County, CA.\n\nUsing the Grateful Dead songbook as a springboard for reinterpretation and as inspiration to create original material, theTFB musicians were inspired as much by one another as they were by the diverse group of influences that they brought to the table; as a result, the music conveyed friendship, respect, warmth, and companionship for listeners and performers alike.\n\n'Family' isn't just a moniker for the group, either. The first person that Phil brought on was Grahame Lesh, his son. From the beginning Grahame's guitar chops, powerful vocals and harmonic touch helped form the backbone of the band's sound.\n\nKeeping with the family theme is Alex Koford, a longtime family friend whom Phil recruited to be his drummer. It quickly became apparent that Alex had a voice to match his drumming ability, and before long he was pulling a 'Levon Helm,' delivering soaring vocal leads while pounding away on the drums.\n\nThen, there is the man of many talents, Jason Crosby. He started playing violin at the age of 2, discovered he had perfect pitch not longer thereafter, and then proceeded to master virtually every instrument known to man. You can usually find him on the piano or violin with the Terrapin Family Band, adding a delicate touch here, a perfect note there.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, is our very own Ross James. The dynamic, bearded guitarist wowed crowds from the moment he burst onto the scene at Terrapin Crossroads, and it wasn't long before his distinct sound and style were as recognizable at Terrapin as Phil's bass bombs. Combine Ross with the two Lesh men, and you've got about as electric a musical front-court as you can find anywhere.\n\nOver time, the band's music has developed organically, merging and fusing each musician's influences (including rock, folk, punk, jazz, metal, psychedelic, experimental, classical) into a hard-rockin' sound rooted in the communal/collective, telepathic, exploratory spirit of the Grateful Dead.\n\nWhat began as a house band for Phil's Terrapin Crossroads has turned into something much more, and the band is excited to take the unique Terrapin Family Band sound outside of their home turf as they explore new musical grounds.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "61 Wythe Ave, New York, NY 11249", "Artist": "James Casey", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.957549, 40.722053], "Date": "Thu Mar 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-05", "Genre": "Genres: Solo Musician, Other", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Bowl", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "61 Wythe Ave, New York, NY 11249", "Artist": "Alex Koford", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9178061.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.957549, 40.722053], "Date": "Thu Mar 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-05", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Bowl", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "40-19 Gleane St, Queens County, NY 11373", "Artist": "Remy Le Boeuf", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10222095.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.882015, 40.747512], "Date": "Thu Mar 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-05", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Modern Jazz", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Terraza 7", "moreBioInfo": "Described as by the New York Times as a \u201cmusically precocious\u201d saxophonist and composer who embodies \u201cthe gleaming cosmopolitanism of our present era,\u201d Remy Le Boeuf has performed and had his works featured throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. Known for his integration of classical, jazz, and indie-rock genres, Mr. Le Boeuf has received many of today\u2019s most prestigious honors and awards for composition and performance. While envisioning his approach to composition and improvisation as never veering far from the roots of language, Le Boeuf often employs literary elements to fuel his compositions.

Mr. Le Boeuf is currently touring the release of his latest album, \u201cIn Praise of Shadows,\u201d under Nineteen-Eight Records, in which he continues to sculpt his compositions after the initial recording process, using modern production techniques, sampling, and layered arranging/recording methods.

Internationally known for classic standards, late-night ballads, and the cool jazz flavor he brings to his performances and recordings, he has recently established himself as the consummate entertainer and radio program host with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli\" a nationally syndicated radio program co-hosted with his wife, Broadway star Jessica Molaskey.\n\nBorn on April 6, 1960, in Paterson, New Jersey, Pizzarelli has been playing guitar since age six, following in the tradition of his father, guitar legend Bucky Pizzarelli. Hanging out with his father, John was exposed to all the great jazz music of the era, from Erroll Garner and Les Paul to Django Reinhardt. He began playing with his father at age 20, before going out on his own.\n\nJohn Pizzarelli has recorded as a bandleader for RCA, Chesky, Stash and Novus, and in 1997 appeared in the Broadway musical Dream, a revue of Johnny Mercer songs. Along the way, Pizzarelli and his band have earned rave reviews. Reviewers often compare the Pizzarelli Trio to jazz icons such as Nat \"King\" Cole: \"The John Pizzarelli Trio has never been tighter, and Pizzarelli himself has never been looser,\" said The Village Voice of a recent New York show. \"We can say we\u2019re as lucky to listen to [Pizzarelli] as Nat Cole fans were in the years before he became a legend.\"\n\nFor Pizzarelli, the comparison to the Nat \"King\" Cole Trio is the highest of compliments. \"I've always said in my concerts that Nat 'King' Cole is why I do what I do.\" Using greats like Nat \"King\" Cole and Frank Sinatra and the songs of writers like Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen as touchstones, Pizzarelli is among the prime contemporary interpreters of the great American songbook, bringing to the work his signature style and brilliant guitar playing.\n\nWith Telarc\u2019s recent release of Dear Mr. Sinatra, an homage to 'Ol' Blue Eyes,' Pizzarelli's album count now stands at 21, an odyssey that began with My Blue Heaven in 1990. Some of his most recent CDs include, Knowing You (Telarc 2005), Bossa Nova (Telarc 2004), and Live at Birdland (Telarc 2003).\n\n\nA veteran radio personality, Pizzarelli hosted \"New York Tonight\" on WNEW from 1984-1988. Now, with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli,\" he brings warmth, humor and that long-lost \"live\" feel back to radio. The show takes place in their \"deluxe living room,\" where he and his guests play live and recorded music, and enjoy conversation that is relaxed, candid, and off-the-cuff. Recent guests include Regis Philbin, Liza Minnelli, Peter Cincotti, Keely Smith, Steve Tyrell and Tony Danza.\n\nIn addition to being a bandleader, radio personality and solo performer, John has been a special guest on recordings for major pop names such as James Taylor, Natalie Cole, Tom Wopat, Rickie Lee Jones and Dave Von Ronk, as well as leading jazz artists like Rosemary Clooney, Ruby Braff, Johnny Frigo, Buddy DeFranco, Harry Allen and, of course, Bucky Pizzarelli. He was recently featured opposite Donna Summer, Jon Secada and Roberta Flack on the Grammy Award winning CD, Songs From The Neighborhood: The Music of Mr. Rogers.\n\nJohn has performed numerous times on the country's most popular national television shows such as \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" \"The Late Show with David Letterman,\" \"Live With Regis & Kelly,\" \"The Tony Danza Show,\" \"The CBS Early Show,\" Fox News Channel and Jerry Lewis's Labor Day Telethon.\n\nPizzarelli continues to tour throughout the United States, Europe and Japan, performing classic pop, jazz and swing, while setting the standard for stylish modern jazz.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1650 Broadway, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "King Solomon Hicks", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9715111.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983533, 40.761865], "Date": "Thu Mar 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-05", "Genre": "Genres: Blues", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Iridium", "moreBioInfo": "\"King\" Solomon Hicks is an American blues guitarist born in Harlem, NY.

I just wanted off the road. I needed to see what it was like to live at home and write some songs.\u201d\n\nIt was a risky move to walk away from the safety and security of his career as one of music\u2019s most in-demand sidemen, but Crosby\u2019s decision to experience a different kind of life helped plant the seeds that now, nearly a decade later, have blossomed into his exceptionally beautiful debut album, \u2018Cryptologic.\u2019 Split essentially into two halves, one in which Crosby plays nearly every instrument himself, and another in which he\u2019s backed by Golden State stalwarts The Mother Hips, the record showcases both Crosby\u2019s instrumental prowess and his unflinching honesty as a lyricist and singer. He digs deep on the album, most of which was written after his 2013 relocation from New York City to Marin County, California, painting vivid portraits of characters on the hunt for redemption and renewal.\n\nIf Crosby\u2019s name isn\u2019t immediately familiar, his keyboard/violin/guitar playing most likely is. The multi-instrumental virtuoso has toured and recorded with a who\u2019s who of legendary artists, including Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, Pete Seeger, Dave Matthews, The Blind Boys of Alabama, Robert Randolph, and Susan Tedeschi among others. He\u2019s graced the stages of the world\u2019s biggest festivals and appeared on television everywhere from The Tonight Show and Austin City Limits to Jools Holland and the GRAMMY Awards, where he played keyboard in the tribute to Funk with Outkast, the original P-Funk, and Earth, Wind & Fire. Upon landing in California, he took up gigs with Jackie Greene, The Mother Hips, John McLaughlin and Jimmy Herring, and Grateful Dead icons Phil Lesh and Bob Weir, and he soon discovered an audience hungry for the original material he\u2019d begun crafting during his hiatus from the road.\n\n\u201cWhen I was living in New York, I was playing for tips at the Living Room and Rockwood Music Hall and burning through my savings from all those years as a sideman,\u201d Crosby remembers. \u201cBut California embraced me as an artist. I started playing with Phil and Bob and doing my own shows at their clubs, and pretty quickly I was selling hundreds of tickets myself as a headliner.\u201d\n\nWhen Crosby met Blue Rose Music founder Joe Poletto, it felt like a sign from the universe that the time had arrived to take the plunge and record his first album as a singer/songwriter. Crosby headed into the Stinson Beach studio of producer/engineer Karl Derfler (Tom Waits, Dave Matthews) for two whirlwind sessions, each capturing a different side of his musical personality. The first, conducted in the spring of 2016, featured Crosby playing roughly a dozen different instruments, deliberately crafting each song from the ground up by himself with an ambient, compellingly visual quality. The second session, a more raw and reckless affair that went down just a few months later, tapped into the wild and collaborative spirit of rock and roll that\u2019s always flowed through Crosby\u2019s veins, as he captured a new batch of songs (co-written with Tim Bluhm) live in the studio with The Mother Hips as his backing band.\n\nRichly cinematic and enchantingly playful, the resulting album reveals Crosby to be not only an unparalleled instrumentalist, but also a supremely talented songwriter. The record opens with the emotional \u201cFinal Step,\u201d which builds from a spare, finger- picked ukulele into a densely orchestrated crescendo beneath Crosby\u2019s double-tracked vocals, which at times call to mind Beck or Grandaddy\u2019s Jason Lyttle in their understated directness. The song, like much of the album, deals with loss, both literally and metaphorically, but accepts it with the understanding that the conclusion of any one chapter is only just the beginning of the next.\n\n\u201cWriting these songs was my way of saying to myself, \u2018Look, you\u2019ve traversed the country, you made it to California, things are looking up,\u2019\u201d Crosby explains.\n\nOn \u201cRoads Are Torn,\u201d he locates the beauty in isolation and sadness, while the alternately Stones-y and psychedelic \u201cBelow Horizons\u201d finds hope in forgiveness, and the poignant \u201cGoodbye My Friend\u201d sees him reassuring the listener (or perhaps himself) that \u201cit\u2019s hard admitting it\u2019s the beginning of the end,\u201d but \u201cyou\u2019re gonna find it again.\u201d Though the album doesn\u2019t shy away from heavy topics, a mischievous sense of fun still shines through. The record draws its title from a driving, bluesy song Crosby co-wrote with Bluhm called \u201cWas I Ever There?\u201d which imagines entries from a \u201ccryptologic captain\u2019s log.\u201d It\u2019s trippy stuff (the narrator is a piloting a ship through the fourth dimension), but it\u2019s not hard to hear a personal allegory in there as Crosby sings, \u201cWhen the light is right and I squint my sight / I can almost get there.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the album plays out as a work of catharsis, but more than that, it\u2019s a leap of faith from an artist willing to push beyond what\u2019s comfortable in order to follow his muse. It\u2019s our first real glimpse of Jason Crosby not as a sideman, but simply as a man, one striding boldly into the spotlight after a career spent in the artistic service of others. Crosby\u2019s courage to step off the proverbial edge before a net appears has reaped him both artistic and personal rewards throughout his career, but in the case of \u2018Cryptologic,\u2019 it\u2019s yielded his greatest triumph yet.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "61 Wythe Ave, New York, NY 11249", "Artist": "Ross James", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7799305.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.957549, 40.722053], "Date": "Thu Mar 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-05", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, Country, Psychedelic Rock", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Bowl", "moreBioInfo": "Guit-box & pedal steel. @texbacon", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1650 Broadway, New York, NY 11207", "Artist": "King Solomon", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9837590.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983533, 40.761865], "Date": "Thu Mar 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-05", "Genre": "Genres: Blues Funk Roots Jazz Rock", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Iridium Jazz Club", "moreBioInfo": "SOLOMON HICKS\n\nEntertainer- guitarist-singer music prodigy.

As a member of the band Midnight North, she\u2019s appeared on bills with the likes of Bonnie Raitt and The Mother Hips and slayed festivals from Lockn\u2019 to Hardly Strictly Bluegrass. Now, with her mesmerizing solo debut, Peck is stepping center stage, ready to prove she\u2019s a talent more than worthy of the spotlight on her own.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing songs for a long time and I\u2019ve been really fortunate these last few years to perform with so many great musicians,\u201d says Peck, \u201cbut I wanted to try something different with this album. I wanted to focus on writing for myself, to see if I could come up with something that I\u2019d be proud to call my own.\u201d\n\nRecorded in Oakland with producer Karl Derfler (Tom Waits, Dave Matthews), \u2018Further From The Storm\u2019 is Peck\u2019s first release under her own name and her debut album for the burgeoning Blue Rose Music artist collective. Weaving together the disparate threads of American roots into a captivating whole, the record serves as a brilliant showcase not only for Peck\u2019s vocal prowess, but also for her meticulous craftsmanship. She writes with a breezy vulnerability, a plainspoken and unflinching honesty that belies her songs\u2019 subtle sophistication as she draws on classic country, blues, R&B, and jazz to create an utterly timeless collection. It\u2019s the kind of music that demands repeated listening, revealing new rewards with each and every drop of the needle.\n\nRaised on a farm in rural Michigan, Peck first became enamored with live music through family trips to the Windy City.\n\n\u201cThere were more animals than people where I grew up,\u201d says Peck, \u201cbut even though it was really isolated there, my parents were music lovers who would drive us down to Chicago for concerts and festivals. I saw Koko Taylor and Ray Charles and just fell in love with the Chicago blues at a young age. It was the first music I started singing and it made me want to explore my voice.\u201d\n\nPeck moved to Chicago after graduating from college, but relocated to the San Francisco, California a few years later. There, she was introduced to the Bakersfield country sound, diving headfirst into old recordings by Merle Haggard and Buck Owens and tracing their legacy all the way up through contemporary keepers of the flame like Tim Bluhm and Greg Loiacono. Quickly embraced in the Bay Area, Peck began singing and writing alongside Grahame Lesh in Midnight North, which would go on to release three studio albums in addition to touring nationally and serving as the house band at the famed Terrapin Crossroads. Relix praised the outfit\u2019s soulful, harmonized vocals,\u201d while The Washington Post hailed their \u201cexuberant, twangy\u201d sound, and Pop Matters raved that \u201cPeck shines\u201d in the band, \u201cdelivering a bluesy country rock vocal.\u201d\n\nAt the encouragement of Blue Rose founder Joe Poletto, Peck began exploring alternative avenues of her songwriting, penning a batch of tunes with a different feel than her Midnight North material. The songs were tighter and more succinct in their architecture, crafted with an eye towards more traditional pop structures and organic arrangements. She dove deep, fine-tuning the material with Derfler before recording a single note. When it was finally time to head into the studio, Derfler assembled an all-star lineup of musicians to help bring the music to life: bassist David Hayes (Van Morrison, Sheryl Crow), guitarist James DePrato (Chuck Prophet, Country Joe McDonald), drummer Kevin Hayes (Robert Cray, Old Crow Medicine Show), pedal steel guitarist Dan Lebowitz (ALO, Jack Johnson, Donovan Frankenreiter), keyboardist Patrick Warren (Joan Baez, Bob Dylan), and organist Jason Crosby (Eric Clapton, Robert Randolph).\n\n\u201cIn the past, I\u2019d always recorded with a band that had played live and rehearsed together,\u201d says Peck. \u201cThis album was the first time I\u2019d taken such raw material and developed with new musicians on the fly. It was definitely challenging and it really pushed me as an artist, but it turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences I\u2019ve ever had in the studio.\u201d\n\nThe record begins with an arresting a capella moment, as punchy three-part harmonies burst forth and give way to the soulful, hypnotizing album opener \u201cRiver\u2019s Path.\u201d Backed by Tim Bluhm and frequent Mavis Staples backup singer Vicki Randle, Peck\u2019s voice is silky and textured, weathered with character and loaded with emotion. It\u2019s an ideal introduction to an eclectic album that moves freely between genres and moods, tied together at every turn by its stunning vocal performances. Songs like the waltzing \u201cAnother Life Ago\u201d and shuffling \u201cHard Lines\u201d are lean and playful, while the melancholy \u201cLeave Me By The Sea\u201d and tender \u201cOut Sailing\u201d are lush and poignant. Peck digs into reimagined versions of The Trishas\u2019 \u201cGive It Away\u201d and Lucinda Williams\u2019 \u201cI Lost It\u201d as powerfully as if they were her own, and she the raises the tempo and intensity for gritty rockers like \u201cHighway Song\u201d and \u201cGood For You I Guess.\u201d The collection covers a remarkable amount of stylistic ground, but that should come as little surprise considering Peck\u2019s pedigree and her mentors.\n\n\u201cPhil Lesh has always pushed me to think outside the box,\u201d says Peck. \u201cI\u2019ve adopted his policy of trying to keep things surprising, keep them interesting, keep them weird. There\u2019s comfort in writing a song and being done with it, but I\u2019ve learned from Phil not to be afraid to go back and rethink things and experiment with different sounds and progressions.\u201d\n\nThe end result is a record that defies expectations while still managing to feel warm and familiar. It\u2019s an invitation to dig deeper, to push below the surface in the search for honest expression and pure emotion. Even if you\u2019ve never heard her sing a note before, Peck sounds like the kind of songwriter you\u2019ve been listening to for years, and as she embarks on her newest chapter, it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s the kind of songwriter you\u2019ll be listening to for years to come, too.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "4 Stuyvesant Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11221", "Artist": "Sailor Boyfriend", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10145971.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.934907, 40.696607], "Date": "Thu Mar 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-05", "Genre": "Genres: New Wave, Synth Pop, Indie Rock, Dance Pop", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Jones Beach", "moreBioInfo": "Going for it, doing our best, having a good time.

Most quickly realize that such a feat is nearly impossible, but every once in a while someone manages the wonderful trick of putting a new spin on things in a way that sounds completely and wholly fresh.\n\nSuch is the case with Rene Lopez\u2019s new EP, Love Has No Mercy. While the veteran NYC musician\u2019s earlier records flirted with everything from salsa to soul, the seven tracks on Love are a decidedly more dance-friendly affair. The record\u2014which incorporates the sanguine Latin influences of his previous albums and interjects them with a healthy dose of disco and funk\u2014seems tailor made for both impromptu house parties and late nights at the club.\n\n\u201cThere was no grand plan,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cI wrote a ton of songs for my last record that I didn\u2019t end up using, so I booked some studio time and decided just to go in and kind of see what happened. I wrote \u201cLove Has No Mercy\u201d first and then the other songs just kind of happened. You know, I started off in the early 90\u2019s playing in a Latin funk band with an MC\u2014we\u2019d play with Public Enemy or The Meters or jam bands. We were kind of chameleons. I\u2019ve grown used taking all of my influences and then fusing them together into something new. I never felt very comfortable just working in one genre. This time around it just happened that I started to incorporate a dance sensibility into the work as well, which felt very natural.\u201d\n\nClocking in at just under 30 minutes, Love Has No Mercy is a remarkably slick statement of intent. The EPs title track, which features vocals from NYC powerhouse Carol Cee, is equal parts Chic and Giorgio Moroder\u2014a siren song of synthed-out futuristic disco that swings with the same kind of effortlessness that brings to mind the likes of \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and old school Donna Summer. In other words, it\u2019s a track that basically requires dancing. Elsewhere, tracks like \u201cLovegod\u201d and \u201cCity Streets are Dead Tonight\u201d pulse with same kind of subdued electro-funk that made early Prince and Rick James tracks so eternally irresistible. For Lopez, the tracks represent a natural musical evolution\u2014a move from the sweaty rock and Latin grooves of his previous albums to a place located firmly on the dance floor.\n\nThe somewhat kaleidoscopic array of influences manifesting on Love Has No Mercy make sense considering Lopez\u2019 rich musical heritage. A native New Yorker (and the son of renowned salsa musician Rene Lopez, Sr), Lopez grew up absorbing the non-stop musical melting pot that the city had to offer, eventually channeling those influences into a his own music. A jazz trained drummer and multi-instrumentalist, Lopez recorded with a variety of band projects (The Authority, Extra Virgin) before taking wing as a solo artist, eventually perfecting a style that he came to refer to as E.L.S. (Electric Latin Soul). Though his previous solo records (People Are Just People, E.L.S., Paint The Moon Gold) flirted with the aesthetics of dance music, Love Has No Mercy embraces the spirit of classic 1970\u2019s NYC club culture.\n\n\u201cThis record is a first for me,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m just kind of dipping my toe into this new world. I\u2019m excited to see people remix these songs and for them to have a life out in the clubs. It makes sense when I think about the way I grew up. I was a kid during the disco era. I experienced my parents having epic dance parties in our living room. It just feels right to explore this kind of music right now. I can\u2019t wait to go out and play these songs for people and, hopefully, make them all dance.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E 27th St, New York, NY 10016", "Artist": "Dafnis Prieto / Dafnison Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8564235.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983746, 40.742276], "Date": "Thu Mar 5 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-05", "Genre": "Genres: Afro-Cuban, Jazz, Latin Jazz", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Jazz Standard", "moreBioInfo": "From Santa Clara, Cuba, Dafnis Prieto\u2019s revolutionary drumming techniques and compositions have had a powerful impact on the Latin and Jazz music scene, nationally and internationally.\n\nVarious honors include a 2011 MacArthur Fellowship, Up & Coming Musician of the Year from the Jazz Journalists Association in 2006, a 2018 GRAMMY Award and Latin GRAMMY nomination for Best Latin Jazz Album for Dafnis Prieto Big Band 'Back to the Sunset', a GRAMMY nomination for Best Latin Jazz Album for 'Absolute Quintet' in 2006, and a Latin GRAMMY nomination for Best New Artist in 2007.

Favorite musste daraufhin einen Gro\u00dfteil seiner Jugend in Waisenh\u00e4usern verbringen und wurde nat\u00fcrlich durch diese Zeit sehr beeinflusst. Er musste sich alleine durchschlagen und sammelte viele Erfahrungen, die ihn gepr\u00e4gt haben.\n\nIn dieser Zeit kam auch der erste Kontakt mit Rapmusik zustande.

Recording her debut full-length album in Mississippi brought her to the roots of the gospel she sang in the church and the soul music she heard on the block on hot summer nights growing up on the corner of Nostrand and Fulton. The powerful \u2018Jetlagger\u2019 comes out September 29 on Big Legal Mess, a Fat Possum subsidiary. \u201cThe south came to me and grabbed me and pulled me down there. The southern migration came up and got me. My neighbors in Bed-Stuy influenced me,\u201d she says.\n\nShe recalls that Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn was a very different place when she was growing up. \u201cIt was rough back then!,\u201d she exclaims. \u201cThere was lots of gang activity. One gang came after my brother and my dad came out with a lead pipe to protect him. It was really hairy. My older brother Junior protected me from all of that. He would intimidate all of the other guys.\u201d\n\nShe owes even more to Junior. Several years ago, on his deathbed suffering from kidney failure, he made her promise not to give up on a career as a singer. Those last days of his, she sang while he tapped his foot on the hospital bed at Kings County Hospital. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how else to comfort him,\u201d she recalls. He told her, \u201cI want you to sing; don\u2019t give up\u201d and she\u2019s kept that promise, playing gigs from One Penn Plaza in New York to the Boogie Woogie Festival in Brussels, Belgium, always wearing yellow on stage to honor him. \u201cIt\u2019s all for Junior now,\u201d she affirms.\n\nJimbo Mathus produced the album at Water Valley\u2019s Dial Back Sound and sent roughs to Bruce Watson, who swiftly signed Smith on for a full-length. He\u2019s become a secret weapon for Fat Possum and Big Legal Mess Records; in addition to being a solo artist and a founding member of the Squirrel Nut Zippers, Mathus has also produced Shinyribs, Luther Dickinson, The Seratones, and played on records by Valerie June, Buddy Guy, and Elvis Costello. \u201cYou exceeded all expectations,\u201d Mathus told her.\n\nThe trip was also Smith\u2019s first to the deep south. She recalls, \u201cIt took me out of my comfort zone. I got lost in a swamp one time and kind of freaked out! I\u2019m a quintessential city girl.\u201d\n\nSmith beams when talking about the sessions. \u201cIt was really wonderful. Everything was recorded live. I felt like I was Tina Turner and Etta James. I do well when I\u2019m performing. It was a real performance that had never been captured before.\u201d Anyone who\u2019s ever seen her live knows how absorbed she gets on stage and these sessions put her in that same place. She continues, \u201cThere\u2019s New York aggressiveness and passion. I get to a fever pitch. I\u2019m gone. I\u2019m not even there anymore. Something else takes over.\u201d\n\nMathus dug deep into the Mississippi and Memphis soul bags, unearthing \u201cFlying Sweet Angel of Joy\u201d by Famous L. Renfroe, a song with which Smith particularly connected. \u201cI believe in guardian angels. Jimbo picked up on that. I feel that I was giving voice for Famous. because he never really got a chance.\u201d Mathus also picked Isaac Hayes\u2019 \u201cDo Your Thing,\u201d which simmers with Memphis heat.\n\nThe raucous soul-rock of \u201cMan Child,\u201d the spare funk of \u201cShackles & Chains,\u201d and Blaxsploitation soundtrack feel of \u201cDurty Hustlin\u2019\u201d were all written or co-written by Mathus specifically for Smith. She gets rough, wrestling the title track to the ground; the song captures the late nights and lack of sleep inherent in a musician\u2019s life. First-call Memphis horn players Marc Franklin (Robert Cray, Lucero and Kirk Smothers (Don Bryant, Melissa Etheridge, Cyndi Lauper, Buddy Guy) were summoned to complete the album\u2019s sound.\n\n\u2018Jetlagger\u2019s\u2019 closer, the Staples Singers\u2019 \u201cCity In the Sky,\u201d connected her back to Bed-Stuy. She remembers, \u201cMy father was a church choir director. I was singing since I was five years old. I take it to church. I just break out, start speaking in tongues.\u201d She also heard gospel around the house every weekend. \u201cMy grandmother listened to nothing but gospel,\u201d she recalls, citing Mahalia Jackson and Reverend James Cleveland. \u201cEvery Sunday morning, she would get up and put on these records while dressing and praising the Lord. The furniture was plastic-covered. After lunch, it was more gospel music,\u201d she says. Bed-Stuy block parties would also have revivalist-style gospel acts. \u201cI\u2019m steeped in it!,\u201d she adds. Though a Seventh Day Adventist as a child, Smith is now a member of the Church of God in Christ.\n\nSeveral years ago while singing in Los Angeles, Bette\u2019s voice drew the attention of another artist who came up in the church \u2013 Ray Charles, who invited her to collaborate with him shortly before his passing. \u201cIt was the first inkling that I had greatness in me,\u201d she says.\n\nReviewers have noticed, too. On the strength of a 2016 EP, Bitch Magazine compared her to Lauren Hill and Erykah Badu, praising her \u201cstunning voice [and] powerful but pliable tone\u201d saying that her songs \u201ccut deep\u201d and calling her music \u201cremarkable.\u201d Bitch continues, \u201c[Smith\u2019s] individuality keeps her story in her own hands and gives her firm ground from which to leap into her career.

It\u2019s all confidence and power. The sexy slur and slide of Bette\u2019s voice, her roll of syllables, the phrasing and intonation all on target, all polished with gratifying verve. But the true sting is in Bette\u2019s ability to know exactly how to interpret a song -- her songs, or anyone else\u2019s.\u201d\n\nShe already can\u2019t wait for her next trip down south, when she\u2019s going to meet soul legends Al Green and Don Bryant. She says, \u201cIt feels like the circle is coming around. The gospel roots remain the same. This is timeless music \u2013 soul, rhythm and blues \u2013 Mississippi is the birthplace.

Turning to blank slates, Ashley\u2019s own originals grow in number and acclaim each year, with notable releases having topped dance music charts (iTunes, Beatport, AudioJelly), streamed in the millions (Spotify) and received regular airtime from BBC Radio 1\u2019s Pete Tong and Danny Howard, Avicii himself, David Guetta, W&W, Armin van Buuren, Dash Berlin & more.\n\nWallbridge is no stranger to commercial success.

Migrating the tunes to the crowds, his live performances have taken him from Europe to the USA and as far as Australasia, appearing at many prestigious venues including Exchange (Los Angeles), Omnia (San Diego), Ministry of Sound (London, UK) and Privilege, Ibiza. Ashley\u2019s ever-growing demand from fans has seen him perform at major festivals including Creamfields (Australia), Global Gathering (UK) and Sunset Music Festival (USA).

Organized by post-bop pianist Marc Cary, The Harlem Sessions (originating at Gin Fizz and now based at Smoke Jazz Club) invites musicians, poets, artists, philosophers and dancers to build and explore a new common repertoire with original ensemble arrangements. A key player in galvanizing this fresh and dynamic sense of cultural awareness, drummer/composer Curtis Nowosad was on hand anchoring the groove every week during the gathering\u2019s first years \u2013 and he\u2019s still part of the action today.\n\nHaving made his home in Harlem since 2013 when he was working on his masters at the Manhattan School of Music, the 31-year-old Canadian native emerges as a powerful musical force for social justice on a groundbreaking self-titled jazz and blues-driven collection that illuminates past and present American history while creating some profound history of its own.\n\nWhile it may seem curious to some that Curtis would self-title his third overall album, it\u2019s reflective of a desire to share his deeper core identity. He imparts his truth and the issues that have long mattered to him via five impactful originals and edgy, intensely rendered versions of three thematically related pieces: Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s \u201cHome is Where the Hatred Is,\u201d Skip James\u2019 \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Co-produced with Cary, it\u2019s also the drummer\u2019s first collection to feature the explosive and intuitive chemistry of his NY-based ensemble that has held court in NYC everywhere from Smalls, Fat Cat and Rockwood Music Hall to The Jazz Standard and full week residencies at Dizzy\u2019s Club at Jazz at Lincoln Center.\n\nThe group includes Duane Eubanks (trumpet), Braxton Cook (alto sax), Andrew Renfroe (guitar), Jonathan Thomas (piano, Fender Rhodes, organ) and Luke Sellick (bass). Guests include Corey Wallace (trombone), Matthew Whitaker (organ) and vocalists Michael Mayo (whose beautiful wordless vocal brings a rich humanity to \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d and \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d) and Brianna Thomas, who brings the burning soul-blues angles and edges to \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Cary himself guests on Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer and synth.\n\nCurtis laid the foundation for this current release with two previous critically acclaimed collections, his debut The Skeptic & the Cynic (which spent two weeks at #1 on the Canadian Jazz charts and featured Grammy-nominated pianist Taylor Eigsti) and the WCMA-winning and JUNO-nominated Dialectics (Cellar Live), which made DownBeat Magazine\u2019s \u201cBest of 2015\u201d list, reached #3 on the CMJ jazz charts and spent ten weeks on the JazzWeek charts. The Skeptic & the Cynic was comprised mostly of cover songs by Michael Jackson, Bob Marley, Joni Mitchell, Pink Floyd, Black Star and 2Pac, along with two originals. Recorded in Winnipeg in 2014 after Curtis\u2019 first year at Manhattan School of Music, Dialectics featured mostly original music along with arrangements of compositions by Thelonious Monk, Wayne Shorter and the jazz standard \u201cI Remember You.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recorded my first two albums in my hometown of Winnipeg,\u201d Curtis says, \u201cwith a band made up of my former teachers from the University of Manitoba. Those works were geared towards my growth as a musician and gaining a deeper knowledge of jazz. Stylistically, the new one is definitely a departure from those, yet is a much better reflection of who I am and the themes and issues that matter to me. It\u2019s more important to me than just, \u2018here are some new songs.\u2019 These social issues were always simmering in my mind, and I was very vocal about them among the people I know and love, but it took a while before I was able to convey my feelings musically.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ve lived a lot of life between the release of Dialectics and now,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019ve gained a great deal of life and musical experience and been through a lot, so it felt appropriate to self-title the album. The music is very personal to me. I have gained a lot of insight living in Harlem for the past 5 1/2 years, and as a European-descended practitioner of Black American Music, I feel it is my duty to approach this music and these themes in a respectful, earnest and serious manner. I also feel that as I have made the transition from being an \u2018outsider looking in\u2019 (being from Canada) to an \u2018insider looking out,\u2019 so to speak, I have a unique perspective that I have chosen to express with this album.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding the world from Curtis\u2019 perspective will no doubt prompt listeners not only to enjoy some of the most inventive, hard-hitting jazz they\u2019ve heard in a long time, but also to start Googling and brushing up on their social history. Four of his five originals are devoted to activists who gave their lives or livelihoods to the struggle for a better planet.\n\nThe dreamy and mystical, then percussively busier and bustling \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d is dedicated to the Standing Rock Sioux and all other indigenous people in the U.S., Canada and worldwide who are fighting for their rights to exist without encroachment. Ranging from lilting and simmering gospel to fiery bebop to an electric piano, organ and affected saxophone jam, \u201cNever Forget What They Did to Fred Hampton\u201d reflects both the forward thinking, socially conscious vision and the violent chaos that beset the Black Panther movement. Curtis composed the track on the anniversary of the FBI\u2019s assassination of Hampton, one of the movement\u2019s young, charismatic leaders who was head of the Chicago Chapter of the Party when he was gunned down in December 1969, at the age of 21. \u201cHis murder must be remembered and understood as we celebrate his message and vision of a brighter future for African Americans and all people devoted to justice and solidarity,\u201d the drummer says.\n\nThe emotional, deeply soulful ballad \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d is dedicated to Brazilian politician Marielle Franco, who was the leading voice in her country against police brutality and corruption before her assassination in March 2018. \u201cBlues 4 Colin K\u201d is a lively, high energy blues romp with a hypnotic soul transporting melody designed to shed light on former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who like Muhammad Ali fifty years before him, was robbed of his best years of competing for taking a stand (via taking a knee during the national anthem) against injustice and the oppression of Black people. Curtis balances the heavy themes with a personal statement of a different kind, the romantic and whimsical \u201cWaltz 4 Meg,\u201d dedicated to his wife Megan, whom he has known for over half his life.\n\nCurtis, who started playing drums at 12 and picked up piano at 16, grew up in Winnipeg, the son of a piano teacher mother and saxophonist father. While he grew up hearing jazz around the house, Curtis opted instead for bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Yet his mindset shifted quickly from hard rock to jazz when he heard Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers, particularly their 1963 album Caravan. \u201cI liked John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman and started learning with records I checked out of the public library,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was something about Blakey being a thunderous drummer and bandleader that tapped into my spirit and made me realize I wanted to be that kind of musician as well. Why jazz? Its sense of freedom just spoke to me, and I think that\u2019s what attracts a lot of people. There are no limits. I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to interact with a lot of New York musicians when I was in high school and college, and that played a large part as well.\u201d\n\nEstablishing himself on the NY jazz scene, Curtis has played in the bands of Philip Harper, Craig Harris, rising star saxophonist Braxton Cook and renowned pianist Marc Cary (who both make major contributions to the album) while headlining major jazz festivals in Canada and several in the U.S. He has also performed with four NEA Jazz Masters: Candido Camero, Dave Liebman, Jimmy Owens and Kenny Barron. A recipient of several awards and scholarships, in 2014 Nowosad performed at the Bimhuis in Amsterdam as a winner of the Keep an Eye Jazz Award. He was twice selected to participate in Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC and also attended the Banff Jazz Workshop.\n\nCurtis is an alumnus of the University of Manitoba, where he studied with Terreon Gully and Quincy Davis, and holds a master\u2019s degree from Manhattan School of Music, where he was a student of John Riley, and performed with the multi-Grammy nominated MSM Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra, under the direction of Bobby Sanabria. He currently serves on MSM\u2019s Precollege jazz faculty and is an endorser of Canopus Drums.\n\n\u201cFrom a purely musical standpoint, this album was creatively fulfilling because it was the first time that I had handled all of the audio editing myself, which was quite a task because there are so many layers, from horns to vocals to electronic sounds,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cIt was a challenge to figure out how to bring the right people into unique configurations for each song so that we could best bring their artistry to life, and we were still adding guests a week before the recording session. It was going to be a purely instrumental project until Marc and I talked about adding vocals \u2013 which led us to bring the incomparable Michael Mayo and Brianna Thomas on board.\n\n\u201cThematically, my feeling is that if we never deal with history we will never know how to grow and move forward as a society\u201d he adds. \u201cOne of the problems in the U.S, Canada and many other countries is that we don\u2019t do nearly enough to understand that history and take the necessary steps toward dismantling systems of oppression. Jazz has always inherently reflected the times it\u2019s created in, but often when it\u2019s institutionalized in colleges and university programs, we tend to focus on jazz history alone as opposed to the American and world history it emerges from. I hope this project will inspire listeners to read up on the different icons I was inspired to write about, and open their eyes and ears to not only what was going on in previous generations but also today. By better understanding those important connections, we can collectively begin to question all the societal structures around us.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "89 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017", "Artist": "Ryoju Fukushiro", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8680564.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.977412, 40.75236], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Lounge, Jazz, Classical, Smooth Jazz, Funk, Pop, R&B, soul, Free Jazz", "Time": "8:00 AM", "Venue": "Grand central station", "moreBioInfo": "Ryoju Fukushiro (Riyo) was born into a musical family in Kyoto, Japan in April 1986.

The California quartet\u2014Noah Sebastian [lead vocals], Joakim \u201cJolly\u201d Karlsson [lead guitar, vocals], Nicholas Ruffilo [bass], and Nick Folio [drums]\u2014explore the enigmatic idiosyncrasies of their signature sound on 2019\u2019s Finding God Before God Finds Me [Sumerian Records], imbuing cinematic electronics and gospel stature into metallic melodies.\n\nProduced by Noah and Jolly, the ten-track trip unfurls like the sonic equivalent of a gripping existential drama.\n\n\u201cWhat makes us a rock band is the fact we play instruments, but we\u2019ve always been pretty experimental in terms of post-production,\u201d explains Noah. \u201cWe dove after a specific sound without boundaries. What separates us is the attention to detail in every song.\u201d\n\nBad Omens diligently worked to hone this approach since their 2016 self-titled debut. As the entire tracklisting tallied nearly 30 million streams, the breakthrough single \u201cThe Worst In Me\u201d leapt past the 8 million mark on Spotify. Meanwhile, \u201cGlass Houses\u201d clocked 4.7 million Spotify streams, \u201cExit Wounds\u201d racked up 2.6 million Spotify streams, and \u201cReprise (The Sound of the End),\u201d \u201cThe Fountain,\u201d \u201cF E R A L,\u201d and \u201cEnough, Enough Now\u201d each exceeded 1 million-plus on the platform. Along the way, they received looks from Alternative Press, New Noise, and Revolver and toured alongside everyone from Parkway Drive to Bullet For My Valentine and Asking Alexandria. Following Warped Tour 2017, the group commenced writing for what would become Finding God Before God Finds Me.\n\n\u201cThe last record was so melancholic, sad, dark, and nihilistic at points,\u201d he admits. \u201cBefore we started really writing the new record, I went through some things that opened up my mind and made me realize who I wanted to be as a musician, what message I wanted to send, and the feeling I needed to inspire. This is predominantly hopeful. There\u2019s a sense of underdogs overcoming adversity. We should be a safe place for people. There\u2019s also a musical feeling of uplifting catharsis. It\u2019s not entirely happy or sad, but more so regal.\u201d\n\nThis drove 2018 singles \u201cCareful What You Wish For\u201d and \u201cThe Hell I Overcame.\u201d Fans immediately responded as the former generated 1.5 million Spotify streams and the latter quickly neared 2 million. With Jolly a world away in Sweden, they finished the record remotely, maximizing the time in between tours to cap off a panoramic vision.\n\nThe 2019 single \u201cBurning Out\u201d couples strains of piano and choir with trudging distortion and a sweeping and soaring chant of empowerment, \u201cI was lost, but now I\u2019m found under the lights and in the sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the impact music has made on me and how it saved me in a sense,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s about my relationship with myself and music and how I overcame my emotions and took advantage of this ability to reach a better place. I wanted the lyrics to give you a sense of hope.\u201d\n\nBy imparting a piece of themselves on every aspect of the composition and production, Bad Omens deliver a statement that stands out. \u201cWe just want you to feel something,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cNothing in the world is stronger than emotion. It makes us human, gives us soul, and separates us. We tried to make this album like a movie where it captivates you immediately, takes you on a journey, and gives you a positive payoff.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Bandsintown Contest Rules: https://go.aws/38NAZjy"}, {"Address": "2 Havemeyer St, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Savon Bartley", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10099812.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.952866, 40.71652], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop, Poetry", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Muchmore's", "moreBioInfo": "Savon Bartley is a poet who uses his passion for music and storytelling to document the human experience.

After high school, David moved to San Francisco to pursue a career in Audio Production at San Francisco State University. Upon graduation, he was hired from intern to full-time producer for the \u201cHouse of Blues Radio Hour\u201d hosted by Dan Aykroyd a.k.a. Elwood Blues. Among the highlights of his job was the opportunity to interview many of the legends of blues and rock including John Lee Hooker, B.B. King, and Buddy Guy, to name a few. These experiences convinced him to pick up the guitar and start studying it seriously. Today, his style ranges from country rock to reggae and of course the blues. In addition, his craftsmanship as a songwriter has recently put him into the mix with popular festivals and radio stations alike. Will Hughes grew up in Northern New Jersey. He began playing guitar at sixteen listening to Nirvana records, and before long, his musical interests evolved as quickly as his playing did. Classic rock greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Jerry Garcia, Led Zeppelin, and ultimately the Beatles pushed his desire to study guitar to new heights. Will soon decided to make the guitar his lifelong passion and professional career. He received his B.A. in Classical Guitar from Rowan University in Southern New Jersey, studying with such greats as Christopher Parkening and Judicael Perroy. Will\u2019s musical journey eventually led him to the Bay Area to pursue teaching guitar and performing with a variety of artists from all different musical backgrounds. His style is a fusion of classical, gypsy jazz, and good old Rock and Roll. David and Will\u2019s paths crossed after sharing a bill one night in the Bay Area. The two connected musically during a post-party jam and they soon began playing together regularly.

Surprisingly, virtually all of the youths return.\n\nBut sometimes they don't.\n\nFour out of the original six of the members of The Amish Outlaws were born and raised in Lancaster, PA and had a strict Amish upbringing. No electricity from land lines, no alcohol, no musical instruments, but their spirits were too wild for the Amish lifestyle. Once they trampled in the Devil's Playground, there was no turning back. In the years since Rumspringa, the members of the Amish Outlaws have become very well acclimated to the pleasures and vices of the modern world... music, most of all.\nIt was this mutual love of music that brought the Outlaws together in a chance meeting at the 2002 Pocono Vacation Park \"Rock and Roll Hootenanny.\" While their appearance drew snickers and stares from most of the crowd, they sat down together and the Brothers were soon like brothers, sharing not only the bond of having left the Amish life behind, but also the deep mutual love of music. Together they delved deeply into the 16 years of American culture they missed, watching endless hours of classic MTV, listening to the radio, CDs, records, tapes... anything they could get their hands on. But just listening and watching was not enough... the Brothers soon decided to form a band that combined their love of the modern world and their traditional upbringing. They met some non-Amish friends out in the world (\"English\" as we call the non-Amish), making them \"honorary Amish\" when they joined the band. Thus, with a bold lust for life and a fire for music and performance that can only come from 16 years of repression, The Amish Outlaws were unleashed upon the world.\nThere is no \"typical\" Amish Outlaws show, but the average crowd can expect to see men in full Amish garb releasing all of their pent up energy with an infectious joy. With a set that is always evolving as the Brothers discover more and more music and culture, The Amish Outlaws constantly surprise the audience and keep them guessing as to what they could possibly play next, from Johnny Cash to Jay Z, Lady Gaga to Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, Bon Jovi to Elvis Presley, The Foo Fighters to Dropkick Murphys, to theme songs from the TV shows they have come to know. Throughout, The Outlaws spin yarns about the Brothers' upbringing and adventures since Rumpsringa. Amish Outlaw gigs are less performances than they are initiations into the life of an Amish Outlaw and parties celebrating the Brothers' newfound freedom.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "125 East 11th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Four Year Strong", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9056163.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.989166, 40.731661], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Pop Punk, Emo, Punk Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Webster Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Cheers.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Jersey City, NJ", "Artist": "Damn Tall Buildings", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9127789.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.0776, 40.7282], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Bluegrass, Fiddle And Banjo, Guitar Acoustic, Folk, Blues, String Band Classico, Guerrilla Roots, Guiar, Upright Bass, Female Fronted, Country, Vocal Harmonies, Grass, Old-Time Music", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Spiral Sounds House Concert", "moreBioInfo": "In their early days, Damn Tall Buildings didn\u2019t rehearse \u2013 they busked.

Whether sharing lead vocals and instrumental solos or blending their voices into loose, joyous harmony, the four members of Damn Tall Buildings (guitarist/lead vocalist Max Capistran, bassist/lead vocalist Sasha Dubyk, fiddler/vocalist Avery Ballotta and banjoist/vocalist Jordan Alleman) blend elements of bluegrass, blues, roots-rock and vintage swing to create a captivating, high-energy sound.

A native of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Keezer was playing in jazz clubs as a teenager, holding down the piano chair for Art Blakey at age 18, and touring in the company of Ray Brown, Joshua Redman, Diana Krall, Art Farmer, Benny Golson and Barbara Hendricks in his 20s. More recently he has toured with Wayne Shorter, Dianne Reeves, David Sanborn, Chris Botti, Sting, Joe Locke and Christian McBride; produced and arranged three GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated recordings with vocalist Denise Donatelli, and released a series of albums drawing influences from Hawaiian, Okinawan and Afro-Peruvian folk traditions. His 2009 album \u00c1urea (ArtistShare) was nominated for a Best Latin Jazz Album GRAMMY\u00ae award. Geoffrey\u2019s 2013 solo piano release, Heart of the Piano (Motema Records), seeks to redefine solo jazz piano as a personal and interactive showcase of melody, energy and groove, while his latest album On My Way to You (MarKeez Records 2018) is a stunning new set of music featuring his working trio with the addition of guest vocalist Gillian Margot.\n\nGeoffrey\u2019s compositions have been commissioned by the Mainly Mozart Festival, Art of El\u00e1n ensemble, Saint Joseph Ballet, Zeltsman Marimba Festival, Carnegie Hall Jazz Orchestra and Scottish National Jazz Orchestra.

Over a viscid, bluesy slide-guitar, the band transports you to the sweltering Texas heat, a \"land of oilfields, iron nightmares, and fevered dreams.\" That song, \"Good Evening,\" plants the band's flag firmly in the sand, simultaneously celebrating the pride of home and acknowledging the ominous clouds that hang over it, all while perfectly setting the stage for the raucous journey through time and space that follows.\n\nThe Night Hawks\u2014Anderson and Matsler on vocals and guitars, Pat Adams on bass, and Aaron Haynes on drums\u2014are a Southern band, to be sure, but it's not the South we've come to expect from our rock and roll. Equally influenced by ZZ Top and science fiction, they write of landscape both familiar and foreign, of a people working to shed their past but still burdened with its repercussions even in the distant future.\n\n\"Dave and I both pull from older artists when we write,\" says Anderson, \"but we're trying to put a new spin on it. We're harkening back to old Texas, but we're writing about a new southern culture, maintaining the past and moving it on into the future.\"\n\nEras collide in every aspect of the record, from the title\u2014which merges Texas' Spanish and Mexican roots with its role at the center of the modern space race\u2014to its pop art cover, depicting a classic hot rod from the 70's that's been modified into a spacecraft hovering over an exotic desert landscape. Songs like \"Mockingbird\" play out as a classic-rock road warrior's tale souped-up for the 22nd century, while \"Liberty Bell 7\" re-imagines current-day border issues through the eyes of a \"space coyote\" smuggling illegal immigrants on and off the planet. The track, which was engineered by Centromatic's Matt Pence, is actually named for a real NASA mission from 1961.\n\n\"At the time, it was the furthest into space that anything had gone,\" says Anderson, a huge space travel junkie. \"Upon reentry, it crashed into the ocean and filled with water and sunk down to the bottom. This thing had been as far out into space as you could go and as deep down into the ocean you could go, and that's how the narrator of the song feels, he's been as far out and as low down as you can get.\"\n\nThe Quaker City Night Hawks have been far out there, but they're anything but low down at the moment as they prepare for their first major foray into the national spotlight. Paste hailed the band's \"blues-infused southern\" sound, while the Dallas Observer dubbed the \"relevant and timeless\" rockers the Best Band of 2015, and several of their songs were featured in the hit FX series Sons of Anarchy. Anderson was one of the first to invite fellow Ft. Worth-native Leon Bridges to perform during set breaks at his shows, and the two recently reunited to perform for an upcoming Danny Clinch documentary which was teased during the GRAMMY Awards, and dates with Chris Stapleton, Lucero, J Roddy Walston, and Whiskey Myers have solidified the Night Hawks' status as one of the Lone Star State's most exciting new acts.\n\n\"Our name is pulled from a Mark Twain book called The Innocents Abroad or, The New Pilgrim's Progress,\" explains Anderson, \"where Twain, along with many other Americans, set out in 1867 aboard the chartered vessel Quaker City to see sites in Europe and the Holy Land. En route, he found that the only time his fellow passengers of varying religious backgrounds refrained from petty bickering and squabbles was when they met together at night to play cards, smoke, and drink. That gathering became collectively known as the Night Hawks.\"\n\nIt's a fitting moniker for a band that seeks to bring their audiences together every night onstage, but despite the group's clear sense of identity, El Astronauta was almost a very different record, as they aborted an early recording session only to revisit the songs later with a new perspective.\n\n\"Usually Dave and I write the songs and then we record them a few weeks later,\" explains Anderson, \"but on this one, because we decided to re-record, we had the opportunity to incorporate them into our live sets for a while, and songs can change so much when you play them 100 times in different cities.\"\n\n\"Our old studio habit was to get there and knock out as many drum and bass tracks in a day as possible,\" adds Adams, \"but this time around, we took the approach of trying to fully complete each song before moving on to the next, and that was a really good spark for our creative vision when we finally got back into the studio.\"\n\n\"There was definitely a gestation period,\" reflects Matsler, \"where we gave the songs time to develop on their own, and sometimes they changed pretty drastically.\"\n\nChange, and the need for it, is a central theme on the record, and one that weighs heavily on the bandmembers' minds as they enter a new phase of adulthood. \"Beat The Machine\" is a protest song of sorts according to Matsler, not against any one particular war but against the military and prison industrial complex that seems to hold a vice grip over modern American politics, while the JFK-inspired \"The Last Great Audit\" grimly assures that we'll \"never walk through the gates of His promised land 'til we shake off our bloody ancestors' blues,\" and album-closer \"Sons and Daughters\" is a rollicking dose of secular gospel.\n\n\"That song caps the album because it's about the realization that things aren't exactly right and they have to change,\" explains Matsler, \"but the changing part doesn't have to be sad or morose. It's a call-to-action to head out the door and change the world.\"\n\n\"This whole record sums up that feeling when you finally start to realize that you've been surrounded by bullshit,\" adds Anderson with a laugh. \"It's immense and depressing at first to understand that things aren\u2019t the way people told you they would be growing up, but coming out the other side, you see everybody else is in the same boat. We've been lied to for a long time, but now it's time to figure it out and move on and do something about it.\"\n\nFor the Quaker City Night Hawks, that means getting onstage and singing their hearts out every night. This isn't the South of their fathers, nor is it the America they'd been promised growing up, but we're all in it together, and maybe, by the time souped-up hot rod spaceships are cruising between planets, we'll have learned a lesson from the original Night Hawks onboard the Quaker City and put aside our differences long enough to make life just a little better for everybody.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Warehouse, Fairfield, CT 06824", "Artist": "John Lodge", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8803248.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.26, 41.16], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Warehouse at FTC", "moreBioInfo": "The official page of John Lodge of The Moody Blues.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "OSA, 22 East 23 St, Suite 707, Manhattan, NY 10010", "Artist": "Moonfruits", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8009515.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988254, 40.740866], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Acoustic, Guitar, Kalimba, Country, Francophone, Franco, Harmonies, roots, Banjo, Folk, Americana, Glockenspiel, Canadiana Folk Blues, Canadiana, everything in between", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Folk Music Society of NY", "moreBioInfo": "Fronted by partners Alex Millaire and Kaitlin Milroy, Ottawa-based Moonfruits are makers of art-folk bilingue.

He has performed with such notables as Terri Lyne Carrington, Ellis Marsalis, Tyshawn Sorey, Esperanza Spalding, Jimmy Cobb, Nicholas Payton, Christian Scott, Stefon Harris, Allen Toussaint, Freddy Cole, Russell Gunn, Amina Figarova, Wallace Roney, and Buster Williams.\n\nGuerin was born in Metairie, Louisiana and moved to Atlanta at age 11. Growing up in a family of musicians, Morgan was given his first pair of drumsticks at the age of six months, followed shortly thereafter by a drum set. By six, Morgan had his first saxophone. With his mother being a pianist and his father being a bassist, Morgan began playing piano and bass early on. His debut record \u201cThe Saga\u201d was released in 2016. It featured Guerin performing the majority of the instruments on the record. Since moving to New York in 2016 and attending the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, Morgan had the great fortune of joining Terri Lyne Carrington\u2019s band, \u201cSocial Science\u201d where he plays electric bass, saxophone and EWI in the group.\n\nThe Huffington Post named Morgan\u2019s first album, \u201cThe Saga\u201d one of the best Jazz albums of 2016 and Stereo Gum showcased his sophomore album, \u201cThe Saga II\u201d in their August article for their favorite albums. He has also been featured in Downbeat Magazine, New York Times and Burning Ambulance. In 2018, Jammcard selected Morgan as one of their \u201c20 under 20\u201d artists.\n\nMorgan now performs regularly with Terri Lyne Carrington and Social Science, Esperanza Spalding, Amina Figarova Sextet and Tyshawn Sorey. Also an active mixing engineer, Morgan has helped engineer albums from artists such as Justin Brown, Jesse Fischer, Gr\u00fct and Fullmoon Groove. During the fall of 2018, Morgan joined Esperanza Spalding on her \u201c12 Little Spells\u201d tour and played bass, Prophet, saxophone, bass drum and sang background vocals.

Gone are the days of reliance on formal singles and/or albums, and in their place waits a space of creative freedom for artists. Ilan Rubin never fit traditional molds anyway. Despite the energy and enjoyment of playing with artists like Nine Inch Nails, Angels & Airwaves, and Paramore, Rubin felt the urge to do more and was always at work creating his own music, his own sound, his own vision \u2013 The New Regime.\n\nBeginning in 2007, he spent every spare moment writing, arranging and performing his own songs. Every instrument, every note of The New Regime is played and/or sung by him. With two albums under his belt \u2013 Coup and Speak Through the White Noise \u2013 Rubin decided to take a different approach with his most recent crop of creative outpouring.\n\n\u201cWhen it came time for a third release, I had enough material for almost two full-lengths. But, unlike my first two albums, these songs weren\u2019t written with a definitive vision in mind.

I think \u2018Daydream\u2019, the featured track from Exhibit A, is a good example of what I\u2019d like listeners to experience with this music.

Their music serves to make introspection and human connection sexy again. Pr\u00f3xima Parada is releasing new music and will embark on their first U.S. tour this year.\n\nTheir last single, Time In A Circle, currently has over 1,500,000 plays on Spotify alone.\n\nStarting in 2012 as a group of college friends wanting to extend their dynamic to their community in San Luis Obispo, CA, they never dreamed that their passion would reach a global audience, that they'd perform at beautiful historic venues and music festivals, that their songs would earn awards, that their music would soothe and uplift people around the world.\n\n\nThe starting lineup for Pr\u00f3xima Parada:\nNick Larson (vocals, keys, guitar), Kevin Middlekauff (bass), Josh Collins (guitar), and Aaron Kroeger (drums).\n\nA BETTER BIO:\n\nThe following recount of the epic of Pr\u00f3xima Parada was translated from ancient Greek dactylic hexameter and is traditionally attributed to Sophocles (although recent investigations by way of modern advancements hypothesize the text as a discarded fragment of Homer's Iliad):\n\nIt all emerged from the discovery of freedom way back when. Pr\u00f3xima Parada, protector of goslings, formed as a result of a murmur, a moo moo, the recitation of a Nordic dirge, and a desperate whimper; sounds heard all the way down to the Mississippi Delta, which had long been shining like a National guitar. Though the individuals of Pr\u00f3xima Parada were all ephemeral in flesh, their collective offering of goodwill in the aural realm became immortal by wish of the gods.\n\nOn Olympus resounded a long, deep breath of agreeable relief, as the gods delivered their most interesting gift for Earth, Kevin Middlekauff, enchanter of the four stringed bass lyre, son of Leto of the Lovely Locks, to whom they gave the patience of the Bald Eagle along with his fierce talons, which made plucking strings a markedly difficult task. With him came a fleet of Achaean spearwomen. Enrapt in observing a quarrel between armies of men, the gods let fall a quiver of divine arrows, and the jumble that fused upon an unforgiving collision of earth and oxen created many a Nicholas Larson, bleak souls with shrill voices. One Nicholas was given the great fortune of finding Kevin, who guided him through wind and sea away from a shameful life as a lotus eater and taught him the Seikilos epitaph (\"While you live, shine / have no grief at all / life exists only for a short while / and time demands an end\").\n\nJoshua Collins\u2019 lineage cannot be enumerated with exactitude, although Agamemnon, supreme commander of the Achaean armies, was informed by an oracle that Joshua was the end result of an abandoned beard. How he and his young fur joined Pr\u00f3xima Parada is even less understood.\n\nFollowing a fortnight of arrows raining from both armies, Apollo ceased his observations of Troy to ponder a creation forming in the northern reaches from the percussion of glaciers striking Galdh\u00f8piggen, Scandinavia\u2019s boldest mountain. Savage ice and rock had been warring for ages. Apollo, to establish consonance in that great region, sent Aaron Kr\u00f6ger, king of Mycenae in the Peloponnese, hiker of short pants. Aaron percussed the earth with his dual gold-bestudded sceptres to instruct the sun of the tempo of the day and the moon of the night\u2019s gloom. Satisfied in frigid Norden, he prepared himself to settle in asceticism for the rest of his days.\n\nNot before long, under the tutelage of Olympus, the three boys became something akin to men and the silence turned to harmony, harmony that spread through the yellow hair of Aaron Kr\u00f6ger, into his ears, and reverberated in his heart. Having never been moved so by man, he vowed to percuss alongside the sounds of the three. Pr\u00f3xima Parada, the amalgamation of the four regions of Nether, was erected in January of 2012 of the Gregorian Calendar, although The China National Petroleum Corporation would soon change their fiscal calendar to mark Pr\u00f3xima\u2019s birth as year 0.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "212 E 52nd St, New York, NY 10022", "Artist": "Leandro Pellegrino", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8300909.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.969227, 40.756686], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Brazilian Jazz, Funk, African Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Club Bonafide", "moreBioInfo": "Brazilian born, Brooklyn based Guitarist", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "61 Wythe Ave, New York, NY 11249", "Artist": "The Mastersons", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9571301.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.957549, 40.722053], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Alt-Country, Americana, Rock, Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Bowl", "moreBioInfo": "Don't bother asking The Mastersons where they're from. Brooklyn, Austin, Los Angeles, Terlingua; they've called each home in just the last few years alone. If you really want to get to know this husband-and-wife duo, the better question to ask is where they're going. Perhaps more than any other band playing today, The Mastersons live on the road, perpetually in motion and always creating. Movement is their muse. On tour, in the unpredictable adventures and characters they cross, in the endless blur of skylines and rest stops and dressing rooms and hotels, that's where they find their greatest inspiration, where they hone their art, and where they crafted their brilliant new album, Transient Lullaby. \"When you travel like we do, if your antenna is up, there's always something going on around you,\" reflects guitarist/singer Chris Masterson. \"Ideas can be found everywhere. The hardest thing to find is time.\" For the last seven years, The Mastersons have kept up a supremely inexorable touring schedule, performing as both the openers for Steve Earle and as members of his band, The Dukes, in addition to playing their own relentless slate of headline shows and festivals. It was Earle, in fact, who pushed the duo to record their acclaimed debut, Birds Fly South, in the first place. \"Before we hit the road with him in 2010, Steve said, 'You'd better have a record ready because I'm going to feature you guys during the show,'\" remembers fiddler/tenor guitarist/singer Eleanor Whitmore. \"We didn't even have a band name at the time. We were going through all these ideas and Steve suggested, 'Why don\u2019t you just be The Mastersons, and that was that.\" Upon its release in 2012, Birds Fly South was a breakout critical hit on both sides of the pond, with Uncut awarding the album 9/10 stars and Esquire dubbing The Mastersons one of the \u201cBands You Need To Know Right Now\u201d. Two years later, they followed it up with Good Luck Charm, premiered by the NY Times and praised by Mother Jones for its \"big-hearted lyrics, tight song structures, and sweetly intertwined harmonies.\" Pop Matters ranked it \"among the top Americana releases of 2014,\" while American Songwriter called it \"a perfect soundtrack for a summer of warm nights and hot, lazy days,\" and the Austin Chronicle praised the band's \"spunky wit and rare measure of emotional maturity.\" The album earned The Mastersons slots on NPR's Mountain Stage and at festivals around the world, from San Francisco's Hardly Strictly Bluegrass to Australia's Byron Bay Bluesfest. With endless touring came new levels of comfort and confidence, and when it was time to record Transient Lullaby, The Mastersons knew they wanted to take a different approach than their first two releases. The band set up shop at Arlyn Studios in Austin, TX, where Chris shared production duties with longtime friend and collaborator George Reiff (Ray Wylie Hubbard, Band of Heathens). Together, they chased a sound that was subtler and more evocative, deeper and more contemplative. \"A lot of what we listen to when we have some rare time off is what we consider late night music,\" explains Chris, who previously played guitar with Son Volt and Jack Ingram among others. \"The last record was bright and jangly and we wanted this one to be vibey and dark. A lot of the stuff is very performance-based and not at all fussed with. We've grown so much more comfortable in our skin that we really weren't trying to sound like anyone other than ourselves this time around.\" \"We've had a lot of time and a lot of miles to refine our sound and our style of singing,\" adds Eleanor, whose resume includes work with Regina Spektor and Angus & Julia Stone. \"I think the depth of our songwriting has really grown, too. Part of the time we're writing on a tour bus with Steve Earle, and the bar for poetry is pretty high when you're within earshot of one of the greatest songwriters alive.\" Rich with Eleanor's stirring string arrangements and Chris's masterful guitar work, the songs on Transient Lullaby more than live up to the challenge. The album opens with \"Perfect,\" a loping duet written partially in Washington, DC, and partially in Newcastle, England, that paints a portrait of two broken lovers who still manage to find a strange optimism in this challenging world. Spare and affecting, the song puts the spotlight on the duo's intoxicating vocal harmonies and makes for an ideal entry point into an album full of characters facing down difficulty and darkness with all the grit and humility they can muster. \"Fight,\" written in a downtown Cleveland hotel, is a wry wink at the battlefield of marriage (\"I don't wanna fight with anyone else but you\"), while the fingerpicked \"Highway 1\" twists and turns on a California road trip through an emotional breakup. \"Life's not easy,\" reflects Chris. \"It's hard for everybody, and I don\u2019t see it getting any easier. All you can hope for yourself is grace when walking through it, and someone to prop you up when you need a little help.\" Though it's a deeply personal album, Transient Lullaby is not without its political moments. The Mastersons found themselves on tour in Lexington, KY, during the height of Kim Davis' obstinate stand against the Supreme Court's same sex marriage decision, and so they penned the infectious \"You Could Be Wrong\" in a dressing room before taking the stage with \"Love Wins\" draped across their guitars. \"This Isn't How It Was Supposed To Go\"\u2014a cosmic country duet written in Cologne, Germany\u2014has taken on new layers of political meaning in 2017, while \"Don't Tell Me To Smile\" is a tongue-in-cheek feminist anthem, and the gorgeous, slow-burning \"Fire Escape\"\u2014which came to life in a hockey rink locker room in Alberta, Canada\u2014suggests that the only solution to a polarized world of fear and distrust is to find strength and guidance in our loved ones. \"As we look at the world political landscape, global warming, a refugee crisis and the uncertain times we\u2019re all living in, rather than lose hope, we look to each other,\" Chris says. \"It\u2019s a little brighter than Cormac McCarthy\u2019s The Road, but not much.\" Ultimately, the road is at the core of everything The Mastersons do. \"Happy When I'm Movin'\" reflects their constant need for forward momentum, both physically and emotionally, and the title track paints the pair as \"pilgrims of the interstate\" on an endless voyage. \"No I don\u2019t unpack my bag / Traveling from town to town,\" they sing in beautiful harmony. \"Set \u2019em up and knock \u2019em down / Where there\u2019s work and songs to sing / You\u2019ll know the place where I\u2019ll be found / If you don\u2019t want to be alone / Then come along.\" For The Mastersons, all that matters is where they're headed, and the songs they'll write when they get there.

Gone are the days of reliance on formal singles and/or albums, and in their place waits a space of creative freedom for artists. Ilan Rubin never fit traditional molds anyway. Despite the energy and enjoyment of playing with artists like Nine Inch Nails, Angels & Airwaves, and Paramore, Rubin felt the urge to do more and was always at work creating his own music, his own sound, his own vision \u2013 The New Regime.\n\nBeginning in 2007, he spent every spare moment writing, arranging and performing his own songs.

The band is signed to Dangerbird Records. They released their debut Pikul EP in July of 2005, and their full length album Carnavas on July 26, 2006.\n\nThe band consists of Brian Aubert (vocals/guitar), Nikki Monninger (vocals/bass), Christopher Guanlao (drums), and Joe Lester (keyboards). The band members are friends who had played together previously or in mutual friends' bands.\n\nSilversun Pickups have been compared to The Smashing Pumpkins (possibly due in part to Brian Aubert's vocal style) and Shoegaze / Dream Pop bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Lush and Slowride, as well as other influences such as The Velvet Underground. Silversun Pickups claim they have been heavily influenced by Modest Mouse, as well as other lesser known acts.\n\nTheir first break came when a friend mailed a boombox demo to CMJ and they were accepted. They got their start in many of the most important L.A. clubs and began to draw a strong following upon the release of the Pikul EP. This culminated in frequent touring, including a co-headlining stint with Viva Voce.\n\nThe band finished a three-week tour opening for Australian rockers Wolfmother on December 9, 2006, and have toured with OK Go and Snow Patrol on their U.S. spring tour, which ended on April 10, 2007.

While most rappers spend more and more time convincing the masses of their \"hustle,\" Fabolous lets his work speak for his effort. With two platinum albums (2001's Ghetto Fabolous and 2003's Street Dreams) and one Gold (2004's Real Talk) to his credit, the veteran hitmaker still exudes a rookie-of-the year swagger. After recording for both Elektra and Atlantic Records, Fab is enjoying a home coming with the legendary Def Jam label. His first recorded song was \"If They Want It\" from DJ Clue's The Professional, which was released by Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam in 1998. Now he is preparing to release his fourth street classic, From Nothin' to Somethin' under the watchful eye of his longtime collaborators.\n\n\"I had people in my corner already over there,\" Fab says of DJ Clue and A&R Skane, the Desert Storm duo who discovered Fabolous. \"So it wasn't like I was coming to a new neighborhood.\"\n\nWhile he doesn't site any one reason for his move, Fabolous has learned a lot from his time in the industry\n\nand is eager to capitalize on his experience. \"I haven't peaked yet,\" he explains. \"I was happy with the past records, but I have some adversity to learn off of for the future.\"\n\nIt's appropriate that Fabolous is getting a fresh start for his latest release because he wants From Nothin' to Somethin' to be a rebirth for his fans old and new. \"Everybody is trying to take what they have and make something more,\" says Fabolous, explaining the album's title. \"It's a new year, everybody's on their hustle, back in the gym and I'm trying to give them some inspiration. This is music to chase your money too, work out--motivation music.\n\nThe first single \"Make Me Better\" is produced by Grammy Award winning producer Timbaland and finds Fabolous doing what he does best; blending radio ready sound beds with clever and memorable lyrics. Rapping that he needs \"a Corretta Scott to make me King\" Fab picks up with his female fans where \"Baby\" left off. \"It's a great feel good record, it's got a lot of style to it,\" he says. \"I wanted a record that could show that I could touch different people with my music.\"\n\nAlready recognized for his hit-making ability, Fabolous is eager to show the diversity of his technique while staying true to his blueprint for success. On the cocky \"Make Money\" he cleverly borrows Notorious B.I.G's trademark chuckle to comment on the laugh-ability of his competition: \"these dudes is stand up rappers, hip-hop comedians, I start laughin as soon as I put your CD in.\" His wit and wordplay is not something he gets enough credit for, but the MC is confident people will come around. \"Certain people recognize it,\" he says, \"but its like they'll sing it in the shower, but they won't sing it outside. It's all good though. One of them days you gonna get drunk and start singing that song.\"\n\nEnlisting a whose-who list of guests that includes Akon, Young Jeezy, Ne-Yo and Junior Reed, Fabolous plays to a variety of audiences on this disc, but there is no mistaking that it's his show from beginning to end. The anthemic \"Brooklyn\" features a yet to be disclosed surprise guest and \"Change Up\" pairs Fab with singer, producer extraodinaire Akon helping him reflect on his life and career.\n\n\"Anytime you become a successful person, people may look at you and say you changed,\" explains Fabolous, who references the October 2006 shooting that took place outside of Justin's restaurant in the lyrics of the song. \"That record just talks about people changing as a person for money, how they carry themselves and treat other people. For me, I might have changed where I live or my number, but I haven't changed as a person\u2026I slid a line or two about what happened in October but I'm not coming out with a bullet proof vest or anything.\"\n\nThe playful \"Foggin Up The Windows,\" produced by Miami's The Runners, features R. Kelly's chopped and screwed vocals from his hit \"Ignition\" to prop up Fabolous' ode to parkin' lot pimpin' of the more carnal kind.\n\n\"I just took it back to trying to get some in the car,\" he says with a laugh. \"Everyone's either done it or tried to get some in the car. It may not have been the place of choice but everybody's had a hotel on wheels.\"\n\nOther rewind worthy tracks like \"Real Playa\" featuring Lloyd, \"Diamonds\" featuring Young Jeezy and the Just Blaze produced \"Back To School\" round out an impressive collection that makes From Nothin' to Somethin' worth the two-year wait. In his absence no artist has come close to matching his boyish charm, wit and unassuming cool both on and off the mic.

A Performer extraordinaire.\n\nThe legendary Dr. Lonnie Smith describes her this way: \u201cAkiko's playing is like watching a flower blooming, a bird spreading her wings in the music world. Akiko is here to stay.\u201d\n\nRaised in Osaka, Japan, this talented musician began studying the organ at the age of three, at the famed Yamaha Music School. After discovering her passion for jazz very early on in her musical journey, Akiko launched her career immediately after graduating from the Osaka College of Music.\nWhile living and playing in Osaka, she had many opportunities to perform with world- renowned jazz musicians from the United States. Meeting Grady Tate, in particular, was a life-changing event for Akiko. He took a great interest in her after hearing her play, and ultimately convinced her that to fully pursue her career in jazz she must make the move to the United States. He further showed his belief in her talent by performing on her debut album in Japan, Harlem Dreams.\n\nAfter landing in the mecca for jazz, New York City, it didn\u2019t take long for Akiko to make her mark - she was soon embraced not only by audiences, but by her fellow musicians, as one of the top organ players in the city. It was during these early years that she had the great honor of playing several gigs with jazz greats Frank Wess and Jimmy Cobb.\nBut it was the meeting of organ legend Dr. Lonnie Smith that proved to have the greatest impact on Akiko\u2019s musical development and career. He became an important mentor to Akiko, and she considers him her greatest influence. She flourished and continued to be a constant draw on the NY jazz scene. Her extraordinary musicianship and captivating stage presence ultimately drew Lou Donaldson\u2019s attention, when he chose her in 2006 as his quartet\u2019s organist.\n\nAkiko has ten albums as a leader to her credit. Her debut album in the U.S., \u201cSweet and Funky\u201d ,was selected as a \u201cBest album of 2007\u201d in DOWNBEAT Magazine. Akiko has been a regular in the DOWNBEAT polls since 2008 - culminating this year with the 65th Annual Critics Poll, coming in at #2 in the \u201cRising Star - Organ\u201d category. Hot House Magazine has just named her 'Best Organ\" in the 2017 Readers Poll. Her albums have constantly placed in the top ten on the National Radio Jazz Chart.\nAkiko\u2019s most recent recording, \u201cSo Cute, So Bad\u201d is a live record date, recorded at the Alvas Showroom in Los Angeles, and features Jeff Hamilton (Drums) and Graham Dechter (Guitar). This album was released in both the U.S. and in Japan in May 2017.\n\nJust take a listen to this dynamic performer, and I\u2019m sure you will agree with the legendary Dr. Lonnie Smith - \u201cAkiko is here to stay!\u201d\n\nAkiko Tsuruga website: www.akikojazz.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E 16th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Jim Florentine", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8466090.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988348, 40.735421], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand", "moreBioInfo": "Jim Florentine is a comedian best known as the voice of Special Ed, a character on the Comedy Central program Crank Yankers.", "otherInfo": "Bonnie McFarlane, Jim Florentine, Ron Bennington, & More!"}, {"Address": "61 Wythe Ave, New York, NY 11249", "Artist": "The Jayhawks", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8718308.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.957549, 40.722053], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Bowl", "moreBioInfo": "New album available - iTunes: http://smarturl.it/TheJayhawks & Amazon: http://smarturl.it/JayhawksAmazon", "otherInfo": "Tickets go on sale to the general public on 11/15 at noon ET"}, {"Address": "487 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "Janeane Garofalo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9616632.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.981649, 40.685861], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "EastVille Comedy Club - Brooklyn", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Janeane Garofalo, Judah Friedlander, Aaron Berg, No Two Drink Minimum"}, {"Address": "61 Wythe Ave, New York, NY 11249", "Artist": "The Mastersons", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9571301.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.957549, 40.722053], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Alt-Country, Americana, Rock, Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Bowl", "moreBioInfo": "Don't bother asking The Mastersons where they're from. Brooklyn, Austin, Los Angeles, Terlingua; they've called each home in just the last few years alone. If you really want to get to know this husband-and-wife duo, the better question to ask is where they're going. Perhaps more than any other band playing today, The Mastersons live on the road, perpetually in motion and always creating. Movement is their muse. On tour, in the unpredictable adventures and characters they cross, in the endless blur of skylines and rest stops and dressing rooms and hotels, that's where they find their greatest inspiration, where they hone their art, and where they crafted their brilliant new album, Transient Lullaby. \"When you travel like we do, if your antenna is up, there's always something going on around you,\" reflects guitarist/singer Chris Masterson. \"Ideas can be found everywhere. The hardest thing to find is time.\" For the last seven years, The Mastersons have kept up a supremely inexorable touring schedule, performing as both the openers for Steve Earle and as members of his band, The Dukes, in addition to playing their own relentless slate of headline shows and festivals. It was Earle, in fact, who pushed the duo to record their acclaimed debut, Birds Fly South, in the first place. \"Before we hit the road with him in 2010, Steve said, 'You'd better have a record ready because I'm going to feature you guys during the show,'\" remembers fiddler/tenor guitarist/singer Eleanor Whitmore. \"We didn't even have a band name at the time. We were going through all these ideas and Steve suggested, 'Why don\u2019t you just be The Mastersons, and that was that.\" Upon its release in 2012, Birds Fly South was a breakout critical hit on both sides of the pond, with Uncut awarding the album 9/10 stars and Esquire dubbing The Mastersons one of the \u201cBands You Need To Know Right Now\u201d. Two years later, they followed it up with Good Luck Charm, premiered by the NY Times and praised by Mother Jones for its \"big-hearted lyrics, tight song structures, and sweetly intertwined harmonies.\" Pop Matters ranked it \"among the top Americana releases of 2014,\" while American Songwriter called it \"a perfect soundtrack for a summer of warm nights and hot, lazy days,\" and the Austin Chronicle praised the band's \"spunky wit and rare measure of emotional maturity.\" The album earned The Mastersons slots on NPR's Mountain Stage and at festivals around the world, from San Francisco's Hardly Strictly Bluegrass to Australia's Byron Bay Bluesfest. With endless touring came new levels of comfort and confidence, and when it was time to record Transient Lullaby, The Mastersons knew they wanted to take a different approach than their first two releases. The band set up shop at Arlyn Studios in Austin, TX, where Chris shared production duties with longtime friend and collaborator George Reiff (Ray Wylie Hubbard, Band of Heathens). Together, they chased a sound that was subtler and more evocative, deeper and more contemplative. \"A lot of what we listen to when we have some rare time off is what we consider late night music,\" explains Chris, who previously played guitar with Son Volt and Jack Ingram among others. \"The last record was bright and jangly and we wanted this one to be vibey and dark. A lot of the stuff is very performance-based and not at all fussed with. We've grown so much more comfortable in our skin that we really weren't trying to sound like anyone other than ourselves this time around.\" \"We've had a lot of time and a lot of miles to refine our sound and our style of singing,\" adds Eleanor, whose resume includes work with Regina Spektor and Angus & Julia Stone. \"I think the depth of our songwriting has really grown, too. Part of the time we're writing on a tour bus with Steve Earle, and the bar for poetry is pretty high when you're within earshot of one of the greatest songwriters alive.\" Rich with Eleanor's stirring string arrangements and Chris's masterful guitar work, the songs on Transient Lullaby more than live up to the challenge. The album opens with \"Perfect,\" a loping duet written partially in Washington, DC, and partially in Newcastle, England, that paints a portrait of two broken lovers who still manage to find a strange optimism in this challenging world. Spare and affecting, the song puts the spotlight on the duo's intoxicating vocal harmonies and makes for an ideal entry point into an album full of characters facing down difficulty and darkness with all the grit and humility they can muster. \"Fight,\" written in a downtown Cleveland hotel, is a wry wink at the battlefield of marriage (\"I don't wanna fight with anyone else but you\"), while the fingerpicked \"Highway 1\" twists and turns on a California road trip through an emotional breakup. \"Life's not easy,\" reflects Chris. \"It's hard for everybody, and I don\u2019t see it getting any easier. All you can hope for yourself is grace when walking through it, and someone to prop you up when you need a little help.\" Though it's a deeply personal album, Transient Lullaby is not without its political moments. The Mastersons found themselves on tour in Lexington, KY, during the height of Kim Davis' obstinate stand against the Supreme Court's same sex marriage decision, and so they penned the infectious \"You Could Be Wrong\" in a dressing room before taking the stage with \"Love Wins\" draped across their guitars. \"This Isn't How It Was Supposed To Go\"\u2014a cosmic country duet written in Cologne, Germany\u2014has taken on new layers of political meaning in 2017, while \"Don't Tell Me To Smile\" is a tongue-in-cheek feminist anthem, and the gorgeous, slow-burning \"Fire Escape\"\u2014which came to life in a hockey rink locker room in Alberta, Canada\u2014suggests that the only solution to a polarized world of fear and distrust is to find strength and guidance in our loved ones. \"As we look at the world political landscape, global warming, a refugee crisis and the uncertain times we\u2019re all living in, rather than lose hope, we look to each other,\" Chris says. \"It\u2019s a little brighter than Cormac McCarthy\u2019s The Road, but not much.\" Ultimately, the road is at the core of everything The Mastersons do. \"Happy When I'm Movin'\" reflects their constant need for forward momentum, both physically and emotionally, and the title track paints the pair as \"pilgrims of the interstate\" on an endless voyage. \"No I don\u2019t unpack my bag / Traveling from town to town,\" they sing in beautiful harmony. \"Set \u2019em up and knock \u2019em down / Where there\u2019s work and songs to sing / You\u2019ll know the place where I\u2019ll be found / If you don\u2019t want to be alone / Then come along.\" For The Mastersons, all that matters is where they're headed, and the songs they'll write when they get there.

Her great aunt was Freda Dudley Ward, a mistress of Edward VIII while he was Prince of Wales\n\nBirkin emerged in the swinging '60s in London, starring as one of the models in the controversial film Blowup in 1966.\n\nIn 1968, Birkin went to France to audition for the lead female role in Slogan. Though she did not speak French, she got the role.\n\nIn 1969, she and Serge Gainsbourg released the song \"Je t'aime... moi non plus\" (\"I love you... me neither\"), written by Gainsbourg and featuring both of them singing, which caused a scandal for its sexual explicitness. Arguably due in part to the publicity it got from being banned by radio stations in Italy, Sweden, Spain, and the UK, it was a commercial success all over Europe. The song's fame is a result of its salacious lyrics (sung in French) against a background of female moaning and groaning, culminating in an orgasm at the song's conclusion (which some claim to be the result of Jane and Serge actually engaging in sex during the recording of the song).\n\nBirkin took a short break from her acting career in 1971-72, but returned as Brigitte Bardot's lover in Don Juan (or if Don Juan were a woman) in 1973.\n\nIn 1975, she appeared in Gainsbourg's first film, also titled Je t'aime... moi non plus, which created quite a stir for its frank examination of sexual ambiguity. For this performance she was nominated for a Best Actress C\u00e9sar Award.\n\nBirkin has starred in the Agatha Christie films Death on the Nile and Evil Under the Sun, and recorded several albums, including Baby Alone in Babylone, Amours des Feintes, Lolita Go Home and Rendez-vous.

Birkin has also visited Bosnia, Rwanda. and Palestinian Territories, often working with children.

The resulting sound is ambitious and raw, dynamic and powerful.\n\nSome of that power is owed to the deep current of lyrical content flowing just below the surface of seemingly happy, hook-laden tunes. Singer/guitarist Natalie Newbold mined her own past in a tumultuous, long-term relationship for the bulk of the inspiration throughout This is Fine, resulting in a level of candor and self-reflection not often embedded in such catchy rock songs. This potent recipe has earned Well Wisher a reputation as one of the most-promising new bands to arise from the New Jersey DIY scene.\n\nOriginally started as a solo project for Newbold, Well Wisher has taken shape as a full band, touring frequently despite their relative newness.

Pr\u00f3xima Parada, protector of goslings, formed as a result of a murmur, a moo moo, the recitation of a Nordic dirge, and a desperate whimper; sounds heard all the way down to the Mississippi Delta, which had long been shining like a National guitar. Though the individuals of Pr\u00f3xima Parada were all ephemeral in flesh, their collective offering of goodwill in the aural realm became immortal by wish of the gods.\n\nOn Olympus resounded a long, deep breath of agreeable relief, as the gods delivered their most interesting gift for Earth, Kevin Middlekauff, enchanter of the four stringed bass lyre, son of Leto of the Lovely Locks, to whom they gave the patience of the Bald Eagle along with his fierce talons, which made plucking strings a markedly difficult task. With him came a fleet of Achaean spearwomen. Enrapt in observing a quarrel between armies of men, the gods let fall a quiver of divine arrows, and the jumble that fused upon an unforgiving collision of earth and oxen created many a Nicholas Larson, bleak souls with shrill voices. One Nicholas was given the great fortune of finding Kevin, who guided him through wind and sea away from a shameful life as a lotus eater and taught him the Seikilos epitaph (\"While you live, shine / have no grief at all / life exists only for a short while / and time demands an end\").\n\nJoshua Collins\u2019 lineage cannot be enumerated with exactitude, although Agamemnon, supreme commander of the Achaean armies, was informed by an oracle that Joshua was the end result of an abandoned beard. How he and his young fur joined Pr\u00f3xima Parada is even less understood.\n\nFollowing a fortnight of arrows raining from both armies, Apollo ceased his observations of Troy to ponder a creation forming in the northern reaches from the percussion of glaciers striking Galdh\u00f8piggen, Scandinavia\u2019s boldest mountain. Savage ice and rock had been warring for ages. Apollo, to establish consonance in that great region, sent Aaron Kr\u00f6ger, king of Mycenae in the Peloponnese, hiker of short pants. Aaron percussed the earth with his dual gold-bestudded sceptres to instruct the sun of the tempo of the day and the moon of the night\u2019s gloom. Satisfied in frigid Norden, he prepared himself to settle in asceticism for the rest of his days.\n\nNot before long, under the tutelage of Olympus, the three boys became something akin to men and the silence turned to harmony, harmony that spread through the yellow hair of Aaron Kr\u00f6ger, into his ears, and reverberated in his heart. Having never been moved so by man, he vowed to percuss alongside the sounds of the three. Pr\u00f3xima Parada, the amalgamation of the four regions of Nether, was erected in January of 2012 of the Gregorian Calendar, although The China National Petroleum Corporation would soon change their fiscal calendar to mark Pr\u00f3xima\u2019s birth as year 0.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1647 Weirfield Street, Ridgewood, NY 11385", "Artist": "Breanna Barbara", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8938154.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.905204, 40.69784], "Date": "Fri Mar 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-06", "Genre": "Genres: Occult Blues", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "TV Eye", "moreBioInfo": "There is a particular place you get to without directions. you've been a thousand times but never once stayed past a moment.

The band was distinguished by their hyperkinetic stage shows, juvenile humor, ironic covers of new wave pop songs, and metallic shards of ska. The group cultivated an underground following that broke into the mainstream in summer 1997 when their single \u201cSell Out\u201d became a modern rock radio and MTV favorite. Their appearance in the movie \u201cBaseketball\u201d as the halftime band also gained them more fans and helped the band's popularity to grow. Still fronted by original lead singer and songwriter Aaron Barrett, they continue releasing albums and touring relentlessly, playing more and more countries and bigger venues all over the world.\nReel Big Fish recorded its self-released debut album, \u201cEverything Sucks\u201d, in 1995. \u201cEverything Sucks\u201d became a word-of-mouth underground hit in ska-punk and college circles, which gave the band enough leverage to sign with the indie label Mojo Records.\nThe label\u2019s president, Jay Rifkin, and former Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila co-produced \u201cTurn the Radio Off\u201d, which marked Reel Big Fish\u2019s first album for Mojo. \u201cTurn the Radio Off\u201d was unleashed in August 1996, and over the next year, the group continually toured in support of the album\u2019s release, expanding their fan base all the while. In spring 1997, the single \u201cSell Out\u201d began receiving heavy airplay from several influential modern rock stations in the U.S., which soon translated into MTV support for the song\u2019s quirky video. By summer, the song had become a moderate modern rock hit, and the album had charted in the Top 100.\nIn 1998 the song \u201cTake on Me\u201d from the \u201cBaseketball\u201d motion picture soundtrack was released as the promotional single for the movie and once again found the band in regular rotation on rock radio and MTV in the USA.\nThe Album \u201cWhy Do They Rock So Hard\u201d followed a year later, once again enlisting Oingo Boingo Bassist John Avila as producer. The album was not as commercially successful but is still regarded by many fans as the bands finest work. The band filmed a music video for \u201cthe Set up (You Need This)\u201d, the only single released from this album.\nThe guys wound up on Jive Records in fall 2001 when their current label, Mojo, was bought by Jive\u2019s parent label, Zomba. Reel Big Fish\u2019s first release for Jive, a more rock-oriented record entitled \u201cCheer Up!\u201d, appeared in mid-2002. This album was very successful in Europe with the video for the single \u201cWhere Have You Been\u201d receiving heavy airplay on many music video channels.\nLater that same year, RBF did a song for a Rice Krispies called \u201cSnap, Krackle, Pop-punk\u201d which was used in 3 separate commercials. Also that year, they recorded a cover of Toots and the Maytals \u201cMonkey Man\u201d for the Nickelodeon movie \u201cThe Wild Thornberrys.\u201d The single for \u201cMonkey Man\u201d was also released in the UK and received heavy radio play as well as the music video being put on heavy rotation on Kerrang TV.\nThe band\u2019s next album, the cynical yet catchy \u201cWe\u2019re Not Happy \u2018Til You\u2019re Not Happy\u201d, was issued in April 2005. Touring continued for the rest of the year, and Reel Big Fish happily parted ways with Jive in January 2006, having wished to be dropped from the label since the \u201cCheer Up!\u201d release.\nIn August 2006, the group self-released a double-disc live CD (along with an accompanying DVD) titled \u201cOur Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album\u201d.\nBarrett said of this album: \u201cWe finally captured the energy, excitement, and humor of our live shows that we were previously unable to create in the recording studio environment. And it all sounds really good!\u201d\nThe album was very popular with RBF fans and is sometimes referred to as \u201cthe Reel Big Fish Stand-up comedy album\u201d because of all the silly stage banter.\nThe band returned with some new material in February 2007, splitting an EP \u201cDuet All Night Long\u201d with their friends in Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. \u201cMonkeys for Nothin\u2019 and the Chimps for Free\u201d followed several months later, marking Reel Big Fish\u2019s first full-length studio release since leaving Jive\u2019s roster, and 2009\u2032s \u201cFame, Fortune and Fornication\u201d found the band covering songs by the likes of Poison, the Eagles, and Tom Petty.\nIn 2010, the band released \u201cA Best of Us for the Rest of Us\u201d. It included a 22 song disc of re-recorded hits and classic fan favorites as well as a bonus disc of 14 Acoustic or \u201cSKAcoustic\u201d versions.\n2012 brought their 7th studio album, \u201cCandy Coated Fury\u201d (Rock Ridge Music), an inspired and infectiously catchy return to the hyperkinetic ska and biting wit of the band\u2019s beloved early albums.\nIn 2014, RBF released their first Christmas Album, a six-song, digital-only album entitled \u201cHappy Skalidays\u201d. The album included 4 classic Christmas songs and 2 RBF originals.\nWith the late-2018 release of the band\u2019s 8th studio LP, \u201cLife Sucks...Let\u2019s Dance\u201d (Rock Ridge Music) Reel Big Fish are finding themselves with a new focus and a renewed sense of purpose, as well as a-- dare we say it-- happier outlook on life.\nBarrett says, \u201cWe started recording the album in January 2018 and really took our time with it. Our friend and engineer David Irish just finished building his new studio \u201cPot of Gold\u201d in Orange, CA, and we loved how everything sounds there. There\u2019s just really good energy and good vibes there, plus there\u2019s a really adorable studio kitten named Iggy Fluff there, so we may have accidentally made a positive, happy record instead of a pissed off, hateful record, oops...well, there\u2019s a little pissed off-ness in there and some sarcastic, funny lyrics as usual! Also, I just got married so there might be a few sappy love songs on the album too! Yuck!\u201d\nHe adds, \u201cRecording the album with this line up was really fun, we all get along really well these days and everybody was excited to make a new record. Everybody had lots of great ideas and really got creative with everything and I really think it shows.\nThe new single \u201cYou Can\u2019t Have All of Me,\u201d is a danceable sing-along, catchy, hooky good old Reel Big Fish song. We didn\u2019t reinvent the wheel... We just painted more checkers on it!\"\nThe long-running ska heroes, fresh off a summer-long stint on the final cross-country Vans Warped Tour, and appearances at Scallywag!

Several demos, a few years, a new group name, and additional members later, the direction of the crew took its turn towards blending science fiction and conspiracy theories into rap songs, which at the time, was a rare take on hip hop music in the early 90s. In 1994, the early \"Demigodz\" group split up due to the ever-so-popular break up reason: \"musical differences\". However, it was through this transition that the Demigodfather met another fellow CT lyricist, Apathy. As the musical partnership between Open Mic and Apathy progressed, the two decided to rebuild the Demigodz name and take their aspirations to an entirely different level. After years of recording songs, mastering the ASR-10, co-hosting a radio show, and gaining ties with the likes of Alien Nation, Mothership aka Eternia, and Al T of Newcleus, Mic's dues were slowly but surely being paid. Along with Apathy, he also headed up a Connecticut based chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation and recorded the cassette-only \"Sureshot Affair\" EP, which was self-released in 1997 and sold throughout the underground circles of the North East. Shortly thereafter, Mic took a step back from the scene after getting married and becoming a father for the first time in his life... In 2000, the Demigodz became resurrected by Apathy and expanded into a military-like squadron of MCs and DJs. With that movement in motion, it couldn't have existed without the inclusion of its original creator, Open Mic, and once again he became immersed into the hip hop world. Since then, Mic has kept himself afloat by making appearances on wax, including \"Science of the Bumrush\" on UK-based Stonegroove Recordings and the Demigodz EP released on Ill Boogie Records in mid-2002, all of which received critical acclaim in such publications as XXL and The Source. Outside of the microphone realm, he has made quite a name for himself over the years as a professional graphic designer, in which his lengthy resume extends widely with the creation of many 12\" single, vinyl album, and CD covers for an extensive list of labels - beginning with Bronx Science Records (Apathy's first label), Raptivism Records, Domination Recordings and most recently Babygrande. In early 2006, after being reunited with early 'Nobility' member and co-founder of the first generation of the Demigodz, P-Air, Open Mic has begun work on a new duo project. Returning to his original group base from 1989-1990, and bringing back that boom-bap early 90's sound that hip-hop has lacked since it took a commercial nosedive, Open Mic is ready to deliver what many Demigodz fans have been asking for.... the real raw shit.

Hanging out with his father, John was exposed to all the great jazz music of the era, from Erroll Garner and Les Paul to Django Reinhardt. He began playing with his father at age 20, before going out on his own.\n\nJohn Pizzarelli has recorded as a bandleader for RCA, Chesky, Stash and Novus, and in 1997 appeared in the Broadway musical Dream, a revue of Johnny Mercer songs. Along the way, Pizzarelli and his band have earned rave reviews. Reviewers often compare the Pizzarelli Trio to jazz icons such as Nat \"King\" Cole: \"The John Pizzarelli Trio has never been tighter, and Pizzarelli himself has never been looser,\" said The Village Voice of a recent New York show. \"We can say we\u2019re as lucky to listen to [Pizzarelli] as Nat Cole fans were in the years before he became a legend.\"\n\nFor Pizzarelli, the comparison to the Nat \"King\" Cole Trio is the highest of compliments. \"I've always said in my concerts that Nat 'King' Cole is why I do what I do.\" Using greats like Nat \"King\" Cole and Frank Sinatra and the songs of writers like Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen as touchstones, Pizzarelli is among the prime contemporary interpreters of the great American songbook, bringing to the work his signature style and brilliant guitar playing.\n\nWith Telarc\u2019s recent release of Dear Mr. Sinatra, an homage to 'Ol' Blue Eyes,' Pizzarelli's album count now stands at 21, an odyssey that began with My Blue Heaven in 1990.

That sound can be traced back to his native Minnesota, a virtual rock and roll holy land of the midwest, home to wide ranging musical progeny, such as Bob Dylan, Prince, and Paul Westerberg. But his music also has traces of a New York street wise and weary artist, owing to the fact that he has called New York City and Brooklyn his home these past 17 years. Like the unrefined and direct sounds of his fellow Minnesotans, The Replacements and Husker Du, Ewing was also influenced by England's punk music. Sherman experienced this first hand while attending an all boy's boarding school in England during the birth and peak of the Punk movement. Ewing returned to the States and later attended Columbia University where he met John \"Jojo\" Hermann of Widespread Panic. The two classmates played together in Sherman and the Bureaucrats. Ewing continued to develop his sound playing with various New York bands throughout the '90s. Then, in 2002, Sherman launched his solo career and teamed up with producer Godfrey Diamond (Lou Reed, Aerosmith, Billy Squier). Ewing and Diamond's collaborative chemistry was immediate and the two began to write and record songs. The result, Bluemoon. The 11 tracks boast an outstanding team of musicians, including George Recile (Keith Richards, Bob Dylan), Ivan Neville, John Ginty (Robert Randolph), Jack Petruzelli (Joan Osborne), and David Dreiwitz (Ween). In the years since the release of Bluemoon, Sherman has been touring, including several opening stints for his friend Jojo Hermann. Sherman and Godfrey are currently collaborating again for Ewing's next release, Single Room Saloon. This release will include collaborations with Ewing's old friends Jojo Hermann (Widespread Panic) and George Recile (Keith Richards, Bob Dylan), as well as Anthony Krizan (Spin Doctors), and Tom Marshall (Phish, Amphibian). On January 11, 2011, Sherman's long awaited new CD, Single Room Saloon, was released in digital format. The brick-and-mortar release for the 10-song collection is scheduled for Spring 2011.

Chris Brown & Jhen\u00e9 Aiko]\u2014the R&B icon experienced life-changing revelations. Personally, he became a father. Omarion recalls this experience as the most gratifying of his life and identifies his children as the source and purpose of his inspiration. Professionally, a first time visit to South Africa revealed a deeper connection to mother earth\u2019s immense wondrous nature and its creative inspiration. Over the course of two-and-a-half whirlwind years, he quietly assembled a framework for what would become Omarion Worldwide. Omarion Worldwide represents the next level amalgamation of Omarion\u2019s spiritual, physical, emotional and artistic growth.\n\nIn December 2016, Omarion set the stage for his latest body of work with the release of the infectious sing along hit \u201cOkay OK\u201d [feat. C\u2019Zar] followed by the sexy and revealing \u201cBDY On Me\u201d video which he directed and shot in Cape Town, South Africa.\nWith its rhythmic melody and undeniable island infused afro beat, 2017\u2019s \u201cDistance\u201d takes his signature smooth R&B sound into international territory. \u201cDistance embodies another layer of me and invites the world to feel good and dance.\u201d Shot in the African safari and co-starring zebras, elephants and giraffes, the music video (which he once again sat in the director\u2019s chair for) showcased a side of the performer rarely seen and impressively managed to generate over 14 million YouTube views and counting.\n\u201cDistance truly represents me arriving as an artist and as a creator,\u201d he goes on. \u201cI\u2019ve been more involved with everything from the concept to the editing. \u2018Distance\u2019 is the re-emergence of me as a director, fashion icon, performer, and entertainer who speaks multiple creative languages. Lyrically, it\u2019s about creating a connection that I feel like is missing from the game. Songs used to bring people together. Nowadays we\u2019re in the club and everyone is on their phones. Stay connected. Let\u2019s dance.\u201d\nThe follow-up single W4W (Word For Word\u201d) a dancehall inspired vibe continues Omarion s journey around the globe as he shares cultural insight with fans, this time directing the video in Japan. \u201cFor me, W4W discusses self-reflection,\u201d says Omarion. \u201cIn the end, I have to look in the mirror and know that I can stand by every lyric word-for-word. You have to take responsibility for what you say and do. \u201c\nThat\u2019s been the case with all of his work as he confidently and consistently raises the bar for R&B\u2019s modern vanguard with each release. By 2017, he had earned three RIAA gold-certified #1 albums\u2014O [2005], 21 [2006], and Face Off with Bow Wow [2007]\u2014and amassed a catalog of hits ranging from \u201cTouch\u201d ; \u201cIce Box\u201d and \u201cEntourage\u201d to \u201cI\u2019m Up\u201d [feat. Kid Ink & French Montana], which garnered over 43.4 million Spotify streams and \u201cPost To Be\u201d which has garnered over half a billion views on You Tube and counting.\nA multi-faceted performer, Omarion\u2019s talents have shined from the big screen classic, You Got Served, to more recently starring in two seasons of VH1\u2019s Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood. Among many accolades, he received a GRAMMY\u00ae Award nomination for \u201cBest Contemporary R&B Album\u201d and has won several Billboard and BET Awards. He remains an impressive performer on the road dominating the stage in front of packed audiences internationally.\nUltimately, Omarion Worldwide re-introduces Omarion wiser, stronger, focused, and more creative than ever before. When people listen to an Omarion song, I hope they sing; I hope they dance, but most importantly I hope they feel, that\u2019s what makes us ALIVE.", "otherInfo": "The Millennium Tour!

That sound can be traced back to his native Minnesota, a virtual rock and roll holy land of the midwest, home to wide ranging musical progeny, such as Bob Dylan, Prince, and Paul Westerberg. But his music also has traces of a New York street wise and weary artist, owing to the fact that he has called New York City and Brooklyn his home these past 17 years. Like the unrefined and direct sounds of his fellow Minnesotans, The Replacements and Husker Du, Ewing was also influenced by England's punk music. Sherman experienced this first hand while attending an all boy's boarding school in England during the birth and peak of the Punk movement. Ewing returned to the States and later attended Columbia University where he met John \"Jojo\" Hermann of Widespread Panic. The two classmates played together in Sherman and the Bureaucrats. Ewing continued to develop his sound playing with various New York bands throughout the '90s. Then, in 2002, Sherman launched his solo career and teamed up with producer Godfrey Diamond (Lou Reed, Aerosmith, Billy Squier). Ewing and Diamond's collaborative chemistry was immediate and the two began to write and record songs. The result, Bluemoon. The 11 tracks boast an outstanding team of musicians, including George Recile (Keith Richards, Bob Dylan), Ivan Neville, John Ginty (Robert Randolph), Jack Petruzelli (Joan Osborne), and David Dreiwitz (Ween). In the years since the release of Bluemoon, Sherman has been touring, including several opening stints for his friend Jojo Hermann. Sherman and Godfrey are currently collaborating again for Ewing's next release, Single Room Saloon. This release will include collaborations with Ewing's old friends Jojo Hermann (Widespread Panic) and George Recile (Keith Richards, Bob Dylan), as well as Anthony Krizan (Spin Doctors), and Tom Marshall (Phish, Amphibian). On January 11, 2011, Sherman's long awaited new CD, Single Room Saloon, was released in digital format. The brick-and-mortar release for the 10-song collection is scheduled for Spring 2011.

The single has been heavily supported by Excision, Borgore, Flosstradamus, Snails, Kayzo, Ghastly, Kill The Noise, Slander, SKisM, and many more. Following the release of \"Rail Breaker\", Riot Ten dropped his debut EP with DIM MAK called \"Hype Or Die: The Dead\" in February of 2018, which recorded a top 10 debut on the iTunes \"dance album\" charts, a feat that is seldom seen by an artist in the genre.

Green debuted in 1999 from Brighton at 18 years old with a track on Tru Thoughts Recordings' When Shapes Join Together compilation. Though tempted by offers from Mute and XL after the official issue of \"The Scuba EP\" and the \"Terrapin\" single, Green stuck with Tru Thoughts for the acclaimed debut LP Animal Magic. This completely self-produced and mainly self-instrumented album was highlighted by downtempo dub, funk, and an equally likable use of sitars. Animal Magic was an obvious success and plans were quickly made for careful European support appearances, as well as a follow-up album onColdcut's Ninja Tune label in 2001, called Dial \"M\" for Monkey. A tour to support the record followed and was documented on the 2005 EP Live Sessions.\n\nAlso in 2005, Bonobo contributed to the Solid Steel series, with his Bonobo Presents Solid Steel: It Came From The Sea. The release date was scheduled for 10 October, 2005 but was released a week early. The mix features several exclusive tracks as well as remixes and re-edits.\n\nHis latest album, entitled Days To Come was released on October 2nd 2006. The first single from the album, Nightlite, featuring vocals by Bajka, was released on August 14th.\n\nDays To Come was voted Best Album of 2006 by Gilles Peterson's listeners.\n\n2) Bonobo was a dutch electronic project from Utrecht, sharing members with Human Beings.

It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label.

You lean in to hear every word, as Schneckenburger\u2019s voice sweetly sets the scene and then brings it to a boil, careening around each detail. The song ends before you\u2019re ready, leaving you breathless with your heart thumping in your ears. You reach forward and hit repeat.\n\nThunder in my Arms, Schneckenburger\u2019s first release of all original music, is a song cycle about attachment and trauma. After decades as a traditional fiddler and ballad singer, Schneckenburger\u2019s personal experience as a foster parent ignited her drive to write stories of family attachment and loss. She found herself diving into writing new material with a seriousness that matched her subject matter. Sung from a myriad of viewpoints, Thunder in my Arms can be at times brazen and childish, resilient and triumphant, softly confessional, or warm and comforting.\n\nSchneckenburger says \u201cAt a certain point I noticed that everyone we turned to for help with parenting was talking about the same thing: finding compassion, synchronicity, and understanding. In my attempts to be a better adoptive parent I found plenty of invaluable books and workshops that got that point across, but no songs! Music has this magical way of communicating emotion almost instantly, and allows human beings to synchronize with each other on so many levels. I set out to write songs that would resonate with other parents like myself. Songs about loneliness, exhaustion, beauty, abandonment, love, loss, and above all, hope.\u201d\n\nSchneckenburger\u2019s fans will be the first to tell you, the sonic tapestry of Thunder in my Arms is a sharp contrast with her previous recordings. Rooted solidly in a foundation of drums and bass, the songs swell with electric guitar, piano, and strings, and at times explode with brass and saxophone.

Peavy Wagner, Manni Schmidt & Christos Efthimiadis released 5 albums in one of the most successful line ups of their former Band RAGE and set the boundaries for a name that is still successful. Many young people were influenced by these top seller albums and still today, those songs belong to their most wanted list. After 1994, the three musicians moved on to work in different bands and continued to follow their paths to successful musicianships: Peavy (Rage), Manni (ex-Grave Digger), Christos (Tri State Corner). After a long period during which they had not much contact, the three guys met again in 2014 and decided to play a secret show in their German hometown Herne under the Name \u201cTres Hombres\u201d. The show was never promoted, apart from mouth to mouth and Facebook to Facebook PR. As a result, this show became a real insider tip and more than 1200 followers found their way to that happening, at this late summer evening in 2014. The band performed all their hits in the original line up and enjoyed every second of that gig, getting hungry for more - the idea of \u201cREFUGE\u201d was born. For a start, REFUGE played a couple of festival shows all throughout Europe in summer 2015 that were hugely successful. The audiences\u2019 reactions to the RAGE \u2013 songs of 1988 \u2013 1993 performed by the original line \u2013 up at that time were truly overwhelming and have exceeded all expectations. So more shows were played in 2016, including three concerts in Japan (Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka), exactly 20 years after they played their last show in this line-up \u2013 also in Japan! Around the same time, some record labels approached the band and offered deals for an album with new original songs. Since the chemistry between Peavy, Christos and Manni was as great as never before, they decided to work on new song material and inked a deal with Frontiers Records. What started out as a \u201cfun thing\u201d in 2014 has turned into a real band again! Currently, REFUGE are working on their brand new album which will see the light of day in 2018. It will be the first original album since 25 years of the most successful RAGE line-up to date and it sure will be the debut of a brand new band of old acquaintances. Up the horns for REFUGE!

Her overall vision for California Christmas was to convey these upbeat, jazzy, bluesy and tropical vibes.\n\nFor the saxophonist, one of the great joys of indie music making is the opportunity to step outside the confines of the urban jazz genre and spread the seasonal cheer in a multitude of styles from track to track with different lineups of her favorite musicians. Five of the nine tracks were mixed by Jessy\u2019s longtime collaborator, producer and mentor Paul Brown, who also plays one of his blistering trademark electric guitar solos on \u201cSilent Night.\u201d Also helping Jessy make the season grooving and bright are contemporary jazz greats, keyboardist Jeff Lorber and guitarist Steve Oliver; vocalist Maurice Smith; guitarists Michael Thompson, Michael Nomad Ripoll and Michael Angel; keyboardist Norman Jackson; pianists Jay Rowe and Ruslan Sirota; bassists Oskar Cartaya and Frank Abraham; percussionists Ronnie Gutierrez and Richie Gajate Garcia; drummers Dave Hooper, Trever Somerville, Iajhi Hampden and Gary Novak.\n\n\u201cChristmas songs bring us to a place of nostalgia, where we think of being a kid opening presents, having dinner with our families and creating wonderful memories,\u201d says Jessy. \u201cI grew up loving all the songs I recorded for California Christmas, and I\u2019m proud of the work we did to create a unique album that my fans can enjoy year after year. All of the arrangements are original, offering a fresh perspective on songs we have known in other ways for so many years.\u201d\n\nThe first track that Jessy worked on is also the collection\u2019s most intimate, a classical flavored take on the hypnotic melody of Bach\u2019s \u201cJesu, Joy of Man\u2019s Desiring,\u201d performed as an unadorned duet between her flute and Oliver\u2019s nylon string guitar, with subtle percussion by Richie Gajate Garcia. Jessy recorded what turned out to be the impetus for the full project with Oliver when she played on \u201cHello Mornin\u2019,\u201d a track from his Best Of\u2026So Far album in 2014.\n\nThe enticing, high energy Latin fired grooving mash-up of \u201cFeliz Navidad/Home For The Holidays\u201d and the traditional jazz waltz twist on \u201cWinter Wonderland\u201d were arranged by Jason Goldman (who has worked extensively with Michael Buble) and feature Jessy on sax, vocals and flute, ensembling with Ripoll, Cartaya, Sirota, Hooper and Gutierrez. The mashup features the soulful vocals of Smith, who also takes the powerful lead voice on California Christmas\u2019 jamming centerpiece, a powerhouse blues-driven romp through the usually solemn \u201cSilent Night.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn \u2018Silent Night,\u2019 I wanted to venture away from what you would expect, putting it in 4/4 instead of 3/4 time and taking it into heavy duty blues territory,\u201d Jessy says. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a \u2018Silent Night,\u2019 but it\u2019s celebrating the night Jesus was born and that makes it a party night, too. I wanted to take it into a different context to show the way people might celebrate it now.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cJingle Bells\u201d and \u201cHark The Herald Angels Sing,\u201d Jessy vibes with Rowe, who performed with her at Pizza Express in London during Christmastime 2015. Keeping with California Christmas\u2019 aesthetic of unexpected arrangements, she and Rowe approach \u201cJingle Bells\u201d as an atmospheric, traditional jazz tune, balancing its unique dark harmonies with the appearance of literal sleigh bells ringing. \u201cHark The Herald Angels Sing\u201d features Jessy\u2019s whimsical soprano melody gliding over a lighthearted, easy swinging trio.\n\nJessy has considered Lorber a mentor since they became friends on a Guitars & Saxes tour in 2008, and he co-wrote and produced several tracks on her Second Chances project in 2013. On California Christmas, the legendary keyboardist produced and did the arrangement on three tracks whose foundations are laid by Novak: a funky, high octane romp through \u201cJoy To The World,\u201d the soulful, mystical ballad \u201cThe First Noel\u201d and a sensual, folk-jazz spin on \u201cLittle Drummer Boy.\u201d The third tune features Jessy playing a wistful soprano lead and includes a powerhouse electric guitar solo by Thompson. \u201cI love working with Jeff because he is always challenging me,\u201d says Jessy. \u201cHe brings out something different in my playing and pushes me to reach higher whether we\u2019re performing or in the studio.\u201d\n\nWith her sizzling mix of hot beats, Latin and samba rhythms and sensuous, captivating melodies, Mexican American saxophonist and singer Jessy J (born Jessica Arellano) has had everyone swaying under the Tequila Moon, contemplating the joys of True Love and Hot Sauce, and embracing the possibilities of Second Chances and finding My One and Only One since she broke onto the contemporary jazz scene in 2008.\n\nIn addition to her airplay and chart success and tours with smooth jazz greats like Gerald Albright, Jeff Lorber, Euge Groove and Peter White on several all-star Guitars & Saxes tours, Jessy has performed on the hit television competition shows \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d \u201cThe Voice\u201d and \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201d The year Steven Tyler was a judge on \u201cIdol,\u201d he was so impressed with her performances that he invited her to play on Aerosmith\u2019s 2012 album Music From Another Dimension.\n\nJessy\u2019s connection to her Latin heritage runs deep, as her father is originally from Mexico and her mom hails from Texas. Born in Oregon and raised in southern California, Jessy grew up in a home full of big family get-togethers, Mexican feasts and lots of Latin, jazz and pop music. Her musical influences include Cannonball Adderley, John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Grover Washington, Jr., Sergio Mendes, Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan.\n\nAfter graduating from USC with a degree in jazz studies, Jessy\u2019s equal passion for pop led her quickly into recording sessions with artists like Michael Buble, followed over the years by tours with Jessica Simpson, The Temptations and Michael Bolton. In 2004, Jessy joined the cast of the off-Broadway show \u201cBlast!\u201d and drew on her multitude of skills as an actress, singer, dancer and sax player as she performed throughout the U.S., in London and Tokyo. Even while working with pop and Latin artists, she put together her own band, performing at such L.A. hotspots as The Jazz Bakery and, through her work with the Henry Mancini Institute and Orchestra, she performed on their twice GRAMMY\u00ae nominated album Elevation, and at numerous official functions and private parties.\n\n\u201cFor me, California Christmas is a special album for many reasons,\u201d says Jessy. \u201cIt will give listeners the feeling of being in a warmer, sunnier climate during the holiday season. But most importantly, as an artist I get to share the holidays musically with all my fans for the first time. Christmas is my favorite time of year and I am so grateful for all of my blessings.

There, she was exposed to traditional and rural folk music through her father, Greg Brown, the now beloved Midwestern folk singer. Later, while living with her mother in Birmingham, Alabama during her formative years, Pieta drew on and expanded these influences and began writing poems and composing instrumental songs on piano. By the time she left home at 18 she had lived in at least 19 different houses and apartments between Iowa and Alabama.\n\nIn her early 20's, after experiencing what she describes as \"the songs calling,\u201d Pieta started experimenting with the banjo and eventually picked up a 1930's Maybell arch-top guitar during a visit to her father's place and never looked back. Emerging from a disjointed and distinctly 'bohemian' upbringing, Pieta began performing live and making independent recordings soon after teaching herself how to play guitar. \"I grew up around a lot of musicians and artists living on the fringe, and have always felt most at home among them,\" Pieta says.\n\nContinually revealing new layers as both a songwriter and performer, Pieta is being recognized as one of modern Americana's true gems. In recent years Pieta has released multiple highly critically acclaimed albums, with much attention being paid not only to her distinct sound and style, but also the power of her singing and songwriting. Since releasing One and All (2010) and Mercury (2011), followed by Paradise Outlaw (2014 which Bon Iver master mind, Justin Vernon, called his \u201cfavorite recording made at our studio.\u201d) Pieta has toured North America with Mark Knopfler, and toured various regions of the U.S., Australia and Canada with John Prine, Amos Lee, Brandi Carlisle, JJ Cale, Ani Difranco, Mavis Staples, and Calexico among others.

In the last few years Pieta\u2019s songs and music have been heard in various TV Shows and indie films including Everything Will Be Fine (Wim Wenders).

There, she was exposed to traditional and rural folk music through her father, Greg Brown, the now beloved Midwestern folk singer. Later, while living with her mother in Birmingham, Alabama during her formative years, Pieta drew on and expanded these influences and began writing poems and composing instrumental songs on piano. By the time she left home at 18 she had lived in at least 19 different houses and apartments between Iowa and Alabama.\n\nIn her early 20's, after experiencing what she describes as \"the songs calling,\u201d Pieta started experimenting with the banjo and eventually picked up a 1930's Maybell arch-top guitar during a visit to her father's place and never looked back. Emerging from a disjointed and distinctly 'bohemian' upbringing, Pieta began performing live and making independent recordings soon after teaching herself how to play guitar. \"I grew up around a lot of musicians and artists living on the fringe, and have always felt most at home among them,\" Pieta says.\n\nContinually revealing new layers as both a songwriter and performer, Pieta is being recognized as one of modern Americana's true gems. In recent years Pieta has released multiple highly critically acclaimed albums, with much attention being paid not only to her distinct sound and style, but also the power of her singing and songwriting.

But hard work isn't. After 10 years of evolving as melodic rock savants while independently releasing dozens of singles and EPs, Reality Suite is determined to awaken the masses and demonstrate that rock is NOT dead. \"Reality Suite has become one of my favorite bands for numerous reasons. They are a kick ass in your face rock band with a dynamic front woman,\" says East Coast renowned photographer Jeff Crespi. WRAT 95.9FM radio DJ, Tom Hanley stated in his blog, \"The female-fronted Hard Rock act puts out a modern Arena Rock sound comprised of killer vocals, complex instrumentals and meaningful lyrics.\"\n\nAfter the 2018 self-released \"Awaken\" EP exceeded fan expectations and garnered the attention of several European record labels, Lions Pride Music based out of Denmark won the partnership with Reality Suite resulting in 2019's expanded album \"Awaken (deluxe.)\" The leading single and video, \"Kiss The Ring\" will be launched on May 17th. This first full-length album not being entirely band-produced incorporates the production skills of hard rock producer/engineer Mike Ferretti (Sevendust, Saliva, Brand of Julez) and pop/R&B producer Earl Cohen (Lady Gaga, Jessica Simpson, Pink.) \"Awaken (deluxe)\" will be available on June 28th digitally and on CD.\n\nFormed in 2009 in North Haledon, New Jersey by childhood friends Brian King (drums,) Antonio Valenti (bass,) and Joe Padula (guitars) \u2013 their ambitions have been to produce heavy, melodic rock. After several male and female vocalists, Kimmii Heart had joined in 2013 establishing the definitive line-up known today worldwide.\n\nIn September of 2015, the self-produced debut full length \u201dSkinn\u201d was released. A unique sound to global rock fans, it was secretly a greatest hits album capitalizing on Reality Suite\u2019s most popular songs from previous EPs. \"Skinn boasts a number of standout tracks, including hook-laden first single, Die Dreaming with the equally infectious Save My Life and Playing with Fire,\" printed the Record/Herald News reporter, Brian Aberback. The song Save My Life was featured as the Song of the Week in Steppin' Out, a NJ music publication while MPire Magazine declared, \u201cSkinn is a damned near perfect piece of rock, one that incorporates the old and new in the right balance.\"\n\nAfter an aggressive band managed social media campaign, Reality Suite has developed over 24,000 followers worldwide. There are pleas from male and female fans of all ages requesting the New Jersey based band to perform in their cities and countries. Several continents are represented by fans posting photos with their \u201cSkinn\u201d CD, wearing Reality Suite t-shirts, posting screenshots while streaming tracks and videos of themselves singing their songs. \u201cWhen recording \u201cSkinn,\u201d we didn\u2019t know if anyone was going to care about it,\" Brian told WDHA 105.5FM DJ, Lidsay Klein in an interview. \"We knew about 12 friends that would be interested, that was it. Months after its release, we are constantly receiving praise from fans around the world. It is so fulfilling. It is truly driving us to take our new album to the next level,\u201d\n\nIn October 2016, Reality Suite released the single \"Bury Me Alive.\" Leading music review website, Stereo Stickman stated: \"It feels like an instant classic. It\u2019s like the band have taken this incredible leap forwards into alternate territory, without sacrificing any of what we loved about them in the first place. They\u2019ve brought back the things we loved the most about early 2000\u2019s rock and pop-rock, and fused it effectively with this fresh and always addictive Reality Suite sound.\"\n\nIn May of 2018, Reality Suite released the Awaken EP. Brian King revealed in an interview with PopBreak.com: \"The songs \"Grave\" and \"Cut, Burn, Bruise\" may be closest to defining what \"Awaken\" is all about. During the writing for what became \"Awaken,\" Kimmii and I realized most of what we were writing lyrics about were losing loved ones. Each of us in the band had lost someone in the last two years. I lost my mother in 2016 to lung cancer - which spawned the song \"Cut, Burn Bruise.\" Kimmii lost a close family friend which inspired \"Grave.\" Antonio lost his mother and Joe had lost an Aunt in 2017 - so, as much as \"Grave\" and \"Cut\" are about missing a loved one, in the context with the other songs - \"Awaken\" becomes an album about recovery and rebirth......leaving the pain behind and moving on. The songs \"Live Now Forever,\" \"Dead to Me,\" and \"Lust\" drive that point home.\"\n\nAs Kimmii sings on the \"Awaken (deluxe)\" lead-off single \"Kiss the Ring,\" \"I don't need you telling me what's right, I've got my own two eyes - I WILL NOT KISS THE RING,\" Reality Suite have never compromised their visions yet earned the loyalty of many fans worldwide.

Still, Couvares is determined to age gracefully in an increasingly crestfallen era of draconian politics and disenchantment on his upcoming release, When This All Ends (out April 24), mixed by Charlie Stavish (Jenny Lewis, Interpol, Weezer) and mastered by Robin Schmidt (The 1975, The Japanese House, Ben Howard).\n\nWhen This All Ends is a coming of age tale for Couvares, who plans to keep exuberance intact but yearns to jettison reckless abandon and feckless joy, now a 26-year-old working-class citizen; and while he may not be The Only Living Boy in New York, he\u2019s not impervious to loneliness. Swallowing the dregs that remain of youthful naivet\u00e9, the unassuming crooner yields wistful, spirited coos akin to Ezra Koenig and Morning Benders era Chris Chu. Through character-driven exploits of the heart and semi-autobiographical accounts, Couvo\u2019s lyrics take precedence, though his big-hearted choruses on songs like \u201cStill Hanging On\u201d and \u201cGloria Steinem\u201d remain unaffected, and equally poignant.\n\nOn \u201cStill Hanging On,\u201d Couvares manages to wax humor alongside poetry, by capturing an awestruck revelation - the field noise of a would-be laureate outside of Roberta\u2019s Pizza & Bakery on Moore Street, who exclaims, \u201cWait, wait, wait - but also - we can do takeaway,\u201d as if struck by a bolt of lightning. Although Brooklyn is quite the bitter pill at times, Couvares invites all of his high school friends from Manchester, CT inside the studio to wrangle warmth and nostalgia on the chorus of \u201cStill Hanging On\u201d; the first half of the track presents minimal instrumentation, with caj\u00f3n, a charming piano cadence, acoustic and electric guitar balladry and soothing vocals, only to give rise to a bigger and jazzier arrangement, replete with a Clarence-esque sax solo, a full drum kit, and the aforementioned chorus of dear friends.\n\n\u201cTo all my friends that I grew up with, who I don\u2019t see anymore/To all those nights when we had no idea what it was that we were living for/You know those days are over/We\u2019re all just getting older/And I know those years are gone/My dreams, they\u2019ve been a little bent and bruised/But they\u2019re still hangin\u2019 on.\u201d\n\n\u201cGloria Steinem\u201d sedates the listener with sizzling auxiliary percussion, ethereal guitar swells, rapturous saxophone, and another big chorus that presupposes the taxing journey and romantic interest of a rich girl who exhibits a duality in the spirit of Roxanne Gay\u2019s Bad Feminist: on one hand, she\u2019s \u201ccoked out of her mind/Lower East Side all the time,\u201d and on the other, the narrator reveals, \u201cShe had this little letter that she wrote when she was seven/To the person she\u2019d become/How she would be a doctor, and a lawyer and a mother, and the president all at once,\u201d illuminating (quite literally) the ridiculous laundry list of gratuitous expectations society places on women, and the letter is - in turn - upended by a zippo lighter. Meanwhile, the narrator explains, \u201cAll she ever wanted was to be Gloria Steinem/ But the gig was already booked.\u201d It\u2019s the story of a rich girl and a poor boy, talking in circles as they try to relate to one another, and all the while, not being ready for any burdensome chapters that come with being an adult in real-time. Then again, who is?\n\n\u201cGoon Squad,\u201d which Couvares describes as \u201cthe heart of the record,\u201d continues the boy-meets-world-and-falls-in-love-with-a-girl, drunk-on-a-Summer-day-in-Brooklyn narrative, with just a dash of spite at the behest of blame, as the unreliable narrator is called out on truths that, perhaps hit too close to home; Couvares also begs the question, how does anyone truly know what\u2019s best for their significant other, as we try, earnestly, not to burst any bubbles, in the name of love? \u201cAnd if I\u2019m another boy like the rest/You\u2019re a question mark in a Summer dress,\u201d Couvares declares.\n\n\u201cThe older I get, the harder it is to feel anything,\u201d says Couvares, and as we all know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Skylarking aside - and when we strip all the trivial pursuits of escapism away from our lives - it\u2019s hard to proclaim what one should focus on when they pore over both socioeconomic status, and even harder to occasionally enjoy one\u2019s adulthood in the ghost of their youth, without first considering what\u2019s left behind, when this all ends.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "5th & Ocean Ave, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "The Extensions", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8929438.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.01, 40.22], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Power Pop, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Wonder Bar", "moreBioInfo": "The Extensions are the Asbury Park equivalent of Fleetwood Mac to Buckingham Nicks and The Hold Steady to Lifter Puller.

Bryce sings the hits and cult favorites from every era and every genre and makes it a point to create an experience for his audience in the moment by constantly conjuring new versions of old favorites, connecting songs and building huge soundscapes on his own that are worthy of stadium performance.\n\nBryce's most recent release, \"Here's to You,\" is a full length, fully produced album that was funded through a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign that raised over $24,000. He used the money to spend three months in Nashville, TN, working with producer Freddy Wall at the legendary Dark Horse Studios.

The show brought him exposure in countless new markets, and also brought his musicianship to a new level as a solo artist.\n\nBryce Larsen is now a middle school general music teacher, introducing a new generation to the lifelong benefits of music through piano, guitar, percussion and any instrument he can get his hands on. He works to help kids shed the fear of improvisation and trust themselves and each other as musicians.\n\nMost nights, you can find Bryce performing solo with his Martin GPCPA1 guitar.

If intergalactic energy beings, upon their initiation into an order of whirling dervishes, built a pan-dimensional booty-shaking engine powered by psychedelic math...it would sound like a cut-rate CTS cover band. With their blend of progressive rock and improvisatory jazz, soaked in Indian and Middle Eastern styles, CTS blends disparate elements into an utterly original whole. A relentless touring schedule has earned them a fervent following around the world, with fans ranging from jam-band hippies to corpse-painted headbangers.\n\nTheir latest album, You Are Literally a Metaphor, is the culmination of a fifteen-year musical journey. Packed with the same fury and dazzling virtuosity of their previous work, Metaphor is also a portrait of three musicians reaching new levels of maturity.\n\nFrom the bluesy swing of \u201cWhen You\u2019ve Loved and Lost Like Frankie Has\u201d to the ethereal electro-synths of \u201cSketches From a Blind Man\u201d, CTS\u2019s minimalist pop instincts stand shoulder-to-shoulder with progressive metal and freewheeling improvisation in a true expression of their omnivorous musicality. Three of Metaphor\u2019s nine songs are Eastern European traditionals, but could easily be mistaken for the band\u2019s original tunes, so singular has their sound become. CTS retain their signature fiery maximalism while pushing the hooky, anthemic songwriting to the forefront. Bassist John Ferrara\u2019s new Taurus bass pedals and guitarist Gabriel Marin\u2019s new custom Vigier double-neck guitar add new dimensions to the band\u2019s already diverse sound.\n\nThis is an album born of comfort and growth. In the five years since World War Trio, the band has toured extensively, Marin and Ferrara have released side projects, and drummer/percussionist Jeff Mann has gone from a relative newcomer to a road-hardened veteran. After all this time, CTS knows how to create space for each other, how to finish each other\u2019s musical thoughts and sentences, how to think as three individuals but speak with one voice. You Are Literally a Metaphor is a statement of confidence, an assertion of identity from a band with no reservations and nothing to prove.\n\nCTS have performed in a half-dozen countries across three continents.

LOWLIGHT are just as keen to hit the road as they are to get back to the same local stages that the members first shared when their previous bands were grinding it out. The beauty this time around is that as individuals they all know what works and what doesn\u2019t, and as a band this renewed focus allows them to all work for the same common goal; to create a sound and live show that they\u2019re damn proud of.

For this questing artist, it\u2019s not about the rear-view but the road ahead. The next song. The next session. Tonight\u2019s show and tomorrow\u2019s bus ride. But as Dana sheds her musical skin with her triumphant fourth album Love Lives On, it seems a fitting juncture to rewind the reels and thumb a backstory as compelling as any in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. This life and times doesn\u2019t always make for easy reading. The triumphs are laced by tragedy, ugliness, injustice. But whatever the obstacles, music and love have been the beacons that guide her on.\n\nAs one of New York City\u2019s favorite daughters, it\u2019s tempting to imagine that Dana\u2019s career began amidst the subterranean throb in the clubs on the Lower East Side. It\u2019s true: that city was her birthplace and springboard to fame. But to truly grasp her artistic motivations, you\u2019d have to follow the family\u2019s car towards Florida, and rattle along the dirt tracks until you hit Wildwood: a backwoods town, population 2000, where black and white were split along battlelines and distrust simmered in the air. \u201cBack in the \u201970s, it was a sorta small, racist town,\u201d remembers Dana, who dropped a social hand-grenade by dating a black friend. \u201cWe were a big family from New York, Irish-Catholic, there was no one like us in the area. I tended to gravitate more towards the African-American community. I felt more accepted by them.\u201d\nDana and her five older siblings ran wild in the woods (she remembers herself as a \u201ctomboy with dirt under my nails\u201d). Yet this was no picture-perfect childhood, the family\u2019s mood and rhythm set by her father: a former Marine in daily conflict with his demons. \u201cHe was a very tortured soul who had one of the most brutal lives of anyone I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d explains Dana of the patriarch commemorated in Faithful Sinner, one of the songs she wrote for the album. \u201cHe was tortured by his father and molested by his mother. His beatings only stopped because his father took his own life. My father found him. With all that pain, he was most certainly a flawed parent. He could also be very angry and scary, especially when he drank. Still, we knew he loved us.\u201d\nIf the household was fractious, then music was always the balm. Ostracised at school, Dana found solace in the stomp-and-holler gospel of her local Baptist church, but it was the British classic rock blasted out by her siblings \u2013 The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Fleetwood Mac \u2013 that lit a lightbulb over her head. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew I had to do music,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen I started hearing that stuff, at 10 or 11, I stopped listening to other music completely. Later on, I appreciated my parents\u2019 music \u2013 Hank Williams, Ray Charles, Billie Holiday \u2013 but when I heard the old classic rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, I lost my mind over that stuff.\u201d\n\nDana\u2019s musical appetite was bottomless, and when fronting a band at a local Holiday Inn was no longer enough, the 19-year-old singer hatched a bolder plan. At this time, New York did not hold happy associations. The city had been the backdrop to the tragic death of Dana\u2019s beloved elder sister, Donna. \u201cShe and my brother Don had a band, quite popular in the South. She went up to New York City to find her fame and fortune. She took a lot of wrong turns and tragically ended her life.\u201d\n\nAny other 19-year-old might have run a mile from New York\u2019s bearpit music scene, but Dana used the pain as her fuel (\u201cDonna\u2019s suicide,\u201d she says, \u201ccatapulted me from despair to determination to fulfil our shared dream of music\u201d). Yet she still needed a foil. One fateful day, pounding the sidewalks of the Lower East Side, Dana heard the missing puzzle-piece, in the form of Jon Diamond: a heavyweight session guitarist who could already boast credits with Joan Osborne and others. \u201cI was walking by this little club and I heard his guitar from the sidewalk,\u201d she recalls of the musical partnership that flourishes to this day. \u201cI introduced myself to Jon on the break, told him I thought he was great, and that I had come to New York to be a singer. So, he invited me up to sing, and I faked Stormy Monday. Afterwards, he said, \u2018You have a good instrument, but you really need to learn what you\u2019re doing\u2019.\u201d\nAfter Jon exposed her to his encyclopedic blues vinyl collection, Dana\u2019s astonishing natural vocal prowess took on new depth and nuance. And so they were ready. Together, Jon and Dana hit the Lower East Side\u2019s live circuit like a wrecking ball, holding their own on bills featuring titans like James Cotton and Taj Mahal, and quickly earning a residency at the Red Lion club. Four nights a week, they shook the foundations until 3am, but there was already the sense they could be far more than a rocking covers band. \u201cEvery Tuesday night,\u201d Dana recalls, \u201cwe'd play all night, and that's where we wrote our first handful of tunes and we\u2019d try them out on the crowd.\u201d\n\nDrawn by the pair\u2019s original songs and incendiary performances, those crowds were soon stretching round the block, at mythologised hot-spots like Arlene\u2019s Grocery, The Mercury Lounge and B.B. King\u2019s Blues Club. In the studio, meanwhile, Dana and Jon planted their flag with 2003\u2019s Lonely For A Lifetime: an opening gambit that fizzed with potential, splicing a \u201960s Stax/Volt vibe with the driving grit of the Stones, and fusing the dark wit and wisdom of Bob Dylan, Tom Waits and Lucinda Williams. \u201cThey\u2019re about addiction and religious hypocrisy,\u201d she noted of tunes like Strung Out and Bible Baby, \u201cand like all the tracks on the album, deal with subjects that I have a deep personal experience with.\u201d\n\nBy now, all eyes were on her, and after being spotted by musicians from Broadway\u2019s orchestra pits, Dana won the lead in the hit musical Love, Janis, followed up by the role of Sadie in 2007\u2019s Golden Globe-nominated cult movie, Across The Universe. \u201cWe\u2019d been slugging away in New York,\u201d she recalls, \u201cand then I got the show playing Janis Joplin five nights a week. Jon taught me Piece Of My Heart and I went down \u2013 and that was it. That led to Across The Universe. The director, Julie Taymor, asked if I could act. So of course, I lied and said, \u2018Oh yeah!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe demands of stage and screen inevitably impacted on the band\u2019s studio output. But in 2011, the catalogue was thrillingly reignited by Love To Beg, crowned by the UK\u2019s Classic Rock magazine as blues album of the month on the strength of devastating songs like Keep On Rollin\u2019 and Keepsake, which addressed Dana and Jon\u2019s brief (and ill-fated) romantic coupling. \u201cWe fought like cats and dogs,\u201d she grins. \u201cThe first two weeks we were together, we were breaking up every day.\u201d\n\nStill deeper depths were plumbed on 2013\u2019s \u201cblisteringly good\u201d Bliss Avenue: an album that saw Dana battling back into the light after the death of her brother, and reaching for redemption on cuts like So Hard To Move and Vagabond Wind. \u201cIt really purged my soul,\u201d she said, \u201cin a starker, more naked way, lyrically and musically\u201d.\n\nIt takes a brave artist to rip it up and start again. But Love Lives On is the best kind of evolution, seeing Dana burst defiant from her darkest days with a sound inspired by the siren call of American soul. \u201cIt\u2019s a new beginning for me in every way,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to starting chapter two.\u201d\n\nRest assured, you\u2019ll find all the factors that have helped her conquer the modern music scene, with 13 new songs that offer heart-on-sleeve songwriting, stellar musicianship and the ragged vocal that Classic Rock described as \u201cjuke-joint dirty and illicit, evoking Joplin, Jagger and a cigarette bobbing in a glass of bourbon\u201d.\n\nBut this time there\u2019s a new creative freedom, borne of Dana completing her existing record contract, contemplating a blank canvas and crowdfunding the record that she was burning to make. \u201cI was at an interesting crossroads,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWhen my contract was up, I felt a sense of relief that I really held the reins for my next move. I need to be running things. I decided to start my own label called Get Along Records, and to get out of New York and go to the home of the music that inspired me to follow my passion: the Memphis Southern soul of Stax/Volt, Hi Records and Sun Studios. From Otis Redding to Al Green to Johnny Cash. All huge influences.\u201d\n\nFor better and worse, the record was also shaped by emotional extremes, as Dana weathered the loss of three beloved family members, before the storm clouds parted with the birth of her son. \u201cInitially, it felt the worst timing to have a baby,\u201d she says, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. The shift from grief to joy was the most powerful and empowering experience I\u2019ve ever lived. The opportunity arose to take all of the pain from the family loss, the miraculous love of a new baby and put it in a body of music. This album is all about hope and perseverance.\u201d\n\nWith her raw emotions at the surface, Dana hit the album sessions in Memphis with purpose. Armed with songs mostly penned with Jon, the singer found an immediate telepathy with producer Kevin Houston (North Mississippi Allstars, Luther Dickinson, The Bo-Keys, Ian Siegal) and a crack-squad studio band that took in original Hi organist Charles Hodges, Stax heavyweight Steve Potts on drums, keys wizard Glenn Patscha and first-call bassist Jack Daley. \u201cIt was so fast and easy,\u201d Dana reflects, \u201clike I\u2019ve never experienced before. Unbelievable mutual respect and admiration between everyone. Not one ego, ever.\u201d\nOn Love Lives On, the songs are the stars. The album opens in commanding style with Backstreet Baby, driven by grooving guitars, a spring-heeled horn section and a savagely beautiful vocal telling of a woman with \u201cnothing to lose\u201d. Cuts don\u2019t come funkier than Ain\u2019t Nobody\u2019s Fault But Mine, while Callin\u2019 Angels fuses upbeat gospel with a poignant lyric. \u201cIt has a verse for each family member,\u201d explains Dana. \u201cIt\u2019s become a song of conjuring our loved ones in our hearts at every show.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the bittersweet Sittin\u2019 On rides on clipped guitar, Sad Solution offers an effervescent strut, while the vulnerable and reflective title track \u2013 written by Dana as she watched her mother slip away in a Florida hospital following an 11-day vigil \u2013 traces the circle of life. \u201cThis song is about the experience of losing a mother and then becoming one. Letting go of the first love of my life. Lying next to her as she passed, wishing I had asked her so many things. Wishing I had more time.\u201d\n\nOut of darkness comes light. And out of that fascinating early career emerges an older, wiser Dana Fuchs, armed with the album of her life. New label. New studio. New sound. New possibilities for an artist who has so far only hinted at her potential. \u201cI sure hope those who\u2019ve been with me all along will feel as passionately as I do about it,\u201d she concludes. \u201cAnd that those who have yet to hear me will now come on board. Love Lives On is almost like a second child to me. It\u2019s who I am at this moment in time, captured on tape\u2026\u201d\n\nIn April, Dana is set to embark on her Love Lives On world tour in support of her forthcoming new album.\n\nLove Lives On will be released on Get Along Records on May 18th worldwide.\n\nCheck out http://danafuchs.com for music, video, tourdates and much more", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1272 Broadway,, Brooklyn, NY 11221", "Artist": "Very", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/204615.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.924884, 40.690956], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "the broadway", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Sacr\u00e9 Lodge x The Broadway Presents: Brown Sam / Jehovah\u2019s Princess / Very Special / 424"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Ricky Stein", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10087792.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Songwriter, Roots, Folk, Americana, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Austin-born, NYC-based singer/songwriter Ricky Stein peddles a fresh brand of Americana and the laid-back traditional/progressive vibe of his hometown.

The quartet of Horvath, guitarist Dave Whitehead, drummer Chris Ryan and bassist Christopher Rousseau enthralls listeners with irresistible hooks and captivates them with intelligent layers of sound.\n\nIn 2001, The Council released its debut album Coloursound (The Sinclair Recording Co.). Coloursound made its radio debut on Little Steven\u2019s internationally syndicated radio show \u201cUnderground Garage\" and the first single \u201cSitting on a Cloud\u201d, was named the \u201cCoolest Song in the World\u201d in April 2002.\n\nIn 2006 the band released its second full-length album, The Fall Parade (Groove Disques Records), which was nominated for \u201cBest New Release\u201d and \u201cBest Album\u201d by the Asbury Park Music Awards. The album quickly made its way to the Billboard Garage Rock charts on the strength of its first single \u201cPinkerton\u2019s Assorted Colours\u201d which entered at number one and propelled the The Fall Parade to number nine. Both the single and album remained in the Top 10 charting for three months straight. The second single \u201cStrawberry Smell\u201d, which is featured on the soundtrack of award-winning film I\u2019m Reed Fish (2007), continues to spin regularly on Underground Garage and radio stations across North America.\n\nIn 2012 The Anderson Council completed and released their 3rd full length album, Looking at the Stars. Recorded in Highland Park, New Jersey by Kurt Reil (leader of the Grip Weeds, and producer of Mark Lindsey and The Smithereens) on Sinclair Records, \u201cLooking at the Stars\u201d featured 13 new songs ranging from high-energy 60\u2019s power pop to 70\u2019s Mod Revival to 00\u2019s British re-invasion. Their video for the single and lead off track \"Don't You Think\" received extensive views online on YouTube and in the blogosphere. The single also appeared in the Canadian film The Right Kind of Wrong (2013). The record continued to surge, behind the support Little Steven Van Zandt, who deemed a deeper cut, \"Gardening Man\" the \u201cCoolest Song in the World\u201d on his Underground Garage Sirius XM radio (channel 21) and syndicated radio show. Combine that with a public endorsement from Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day, annual appearances at multiple metro area music festivals and all was looking good in the power pop world for The Anderson Council.\n\nOver the next two years, the band stayed busy and productive playing shows and kept their name in the public eye. They made appearances on several tribute records, recording their versions of songs by Elvis Costello, Bobby Sutliff, The Posies, New Jersey\u2019s own, The Critters and most recently, the Canadian rock band, Sloan.\n\nIn 2014 Christopher Rousseau joined the fold, taking over bass duties from long time member Rob Farrell. Energized, the band brought Christopher up to speed, and later that year, the band embarked on writing and demoing new material. The result is 2015\u2019s Listening Party!, a six song EP which gave their fans some well deserved tracks to spin while awaiting the next album. The EP tracklisting was unique in that each member contributed one original and chose one cover.\n\nIn 2016, fresh from signing with Marty Scott\u2019s JEM Records, the band re entered The House of Vibes to cut some tracks. Scott\u2019s intention was to introduce the rest of the world to the sounds of The Anderson Council without having to purchase their catalog. Thus the idea behind Assorted Colours, an aural history of The Anderson Council was born. Under the stewardship of Reil, the band began a massive re-mastering of tracks from the first three albums. With the intention of including three tracks from each previously release along with 4 newly recorded \u201cjems\u201d. Assorted Colours combines the old with the new sounds in a seamless presentation. The remastering adds punch to previously released songs like \u201cWe\u2019re Like The Sun\u201d and \u201cHole in the Sky\u201d while the new tracks \u201cGirl on The Northern Line\u201d, \u201cI Never Feel\u201d, \u201cMagical\u201d and \u201cFire Island\u201d simply sparkle.\n\n\nThe Anderson Council\u2019s Assorted Colours is a vibrant palette of psyche power pop and will be released on July 15th, 2016.", "otherInfo": "Lieder 8 pm\nThe Melancholy Kings 9 pm\nThe Anderson Council 10 pm\n\nIt\u2019s the end of an era, as this will be Guitarist Dave and Drummer Chris\u2019 last show with The Anderson Council.

Quincy Jones and Dinah Washington have proclaimed themselves as her godparents.\n\nBy the late 1960s Austin was a prolific session musician and commercial jingle singer. During the 1980s, signed to Jones's Qwest Records, she began her most prolific hitmaking period. She charted twenty R&B songs between 1969 and 1991 and had success on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, where she hit number one in 1981 with \"Do You Love Me?\" / \"The Genie\".\n\nThe album containing that hit, Every Home Should Have One, also produced her biggest mainstream hit. \"Baby, Come To Me,\" a duet with James Ingram, initially peaked at number 73 on the Hot 100 in early 1982. After being featured as the love theme in a prominent storyline on the soap opera General Hospital, the song re-entered the pop chart in October and went to number one in February 1983. The single was certified Gold by the RIAA. She would later team up again with Ingram for \"How Do You Keep The Music Playing\".", "otherInfo": "Grammy winner Patti Austin crosses all musical genres, has made 17 solo albums, and has performed her award-nominated hit songs on the GRAMMYS\u00ae and the Oscars. As a performer, songwriter and vocalist she has had a star-studded career that began at the age of four, making her one of the most beloved artists the world over and a mainstay on the Billboard Jazz Albums charts. Charlie Rose calls her \u201cthe most underappreciated voice in music today.\u201d She is Patti Austin, whose extraordinary career continues to cross over boundaries and reach new heights. Her most recent release, Rendezvous Entertainment presents Avant-Gershwin, won Austin the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Performance. As with 2002\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated homage to Ella Fitzgerald For Ella, Patti worked her magic again with the WDR Big Band on Avant-Gershwin. She currently serves as the spokesperson for the American Heart Association\u2019s (AHA) \u201cPower To End Stroke\u201d campaign, helping educate her fans about the importance of their dietary choices and the risks of stroke, which threatened her life and ultimately felled her friend, music legend Luther Vandross, and her mother. Patti\u2019s label recently partnered the release of the album Forever, For Always, For Luther Volume II with the \u201cPower to End Stroke\u201d campaign and Austin\u2019s version of \u201cSo Amazing\u201d is currently climbing up the Smooth Jazz Charts. Austin, the daughter of jazz trombonist Gordon Austin and goddaughter of musical legends Jones and Dinah Washington, made her stage debut with Washington at the world-famous Apollo Theater in Harlem. During the 70s she was the undisputed \u201cqueen\u201d of the New York session scene; her voice was heard behind everyone from Paul Simon, Cat Stevens, James Brown and Joe Cocker to Bette Midler, Roberta Flack, Luther Vandross and Diana Ross and on countless memorable commercial jingles. At the beginning of the 80s, Patti earned a wider audience through her participation on a series of albums with Jones including his best-selling Stuff Like That, his Grammy-winning classic The Dude, and his From Q With Love Vols. 1&2 via the standout track, \u201cIf This Time Is the Last Time.\u201d Austin has also written and created her own one-woman show, and co-created the musical extravaganza Beboperella, a modern-day, music-driven show that brings the sound and spirit of bebop to a new generation. She also is the co-creator of Oh Freedom, a show exploring the African-American quest for freedom and equality in America. Patti has devoted a lot of time performing for AIDS-related organizations and has appeared in several major benefit concerts in San Francisco and Los Angeles. With recording commitments and touring engagements already confirmed for 2008 and beyond, Patti can look at her latest accomplishments with much justifiable pride. She continues to create milestones in an incredible career; a further testament to her status as a member of that rare breed: a true artist whose creativity knows no limits."}, {"Address": "610 W 56th St, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "Tchami", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8200141.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.992666, 40.769855], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Deep House, Electronic", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Terminal 5", "moreBioInfo": "Can't Edit Your Soul", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "390 E Main St, Manasquan, NJ 08736", "Artist": "Thomas Vincent", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9456719.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.040274, 40.116865], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Salty Whale and Guesthouse", "moreBioInfo": "Singer/Songwriter from NJ.

Working alone, and at his own pace, Bejar dabbled in four tracking and worked to develop his style and vision.\n\nHe was meticulous in reworking songs again and again until he found confidence in his music and his voice. By 1996 he had culled enough material to release his debut full length, We\u2019ll Build Them A Golden Bridge. Stripped down lo-fi electric folk, Golden Bridge introduced Dan as a major new talent in Vancouver.\n\nIn 1998 Bejar added a rhythm section to Destroyer and headed into a real studio for the first time to record City Of Daughters, a sparsely produced but engagingly vibrant batch of songs in which Bejar\u2019s unique and inventive lyrics began to evolve into an obtuse and poetically original voice.\n\nDestroyer expanded once again in early 2000, this time rounding out into a quintet for Thief, the third album, which provided an expanded canvas for Bejar\u2019s cryptic and scathing indictments that warned of the pitfalls and pratfalls of the modern music industry (or at least that\u2019s what everyone claimed he was singing about; Dan offered no explanations).\n\nBy the time Streethawk: A Seduction hit the streets in 2001, the groundwork had been laid and a maelstrom of critical acclaim flowed all around. Streethawk was a highly refined and biting condemnation, a harsh satire of popular culture, an idea and conception honed to razor sharp perfection.\n\nSo where does Destroyer go from here\u2026 how does one top a masterpiece? Well, Bejar packed up and left Vancouver, heading off for a year in Montreal and later Madrid, effectively disbanding the group and starting over from scratch.\n\nWhen he returned from the wilderness, so-to-speak, it was with sprawling bombast and an obvious disdain for restraint or expectations. This Night, Destroyer album number 5 and Bejar\u2019s debut on Merge Records, was released in the fall of 2002 and continued to raise the bar, confounding perceptions of what exactly Destroyer was, or could be. Epic and sprawling, it was the perfect foil to Streethawk\u2019s sleek and refined approach. An unapologetic send up of rock and roll excess and conceit, This Night confused and amused in equal portions.\n\nBut it was not long before Bejar was busy cooking up plans to turn the tables once again. Your Blues turned everything on its head with a vainglorious retreat from the American rock tradition. Released in the fall of 2004, Your Blues was a MIDI-synthesizer symphony celebrating an exercise in old-world excess, exploring what Bejar dubbed \u201cEuropean Blues\u201d.\n\nWhen Dan decided to take Your Blues on the road for the most extensive touring of Destroyer\u2019s career, he tore it all down again. Not even attempting to recreate the synth-heavy extravagance of the recordings, Bejar instead recruited Victoria spazz-rockers Frog Eyes as his backing band, rebuilding the songs from scratch for the live performance. The results were chronicled on the Notorious Lightning And Other Works EP, released in the spring of 2005.\n\nOver the more than 10 years that Dan Bejar has been performing and recording as Destroyer, there have been numerous lineup changes and shifts within \u201cthe band\u201d. This ever-evolving shuffle of musicians has led some to consider Destroyer as a solo project, but Dan has always insisted that he sees Destroyer as a band, with full contributions from his collaborators. Admittedly he\u2019s just never been very good at the logistics of keeping a band together.\n\nAll that is about to change as Bejar assures us that the current line-up of Destroyer that emerged from the recording sessions for Destroyer\u2019s Rubies shall be the definitive and permanent line up for the band from this point forward. Many members here have performed with Bejar in one form or another before, some on previous Destroyer albums. From the sound of things on this record, it will be a band to be reckoned with. We would also be remiss not to point out that the glue that holds all of this together are Dan\u2019s longtime collaborators, the production team of JC/DC (John Collins and Dave Carswell).\n\nA new year, 2006, marks the return of Vancouver\u2019s Dan Bejar with his seventh full-length release under the moniker Destroyer. If there has been any precedent set or pattern developed over the previous six recordings in the Destroyer canon, it\u2019s that Bejar holds little regard for convention or expectations. Never one to rest on laurels, each successive Destroyer release always explores new sonic territories and ideas.\n\nThe new album is titled Destroyer\u2019s Rubies and the opening track, \u201cRubies,\u201d sets the tone well. It\u2019s 9 and 1/2 minutes long, a sprawling epic that opens with the phrase: \u201cCast myself towards infinity, trust me, I had my reasons\" the perfect summation of the Destroyer aesthetic.\n\nDestroyer\u2019s Rubies is a collection of shrewd pop music that takes no prisoners and asks no pardons. Equal parts cynicism, disdain, hope and humor; self-referential, self-mocking, sagacious and coy. There is mythology here, there is history, there is heartbreak and there is triumph. Follow along as Bejar leaves his breadcrumb trail twisting through the crumbling forests and bleak landscapes of modern popular music. It\u2019s all heady and ecstatic. Trust him, he has his reasons.\n\nBejar\u2019s Dylanesque flare for biting and sardonic wit and his nods to the glam and bombastic folk approaches of early T. Rex and Bowie recordings have clearly distanced Destroyer from the more straightforward pop of his \u201cother\u201d band, The New Pornographers. But you can hear a few more colloquial pop hooks seeping into the formula here, just to sweeten the pot. Bejar himself claims that influences on Destroyer\u2019s Rubies come from the works of Kevin Coyne, Kevin \u00c5yers, Kevin Rowlands, Kevin Junior\u2026 pretty much anyone named Kevin.\n\nSpeaking of those New Pornographers, fans and critics have often tried to decipher the extent of Mr. Bejar\u2019s contributions to their favorite Canadian supergroup (ack!), but he has always maintained a distance and mystery about his level of involvement. The truth is his participation has consisted of a few songs contributed to the cause over the years, and a few vocal performances on record. Bejar does not consider himself an official member. However, in the fall of 2005 Destroyer did head out on the road for a support slot on the New Pornographers North American tour, and Bejar was persuaded to perform a few songs live with the Pornographers for the first time in years. He blames it all on the wine backstage.\n\nMore information on Destroyer, along with fan communities, may be found at the Destroyer wiki and at Streethawk.\n\nDestroyer's new album can be streamed for free at Merge Records.\n\nFor those keeping score at home, Destroyer is and shall be:\nDan Bejar (vocals, guitar), Nicholas Bragg (guitar), Tim Loewen (bass, guitar, harmonica), Ted Bois (keyboards), Scott Morgan (drums, baritone sax) and Fisher Rose (vibes, trumpet)", "otherInfo": "Destroyer"}, {"Address": "80 E Ridge Rd, Ridgefield, CT 06877", "Artist": "King Solomon Hicks", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9715111.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.49241, 41.28225], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Blues", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ridgefield Playhouse", "moreBioInfo": "\"King\" Solomon Hicks is an American blues guitarist born in Harlem, NY.

On That\u2019s What I Heard, Robert celebrates the music of Curtis Mayfield, Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland, The Sensational Nightingales and more, alongside four newly written songs. Listen to the first single \u201cAnything You Want\u201d here (by Robert Cray), available now on all streaming services.\n\nCray and Jordan go way back, having met during the making of the Chuck Berry documentary Hail! Hail! Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll, in 1987. They started working together in 1999, when Jordan produced the Grammy-winning Take Your Shoes Off, and the recent Grammy-nominated LP, Robert Cray & Hi Rhythm. That\u2019s What I Heard is their sixth album. \u201cOnce you start working with Steve, it\u2019s kind of hard to get away from him,\u201d said Robert.\n\nThe music on That\u2019s What I Heard falls into two camps, the sweet and the funky. Of the former, \u201cYou\u2019re the One\u201d comes from the Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland songbook. \u201cThere\u2019s this thing where I feel you kind of gotta get out of your own head when you're covering one of your heroes,\u201d Cray explained. \u201cBobby\u2019s one of those. You just let yourself go, and do the song because you love it.\u201d\n\nDon Gardner\u2019s \u201cMy Baby Likes to Boogaloo\u201d and the Billy Sha-Rae minor hit, \u201cDo It\u201d are acknowledged rarities (the originals can be heard on the compilation, Groove & Grind: Rare Soul). \u201cDo It\u201d is leaner and meaner, the sort of bare-bones funk that defined the Detroit club sound in the early \u201970s with Sha-Rae, Dennis Coffey, and Earl Van Dyke. Cray\u2019s steamroller rendition gets a little extra push from guest guitarist Ray Parker, Jr., who played in Sha-Rae\u2019s band as a teen.\n\n\u201cBurying Ground\u201d is a sacred song from the Sensational Nightingales, inspired by Cray\u2019s youth, when Sundays on the stereo were reserved for his parents\u2019 gospel records. Curtis Mayfield wrote \u201cYou\u2019ll Want Me Back\u201d for Major Lance, and Cray wrote \u201cTo Be with You\u201d for his late friend, Tony Joe White. \u201cHot\u201d is another Cray original. \u201cAs for the lyrics, \u201cWe always say to ourselves, \u2018I\u2019m old, but I\u2019m hot,\u2019\u201d he said, and laughed.

Not only because of his singing ability, but his interpretations.

Brooklyn, Austin, Los Angeles, Terlingua; they've called each home in just the last few years alone. If you really want to get to know this husband-and-wife duo, the better question to ask is where they're going. Perhaps more than any other band playing today, The Mastersons live on the road, perpetually in motion and always creating. Movement is their muse. On tour, in the unpredictable adventures and characters they cross, in the endless blur of skylines and rest stops and dressing rooms and hotels, that's where they find their greatest inspiration, where they hone their art, and where they crafted their brilliant new album, Transient Lullaby. \"When you travel like we do, if your antenna is up, there's always something going on around you,\" reflects guitarist/singer Chris Masterson. \"Ideas can be found everywhere. The hardest thing to find is time.\" For the last seven years, The Mastersons have kept up a supremely inexorable touring schedule, performing as both the openers for Steve Earle and as members of his band, The Dukes, in addition to playing their own relentless slate of headline shows and festivals. It was Earle, in fact, who pushed the duo to record their acclaimed debut, Birds Fly South, in the first place. \"Before we hit the road with him in 2010, Steve said, 'You'd better have a record ready because I'm going to feature you guys during the show,'\" remembers fiddler/tenor guitarist/singer Eleanor Whitmore. \"We didn't even have a band name at the time. We were going through all these ideas and Steve suggested, 'Why don\u2019t you just be The Mastersons, and that was that.\" Upon its release in 2012, Birds Fly South was a breakout critical hit on both sides of the pond, with Uncut awarding the album 9/10 stars and Esquire dubbing The Mastersons one of the \u201cBands You Need To Know Right Now\u201d. Two years later, they followed it up with Good Luck Charm, premiered by the NY Times and praised by Mother Jones for its \"big-hearted lyrics, tight song structures, and sweetly intertwined harmonies.\" Pop Matters ranked it \"among the top Americana releases of 2014,\" while American Songwriter called it \"a perfect soundtrack for a summer of warm nights and hot, lazy days,\" and the Austin Chronicle praised the band's \"spunky wit and rare measure of emotional maturity.\" The album earned The Mastersons slots on NPR's Mountain Stage and at festivals around the world, from San Francisco's Hardly Strictly Bluegrass to Australia's Byron Bay Bluesfest. With endless touring came new levels of comfort and confidence, and when it was time to record Transient Lullaby, The Mastersons knew they wanted to take a different approach than their first two releases. The band set up shop at Arlyn Studios in Austin, TX, where Chris shared production duties with longtime friend and collaborator George Reiff (Ray Wylie Hubbard, Band of Heathens). Together, they chased a sound that was subtler and more evocative, deeper and more contemplative. \"A lot of what we listen to when we have some rare time off is what we consider late night music,\" explains Chris, who previously played guitar with Son Volt and Jack Ingram among others. \"The last record was bright and jangly and we wanted this one to be vibey and dark. A lot of the stuff is very performance-based and not at all fussed with. We've grown so much more comfortable in our skin that we really weren't trying to sound like anyone other than ourselves this time around.\" \"We've had a lot of time and a lot of miles to refine our sound and our style of singing,\" adds Eleanor, whose resume includes work with Regina Spektor and Angus & Julia Stone. \"I think the depth of our songwriting has really grown, too. Part of the time we're writing on a tour bus with Steve Earle, and the bar for poetry is pretty high when you're within earshot of one of the greatest songwriters alive.\" Rich with Eleanor's stirring string arrangements and Chris's masterful guitar work, the songs on Transient Lullaby more than live up to the challenge. The album opens with \"Perfect,\" a loping duet written partially in Washington, DC, and partially in Newcastle, England, that paints a portrait of two broken lovers who still manage to find a strange optimism in this challenging world. Spare and affecting, the song puts the spotlight on the duo's intoxicating vocal harmonies and makes for an ideal entry point into an album full of characters facing down difficulty and darkness with all the grit and humility they can muster. \"Fight,\" written in a downtown Cleveland hotel, is a wry wink at the battlefield of marriage (\"I don't wanna fight with anyone else but you\"), while the fingerpicked \"Highway 1\" twists and turns on a California road trip through an emotional breakup. \"Life's not easy,\" reflects Chris. \"It's hard for everybody, and I don\u2019t see it getting any easier. All you can hope for yourself is grace when walking through it, and someone to prop you up when you need a little help.\" Though it's a deeply personal album, Transient Lullaby is not without its political moments. The Mastersons found themselves on tour in Lexington, KY, during the height of Kim Davis' obstinate stand against the Supreme Court's same sex marriage decision, and so they penned the infectious \"You Could Be Wrong\" in a dressing room before taking the stage with \"Love Wins\" draped across their guitars. \"This Isn't How It Was Supposed To Go\"\u2014a cosmic country duet written in Cologne, Germany\u2014has taken on new layers of political meaning in 2017, while \"Don't Tell Me To Smile\" is a tongue-in-cheek feminist anthem, and the gorgeous, slow-burning \"Fire Escape\"\u2014which came to life in a hockey rink locker room in Alberta, Canada\u2014suggests that the only solution to a polarized world of fear and distrust is to find strength and guidance in our loved ones. \"As we look at the world political landscape, global warming, a refugee crisis and the uncertain times we\u2019re all living in, rather than lose hope, we look to each other,\" Chris says. \"It\u2019s a little brighter than Cormac McCarthy\u2019s The Road, but not much.\" Ultimately, the road is at the core of everything The Mastersons do. \"Happy When I'm Movin'\" reflects their constant need for forward momentum, both physically and emotionally, and the title track paints the pair as \"pilgrims of the interstate\" on an endless voyage. \"No I don\u2019t unpack my bag / Traveling from town to town,\" they sing in beautiful harmony. \"Set \u2019em up and knock \u2019em down / Where there\u2019s work and songs to sing / You\u2019ll know the place where I\u2019ll be found / If you don\u2019t want to be alone / Then come along.\" For The Mastersons, all that matters is where they're headed, and the songs they'll write when they get there.

In the wake of 2016's jarring political shift, Friedberger felt a need to be even more self-reliant, right down to the album artwork, in which she painted a backdrop and styled herself as an attempt to look like an amped up Lizzy Mercier Descloux.\n\nIn contrast to the sonic serenity of 2016's New View, which she arranged and recorded with her touring band, Rebound was recorded mostly on her own and with the producer Clemens Knieper. Programmed drums, a Juno synthesizer, and muted rhythm guitars dominate the landscape where influences range from Stereolab and Suicide to Lena Platonos and Yellow Magic Orchestra.\n\nFrom Eleanor:\n\nI spent most of 2016 on the road, and I needed to keep that momentum going. I had always wanted to spend more time in Greece; take Greek lessons and get to know Athens better while hopefully writing some music. After November 8, 2016 I set that loose plan into motion. While friends back home were suddenly becoming politically activated for the first time, it was exciting to be living in a city where protest marches occur on a weekly, or sometimes daily basis. I assembled a band of Greek musicians, played a few shows, learned a few more Greek words, but didn't get much writing done. It turned out to be more of a reconnaissance mission.\n\nAfter a month in Athens I asked my friend, the Greek musician \u03a3tella, \"What's one thing I have to do before I leave?\" After some long and careful consideration she smiled and said, \"you have to go to Rebound. It's a time warp; kind of an 80s goth disco where everyone does the chicken dance; you\u2019ll love it... but it's only open on Saturdays after 3:00 AM.\" Rebound proved to be a revelation in terms of finding the sound and energy for my fourth album. The club was very dark and despite the no smoking signs, like everywhere in Athens, it was very smoky. The \"chicken dance\" Stella mentioned was a solitary one. I copied the slouchy strut, moving back and forth in line, swinging my arms in time to the music that at first sounded like Joy Division or maybe The Cure, but never revealed itself-- one could only assume it to be knock-off by an unknown Baltic band. It was alienating and exhilarating. \"In Between Stars\" is an attempt at a song you could hear at Rebound. It's a dark and disorienting; my warped version of 80s goth disco.\n\nStay tuned in the coming weeks for more details from the story of Eleanor Friedberger's Rebound coming out on Frenchkiss Records on May 4th, 2018.", "otherInfo": "Destroyer"}, {"Address": "2960 Broadway, New York, NY 10027", "Artist": "James Shipp", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6027289.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.963514, 40.808079], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Miller Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Anat's new group, featuring members of her Grammy-nominated Tentet.

He is the son of Gail Sloatman and Frank Zappa and the second of four siblings: his older sister, Moon Unit, and his two younger siblings Ahmet and Diva Zappa.\n\nDweezil's registered birth name was Ian Donald Calvin Euclid Zappa, although this occurred only because the hospital at which he was born refused to register him under the name Dweezil. The name was a nickname coined by Frank for an oddly-curled pinky-toe of Gail's. His father instead used the first names of his bandmates to form a name. He was always called \"Dweezil\" by his family and was unaware that this was not the name on his birth certificate. Upon this discovery at the age of five, he insisted on having his nickname become his legal name. Gail and Frank hired an attorney and soon the name Dweezil was official.\n\nIn the 1980s, Dweezil worked as a MTV VJ. He also recorded some solo rock albums, as well as playing guitar for other artists. Dweezil can be seen in the music video for Don Johnson's top 40 song, \"Heartbeat.\" Dweezil has said that Eddie Van Halen was his favorite guitar player, and he began copying Van Halen's distinctive guitar style. He also had a part in the futuristic Arnold Schwarzenegger movie The Running Man as Stevie (\"Don't touch that dial!\"), and gave his most famous cameo role in Molly Ringwald's brat-pack movie Pretty in Pink as Andi's friend, Simon.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, he voiced the character Ajax Duckman on the animated series Duckman. He also briefly appeared in the television sitcom \"Normal Life\" with sister Moon Unit Zappa and former Laverne and Shirley star Cindy Williams. And he also had a small role in the Michael Keaton movie Jack Frost in 1998, along with his sister Moon Unit Zappa and fellow musician Henry Rollins.\n\nDweezil's first serious relationship of note was with Katie Wagner, daughter of actor Robert Wagner, star of the Hart to Hart tv show. Dweezil later went on to have a brief relationship with actress Sharon Stone. For six years, Dweezil dated musician Lisa Loeb. Dweezil and Lisa wrote and performed music together, and even went on tour with Loeb's band. The couple co-hosted the cooking show Dweezil & Lisa on Food Network in 2004. However, the couple broke up in the summer of 2004. Dweezil married fashion stylist Lauren Knudsen on September 3, 2005 in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2006, Dweezil organized the \"Zappa Plays Zappa\" tour. He assembled a band of young musicians with a view to bring the music of Frank Zappa to a younger audience. The tour also features guest appearances by Steve Vai, Napoleon Murphy Brock and Terry Bozzio. The tour began in Europe in May with dates in the U.S. from June.

Several demos, a few years, a new group name, and additional members later, the direction of the crew took its turn towards blending science fiction and conspiracy theories into rap songs, which at the time, was a rare take on hip hop music in the early 90s. In 1994, the early \"Demigodz\" group split up due to the ever-so-popular break up reason: \"musical differences\". However, it was through this transition that the Demigodfather met another fellow CT lyricist, Apathy. As the musical partnership between Open Mic and Apathy progressed, the two decided to rebuild the Demigodz name and take their aspirations to an entirely different level. After years of recording songs, mastering the ASR-10, co-hosting a radio show, and gaining ties with the likes of Alien Nation, Mothership aka Eternia, and Al T of Newcleus, Mic's dues were slowly but surely being paid. Along with Apathy, he also headed up a Connecticut based chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation and recorded the cassette-only \"Sureshot Affair\" EP, which was self-released in 1997 and sold throughout the underground circles of the North East. Shortly thereafter, Mic took a step back from the scene after getting married and becoming a father for the first time in his life... In 2000, the Demigodz became resurrected by Apathy and expanded into a military-like squadron of MCs and DJs. With that movement in motion, it couldn't have existed without the inclusion of its original creator, Open Mic, and once again he became immersed into the hip hop world. Since then, Mic has kept himself afloat by making appearances on wax, including \"Science of the Bumrush\" on UK-based Stonegroove Recordings and the Demigodz EP released on Ill Boogie Records in mid-2002, all of which received critical acclaim in such publications as XXL and The Source. Outside of the microphone realm, he has made quite a name for himself over the years as a professional graphic designer, in which his lengthy resume extends widely with the creation of many 12\" single, vinyl album, and CD covers for an extensive list of labels - beginning with Bronx Science Records (Apathy's first label), Raptivism Records, Domination Recordings and most recently Babygrande. In early 2006, after being reunited with early 'Nobility' member and co-founder of the first generation of the Demigodz, P-Air, Open Mic has begun work on a new duo project. Returning to his original group base from 1989-1990, and bringing back that boom-bap early 90's sound that hip-hop has lacked since it took a commercial nosedive, Open Mic is ready to deliver what many Demigodz fans have been asking for.... the real raw shit. Keep your eyes open for the debut of his new group the \"Megadonz\" in late 2007.\n\nFor more info on MEGADONZ check out their MySpace page at:\nwww.myspace.com/megadonzmusic", "otherInfo": "Discover a JazzFest, weekend Fish Fry in a restored 1800s Victorian Brownstone building of Brooklyns Landmarked Historical District, Bedford Stuyvesant.8:00 PM Mix and Mingle(Special Tickets),8:30 PM Concert, Refreshments Included, Late Night Fish fry, BYOB, and Open Mic., Info @ 917 704 -9237.

Internationally known for classic standards, late-night ballads, and the cool jazz flavor he brings to his performances and recordings, he has recently established himself as the consummate entertainer and radio program host with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli\" a nationally syndicated radio program co-hosted with his wife, Broadway star Jessica Molaskey.\n\nBorn on April 6, 1960, in Paterson, New Jersey, Pizzarelli has been playing guitar since age six, following in the tradition of his father, guitar legend Bucky Pizzarelli. Hanging out with his father, John was exposed to all the great jazz music of the era, from Erroll Garner and Les Paul to Django Reinhardt. He began playing with his father at age 20, before going out on his own.\n\nJohn Pizzarelli has recorded as a bandleader for RCA, Chesky, Stash and Novus, and in 1997 appeared in the Broadway musical Dream, a revue of Johnny Mercer songs. Along the way, Pizzarelli and his band have earned rave reviews. Reviewers often compare the Pizzarelli Trio to jazz icons such as Nat \"King\" Cole: \"The John Pizzarelli Trio has never been tighter, and Pizzarelli himself has never been looser,\" said The Village Voice of a recent New York show. \"We can say we\u2019re as lucky to listen to [Pizzarelli] as Nat Cole fans were in the years before he became a legend.\"\n\nFor Pizzarelli, the comparison to the Nat \"King\" Cole Trio is the highest of compliments. \"I've always said in my concerts that Nat 'King' Cole is why I do what I do.\" Using greats like Nat \"King\" Cole and Frank Sinatra and the songs of writers like Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen as touchstones, Pizzarelli is among the prime contemporary interpreters of the great American songbook, bringing to the work his signature style and brilliant guitar playing.\n\nWith Telarc\u2019s recent release of Dear Mr. Sinatra, an homage to 'Ol' Blue Eyes,' Pizzarelli's album count now stands at 21, an odyssey that began with My Blue Heaven in 1990. Some of his most recent CDs include, Knowing You (Telarc 2005), Bossa Nova (Telarc 2004), and Live at Birdland (Telarc 2003).\n\n\nA veteran radio personality, Pizzarelli hosted \"New York Tonight\" on WNEW from 1984-1988. Now, with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli,\" he brings warmth, humor and that long-lost \"live\" feel back to radio. The show takes place in their \"deluxe living room,\" where he and his guests play live and recorded music, and enjoy conversation that is relaxed, candid, and off-the-cuff. Recent guests include Regis Philbin, Liza Minnelli, Peter Cincotti, Keely Smith, Steve Tyrell and Tony Danza.\n\nIn addition to being a bandleader, radio personality and solo performer, John has been a special guest on recordings for major pop names such as James Taylor, Natalie Cole, Tom Wopat, Rickie Lee Jones and Dave Von Ronk, as well as leading jazz artists like Rosemary Clooney, Ruby Braff, Johnny Frigo, Buddy DeFranco, Harry Allen and, of course, Bucky Pizzarelli. He was recently featured opposite Donna Summer, Jon Secada and Roberta Flack on the Grammy Award winning CD, Songs From The Neighborhood: The Music of Mr. Rogers.\n\nJohn has performed numerous times on the country's most popular national television shows such as \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" \"The Late Show with David Letterman,\" \"Live With Regis & Kelly,\" \"The Tony Danza Show,\" \"The CBS Early Show,\" Fox News Channel and Jerry Lewis's Labor Day Telethon.\n\nPizzarelli continues to tour throughout the United States, Europe and Japan, performing classic pop, jazz and swing, while setting the standard for stylish modern jazz.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "107 Macon St, Brooklyn, NY 11216", "Artist": "Fish Fry", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.947041, 40.681511], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "BrownstoneJAZZ", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Discover a JazzFest, weekend Fish Fry in a restored 1800s Victorian Brownstone building of Brooklyns Landmarked Historical District, Bedford Stuyvesant.8:00 PM Mix and Mingle(Special Tickets),8:30 PM Concert, Refreshments Included, Late Night Fish fry, BYOB, and Open Mic., Info @ 917 704 -9237.

As the mother shelters her child, she inadvertently creates a false sense of safety. The child, in turn, spends it's life seeking comfort and escape in temporary solutions.\n\nThough Sannhet meditate on life\u2019s imperfect escapes, So Numb\u2019s nine songs showcase the band facing life\u2019s pain and joy with their eyes wide open. The collection\u2019s emotional landscape is one of existential dread, melancholy, and loss - ammunition for escapists. Despite these existential conundrums, So Numb has an uplifting, euphoric feel.\n\nThe collection was recorded and produced by Peter Katis, who\u2019s known for his work with Mercury Rev, Interpol, the National, and Oneida among others. Working with Katis, the production illuminates a more open sound for the band. While Sannhet\u2019s second album, 2015\u2019s Revisionist, was bigger and harsher than their 2013 debut, Known Flood, they offer a more wistful, melodic approach here.\n\nThe first track, \u201cIndigo Illusion,\u201d opens with Christopher Todd\u2019s eviscerating, but anchoring drums locked in with AJ Annunziata\u2019s driving bass and John Refano\u2019s clamoring, unexpectedly coaxing guitar melodies\u2014the song, a muscular anthem that mixes feedback and space, ends up sounding like a million crystals shattering in a dark room. Alternately, the heavier, more solemn and cavernous \u201cFernbeds\u201d finds added pathos from guest guitar leads by one-man shoegaze-metal artist, Planning for Burial\u2019s Thom Wasluck.\n\nAs on past Sannhet albums, the song titles are evocative (\u201cSapphire,\u201d the churning \u201cSleep Well,\u201d \u201cFernbeds,\u201d \u201cWay Out\u201d), but not prescriptive. By the time you\u2019ve gotten to the drifting, airy \u201cSalts,\u201d it\u2019s clear Sannhet has become a more patient, painterly band. The collection ends with the massive \u201cSleep Well\u201d followed by the eerie, ambient \u201cWind Up.\u201d Those two songs offer a good example of what the band does well: moving between extremes to create a dynamic that feels both climactic and anticipatory, dramatic and comfortably calm.\n\nSannhet have always been hard to classify. Since 2010, the Brooklyn trio\u2019s played instrumental music that\u2019s heavy and light, cinematic and intimate, dense but minimal. You could call them \u201cpost\u201d something, \u201cexperimental metal,\u201d or \u201cmath rock,\u201d but none of that\u2019s quite right and the band has thrown another wrinkle into the mix with So Numb. While they don\u2019t write lyrics, they do write subtexts. They pen love letters, extended epistles, and suicide notes, all without words.

The band is a talented mesh or cross-section of musicians from various decades that communicate well together and learn from each other to add to this band's success. There\u2019s a positive interplay among the artists. The music at first had an almost funk reggae feel which then suddenly loomed into an explosion of energy with an experimental, trendy, edgy flare with its techno/synthesizer sound that surges excitement and spirit to the listener.\u201d Annette Versage - Fairfield County Music Reporter\n\nThanks Annette, we couldn\u2019t have said it better. Since the band's inception, Tyrone\u2019s sound has continued to evolve into a wild mix of genres - rock, reggae, dub, funk, jam band and even some disco-esque rhythms - culminating in the third CD/Album, Shoot The Radio being released in March of 2016!\n\nWritten, recorded and mixed entirely in Norwalk CT, Shoot The Radio takes on a Norwalk feel with a reference to Sheffield Island on In The Garden and the song I Didn\u2019t Notice which is about growing up on Lexington Ave in South Norwalk. Proud to put Norwalk, CT on the map, the album features a rap by Norwalk native Leo TheFuture Futerelli and was mixed by three-time Grammy winner & Norwalk resident Phil Magnotti. The album cover was created by another Norwalker, Dave Lindsay of Lindsay Media. This record truly captures Tyrone's ever evolving sound and mash up of genres. It has a much more reggae feel and incorporates some electronica dub for the first time.\n\nThe title song, Shoot The Radio has a simple reggae shuffle beat which then morphs into a rap featuring Leo TheFuture Futerelli and his take on growing up with the radio. I Can Tell Its True is one of 2 ballads on the record and is a duet featuring the beautiful vocal stylings of Miss Sarah Golley who also happens to live in Norwalk. The first single, In The Garden is being released in February of 2016 and their springtime CD release tour begins March.\n\nFollow us:\nwww.tyroneshoelaces.com\nFacebook: Tyroneshoelaces\nTwitter: @tyroneband\nInstagram: tyroneband\n\nTyrone Shoelaces is:\nChuck Chesler: Piano, Organ, Wurlitzer, Synths, Vocals\nSam Wagner: Drums, Percussion, Vocals\nMichael Galgano: Electric & Acoustic Guitars\nPhillip \u201cP\u201d Smith: Bass\n\nThe TSL Horns:\nJoseph Meo: Saxophones\nMark Zaleski: Saxophones\nMarshall Rauh: Trombone\n\nThe TSL Ladies:\nElana Zabari: Vocals", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Emma Willmann", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9489564.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988348, 40.735421], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Upstairs at The Stand", "moreBioInfo": "Comic", "otherInfo": "Mehran Khaghani, Emma Willmann, Lev Fer, & More!"}, {"Address": "318 W 53rd St, New York City, NY 10009", "Artist": "Steve Marshall", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.985669, 40.764451], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Broadway Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "185 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Trace the Sun", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9834766.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988346, 40.722035], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall Stage 3", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Trace The Sun - Rockwood Stage 3"}, {"Address": "66 North 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "bbno$", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9144591.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.96168, 40.71925], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Hiphop, Rap, Swag, LOL, gas", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Music Hall of Williamsburg", "moreBioInfo": "getting this money wyd?? pull up baby", "otherInfo": "bbno$'s 'epic tour name' tour"}, {"Address": "1515  Road, Teaneck, NJ 07666", "Artist": "Alex Bueno", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-74.03, 40.9], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Latin, Bachata", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Elsa Bar & Restaurant", "moreBioInfo": "Este artista, nacido un 6 de septiembre en San Jos\u00e9 De Las Matas, en el mismo coraz\u00f3n de la Republica Dominicana, procede de una familia con s\u00f3lida vocaci\u00f3n art\u00edstica.

His fusion of music playing and easy going banter captures the vivacity of great bandleaders of the past. This exuberance is evident on Newman\u2019s 2016 debut album, Eyes on the City, which pays tribute to his musical journey in New York.\nAlong with his Quartet, fellow musicians from Cincinnati\u2019s College-Conservatory of Music, Newman has allured audiences during his residencies at some of New York\u2019s most iconic venues.

A year later he was enrolled in music lessons, starting on piano and eventually picking up the sax, and by middle school was playing in state symphonic bands, touring with classical horn trios, and singing his heart out any chance he could get.\n\nUltimately Kevin found his place in the jazz and blues scene in highschool and college, while also exploring his talents as a guitar player. By the time he graduated from George Washington University, Daniel had played in two quartets, four high school orchestras, two jazz and blue bands, one bluegrass band, one punk ska group, and even sang tenor in an acapella group. But it was his move to New York City in 2013, and a sudden and unexpected tragedy, that put Kevin on the path towards his eventual solo career.\n\nThat winter, during a dinner party in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Kevin received a phone call from his sister that would change everything. His mother and stepfather, adventure-seekers and amateur pilots, had been flying back from their mountain house in western North Carolina when their plane had crashed, killing both of them. Daniel\u2019s life was turned upside down, his family torn apart and the world forever changed. During his return to North Carolina to help with family business, and while reliving his parent\u2019s lives through photos, essays, and family stories, Kevin wrote over a dozen songs, all fueled by the grief of losing his parents as well as the celebration of the large lives they were known for. From those songs six were chosen to record, including one written specifically for Kevin\u2019s parent\u2019s memorial service.\n\nThe result of those recordings was FLY, Kevin Daniel\u2019s inaugural EP. The six-song project was recorded in 2014 in Brooklyn and embodies the depth of Daniel\u2019s emotions during a time of supreme distress. Southern sounds of banjo and country-loving three-part harmonies were backed by rock riffs and pop lyrics, which spoke true to life and the celebration of living. \u201cI always knew I wanted to record my own music, and a life spent being in other people\u2019s bands had prepared me to lead my own, both in the studio and on the stage. It was losing my parents that gave me the kick in the ass to finally do it\u201d, says Daniel. The EP is available on all digital outlets as well as on 12-inch opaque blue vinyl.\n\nKevin Daniel recently finished his second EP, Myself Through You, which was recorded at Degraw Sound in Brooklyn, NY, and produced, engineered, and mixed by Ben Rice. Kevin gathered together a host of talented, professional musicians from all backgrounds for the project, which resulted in a richly recorded blend of genres and instruments. \u201cWhen I started thinking about this EP, I knew I wanted to get some of the best musicians I know in the studio. With Ben\u2019s help we created a space where people could come in, lay down their own version of the parts, and create something unique to them as well as the record,\u201d says Kevin.\n\nFeaturing instrumentation as diverse as pedal steel guitar, flugelhorn, and bluegrass banjo, the songs on Myself Through You deliver sublime lamentations of the country-tinged Americana Daniel has created over the last few years. The EP\u2019s title track Myself Through You\u2019 is Daniel\u2019s attempt to take a subjective look at his own life. \u201cI often find myself trying to take a step back and see life from someone else\u2019s eyes,\u201d says Kevin. \u201cThis song came into being at a time where I was really struggling to understand someone else\u2019s point of view. I think we all struggle with that daily.\u201d\n\nFollowing the release of Myself Through You in early 2018 Kevin Daniel will look to tour throughout the US, taking a full band, and explosive live performance to his soon to be new fans.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1465 Jerome Ave., The Bronx, NY 10452", "Artist": "Tierra Sagrada", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.91711, 40.841353], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Patron Night Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "318 W 53rd St, New York City, NY 10009", "Artist": "Stand Up Comedy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617845.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.985669, 40.764451], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Broadway Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2344 Arthur Ave, Bronx County, NY 10458", "Artist": "DJ Sunny Cheeba", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9877665.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.888464, 40.8543], "Date": "Sat Mar 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-07", "Genre": "Genres: Soul, House, Reggae, Afro-Beat, Hip-Hop, Disco, Funk, R&B, World", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Bronx Beer Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Sunny Cheeba's everyday soundtrack and diverse record collection reflect the pulse of her Bronx, New York heritage.

With the slanted multisyllabic rhyme scheme of early Eminem fused with the clean flow of renegade Christian rapper Lecrae, hip hop heads deem Topher a hybrid artist. Blending the gritty sound from the boombap era with the unconventional style of today\u2019s trip-hop gives way to Topher\u2019s competitive edge and ability to cultivate the essence of authenticity- a key ingredient missing from mainstream rap.\n\nRealizing his passion for music at the tender age of five, Topher tiptoed his way into the music scene with a guitar in one hand and a toy in the other. It took all but three years for Topher to realize that following in his father\u2019s footsteps of blues singing and guitar slinging wasn\u2019t a hereditary gift passed from generation to generation. Taking his very first step against the grain, a young Topher tossed the guitar picks and picked up a pen. In discovering the natural ability to write his own lyrics, Topher soon captured the stylistic elements rooted in every true emcee. From style, structure, speed and accuracy to originality, fluid flow and seamless delivery!\n\nWhat started as a childhood pastime blossomed into a fully developed skill. From unpaid gigs at high school house parties to sharing college stages with Jared Pellerin, Topher set out to prove he deserved to sit amongst the greats in the rap game. But with time comes change. For Topher, life turned on its head and veered down a tumultuous road of heartbreak and hardships, while Jared Pellerin went on to become the New Orleans Rapper and Indie sensation known as Pell . Battling self -doubt and a lack of direction, Topher enlisted in the Air Force with the intent to find a more fulfilling purpose. Although estranged, his relationship with music never met its full end. Assembling stanzas in his head and freestyling has always been an innate ability and although Topher shied away from his gift, he found inspiration in the oddest measures. Rapping in Hebrew for an audience of 5 thousand people was one them.\n\nUpon discharge, the hobbyist pursued his passion and became a successful rapper. Topher co-founded the indie record label Be Inspired Group in Memphis, Tennessee - where he now resides and released his first full length project entitled Everybody Hates Chris on April 25th 2017-denoting the 6th anniversary from the military and equally symbolizing the moment he chose his dreams over conformity. Determined not to be boxed into the gospel rap genre, the successful entrepreneur transitioned from a strictly faith based artist to a progressive rapper- one in pursuit to bridge the gap between Christian rappers and traditional artists. With uplifting anecdotes and the aggressive surge of thought provoking messages, Topher\u2019s creative range commands attention, which is a telling indicator of true lyrical ability. His walk-in life is a proof that regardless of the hand you are dealt-how you play the game that makes you successful.\n\n\u201cA man\u2019s gift makes room for him and brings him before great men\u201d.

He takes his first music lessons and after studying under Andre Villeger for 3 years he wins the Esprit Jazz Festival Competition in Paris and is endorsed by Selmer saxophones (2006) A year later he enters the Conservatoire National Sup\u00e9rieur de Musique de Paris where his horizons broaden under the influence of peers and mentors such as Riccardo Del Fra and Francois Theberge. He soon understands the necessity to go to the roots of Jazz and in 2009 he is granted a Fulbright Scholarship to study at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary music on a merit scholarship.\n\nIn New York, the dream of meeting and playing with his idols becomes true and Yacine gets to learn from Chris Cheek, Donny Mc Caslin, Reggie Workman and with countless musicians who inspire him daily. But New York also exposes him to a myriad of different musics. Soon he is part of ex Fela Kuti' drummer Jojo Kuo' Afrobeat Collective, of late Cameroonian singer Martino Atangana's African Blue Note, of Haitian Kompa legends Tabou Combo. In their musics, he finds a deep echo to his North African roots and the Bikutsi rhythms from Cameroon become reminiscent of the trance rhythms and musics from Tunisia.\n\nThese influences urge him to find his own identity and his explorations of Cameroonian dance rhythms lead to the creation of the band AJOYO, a mystic brew of African tradition, jazz and soul. Yacine signs the music and lyrics of a repertoire that celebrates life, love and justice. The album is released in 2015 on Ropeadope Records and played on radios throughout the world from New Yorks' WNYC to French RFI, London's Jazz FM, National radio in Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria...\n\nIn the meantime, Yacine continues to play as a sideman both in the jazz repertoire with the likes of Sheila Jordan, Theo Bleckman and Becca Stevens and for various projects such as Japanese singer/songwriter Senri Oe (3 albums for Sony Japan).\n\nIn 2014 he is part of an intimate band picked by producer and arranger Robert Sadin to accompany Opera legend Placido Domingo on his remarkable record Encanto Del Mar. Yacine is featured both as a soloist and arranger of the Andalucian standard Lamma Bada and gets the chance to work closely with Ira Coleman, Mark Feldman, Rhani Khridja, Chico Pinheiro and Bridget Kibbey. This is also where he meets cellist Vincent Segal and gets the idea to explore the tunisian Stambeli repertoire with Vincent on cello and drummer Nasheet Waits.\n\nIn 2015 this project is granted the French American Jazz Exchange. The trio album will be recorded and released in 2017 with the French label Accords Croises.\n\nConcurrently to his activities as a performer and a composer, Yacine teaches song-writing at the French Heritage Language Program. In 2014 he is commissioned to compose a Musical telling the story of underserved French speaking African and Haitian communities in the USA. The show Amidou & Toya was premiered in NY in May 2014.

I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit. Other long term members include drummer Ray Levier and keyboardist Peter Vitalone, both of whom have been with KJ since\u201998 and \u201899. I am always interested in stretching myself and performing my music in different ways. The Lucky 7 recordings feature some wonderful pairings of great players that I don\u2019t always get to tour with but who have appeared in with me at The 55 and are wonderful friends too.\nKJ manages between 120-140 performances a year. New music, places to play and new festivals are what she\u2019s about these days \u201c\u2026 so we can keep on performing for new audiences. I can\u2019t stop, this is what I do.\u201d\n\nA crowd pleaser whose music is impossible to classify but very easy to enjoy, KJ Denhert is in her own special category.", "otherInfo": "THIS !

The bardo can be pleasant or treacherous, depending on one\u2019s perspective. I view the transition from youth to adulthood as being a transitional period similar to the bardo, and view the songs on this EP as telling the story of my own experience in this intermediate state.

I don't agree with all definitions. Basically everything is house music and there are different versions. Even techno music is a different version of house music, it's a little bit faster and more aggressive. I try to be somewhere in between techno and house, and the reality is that everything is based on house. I would say I'm a house DJ for sure. And all this click-house, and micro-house and bleep-house, it's only to sell better the product, you know? At the end, everything is obeying the rules of house - the breaks, the snaps, the snare-drums, the high-hats. Everything is absolutely house. You can substitute different sounds - instead of a normal high-hat, you can use a click or whatever, but it's all house.(R. Villalobos)\n(...)\n\nProducer, remixer, DJ and label owner, this multifaceted artist Igor Vicente is turning into a truly global electronic music proposition. Vicente\u2019s unique sound is built up over 4 or 5 hours creating a smooth blend of House & Techno full of effects often creating surprise in his sets. Signed with Anja Schneider\u2019s prestigious label mobilee, there seems like nothing is stopping him.\n\nGrowing up in Mons, Belgium, Vicente grew up listening to Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown KC & The Sunshine Band\u2019s and Warren G. His passion for electronic music started in his teens when he discovered the sounds of Steve Rachmad, Richie Hawtin, Technasia, Dave Clarke, Funk D Void, Kenny Hawkes, MFF, Lance De Sardi, Brett Johnson, St Dic (RIP), Dj Sneak & Derrick Carter. It was infatuation with sound of music that pushed him to create his legendary Wildfamily parties, which saw the likes of Jamie Jones, Clive Henry, Seth Troxler, Ryan Crosson, Shaun Reeves, Matthew Styles, Sammy Dee, Matt John, Tobi Neumann, Dinky, Pier Bucci, Los Updates among other DJ friends.\n\nIn 2011, Ultrasone was born and the duo started producing tracks for famous labels like Visionquest, Supplement Facts, Hot Creations and Maison d\u2019\u00eatre with remixes on Saved, Get Physical and Air London.\n\n2013 saw Vicente put Ultrasone to bed and focus on his solo career. He has since released Hot Creations bomb, The Knight with a remix by Jamie Jones. His residencies at some of Belgium\u2019s best clubs Caf\u00e9 d\u2019Anvers and Fuse have only firmly imprinted Vicente in the electronic dance music scene. With the success of his solo career flowing, Vicente founded a new brand and label \u2018State of Flow\u2019 which has gone from strength to strength and see\u2019s it\u2019s first vinyl release from French based trio LYE in February 2015.\n\n2015 is set to taste of a rich upcoming year for Vicente with another release on mobilee, a remix for Uner on Supernature, a remix for Alejandro Vivanco on SoundArchitecture, a remix for Michael L Penman on Decay Records and one for Jules & Moss on Acumen\u2019s new label. March will see an EP release on Get Physical.

Drum and Bass is her passion. Erica Munday, A.K.A. DJ Strife, has had a love for music for as long as she can remember. It\u2019s that feeling that when you close your eyes and simply listen\u2026the whole world disappears.\n\nStrife\u2019s involvement in the U.S. underground music scene started back in 1994 when she was only 14 and attended her first rave. After this one night she knew right then that this music was something that truly touched her soul and would be a part of her life forever. She soon thereafter was going to every event on the east coast that she could, which eventually lead her to her next natural step\u2026promoting. She started promoting for one of the largest event companies on the east coast, Park Rave Maddness. And by the time she was 16 she had made enough contacts in the scene and wanted to continue going forward by learning how to DJ \u2013 to be that person that controlled the crowd\u2019s inner feelings by taking you on a journey with the music they wove together. At first by playing fast-paced Hard Trance and Hard Acid music that got the crowd going, but eventually at 19 while in college in New York for Audio Recording, switched to her growing love for Drum and Bass.\n\n2003 brought the way of House DJ, Fame and his Simply Bangin\u2019 Productions which merged Strife and Fame together for combined efforts in weekly events in NYC. By joining a night of House and Drum and Bass music this allowed them to bring both styles of music together in one place. Also in 2003 Strife got linked up with all female crew Sister NYC (the NYC chapter of successful San Francisco group). Right away this combination of all genre woman DJ\u2019s and MC\u2019s connected with her, and knew together they could really make a dent in furthering woman and their place in Electronic music. Being interviewed for Los Angeles collective Technotreff\u2019s nationally distributed \u201cGirls of Techno\u201d DVD also gave her a chance to speak her mind on the empowerment on being a female DJ. Hosting and playing at events all the way from New York to Miami to Brazil to Germany, Italy Australia to London and back again, Strife continues to push the Drum and Bass sound that she strives for everyone to hear and feel.\n\n2009 saw Strife release her first official worldwide mix CD on 16 Chapel Records entitled \u201cSweet 16 \u2013 A Drum & Bass mix\u201d. The release received featured placements on front page iTunes US & UK Dance, Napster Electronic Staff Pick, Zune Electronic/Dance top banner, Amazon Dance, Liquid Audio/Walmart Dance & Thinkindie Dance, as well as featured interviews in esteemed UK Drum & Bass Knowledge Magazine & Dogs On Acid website. The release also reached as high as #123 on the iTunes US Dance page.\n\nStrife's flow of Liquid Drum and Bass sounds infused with Brazilian flavor and vocal tunes make her track selection stream together with each blended mix. As well as being endorsed by keyboard company Korg, Strife has performed all over nationally and internationally at such events as: Sun & Bass Festival (Sardinia, Italy) 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015 (She was also the first American DJ to be asked to play at this festival), DEMF (Detroit Electronic Music Festival) 2002, Respect (LA) 2012, Pacific Jungle (Honolulu, HI) 2015, at renowned UK monthlies \"Therapy Sessions\" 2003, \u201cMetric\u201d 2005, \u201cIntrigue\u201d 2007/2008, \u201cMomentum\u201d 2007, \u201cAccoustixx\u201d 2008 & \u201cSubfactory\u201d 2008.

This includes the core members of creation: Rony Iwryn, Itamar Doari & Shanir Blumenkranz. Each member comes from a different background and brings their own sound and arrangements to Ravid's compositions. The result of this amazing group is a powerful energy that mixes Yemenite, West African & Jazz influences and what Ravid likes to call \"New Age Culture Music\". The mambo and North African rhythms create a joyful and deep foundation, while the vocals remind the listener of ancient Arabic chants mixed with funk & blues.

They also opened for punk bands The Stranglers and The Motors. They had a hit with the single \"On and On\", and refer to their music as \"Athletic Rock.\"\n\nFormed in Newcastle, England by brothers John and Mark Gallagher, Raven quickly set the pace for the burgeoning metal renaissance in the UK at the time. Raven began creating a sound which was rooted in British hard rock with progressive tendencies and a willingness to take musical chances . The band's highly energized live show and interaction between members developed an image and style of play the band described as \"athletic\". They began wearing guards, helmets and plates from various sports (hockey, baseball,etc...) and incorporating them into the playing of their instruments (for instance, elbow pads were used to strike cymbals for a unique performance angle). Eventually, the band signed with Neat Records, the legendary, low-budget metal label of the Northlands, releasing Wiped Out and Rock Until You Drop within a year's time and making an impressive showing on the UK charts a the time. Sufficient noise was made for the American market to take notice and New Jersey's Megaforce Records signed them, issuing their next recording in the States as All for One. The band came stateside in 1983 and toured extensively with Megaforce bands Metallica and Anthrax, both of whom would gain a place of prominence in the growing thrash metal movement. Manager/Megaforce founder Johnny Zazula believed that Raven were major label material and kept them touring constantly until the big labels noticed. The infamous Live at the Inferno recording was a product of one of those tours. Atlantic Records signed Raven to a worldwide contract after a minor bidding war (major label contracts would follow for Metallica and Anthrax in the following year). The band moved its permanent base from Newcastle to New York.\n\nStay Hard was released in 1984 and proved a minor hit on the strength of single/video On and On. The Atlantic years proved to be less-than-stellar for the band. A drastic shift in a more \"commercial\" direction came at the label's behest, with many diehard fans being alienated by the slick, lightweight production of The Pack Is Back (effectively marketing the band with their weird musical forays and confusing image was likely very difficult). However, the band recorded 2 LPs and the Mad EP before being let go by Atlantic. After touring behind the Life's a Bitch album, Wacko left the band to spend more time with his new wife and family. He would later pursue a career in audio production and engineering, eventually working with jazz greats Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick, Jr. Virginian Joe Hasselvander (ex-Pentagram) took over the drum set and the band dropped the outlandish image for a more conventional \"denim and leather\" look for their 1988 release Nothing Exceeds Like Excess. After the advent of grunge and the dissolution of their record label (Combat Records) led the band to concentrate on continental Europe and Japan, where they retained more of a following. The band recorded and toured until 2001, when a wall collapsed on Mark, crushing his legs. Raven went on hiatus for nearly 5 years while the guitarist rehabilitated. As of 2006, Raven is touring with a new release in the works.\n\n\n2) RAVEN is a Solo project by Terui Toshiyuki (\u7167\u4e95\u5229\u5e78), bassist of BLANKEY JET CITY and ROSSO. In 2003, RAVEN released one album, Kagirinaku aka ni chikai kuro (\u9650\u308a\u7121\u304f\u8d64\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u9ed2), most notably featuring Chiba Yusuke of Thee Michelle Gun Elephant and ROSSO on vocals for most of the tracks.\n\n\n3) Raven is Czech artist and multiinstrumentalist Vladim\u00edr Ku\u010dera (*1966), who's released four albums so far - Bubny a p\u00ed\u0161\u0165aly (1991), Salome a dal\u0161\u00ed p\u00edsn\u011b Karla Kryla (1993), Harmonie (2002) and Kamen\u00ed (2006).\n\n\n4) Raven was an influential band from Buffalo, N.Y., in the 1960s. Raven began as Stan Szelest's backing band in Stan and the Ravens, which featured Tom Calandra on bass and Gary Mallaber on drums. When Stan and the Ravens broke up, Calandra and Mallaber joined a band called The Rising Sons with vocalist Tony Galla, guitarist John Weitz, and pianist/keyboardist Jimmy Calire.\n\nRaven manager Marty Angelo, trying to book gigs for the band outside of Buffalo, met Jimi Hendrix at Steve Paul's Scene in New York City in 1967. Hendrix was so impressed with the tape he heard, that he convinced the club's owner to book Raven.\n\nLater that same year, Angelo sent the same tape Hendrix had heard to Beatle George Harrison. Harrison sent a letter back to Angelo which expressed an interest in signing Raven to Apple Records.\n\n\n5) Raven:\nGenre: Black Metal\nLyrical theme: Misanthropy\nOrigin: Norway\nFormed in: 1993\nLabel: No Colours Records\nLast known line-up:\nRune Vedaa (Forgotten Woods, Joyless)\nothers - unknown\n\nMember(s) of Forgotten Woods involved in this. Their demos were released under the name Ravn.\n\nRumours say that Raven is now a solo band, changed their name to Mengele, and is still making music, but not recording. Might, against all odds, release an MCDlater this year.\n\n\n6) Raven:\nA project of the German band Sleipnir.\n\n7) Raven :\nOhio heavy blues rock band from Ohio, who released one, ultra-rare LP, 1975's \"Back to Ohio Blues\".\n\n8) Raven :\nsee Shape of Despair. They started as Raven, released demo Alone In The Mist and then renamed to their current name\n\n9) Raven:\nRaven is a trash metal band formed in 2007 in Kicevo, Macedonia.", "otherInfo": "Late night risqu\u00e9 shenanigans for those who like to go all night long."}, {"Address": "80 N 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249", "Artist": "Trina Basu", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8969262.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.961212, 40.718958], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Inspired by Western and Indian classical, Folk, jazz and creative music", "Time": "7:00 AM", "Venue": "National Sawdust", "moreBioInfo": "Trina Basu is a multifaceted violinist and teacher based in Brooklyn, NY.

Sadly, I attempted violin as a young child and was brutally bad. My parents had some how had me listening to classical music at that time which probably explains the violin attempt. Then a miracle happened\u2026First, the Beatles arrived so, bye bye classical & then my aunt who was buying a new piano (the wealthier end of the family) offered me her old one. I\u2019m 8 1/2 so I was still agreeable to anything so I promised to take lessons and really work at it.\nI lied\u2026After a year and a half I quit\u2026..until I discovered Elton John. That was it! I was determined to be a musician. In the late 70\u2019s I joined a fairly succesful 50\u2019s/60\u2019s band called Slick. I played 6 nights a week and worked full time at a department store as a stock man (person in this politically correct universe). Exhaustion wasn\u2019t considered. I went to gigs with a thermos of tea and lemon since I was always sick. This lasted until the early 80\u2019s. I joined a band called Loose Change which (under my direction) played anything from the 1960\u2019s- whatever was current. That lasted 12 years. Many years of putting my ears in harms way and breathing in way to much bar smoke told me it was time to quit. This was somewhere around 1993/94 (I don\u2019t remember). The next time I played live was in 2004 at my local block party. That\u2019s what I needed to get the itch to play again but, I was working in retail at Sam Ash Music and simply had no time to gig. In 2007 I was offered a better job which offered me a 9-5 existence. The economy turned sour and earning extra cash became a priority. And then it happened\u2026.I walked into a local Italian restaurant called Vera\u2019s Trattoria to pick up a pizza and lo and behold (fancy words ehh?) a piano player was pumping out Jazz licks. Can you imagine? Live music! I decided to approach the owner to see if I could score a gig. He decided to try me the following week. I was hired as a permanent fixture on Saturday nights. Thus The Richie G Review was born. \u201cA one man band Piano/vocals using backing tracks and a voice harmonizer to create a full band sound. My current song list represents over seventy artists including Elton John, Billy Joel , James Taylor, The Beatles and hits from the 1960\u2019s thru today. Over 500 tunes and counting\u2013 Booking email onemanbandrichieg@gmail.com .\u201d I played at Vera\u2019s for 14 months and then a new owner took over. He decided that entertainment was unnecessary. I got to work recording a CD of covers and creating business cards. The hard work paid off! I\u2019m a permanent Wednesday night fixture at the Woodcliff lake Hilton as well as sprinkling in various weekend gigs.\nRidgewood Street Fair 2013-2014\n\n392561_413258562028352_398683286819213_1318553_160572558_nRIDGEWOOD\n\nChapter 2- Ginger Martini was Born Right around St Patty\u2019s Day of 2012, I was performing at the Elm Street Grill in Oakland NJ. I was approached by my soon to be partner Wendy Kelly. I was on the floor wiring up my equipment as she, asked me questions about what I do (kind of music, etc). I was excited believing that I was going to be hired for a private party. During the break, she handed me her card.It turned out she was interested in joining me. I wasn\u2019t looking but, I agreed to see what she sounded like at my rehearsal space (haha my basement). Three songs later I was convinced. We sounded great together. A week later, we had 50 plus songs ready for prime time. She joined me at The Paris Inn in Wayne NJ. Ever since we perform around 50% of my gigs together and get an incredible response. Wendy started a seasoned veteran of the Broadway, Standard, and Country Genres. She has since dragged me into her country word as I dragged her into my pop/rock world.

His passionate performances are punctuated by a crisp acoustic guitar and soaring tenor vocals. This is best shown in his 2018 EP \u201cBreathe,\u201d a four song project consisting only of acoustic guitar, bass and vocals. And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.\n\nKyle takes in the world, processes it and turns it into song with his own special touch. He has a unique take on things, a view of the world others may not necessarily notice. He continues to grow as an artist, sharing his story and messages of love and peace.\n\nAbove all, though, it\u2019s still about the music.", "otherInfo": "3hr set w/Roni Caggiano, 2-5pm"}, {"Address": "709 Lorimer St, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Dejha", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10031264.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.950162, 40.718099], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Rock", "Time": "2:30 PM", "Venue": "Pete's Candy Store", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Madison Rising", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8444475.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Southern Rock, Hard Rock, Alt Rock, Rock", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Private Club Event", "moreBioInfo": "Madison Rising is lead by 20-year Air Force Veteran and Master Sergeant, Rio Hiett.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "199 Chambers St, New York, NY 10007", "Artist": "Women of the World", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-74.01218, 40.717249], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Contemporary Folk, Folk", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "BMCC Tribeca Performing Arts Center", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "A high-energy musical celebration of contemporary a cappella, conceived and arranged by Deke Sharon, vocal producer of Pitch Perfect and The Sing-Off, featuring four internationally recognized, award-winning, rising star ensembles.

After all, as Ezra sees it, the fans are really part of the band, active members of their movement who\u2019ve always exercised a critical role in AEG\u2019s ability to carry out its mission. This inclusive approach to musicianship, centered about respecting and celebrating their listeners above all else, Ezra insists, is what has allowed the group to explode out of their Boston-area origins to emerge as one of the most uniquely powerful, relentlessly entertaining live-music experiences in the country.\n\nFor their most recent studio release, Hurricane Wind (5/2017), AEG galvanized their community partnership by releasing 23 studio demos to fans, including multiple collaborations with John Oates of Hall and Oates fame. Ezra established an innovative framework through which fans could follow the process of song arrangement and studio tracking, help whittle the album down to just 11 polished final cuts, steer artwork creation, and assist in naming the project itself.\n\nEven amid ballooning success, Ezra says it\u2019s been not just easy, but natural for AEG to stay dedicated to its mission and true to its humble roots. Perhaps no song sums this up more than a fan favorite, selected to anchor that album. Called \u201cI Believe,\u201d it\u2019s a gorgeously layered, nakedly emotional ode to the long path they\u2019ve already traveled as a community - and to the wide-open road ahead.\n\nYou\u2019ve got a style, that comes on like a hurricane wind,\u201d sings Ezra on the track, backed by a group of musicians all equally engrossed in the material and attuned to its significance.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a spark, that lights the fire that never ends.\" With his next lines, Ezra speaks not only to the internal maxim that keeps him moving, but also to the enduring force for hope and change that his band has come to symbolize to its ever-swelling fanbase: \u201cAnd in the times when hope is gone, you give me the strength to carry on - I know the path is long, but I believe.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "15 Vandam St, New York, NY 10013", "Artist": "Chronicles", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6302171.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.0047, 40.72656], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Progressive Metal, Metal", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Huron Club At Soho Playhouse", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Feuding tailors, a cocaine-addicted rabbi and a Jewish woman who joins a fundamentalist Christian sect are just a few of the sometimes poignant, often humorous stories told through music in singer-songwriter Daniel Cainer's Jewish Chronicles.

Bucky Pizzarelli calls him \u201ca damn good guitarist.\u201d He believes jazz is music that should make the heart race, the blood pump, and the feet move. Towards that end, Rasmussen founded the Boardwalk Jazz Band, New York\u2019s only 21 piece band to feature four different vocalists and almost entirely original music.\n\nBorn in 1990, Rasmussen entered a world where jazz seemed reserved more for intellectuals than real people. Picking up the guitar at age 10, he spent more time learning Stevie Ray Vaughan and Eric Clapton than working his way through the Real Book. While his passion for rock and blues never waned, his eclectic taste and exploratory spirit never stopped looking for new music to learn; soon enough he was practicing Joe Pass and Yardbird alongside Slowhand under the watchful eye of Andrew Light. A great guitarist in his own right, Andrew introduced PJ to the wide world of jazz. He has never looked back, studying Jazz Performance at William Patterson University and leading groups that have included Scott Robinson, Rich Perry, Jim Ridl, Steve Davis, and a host of others.\n\n\u201cAn American Christmas\u201d was the Boardwalk Jazz Band\u2019s first national television broadcast. Filmed at the City Winery in NYC, the special was available in over 90% of homes across the country, anchored by WCBS ch. 2 and airing Christmas day. The show, which also featured special guest Bucky Pizzarelli, was immediately renewed and is now an annual special.\n\nThe success of \u201cAn American Christmas\u201d also led to \u201cSounds of Summer,\u201d which aired locally on WABC ch. 7 as well as about 100 other stations across the country.

Her first songs reflected a bittersweet culture shock as well as the warmth and musical vibrancy of these new surroundings. While shopping for cassette tapes of dub poets Mutabaruka and Linton Kwesi Johnson, fate put her in touch with the MC of a weekly dub poetry and music session, who took an interest in her talent and encouraged her to audition for a guest slot. Upon hearing the first song Klein had written, the host, locally renowned author Lady Elean Thomas declared, \u201cShe have soul, mon.\u201d\n\nKlein returned to the states, moved to Boston, and began performing locally. After independently releasing her first two albums, winning the Telluride Troubador Songwriting Contest, and garnering several Boston Music Award nominations, Klein was spotted and signed to Rykodisc in 2000 by then-president George Howard.\n\nHer first release for Ryko, Draw Them Near , [3.5 stars, USA Today], launched Klein on a worldwide tour where, among other highlights, her relaxed confidence and rootsy soulfulness wowed 70,000 attendees at the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan.\n\nKlein returned to the U.S. and joined the songwriter collective Voices on the Verge, along with Erin McKeown, Rose Polenzani, and Beth Amsel. The foursome was featured on Good Morning America performing Klein's song 'Little White Dove', and brought crowds in small theaters across the U.S. to their feet nightly with their blend of harmonies and eclectic styles.\n\n2004 saw Klein move to New York City to find some more grit. The result was 2005\u2019s Strawberry Lover [Ryko], produced by RCA recording artist Marc Copely. Working with Copely brought a rock n\u2019 roll edge to Klein\u2019s work, highlighting the influence on her writing of 70\u2019s songwriter albums like Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Darkness on the Edge of Town, Elvis Costello\u2019s My Aim is True, and Patti Smith\u2019s Horses, and incorporating those influences with her ongoing childhood love of Motown and soul music.\n\nStrawberry Lover debuted as the Number 1 most added album at triple A radio a week before its release, was given four stars by MOJO, a plug from the nearly 80 million readership Parade, and within weeks of its release, the emotive and sensual title track was named one of the 'Top Ten Sexiest Songs of the Moment' by the NY Daily News, alongside Fifty Cent's 'Candy Shop' and Destiny's Child's 'Soldier'.\nWhile touring for Strawberry Lover, Klein immersed herself in Chicago 60\u2019s era blues albums by Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Howlin\u2019 Wolf and songwriter Willie Dixon, where she could hear examples of a pop/rock sensibility mixed with heartfelt and sensual performances. Also produced by Copely and recorded in New York, City Garden puts Klein\u2019s soulful, passionate voice up front, and with lyrics that alternate between searing and heartbreakingly vulnerable, and a gritty production style, conveys a deep emotional intimacy\n\nKlein now makes her home in Austin, TX, where, between tours of the US and Europe, she is delving further into roots music and writing new material for her next album.", "otherInfo": "Private event.

The project is built as a listening experience from top to bottom, calling on producers like Jahlil Beats, Kev Rodgers, Kenif Muse, and Maaly Raw to create a dark, engrossing representation of his life. Above all else, Mir Fontane knows his position as an unsung hero is important, which is why he has promised to use his platform to tell stories from his community who may not have a voice. \u201cI tell stories, not only my stories, because my story isn\u2019t the only story that I feel the world needs to hear,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s dozens of stories \u2013 hundreds even in Camden alone that need to be told.\u201d\n\nInfluenced by great narrators like The Notorious B.I.G., 2Pac, Big L, Nas, 50 Cent, and many more, Mir Fontane, a moniker derived from the Godfather\u2019s Johnny Fontane character, wants to be known for his cinematic approach to hip-hop. Before viral songs \u201cFrank Ocean\u201d and \u201cDown By the River,\u201d Fontane used drawing as his artistic expression, putting as much detail as possible into his pictures. When he attended Creative Arts Morgan Village Academy as a freshman, he majored in visual arts, and started to take music seriously going into his junior year. He made an effort to record songs at professional studios, dropping lo-fi mixtapes that were mostly freestyles over popular instrumentals. Switching from drawing to writing rhymes stimulated his creativity, but he ultimately decided to fully focus as an artist.\n\nOne of his earliest mixtapes was Don\u2019t Sleep that contained the blueprint of his storytelling raps. The narratives got much richer on He\u2019s So Crazy, the mixtape that was heavily inspired by Martin and weaved in skits from the show and his perspective of South Jersey. He would slow down his pace, opting to strategically drop \u201cbanger after banger\u201d: \u201cSteph Curry,\u201d \u201cWanni Wag,\u201d and \u201cSpace Jam\u201d all have over 100k plays on SoundCloud. The positive reception eventually led to his biggest song to date (\u201cDown By the River\u201d) that topped the Spotify U.S. Top 200 chart at No. 6 upon its release. The song appeared on August\u2019s Who\u2019s Watching the Kids, a project that was similar in theme to Camden\u2019s thoughtful balance. His second biggest single, \u201cFrank Ocean,\u201d features him singing a strained hook about fans claiming to be day ones but still play J. Cole, Drake, and Frank Ocean over his music. The fan-favorite song was featured in Spotify\u2019s Most Necessary playlist for several months.\n\nIt\u2019s that mentality that Fontane, who is a goal-oriented person, continues to fight for recognition. With Camden already getting behind him, he hopes his success story\u2014the one he\u2019s currently writing\u2014will inspire a generation of artists to bring home something as coveted as a Grammy or an even greater achievement. It all starts with Fontane leading the charge.\n\nRecently celebrating over 10 million streams on Apple Music, Mir Fontane is now gearing up to release his highly anticipated Who\u2019s Watching the Kids 2 album via EMPIRE.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "518 Arnold Ave, Point Pleasant Beach, NJ 08742", "Artist": "Joe Sib", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8097586.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.049061, 40.091719], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Uncle Vinnie's Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "Joe Sib is a dad, husband, co-founder of SideOneDummy Records and parenting podcast Rad Parenting.

Such is the case with rising metalcore/djent band Currents, who after forming in 2011 spent the next few years discovering their identity and evolving into the thriving band they are today. After a change in vocalist in 2015, adding Brian Wille to the group, Jeff Brown (drums), Chris Wiseman (guitar), Ryan Castaldi (guitar) and Dee Cronkite (bass) solidified their lineup with members who shared a common current of energy that moved through one another towards the same vision.\n\nThat vision will come to light on the band's debut album due out this summer. Speaking of the forthcoming record, Brown says \"it's definitely dark lyrically. Although some of the leads and drums might make it more upbeat. Over all the album is about Brian's thoughts and fighting his demons. We left all the vocals up to him so he could have full creative control. It turned out awesome and we are super proud of it. The instruments came together over 2 years of writing. We went into the studio with over 50 songs and ideas and left with 13 songs we believed were our best work.\"\n\nThe upcoming record will mark Currents' debut, full-length album, following two previous EPs with their former vocalist. The release also finds them partnering with their new label, SharpTone Records, which is home to contemporaries like Atilla, Emmure, Miss May I, We Came As Romans and While She Sleeps among others.\n\nBrown adds, \"SharpTone Records is an absolute dream come true. Every single band has a dream of getting signed. However, getting signed nowadays doesn't mean much without the right people behind you. We waited and passed on many offers before talking with Shawn (Keith) and Sal (Torres) at SharpTone. These two guys have a genuine love and passion for music. That then translated to our band and we could tell that they were in this for the long haul. The relationship has been nothing short of amazing and we can't wait to see what the future holds.\"\n\nAfter biding their time, the future looks bright as Currents embark on what will undoubtedly be their most successful and busiest year to date!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "572 Cookman Ave, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "Greyhaven", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8538114.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00952, 40.21622], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Metalcore", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "House Of Independents", "moreBioInfo": "New album Empty Black comes out March 16th!\n\n\u201cThe Louisville, Kentucky group have delivered an explosive slice of heavy rock that is impactful and full of infectious energy.\u201d - Puregrain Audio\n\n\"Louisville, Kentucky's Greyhaven seethe, soar and swagger on \"Echo and Dust Pt.

She grew up singing her heart out in a warm home filled with music of all genres, especially the sounds of the \u201960s and \u201970s. Her Mexican-born father and American mother were eclectic art makers and introduced her to many forms of creativity.\n\nMishell loved performing for people and, at age 8, became swept up in the art of acting. For most of her younger years, she appeared in musicals, plays, and small film productions. After her acceptance to the Beverly Hills Playhouse, she moved to Los Angeles, where she studied and worked in film, TV, and commercials.\n\nIt wasn't until she booked a character with a major singing role that she realized that an essential part of herself had been lying dormant. She started experimenting with singing again; she joined a local folk, bluegrass band called Traditional Matter, taught herself guitar, and began writing songs that drew on her personal experiences.\nOnce she found her voice, she decided to make music her main focus. She uprooted her Los Angeles life and moved to New York City. The move was hard and painful, but she didn\u2019t give up. She began creating a life full of music, community, and transformation.\n\nIn 2010, Mishell released her first solo EP, \"In My Shoes\" (produced by Rich Pagano), followed by an East Coast tour. In 2011, she released her single \"Sunshine\" (produced by Kallie Marie and Danile Van Cortlandt). Soon afterward, Natalie put together the band Natalie Mishell & Company, currently featuring Troy Fannin on lead guitar, Cameron Mitchell on pedal steel, Dave LeBlanc on drums, and Tony Oppenheimer on bass. They released their first full-length record in 2013: \"Goodnight Stranger,\" produced by J.P. Bowersock (The Strokes, Ryan Adams).\n\nIt\u2019s been an thrilling 2016. Natalie recorded the new singles \u201cKeep On Lovin\u2019\u201d (produced by Rich Pagano and featuring the band) and \"So Patiently\u201d (a self-produced solo track), and released a live-session music video for her latest single. She also started exploring intriguing new projects\u2014most recently teaming up with a folk rock trio featuring songwriter Daniel Van Cortlandt and Troy Fannin. Together, this power trio has been making appearances at local NYC venues. Mishell also performs regularly at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall and curates her own singer-songwriter showcase at Erv\u2019s in Prospect Lefferts Gardens.\n\nNatalie lives her songs as she writes them, sustained by the contagious energy of live shows. She greets her audiences with a warm smile\u2014sharing vulnerability, ecstasy, and sorrow alike. Whether solo or with her band, Natalie wears her heart on her sleeve, and is ready to share her spirit and music wherever they take her.", "otherInfo": "A unique and intimite set shared between 3 songwriters.

Her emotionally disarming performances deceive in their simplicity, often times consisting of nothing more than her voice and a guitar, occasionally accompanied by violinist. Yet, they nevertheless arrest audiences through their quiet, brooding intensity, holding a vulnerability that\u2019s offset by a wintry, gallic allure..\n\nOn any given weekday, you can hear her voice echoing over the Hudson and East rivers. Equipped with only an acoustic guitar, a microphone and a tiny mixer, the French songstress delivers hushed and intimate performances for passengers aboard Spirit Cruises, set against the backdrop of an idyllic Manhattan skyline. Doucet\u2019s set list meanders seamlessly between Top 40 staples like Cindy Lauper and The Week'nd, while discreetly inserting the odd Gallic classic and, of course, a few numbers from her own blooming repertoire. Oddly enough, this sort of eclecticism works, as Doucet\u2019s own style has been informed by her superior command of the pop form.\n\n\nTiphanie Doucet got her start early on in the music and entertainment world. Harp and Ballet were part of her two passions since a very early age, and lead to a professional Dancing and Acting career. A starring role in the film Le b\u00e9b\u00e9 d\u2019Elsa, and later in the Glee-like TV series \"Chante\", gave her popularity in her native France, and the unlikely foundations for what would be a very eclectic musical trajectory. After leaving France, Doucet decided to gamble it all and start fresh in America. The 180 degree turn that her life took left her old life in shambles, bringing her plenty of heartbreak and homesickness that would prove to be a wellspring of musical inspiration. This moment of transition afforded Doucet plenty of material to write her own songs, which she began testing out on street corners, cruises and caf\u00e9s throughout New York and her newly adopted home in Jersey City, New Jersey. The overwhelmingly positive reception was such that she decided to release her own work. She released her first single \"Lucky guy\" with Grammy-nominated producer Jason Agel, whose work can be heard in productions by everyone from Kanye West to Bj\u00f6rk to Beyonce.\n\n\nA year later, she released her debut album \u201cUnder My Sun\u201d, a collection of rustic, yet polished folk numbers produced by David Baron and Simone Felice, who have worked with the likes of Lumineers and Jade Bird. Though Doucet\u2019s influences are prevalent throughout the album, nodding to the likes of Norah Jones, Ingrid Michaelson and Feist, the work is without a doubt a testament to the uniqueness and originality of her voice. The sound is amplified by Felice and Baron's production, which never feels intrusive, but serves as the perfect complement to the singer\u2019s overpowering voice, interjecting only at key moments of emotional revelation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiphanie n'est surement pas inconnue de vous. Elle a commence a 15 ans a la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, quand elle interpr\u00e9tait la fille de Corinne Touzet, dans un premier r\u00f4le plut\u00f4t salu\u00e9 par la critique. A l\u2019\u00e9poque elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 8 ans de conservatoire en musique et danse et continua jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ses 18 ans. A 20 ans elle d\u00e9bute une carri\u00e8re de danseuse professionnelle gr\u00e2ce a Redha qui l'engage comme apprenti sur Romeo et Juliette, apr\u00e8s elle enchaine les shows, plateaux t\u00e9l\u00e9s, tourn\u00e9es. Parmi ses meilleurs exp\u00e9riences, on a pu la voir sur les plateaux de la Star Academy, la tourn\u00e9e de Jenifer ou derri\u00e8re David Guetta, Jonnhy Halliday et m\u00eame Prince, travaillant avec tous les chor\u00e9graphes du moment comme Kamel Ouali, Redha, Mya Frye, Stephane Jarny ou Hakim Ghorab. Comme chanteuse on a pu la voir interpr\u00e9ter \u201cJeanie \u201c dans Hair et bien sur a la TV, meilleure amie de Priscilla dans la s\u00e9rie Chante. A l \u00e9poque elle commence a prendre la musique plus au s\u00e9rieux, rencontre Geoffrey, guitariste, avec qui elle commence a composer et voyager aux Etats Unis : Los Angeles, Nashville, New York. Lors d'un programme court au Musician Institute de Los Angeles, elle s'inscrit a une audition pour l\u2019\u00e9cole AMDA. De retour en France, on lui apprend qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'une bourse de talent ! La voila partie aux Etats Unis, et elle ne reviendra plus. Son dipl\u00f4me en poche elle entame les auditions et commence a travailler. Une com\u00e9die musicale, et m\u00eame un premier r\u00f4le dans une pi\u00e8ce de theatre Off Broadway. Mais la musique est toujours pr\u00e9sente. Elle commence a gratter la guitare, et compose seule son premier EP \u201cBetween us\u201d qu'elle revient enregistrer a Paris. Depuis, elle se consacre a sa musique, elle joue m\u00eame dans la rue, le m\u00e9tro, et a fait plus de 50 concerts a NY, dont la premi\u00e8re partie de Anna Nalick a Brooklyn, une auteur compositeur tr\u00e8s populaire aux Etats Unis, et a Paris aussi ou elle a eu la chance de faire la premi\u00e8re partie d'Arnaud Ducret au casino de Paris au Printemps 2016.\nEn 2017, elle rencontre et enregistre avec le producteur / r\u00e9alisateur Jason Agel, nomin\u00e9 notamment au Grammy Awards pour son enregistrement de la chanson \"All of Me\" par John Legend. Le single \"Lucky guy\" surprend par les m\u00e9lodies m\u00e9lancoliques et relaxantes de Tiphanie, les voix douces et ang\u00e9liques, et les arrangements explosifs de Jason Agel. Apres avoir envoye une demo de chanson en francais, elle attire ensuite l'attention du realisateur Simone Felice ( les Lumineers, Jade Bird... ) Elle debarque a Woodstock et s'enferme avec lui et David Baron dans leur studio au milieu des montagnes de Catskills, le coup de foudre artistique est immediat. L'album est sorti le 10 Aout, comprenant des chansons en Anglais et en Francais.\n\nIl attire la Presse Americaine qui la compare a Norah Jones. En novembre dernier Tiphanie s'est produit au Sunset Jazz Club. Un EP de reprises est prevu pour Mars 2019 avec aussi des versions en Francais des chansons de l'album.\n\n\n\n\nLa p\u00e9pite du jour c\u2019est Tiphanie Doucet et Under My Sun\nPar Charles Chinasky\n\nTiphanie Doucet a une histoire qui ferait un film. Jeune actrice avec Corinne Touzet (oui quand m\u00eame), bourse US, Danse sur le grand journal, com\u00e9die musicale pour finir par se faire rep\u00e9rer dans le m\u00e9tro de New York. Sa vie ressemble \u00e0 un condens\u00e9 de la s\u00e9rie Un, Dos, tr\u00e8s sauf qu\u2019il est par contre fort probable que vous vous souveniez d\u2019elle dans 10 ans. Car Tiphanie a une voix enchanteresse. Elle m\u00e9lange une guitare s\u00e8che folk avec un petit cot\u00e9 soul. C\u2019est une musique \u00e0 faire tomber les \u00e9toiles, en sirotant un petit whisky et en pensant \u00e0 la vie.T\n\n\nPRESS\n\nShaped by her experiences in France, Los Angeles, New York, and her recently adopted New Jersey home alike, Doucet\u2019s new work embraces a folksier, jazz-tinged gentleness. Its subtle warmth instantly feels like home, pervading the senses in a way not dissimilar to Norah Jones or Lucy Rose. Yet, in spite of any similarities you may draw between her and other great songwriters, Doucet\u2019s dreamy vocal quality is markedly distinct, especially in how she tenderly incorporates it into her music to tell stories unique to her own outlook and experiences.\n\nJonathan Frahm \u2022 10 July 2018- For Folk Sake\n\n\"Her vocal performance is compelling in its attention to detail\u2013the ends of lines and the wordless sighs that close the song contain a lot of emotion without going for the big move. If you\u2019re looking for a relaxing summer tune, this is what you\u2019re looking for. Highly recommended.\"\n\nStephen Carradini, for Independant Clauses\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d gotten to know Tiphanie and her sincerity to her work, is obvious to witness. Her dedication to her craft is unconditional. She\u2019s humble, energetic, honest, and she wants to share her music to greater and greater audiences. And in her humble way, she still is seeking Of herself, and About herself \u2013 and we think that contributes profoundly to music making. She wants to be \u2018happy\u2019. Happy with her work, happy with her songs making people happy, and happy with making music an even larger part of her life from a career point of view. She\u2019s come a long way. But she\u2019s a tough gal \u2013 resilient and proud of her accomplishment and the way she\u2019s come through the personal pains in her past. Her heart pushes her to do so. And in our eyes, that passion is something that we can\u2019t help but DIG about her. Kudos, Tiphanie. Kudos.\u201d\n\nJason Kim, Come here Floyd (Jun 29, 2018)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "327 Bowery, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Edalo", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.991787, 40.725751], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Bowery Electric", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Edalo comes to NYC with special guests Xen Model and Sparkle Motion!"}, {"Address": "635 Sackett Street, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "Noah Gardenswartz", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9619062.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983337, 40.678441], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "littlefield", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "For this installment of Littlefield's \"Has Guests\" series, Noah and Ester Gardenswartz curate and host."}, {"Address": "570 10th Ave, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "The Greens", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9003205.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9956, 40.759125], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Blues, Funk, Rock, and Earth Funk Party Songs, Folk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Green Room 42", "moreBioInfo": "The Greens: playing together for more than fifteen years, name and sound recognition take root everywhere they play!

She spent many hours there listening to every kind of band perform. \"It made me miss being on stage and kept knawing at me to get on with my real passion.\" One of the bands that really spoke to her was The Miracle 3, fronted by renown singer/songwriter Steve Wynn, of the Dream Syndicate. \"There was a magical interplay between him and guitarist Jason Victor. It had a certain melodic chaos, that distinct kind that I really wanted to hear on my record.\". She then met drummer Colin Brooks at a show where he was laying down his super soul beats in The Hurricane Bells. She was also inspired by bassist Matt Basile, on stage with a dual female fronted rock band, Mother Feather. \"Suddenly I saw before me, my new group.\" Alfonso Velez walked in shortly thereafter and became the final addition to this congregation. This is how Diane and The Gentle Men came to be. Not too long after playing shows to full houses in venues such as Rockwood Music Hall and Berlin in downtown Manhattan, the band soon ended up in a cool new studio built in an old firehouse in Redhook Brooklyn, called Atomic, where Interpol and Mark Ronson had recently recorded. Steve Wynn agreed to produce this first EP to be released through Velvet Elk/One Little Indian Records (Bjork, Dead Heavens, Twilight Singers). The A-side, \"Motorcycle\" \"was inspired by strumming a warn in 1957 Gibson drinking a glass of white wine and thinking about one of the new local heroes in town, who plays in a couple of bands, Threats/Drowners. B- side \"Boyfriend\" and bonus track \"Wasted Word\" were blasted through fast and loose in that instant one-day session. The record was mixed by Clif Norell, (R.E.M., The Replacements, Bruce Springsteen) and the other tracks mixed by Merle Chornuk (Ryan Adams, Nels Cline), the owner of Atomic Studios. With this first EP behind her, Diane began opening for acclaimed artists: Richard Lloyd (Television), Steve Wynn, Jesse Malin, Tommy Stinson, Jason Darling, Laura Cantrell and more. Diane and the Gentle Men will finish recording the full album this spring, with Steve Wynn producing.

(Which explains the similar artists being all musical-related)\n\n-Cabaret is a 1966 Broadway musical set in Berlin in 1929 through 1930 during the run-up to the coming to power of the Nazis under Adolf Hitler. The musical is comprised of the book by Joe Masteroff, lyrics by Fred Ebb and music by John Kander.\nIt is based on John Van Druten's play I Am a Camera, which was in turn based on the novel Goodbye to Berlin by Christopher Isherwood. Its initial run was produced and directed by Hal Prince and starred Bert Convy, Jack Gilford, Jill Haworth, Lotte Lenya, Joel Grey, Peg Murray, and Edward Winter. Such soundtrack as the:\n-Original Broadway cast\n-New Broadway Cast Recording 1998\n-Cabaret Motion Picture Soundtrack\n\n- Brazilian band Cabaret hails from Rio de Janeiro, formed after the demise of a previous underground hit called Glamourama. Their sound is heavily influenced by glam rock, also incorporating some Brazilian rock elements. Currently (as of February 2007) the band is comprised of Marvel (vocals), Myself Deluxe (bass), Peter Glitter (guitar) and De la Foca (drums).\n\nCabaret has somewhat of a cult status after their first album, \"Cabaret\", received a wide span of good reviews from both the alternative and mainstream Brazilian music press. The band is also known for their theatrical live performances, often gaining new fans after energetic performances, specially of underground hits \"Messias Pessoal\", \"Dama da Noite\" and \"Cad\u00e1ver no Palco\". The band's website is http://www.radiocabaret.com.br .\n\n\n- The Polish Cabaret was formed in 1997 by two friends: Jaros\u0142aw Pawlik and Mariusz Radecki. But it is the year 2000, when a new musician - Micha\u0142 \u2018IA\u2019 Bieniek (ex-Noise Gate) - joins CABARET, that can actually be considered the initial date of the band\u2019s conscious artistic activity.

The Philadelphia-based pop-rock band play the kind of songs that aren't afraid to stare down the darkness, with the light at the end of the tunnel flashing in their bared teeth. With the release of their debut single, \"Vertigo,\" in spring of 2018, Neverkept quickly won over a devoted legion of fans who latched onto the urgency of the group\u2019s message. Now gearing up to release their first album, Neverkept continue to push themselves in exciting new directions, tackling heavy themes with the same spark that made \"Vertigo\" such a compelling introduction.\n\nAll five members of Neverkept -- vocalist Dorian Cooke, guitarists Jay Miller and Aaron Mong, bassist Neale DiMento, and drummer Pete Adams -- are longtime friends with deep roots in the east coast DIY scene. They founded the band with the intention of doing something different from their previous projects, wanting to dig deeper into more mature lyrical themes and more complex musical structures. Their influences range from U.K. electro-pop project The Japanese House to prog-metal stalwarts Mastodon, a diversity of taste that shines through in Neverkept\u2019s layered production and irresistible melodies.\n\nEven before he officially joined the band, Cooke was never far from Neverkept\u2019s studio space, visiting their writing sessions to offer suggestions for lyrics and melodies. The first song he contributed to, \"Complicated,\" sees him tracing the wreckage of an unstable partnership over Neverkept's snaking twin guitars and densely layered vocals. \"I never wanted to be just another crack in your hourglass,\" Cooke sings at the chorus, his voice capturing the simultaneous frustration and exhilaration of a relationship that always feels close to working but never quite does.\n\nNot long after, Cooke stepped in to track vocals for \"Vertigo,\" and everything clicked into place. \"It was just so exciting to finally record with them.\" Cooke says. \"Once we started seeing how the songs were coming out, we were like, wow, this is a very new feeling.\"\n\nThe urgency and theatrics of Cooke's vocal presence helped steer the band toward an exciting new sound. Energized by the way \"Vertigo\" sounded, Neverkept decided to release it as their debut single. It quickly began racking up streams on YouTube and Spotify, where it was featured on an official playlist. Soon, Neverkept noticed that more and more listeners had begun adding the song to personal playlists, too. With just one track, the new-minted band had made a splash.\n\nNeverkept are looking ahead to 2020 with plans to release their debut album. In the lyrics they\u2019ve been writing, they\u2019ve tackled heavy topics like coping with anxiety and questions of self-worth. Their mission is to sing about the parts of life that are often difficult to speak about, rupturing taboos around mental illness and other fraught social topics, while always keeping their eyes trained on hope.\n\n\nHaving just come off their very first tour, Neverkept can\u2019t wait to see where their songs will take them. \"There's no limits at the moment,\" notes Miller. \"We want to write music that we all are in love with.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "146 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "The Ar-Kaics", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/267268.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.963479, 40.7101], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Psychedelic Rock, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Baby's All Right", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "~++~"}, {"Address": "95 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Zestrove", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8040164.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988383, 40.721329], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Arlene's Grocery", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Zestrove, C-Level, Nova Lantern and GeoTribe at Arlene's Grocery!"}, {"Address": "635 Sackett Street, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "Roy Wood, Jr.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7459564.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983337, 40.678441], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "littlefield", "moreBioInfo": "Roy Wood Jr\u2019s comedy has entertained millions across stage, television and radio.

C\u00e9line has been called one of the premier contemporary pop vocalist of the Nineties. She has earned music industry accolades from around the world: Grammy Awards in the US, Juno and Felix Awards in Canada, and World Music Awards in Europe. The entire world has seen C\u00e9line Dion literally transform herself from a gifted pre-adolescent into an international superstar.\n\nBorn in Charlemagne (a small town 30 miles east of Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada), famous for its spinning tops, C\u00e9line is the youngest of 14 children of a highly musical family. Her parents, both musicians, operated a small club, and on weekends, the entire family performed and entertained the local population. From the tender age of 5, C\u00e9line sang with her siblings and quickly acquired the ability to perform live. At the age of twelve, together with her mother and one of her brothers, C\u00e9line composed a French song which would forever alter the course of her life.\n\nThe demo tape containing the song was brought to the attention of Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil, a well respected personal manager. In January 1981, Ren\u00e9 was so taken by the voice of the young C\u00e9line, that he became determined to make her an internationally known talent - he even mortgaged his house to finance the recording of C\u00e9line's debut album!\n\nC\u00e9line began to receive recognition for her talent in 1982, winning the Gold Medal at the Yamaha World Song Festival in Tokyo, along with the coveted Musician's Award for Top Performer. In 1983, she became the first Canadian ever to receive a Gold Record in France.\n\nThe streak of recognition had only just begun.\n\nBy 1988, C\u00e9line had established a strong name for herself in her native province of Qu\u00e9bec, where she was enjoying superstar status, receiving numerous Felix Awards and racking up platinum albums. That same year, C\u00e9line won the prestigious Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin, Ireland, where she performed live before a television audience of 600 million viewers throughout Europe, the USSR, the Middle-East, Japan, and Australia. In Eurovision C\u00e9line represented Switzerland with a song Ne partez pas sans moi.\n\nIn September 1990, C\u00e9line released 'Unison' - her first English-language album and her first for Sony Music - and scored a breakthrough US hit with the Top 5 single \"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\".\n\nC\u00e9line's international breakthrough came when she recorded the title track for the soundtrack to the animated Disney hit movie 'Beauty and the Beast'. The song went to number one and garnered an Academy Award and a Grammy Award. \"Beauty and the Beast\" formed the cornerstone for C\u00e9line's second English language album, called simply 'C\u00e9line Dion'. That album produced four more hit singles including \"Love Can Move Mountains,\" \"Water From The Moon,\" \"If You Asked Me To\" and \"Did You Give Enough Love.\" In Canada, the album went six times platinum and set the stage for an incredible streak of Juno Awards.\n\nOn December 17, 1994, C\u00e9line Dion and Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil were married at Notre Dame Basilica in Montr\u00e9al.\n\nAt this time, the C\u00e9line juggernaut started rolling at a momentous pace in the UK. British fans took extremely well to \"Think Twice,\" a ballad on 'The Colour Of My Love.' For five consecutive weeks, the song and album stood on top of the respective British charts, an achievement not replicated since 1965 and the heyday of The Beatles. \"Think Twice\" remained at number one for two more weeks, surpassing the magic million mark to become only the fourth million-selling single ever in the UK by a female artist.\n\nWith 'D'eux,' C\u00e9line achieved what everyone thought was impossible - introduced French music to the upper reaches of the British charts. The world had truly discovered C\u00e9line Dion.\n\nBlessed with one of popular music's great voices, she has crossed all barriers - even that of language - with her electrifying series of international hits. With her breakneck pace of recording, video shoots, touring and appearing on TV shows and awards specials, it seems like C\u00e9line has time for little else. Not the case when it comes to an important cause. C\u00e9line has used her talents to further the cause of the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. In fact, one of C\u00e9line's most emotional songs (\"Vole,\" from the 'D'eux' album, later translated into English as the song \"Fly,\" which appears on the 'Falling Into You' album) is a touching memorial to her niece, Karine, who was taken from her by this disease.\n\nReleased in March 1996, 'Falling Into You' became the best-selling album released that year; topped the charts in 11 countries, and was voted Album of the Year and Best Pop Album at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony. The album has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide.\n\n'Let's Talk About Love' is the follow-up to C\u00e9line's double Grammy Award-winning album. Recorded in London, New York and Los Angeles, 'Let's Talk About Love' features a host of special guests including some of popular music's greatest vocalists, songwriters, and producers.\n\n'Let's Talk About Love' was released on the same day as the soundtrack of the motion picture 'Titanic'. Both albums featured the much-loved Titanic movie's theme song, \"My Heart Will Go On,\" written by James Horner and produced by James Horner and Walter Afanasieff. \"My Heart Will Go On\" quickly became the wedding song of choice for C\u00e9line's fans.\n\nIn a stunning back-to-back achievement, 'Let's Talk About Love' went on to match the 27 million worldwide sales of its predecessor; 'Titanic' also sold over 27 million copies worldwide. It is the all-time best-selling orchestral soundtrack in recording history. C\u00e9line sang \"My Heart Will Go On\" on the worldwide telecast of the 70th Annual Academy Awards, live from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song -- the second Oscar for a song sung by C\u00e9line Dion, following \"Beauty And The Beast\".\n\nA new French album, 'S'il suffisait d'aimer,' recorded in February 1998, was officially released worldwide on September 8. The first featured single, \"Zora sourit\" received rave responses on the radio all over the world. C\u00e9line first introduced her fans to the album's title track during her Let's Talk About Love World Tour.\n\nC\u00e9line's next album, 'These Are Special Times,' featured sixteen songs for the holiday season, including the Christmas pop classics \"Blue Christmas\" and \"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire)\"; and such traditional religious favorites as \"O Holy Night\" and \"Adeste Fidelis (O Come All Ye Faithful)\". In addition, 'These Are Special Times' produced the No. 1 single \"I'm Your Angel,\" C\u00e9line's duet with R. Kelly, who wrote and produced the song; the Diane Warren-penned title track, \"These Are Special Times\"; and \"The Prayer,\" a duet with Andrea Bocelli.\n\nAlso, in 1998, Dundurn Press released the much anticipated biography: C\u00e9line...The Authorized Biography. After travelling with C\u00e9line and her entourage for over a year and spending hours in one-on-one conversions with the star, Georges-H\u00e9bert Germain recounts the story of one of the world's best loved vocal artists. C\u00e9line and Georges-H\u00e9bert Germain later collaborated once again on C\u00e9line Dion...My Story, My Dream. Released in 2000, C\u00e9line recounts her story in her own words and straight from her heart. The autobiography is an exquisitely detailed portrait of C\u00e9line backstage, on the road, and in the recording studio.\n\n'All The Way...A Decade Of Song' is a collection of C\u00e9line's greatest hits, including her chart-topping hit singles \"The Power Of Love,\" \"Because You Loved Me,\" \"I'm Your Angel,\" and the Grammy and Academy Award-winning classic \"My Heart Will Go On.\" Also included are \"Beauty And The Beast,\" \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\"; and \"If You Asked Me To\".\n\nSeven brand-new songs, were recorded specifically for this collection, including the title song \"All The Way,\" a respectful and loving tribute to one of C\u00e9line's all-time favourite singers, the late Frank Sinatra.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1999, in Montr\u00e9al, C\u00e9line Dion gave her last public performance before beginning a temporary hiatus from show business to enjoy her private life... and improve her golf game!\n\nDuring C\u00e9line's hiatus, a compilation album, 'The Collector's Series...Volume One,' was released in October 2000. Among C\u00e9line's greatest hits and best-loved recordings, the album also includes \"The Power of the Dream\" which C\u00e9line performed at the opening ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games as well as a Spanish version of \"All By Myself\".\n\nBut the greatest joy for C\u00e9line and Ren\u00e9 came with the birth of their son Ren\u00e9-Charles Ang\u00e9lil, born January 25, 2001 at 1:00 AM, weighing 6 lbs, 8 oz. He was baptized six months later on July 25, 2001, in Montr\u00e9al's grand Notre-Dame Basilica.\n\nA new peak in C\u00e9line's spectacular career was reached when she released her new album 'A New Day Has Come' in March 2002, which ended her two-year hiatus. The album entered number one in more than 17 countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, United Kingdom, and the United States within two weeks of its debut. It features new tracks that range from pure 21st century pop, \"A New Day Has Come\" to dramatic ballads \"Have You Ever Been In Love\" and \"I Surrender,\" from breathtaking dance music \"Sorry For Love\" to a pair of pre-rock classics \"At Last;\" and \"Nature Boy.\" Other highlights include \"I'm Alive,\" \"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word),\" and \"Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)\".\n\nThe release of the album was accompanied by a blitz of TV specials, appearances on talk shows and magazine interviews all over the world.\n\nIn March 2003, C\u00e9line began a three-year commitment to appear five nights a week at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, a 4000-seat arena designed for her show. A 90-minute event, A New Day... introduces a new form of entertainment, a fusion of song, performance art, theatrical innovation and state-of-the-art technology. The show was created by Dragone Productions, a team led by Franco Dragone, the creative spirit behind ten of the critically acclaimed productions by Cirque du Soleil.\n\nOn March 25th, to coincide with the opening of A New Day..., C\u00e9line released 'One Heart,' a brand new album featuring an upbeat cover of Roy Orbison's classic \"I Drove All Night\" as its first single. The album also includes songs produced by Ric Wake, Anders Bagge, Kristian Lundin, Peer Astrom, Max Martin, Mark Taylor, Erick Benzi et Humberto Gatica.\n\nOn October 14th of the same year, C\u00e9line released the much anticipated '1 fille & 4 types,' her first French album in five years. Artistic director Jean-Jacques Goldman, the power behind 'D'eux' (1995) and 'S'il suffisait d'aimer' (1998), had come up with an idea to surround her with three different writer-composers who have made their mark on the French music scene: Jacques Veneruso, Erick Benzi and master guitarist Gildas Arzel.\n\nThe voice of one or other of these incomparable artists accompanies C\u00e9line's performance throughout the album, produced by Benzi and guided by Goldman from start to finish. '1 fille & 4 types' debuted as the top selling in Canada, France and Switzerland in its first week of release. The first single, \"Tout l'or des hommes\" also made radio history by establishing the record for becoming the highest charting Francophone single on the National CHR Audience chart in the BDS era in Canada.\n\nOn June 14th, 2004, C\u00e9line's album 'A New Day...Live In Las Vegas' was released into stores worldwide. The album, which includes a behind-the-scenes DVD, features thirteen songs perfomed live on stage from her Las Vegas show A New Day... and two new studio-recorded tracks: \"You and I\" and \"Ain't Gonna Look The Other Way\". The live tracks feature C\u00e9line's most recognizable songs such as \"My Heart Will Go On\" and outstanding renditions including Barbra Streisand's \"If I Could\", Frank Sinatra's \"I've Got The World On A String\" and Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\".\n\nOctober 11th, 2004, C\u00e9line's latest album 'Miracle' officially hit stores worldwide. This is album is all about the love and bond between a mother and her child, something which is precious and cannot be compared. 'Miracle' includes C\u00e9line's newest single which has the same title as the album, and many others including \"Bhram's Lullaby\".", "otherInfo": "To purchase advance parking for this event, please click here: https://prucenter.clickandpark.com"}, {"Address": "1647 Weirfield Street, Ridgewood, NY 11385", "Artist": "Parlor Walls", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.905204, 40.69784], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Rock, Post Punk", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "TV Eye", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Join a truly stellar line-up of female performers in celebrating International Women's Day 2020 at TV Eye in Ridgewood!"}, {"Address": "116 E 27th St, New York, NY 10016", "Artist": "Alex Brown Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8880737.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983746, 40.742276], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Latin, Latin Jazz, Funk, Fusion, world, Pop", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Jazz Standard", "moreBioInfo": "Grammy-nominated pianist and composer Alex Brown is quickly emerging at the forefront of a new generation of artists.

C\u00e9line has been called one of the premier contemporary pop vocalist of the Nineties. She has earned music industry accolades from around the world: Grammy Awards in the US, Juno and Felix Awards in Canada, and World Music Awards in Europe. The entire world has seen C\u00e9line Dion literally transform herself from a gifted pre-adolescent into an international superstar.\n\nBorn in Charlemagne (a small town 30 miles east of Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada), famous for its spinning tops, C\u00e9line is the youngest of 14 children of a highly musical family. Her parents, both musicians, operated a small club, and on weekends, the entire family performed and entertained the local population. From the tender age of 5, C\u00e9line sang with her siblings and quickly acquired the ability to perform live. At the age of twelve, together with her mother and one of her brothers, C\u00e9line composed a French song which would forever alter the course of her life.\n\nThe demo tape containing the song was brought to the attention of Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil, a well respected personal manager. In January 1981, Ren\u00e9 was so taken by the voice of the young C\u00e9line, that he became determined to make her an internationally known talent - he even mortgaged his house to finance the recording of C\u00e9line's debut album!\n\nC\u00e9line began to receive recognition for her talent in 1982, winning the Gold Medal at the Yamaha World Song Festival in Tokyo, along with the coveted Musician's Award for Top Performer. In 1983, she became the first Canadian ever to receive a Gold Record in France.\n\nThe streak of recognition had only just begun.\n\nBy 1988, C\u00e9line had established a strong name for herself in her native province of Qu\u00e9bec, where she was enjoying superstar status, receiving numerous Felix Awards and racking up platinum albums. That same year, C\u00e9line won the prestigious Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin, Ireland, where she performed live before a television audience of 600 million viewers throughout Europe, the USSR, the Middle-East, Japan, and Australia. In Eurovision C\u00e9line represented Switzerland with a song Ne partez pas sans moi.\n\nIn September 1990, C\u00e9line released 'Unison' - her first English-language album and her first for Sony Music - and scored a breakthrough US hit with the Top 5 single \"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\".\n\nC\u00e9line's international breakthrough came when she recorded the title track for the soundtrack to the animated Disney hit movie 'Beauty and the Beast'. The song went to number one and garnered an Academy Award and a Grammy Award. \"Beauty and the Beast\" formed the cornerstone for C\u00e9line's second English language album, called simply 'C\u00e9line Dion'. That album produced four more hit singles including \"Love Can Move Mountains,\" \"Water From The Moon,\" \"If You Asked Me To\" and \"Did You Give Enough Love.\" In Canada, the album went six times platinum and set the stage for an incredible streak of Juno Awards.\n\nOn December 17, 1994, C\u00e9line Dion and Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil were married at Notre Dame Basilica in Montr\u00e9al.\n\nAt this time, the C\u00e9line juggernaut started rolling at a momentous pace in the UK. British fans took extremely well to \"Think Twice,\" a ballad on 'The Colour Of My Love.' For five consecutive weeks, the song and album stood on top of the respective British charts, an achievement not replicated since 1965 and the heyday of The Beatles. \"Think Twice\" remained at number one for two more weeks, surpassing the magic million mark to become only the fourth million-selling single ever in the UK by a female artist.\n\nWith 'D'eux,' C\u00e9line achieved what everyone thought was impossible - introduced French music to the upper reaches of the British charts. The world had truly discovered C\u00e9line Dion.\n\nBlessed with one of popular music's great voices, she has crossed all barriers - even that of language - with her electrifying series of international hits. With her breakneck pace of recording, video shoots, touring and appearing on TV shows and awards specials, it seems like C\u00e9line has time for little else. Not the case when it comes to an important cause. C\u00e9line has used her talents to further the cause of the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. In fact, one of C\u00e9line's most emotional songs (\"Vole,\" from the 'D'eux' album, later translated into English as the song \"Fly,\" which appears on the 'Falling Into You' album) is a touching memorial to her niece, Karine, who was taken from her by this disease.\n\nReleased in March 1996, 'Falling Into You' became the best-selling album released that year; topped the charts in 11 countries, and was voted Album of the Year and Best Pop Album at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony. The album has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide.\n\n'Let's Talk About Love' is the follow-up to C\u00e9line's double Grammy Award-winning album. Recorded in London, New York and Los Angeles, 'Let's Talk About Love' features a host of special guests including some of popular music's greatest vocalists, songwriters, and producers.\n\n'Let's Talk About Love' was released on the same day as the soundtrack of the motion picture 'Titanic'. Both albums featured the much-loved Titanic movie's theme song, \"My Heart Will Go On,\" written by James Horner and produced by James Horner and Walter Afanasieff. \"My Heart Will Go On\" quickly became the wedding song of choice for C\u00e9line's fans.\n\nIn a stunning back-to-back achievement, 'Let's Talk About Love' went on to match the 27 million worldwide sales of its predecessor; 'Titanic' also sold over 27 million copies worldwide. It is the all-time best-selling orchestral soundtrack in recording history. C\u00e9line sang \"My Heart Will Go On\" on the worldwide telecast of the 70th Annual Academy Awards, live from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song -- the second Oscar for a song sung by C\u00e9line Dion, following \"Beauty And The Beast\".\n\nA new French album, 'S'il suffisait d'aimer,' recorded in February 1998, was officially released worldwide on September 8. The first featured single, \"Zora sourit\" received rave responses on the radio all over the world. C\u00e9line first introduced her fans to the album's title track during her Let's Talk About Love World Tour.\n\nC\u00e9line's next album, 'These Are Special Times,' featured sixteen songs for the holiday season, including the Christmas pop classics \"Blue Christmas\" and \"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire)\"; and such traditional religious favorites as \"O Holy Night\" and \"Adeste Fidelis (O Come All Ye Faithful)\". In addition, 'These Are Special Times' produced the No. 1 single \"I'm Your Angel,\" C\u00e9line's duet with R. Kelly, who wrote and produced the song; the Diane Warren-penned title track, \"These Are Special Times\"; and \"The Prayer,\" a duet with Andrea Bocelli.\n\nAlso, in 1998, Dundurn Press released the much anticipated biography: C\u00e9line...The Authorized Biography. After travelling with C\u00e9line and her entourage for over a year and spending hours in one-on-one conversions with the star, Georges-H\u00e9bert Germain recounts the story of one of the world's best loved vocal artists.

Produced by Chicana punk legend Alice Bag, their sophomore album No Novelties finds Fea following their instincts into entirely unexpected directions (e.g., covering an early-\u201990s pop anthem from Mexican superstar Gloria Trevi, trash-talking en Fran\u00e7ais on a y\u00e9-y\u00e9-inspired track called \u201cMerde\u201d). But even in its most playful moments, No Novelties channels a classic-punk ferocity, endlessly backing Fea\u2019s sticky melodies with breakneck rhythms, blistering guitar riffs, and boldly nuanced vocal work.\n\nThe follow-up to their self-titled debut \u2013a 2016 release that prompted Iggy Pop to praise Fea in the pages of Rolling Stone, with the Village Voice ranking \u201cNo Hablo Espanol\u201d among the year\u2019s best protest songs\u2014No Novelties takes its title from the album-closing \u201cGirl Band.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s referring to that stereotype of how female bands are some kind of novelty with no real talent,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cBut that\u2019s not us at all: we know how to play our instruments, we know how to write great songs. So \u2018Girl Band\u2019 is basically a middle finger to anyone who underestimates us.\u201d\n\nRecording at Sonic Ranch (a studio in the Texas border town of Tornillo), Fea brought both raw intensity and greater complexity to the making of No Novelties, composing more intricately layered arrangements and pushing into heavier emotional terrain than ever before. On lead single \u201cLet Me Down,\u201d the band offsets their frenetic energy with graceful three-part harmonies, their lyrics speaking to social media\u2019s constant enabling of self-absorption. \u201cSocial media is a great platform that could potentially be used in a lot of positive ways, but it\u2019s become this weird thing where everyone just puts themselves on display because they\u2019re so obsessed with getting attention,\u201d says Martinez of the song\u2019s inspiration.\n\nWith No Novelties driven by Fea\u2019s naturalistic use of bilingual lyrics, \u201cYa Se\u201d injects Spanish-sung gang vocals into a cathartic middle-class anthem. \u201cIt\u2019s about living paycheck-to-paycheck, and getting caught in that cycle where you don\u2019t make enough money but you spend too much on things you don\u2019t need, just to get some relief from reality,\u201d says Martinez. \u201cIt also came from thinking about how a lot of people in our generation are in a worse financial place than our parents, and how sometimes that makes us feel like failures\u2014even though I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily true that we\u2019ve failed.\u201d Elsewhere on the album, Fea turn confessional on songs like \u201cICU\u201d (a darkly charged portrait of a toxic relationship) and take on a celebratory mood on such tracks as \u201cItch\u201d (a surf-punk-leaning look at the scuzzy glory of touring). \u201cWe don\u2019t glamorize touring in \u2018Itch,\u2019 because for us it\u2019s never glamorous,\u201d Martinez points out. \u201cIt\u2019s dirty and smelly and uncomfortable and we love it\u2014we always embrace the dirty.\u201d\n\nBorn from the ashes of Diaz and Alva\u2019s beloved former band Girl in a Coma, Fea got together in 2015 and soon carved out a kinetic sound shaped by the eclecticism of their homeland. \u201cWe all listen to punk and post-punk and riot grrrl music, and we grew up on oldies and Latin music stars and so many other things\u2014so there\u2019s this whole melting-pot effect that definitely comes out in the songs we write,\u201d says Diaz. After putting out their self-titled debut\u2014an album co-produced by Alice Bag, Against Me!\u2019s Laura Jane Grace, and Babes in Toyland\u2019s Lori Barbero\u2014Fea earned acclaim from such outlets as NPR (who hailed the band as \u201cLatina punk at its finest\u201d), and soon began taking their rambunctious live show to venues across the country.\n\nOver the past few years, Fea have toured with both Against Me! and Babes in Toyland, as well as with punk icons Agent Orange. And as their audience continues to expand, the band aims to instill every show with the same sense of solidarity, purpose, and irrepressible fun found in their albums. \u201cWe\u2019re serious girls, but there\u2019s a lot of humor involved in everything we do,\u201d says Alva. \u201cWe try to put on a really rowdy show; we\u2019re always moving around a lot and always smiling at each other. I think everyone in the crowd can tell we\u2019re having a blast, and hopefully that vibe and energy gets transferred onto them. Our favorite shows are the ones where we can really feel that community between us and the audience.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E 16th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Mark Normand", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8983174.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988348, 40.735421], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Standup Comedy, Comedy, Spoken", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand", "moreBioInfo": "@marknorm\n\nMark Normand is one of today\u2019s most talked about comedians, and a favorite of the New York comedy scene, despite being born and raised to a fairly normal family in New Orleans, LA.\n\nIn the past few years, Mark has appeared on HBO\u2019s 2 Dope Queens, and multiple visits to TBS\u2019s Conan and NBC\u2019s The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and Comedy Central\u2019s This Week at the Comedy Cellar and Roast Battle. 2016 and 2017 included stops on CBS\u2019s Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Seeso\u2019s What\u2019s Your F@%king Deal?!

Toshi has a very beautiful voice that goes over about three octaves. \u041d\u0435 started his solo career in 1993 when he was still an active member of X JAPAN before their Last Live.\n\nToshi left the group in 1997 when it was at its fulll bloom. In the same year, he released an album, \"Beautiful Love Song\" , which showed a change of his music style, from a rock star to a healing music artist. Toshi also started giving more than 2,500 concerts at such places as concert halls, schools, various local events, etc. all over Japan on a tour called \"Uta tabi\". Along with these regular concerts, he also held charitable concerts at facilities such as homes for the old, the handicapped and the abused children, prisons, reformatories, hospices, and similar institutions, since 2001, which numbered more than 8,000 places where he gave heartfelt healing moments to a great number of audiences. Such steady and honest activities of Toshi were often taken up by the media.\n\nHaving continuously performed songs composed by MASAYA, which Toshi happened to find and felt deeply healed while he was in difficult times, for the people of all walks of life and and in various situations, he says, \"I have seen so many people shed tears to hear my songs for as long as 8 years, and I sincerely feel it is such a blessing and a great pleasure for me. I think, to heal other people is to heal myself.\" Toshi ended his 8-year-long nationwide tour of Utatabi in the spring of 2007, and started doing major activities as a healing music artist.\n\nIn October 22, 2007, there was an announcement of a reunion of X JAPAN. Toshi joined the group's 3 consecutive shows held in the last days of March, '08 at Tokyo Dome where 150,000 fans gathered from over the world.\n\nToshi released special best albums of the healing music which recorded his footsteps of the past 10 years and consecutively released such albums as \"EARTH IN THE DARK - to the blue sky\", \"ERA (JIDAI)\" and \"Beautiful World\".\n\nHaving a similar theme to such beautiful healing music, but as a rather different music style, Toshi organized a new band called \"Toshi with T-EARTH\" in June, '08. Its sound is based on 70's hard rock with shouts of Eco messages on it, in short, a fusion of Eco and Hard Rock. The band made a debue performance at Busan Rock Festival in South Korea and made a successful concert tour in the major cities of Japan in summer. It is also scheduled that they will visit Brazil and Chile for concerts in October. Toshi's message, \"Heal the earth, heal the children.\" will go beyond national boundaries and reach the hearts of millions of people in the world.\n\nHis discography:\n\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ALBUM & MINI-ALBUM \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\n\n2008-09-30 Toshi Duet 1 - Towa ni tabisuru koto\n2008-08-08 Earth Spirit ( Toshi with T-EARTH) (CD-album)\n2008-07-25 Beautiful World (Single CD)\n2008-07-25 ERA (JIDAI) (Single CD)\n2008-04-01 EARTH IN THE DARK - to the blue sky (Single CD)\n2008-03-25 Toshi Best 2 - Perfect Love (CD - album)\n2008-03-25 Toshi Best 1 - Ai no uta wo utaitai (CD-album)\n2008-02-25 Toshi Healing - Ai no uta wo utaitai 4 disks (CD - album)\n2004-12-00 - Utatabi ~~ utsukushiki machi he (CD - album)\n2004-05-25 - Sekai ga hitotsu de areba (CD - album)\n2004-02-21 - Ame no naka no ano hi no boku (CD - album)\n2002-11-30 - Perfect Love (CD - album)\n2001-04-30 - Jibun ~daite yaritai ~(CD - mini-album)\n2000-06-30 - INOCHI...

Blaque stands for Believing in Life and Achieving a Quest for Unity and Everything. The group was originally known as Blaque Ivory and is still known by that name outside the United States. The group consists of members Natina Reed, Shamari Fears and Brandi Williams. They are currently signed to Family Over Everything Ent./Geffen Records.\n\nNatina Reed departed the group to go into ministry in 2003. They replaced her with Erica Pullins. Blaque never debuted with their new member. Shamari was signed with Darkchild and set to debut in 2006, but plans were changed when her and the other original Blaque members reunited.\n\nReed and Fears both moved to Atlanta, Georgia and met while in high school. Reed formed Blaque Ivory while Fears formed another group called Intrigue. Intrigue won a recording contract with Elektra Records, and Fears met up with Williams at a talent show while a member of that group. Fears left Intrigue to join up with Reed in Blaque Ivory and Williams joined the group shortly thereafter. Reed met Ronald Lopes while singing jingles to earn extra cash and he introduced her to his sister Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes of TLC. Lisa Lopes signed the group to her \"Left Eye Productions\" and then to Columbia Records.\n\nTheir self-titled debut Blaque debuted #53 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and went platinum. Their single \"Bring It All to Me\" featuring JC Chasez , reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The album also featured a cover version of \"Time after Time\" originally recorded by Cyndi Lauper. Their only single to be nominated for a MTV Video Music Award was \"I Do\" for Best Editing.\n\nWhile the Blaque album went platinum, their second album Blaque Out was set for release in 2001, but they were dropped from Columbia Records. Their video for the first \"Blaque Out\" single; \"Can't Get It Back\" was never released. The album was soon leaked on the Internet. When their mentor Lisa Lopes died in a car crash on April 25, 2002 in Honduras they signed with Elektra Records and began work on their 3rd album. An alternate version of the shelved album was released to iTunes on May 22, 2007.\n\nTheir third album Torch featured a number of A-list music industry figures including Missy Elliott, songwriter Linda Perry, and producer Rodney Jerkins. The buzz single was \"No Ganksta\" which was an answerback song to 50 Cent's song \"Wanksta\". Missy Elliott produced the intended first single \"Ugly\". However, because radio did not pick up the song, it was decided to release \"I'm Good\" instead. \"I'm Good\" also appeared on the soundtrack for the film Honey.\n\nDue to the poor success \"I'm Good\" achieved, the release date for Torch was pushed back. Finally, news came up their next single would be \"Hopeless\" - a man bashing, Darkchild produced song. But it failed to be released. In 2004, Natina left the group to go into ministry. She was soon replaced by singer/rapper Erica Pullins who performed with them overseas although no one really knows where she came from. They recorded some new songs and re-recorded old ones with new member, but the album failed to be released and Blaque disbanded.\n\nTheir 2003 contribution to the soundtrack of Honey, \"I'm Good\", charted on the Rhythmic Top 40.The single also made the Australian Top 40 in March 2004 and charted in Germany and Switzerland. The song was also intended for a UK release. The song gained fair airplay and the video gained good rotation being played on major music channels. However, the record company decided to axe the UK release. It has been confirmed by Natina that Torch is to be released to iTunes on 12/04/07.\n\nNatina went into ministry in early 2004. She has a son named Tren with rapper Kurupt.\n\nShamari was signed to Darkchild Records in 2005. Brandi managed to get a record deal and started working on a solo album. She also appeared on Nelly's first single, from his 2005 album \"Sweatsuit,\" \"Grillz\". Grillz features Nelly, Paul Wall, Ali & Gipp and, of course, Brandi Williams although she is not credited, promo wise. There is no information regarding Erica.\n\nIn 2004 Shamari Fears, Brandi Williams & Erica Pullins reformed Blaque. They performed on several occasions in Germany and other countries. During this time, Erica kept fans up to date via the internet. She stated she is currently working on a solo record.\n\nTheir next studio album: Beauty, is set in 2007 through their deal with Family Over Everything Entertainment and Geffen Records. Recently a new song titled \"Blue Jeans\" has surfaced on the internet which is taken from the upcoming Beauty album.\n\nIn addition to their recording work, Reed, Fears, and Williams appeared in the 2000 film Bring It On as members of the East Compton Clovers, the African-American cheerleading squad fronted by Gabrielle Union. Williams also had a small role (playing herself) in the 2001 movie On the Line. Blaque also appears on Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes's 2001 solo debut album, \"Supernova\", on the track titled \"Head to the Sky\", which was only released internationally.

By the age of one, Skanks was brought to Crown Heights, Brooklyn where he was raised. It was during these years that Skanks began to have a passion for the music business. His big brother Goldz was a local DJ and up and coming producer. When Skanks was growing up, he came across artists such as Das Efx, DJ Klark Kent, Mos Def, Talib Kweli and many more working right out of his basement in a studio his brother built, but at the age of 11, no one was willing to give a young Skanks a chance. Then one day while getting kicked out of the studio as usual, young Skanks dropped his rhyme book and when the older guys read what he wrote, they were more than impressed. The next thing you know, young MC Row, which was Skanks first rap name, was the main artist working out of the studio. It was during this time that Skanks caught the attention of hip hop legend MC Lyte who was starting her Duke Da Moon management at the time with her partners Lin-Q and Makeeba, saw the young artist as a good move for the up and coming company. Skanks started opening up for MC Lyte all over the U.S under the name Problem Child, a name he was given by Flipmode squad\u2019s Rampage after he saw him perform live in N.Y.C at age 13. Due to Lyte being a superstar, she was too busy to put her star power behind Skanks and the other artists on the roster. The company split up eventually forcing Skanks to go the indie route starting LaCosa Nostrand and Anarchy Records. It was during this time that Skanks got a call from Klark Kent to come up to a studio so he could see how much the Problem Child grew, but he had a session with Columbia Records artist at the time 50 Cent. Skanks and 50 had a little lyrical sparring session that ended with 50 telling him he was nice. If that was not enough to be confident about, Busta Rhymes met Skanks and his LCN co founder Elgee after listening to their CD and said he was a fan of the penmanship. Skanks received regular airplay on New York radio station Hot 97 thanks to morning show hosts Star and Buck Wild. Skanks has released mix CDs including \u201cBack From The Future\u201d, featuring the hit single King Of The Streets feat. reggae superstar Anthony B., \u201cThe Flowfessional\u201d, \u201cThe Flowfessional 2\u201d, \u201cMartyr Mattic\u201d, and \u201cRest In Peace To The Beats\u201d.

He was more interested in rhythm and blues music--Stax records releases and Aretha Franklin, especially--until he heard a recording by Julius Hemphill.\n\nHemphill was known for his integration of soul music and funk with free jazz. Berne moved to New York City in 1974. There Berne took lessons from Hemphill, and later recorded with him.\n\nIn 1979, Berne founded Empire Records to release his own recordings. He recorded two albums for Columbia Records, which generated some discussion and controversy, due in part to the fact that Berne's music had little in common with the neo-tradionalist hard bop performers prominent in the mid-1980s. Some regarded Berne's music as uncommercial. In the late 1990s Berne founded Screwgun Records, which has released his own recordings, as well as others' music.\n\nBeyond his recordings as a bandleader, Berne has recorded and/or performed with guitarist Bill Frisell, avant-garde composer/sax player John Zorn, violinist Mat Maneri, trumpet player Herb Robertson and as a member of the cooperative trio Miniature (group).\n\nRecent years have found Berne performing in several different groups with drummer Tom Rainey, keyboardist Craig Taborn, bassists Michael Formanek and Drew Gress, guitarists Marc Ducret and David Torn, and reeds player Chris Speed.\n\nBerne's complex, multi-section compositions are often quite lengthy; twenty to thirty minute pieces are not unusual. One critic has written that Berne's long songs \"don't grow tiresome. The musicians are brilliantly creative and experienced enough not to get lost in all the room provided by these large time frames.\" [1]\n[edit]\n\nDiscography\n\n* 1979 The Five Year Plan\n* 1980 7X\n* 1981 Songs and Rituals in Real Time\n* 1983 Ancestors\n* 1983 Mutant Variations\n* 1983 Theoretically\n* 1986 Fulton Street Maul\n* 1988 Sanctified Dreams\n* 1989 Tim Berne's Fractured Fairy Tales\n* 1990 Pace Yourself\n* 1992 Diminutive Mysteries\n* 1993 Nice View\n* 1994 Lowlife\n* 1994 Poisoned Minds\n* 1996 Memory Select\n* 1997 Discretion\n* 1997 Saturation Point\n* 1997 Visitation Rites\n* 1997 I Think They Liked It Honey\n* 1998 Please Advise\n* 1998 Visitation Rites\n* 1998 Ornery People\n* 1998 Cause & Reflect\n* 2001 The Shell Game\n* 2001 Open, Coma\n* 2002 The Sevens\n* 2002 Science Friction\n* 2003 The Sublime And\n* 2004 Souls.Savedhear\n* 2004 Acoustic and Electric Hard Cell Live\n* 2005 Feign\n* 2005 Pre-Emptive Denial", "otherInfo": "\u2022\u2022\u2022"}, {"Address": "1258 Myrtle Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11221", "Artist": "Estrellas de la Kumbia", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.927075, 40.697783], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Christopher's Palace", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "518 Arnold Ave, Point Pleasant Beach, NJ 08742", "Artist": "Joe Sib", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8097586.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.049061, 40.091719], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Uncle Vinnie's Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "Joe Sib is a dad, husband, co-founder of SideOneDummy Records and parenting podcast Rad Parenting.

Indeed, since he debuted almost two and a half years ago on New York City hip hop station WWPR Power 105.1 FM, Norie\u2019s Sunday night show \u201cAnything Goes-Caribbean Edition\u201d, a vigorous blend of soca, reggaeton, roots reggae and dancehall, accented with a distinctive Brooklyn flavor, consistently tops the ratings for the 8-10 PM time slot according to Arbitron statistics.\nRespectfully referred to as Da Reggae Don, DJ Norie was born to Panamanian parents in Brooklyn, which is often referred to a Jamaica\u2019s 15th parish, due to its concentration of immigrants from reggae\u2019s birthplace. Raised in Brooklyn\u2019s East Flatbush area, Norie became familiar with the music of Shabba Ranks, Super Cat and Ninja Man (dancehall reggae superstars of the late 1980s and early \u201890s) by listening to coveted sound clash cassettes that furthered the popularity of the latest reggae hits and the renown of the era\u2019s premier Jamaican sound systems. \u201cListening to the cassettes of Stone Love, Kilimanjaro and other sounds I thought, I want to be a part of that,\u201d Norie recalled.\nBarely into his teens, Norie began working with a neighborhood sound doing odd jobs such as carrying speakers and other equipment to their various gigs around Brooklyn. He paid close attention to the deejays (or selectors in Jamaican parlance) observing their proficiency in choosing just the right tunes to elicit roaring responses from the crowd and keep them on the dance floor. When the selectors needed to take a break, Norie got the chance to display his burgeoning skills on the wheels of steel; however, these early career-training sessions took place unbeknownst to Norie\u2019s mother. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will get in trouble for saying this now but my mom used to work nights so I used to sneak out to play at these basement parties, and basically that is how I learned to select,\u201d Norie laughingly discloses. \u201cIt was kind of hard in the beginning; they used to line up four or five records, tell me what to play and when I played them, people used to go crazy. So it used to seem like, yeah, I can do this, even though I was scared as s*#t. But I did it anyway and it was a good experience.\u201d\n\nNorie\u2019s fears subsided with repeated stints at the turntables and eventually he was recruited by Spectrum Disco, working with selectors Redds and Super C; as Spectrum\u2019s popularity spread throughout Brooklyn and the greater New York area during the 1990s, so too did Norie\u2019s renown as an intimidating selector. In the late 1990s Super Claude, the founder of Afrique Sound Station, one of the most venerated sound systems in the New York area, recruited Norie to join the set. Alongside Afrique\u2019s remarkable team of selectors, which included Jagga B, Crazy Richie and Super Twitch, Norie\u2019s talents were taken to a wider audience that spanned many states and several countries. \u201cSometimes you have to make a move, enhance yourself and go for you, and Afrique is where my name really started from, its what took me to the level of traveling with the music,\u201d Norie reflects. \u201cI will never forget Spectrum Disco because that is where I came from but Afrique has been in the business for more than 20 years, they set the trend for \u2018nuff sounds and it is a blessing to have been a part of it.\u201d\nNorie has also played on numerous Brooklyn based pirate and Internet stations that exclusively play reggae and Caribbean music (he even started one of his own, My Radio 94.3 FM), a phenomenon indicative of the vast potential for Caribbean music in the New York area. But Norie\u2019s expertise in selecting dancehall also resonated with a mainstream listenership, as he found out when he joined up with (hip hop) DJ Self as one of six deejays comprising a collective called Da Union, which enabled him to take dancehall into several (Manhattan) clubs where it had previously been excluded. This led to a few guest appearances on Power 105.1 FM, and eventually his Sunday night show on the station, which has contributed to his enviable status as America\u2019s most influential radio personality for dancehall reggae. As such, Norie is usually the first to transform a core dancehall anthem into an international hit, which he recently did with Stephen and Damian Marley\u2019s single \u201cJah Army\u201d, featuring Buju Banton.\nNorie is also the personal deejay for Beenie Man, with whom he travels whenever the artist has a show outside of Jamaica and he has also toured with Elephant Man, Bounty Killer, Mavado and Serani. On March 30, 2011 at New York City\u2019s BB King\u2019s nightclub, Norie made history selecting the rhythms for seven time Grammy winner Stephen Marley\u2019s first performance done solely to backing tracks (that is, without his band\u2019s accompaniment); Marley headlined Norie\u2019s two year anniversary party for his Power 105 show, which was also the one year anniversary celebration for his immensely popular monthly live concert series, \u201cAnything Goes\u201d. \u201cStephen was a little hesitant at first, because he never performed to tracks before, but he did it and he was happy about it, so it is a great experience to have under my belt,\u201d Norie shares.\nNorie has recently partnered on several projects with Queens New York based VP Records, the largest independent reggae label in the world. He selects the music at each of VP\u2019s album release parties and the label\u2019s artists are regularly showcased at his \u201cAnything Goes\u201d series. For VP Records\u2019 \u201cReggae Gold 2011\u201d, a collection of the year\u2019s biggest reggae hits, Da Reggae Don provided a vibrant, 35-minute bonus mix CD, rife with artists\u2019 shout-outs to Norie (including 2011 Celebrity Apprentice winner/country superstar John Rich) and customized renditions of popular songs. Additionally, Norie has just started recording artists on his own dancehall rhythms and he plans to release those tracks as part of his own compilation series sometime in the near future.\nEach of Norie\u2019s endeavors is in pursuit of his ultimate goal: expanding the overall popularity of Caribbean music, especially dancehall reggae, the music that inspired his career path almost 20 years ago. \u201cMy radio show has served a lot of purposes; not only did it allow my fans to get to know me but it allowed me to give back to this music game,\u201d Norie explains. \u201cBut I would like to get further in radio, be more than just a deejay because then I can help reggae by impressing upon program directors that New York\u2019s Caribbean population is really an untapped market that no one is paying attention to so why not go out and support it? We don\u2019t have to follow the same trends that everyone has been doing for years and years, we can do things differently, add on and make it much stronger.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1258 Myrtle Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11221", "Artist": "DJ NEGRITO", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.927075, 40.697783], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Christopher's Palace", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "167 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Tyler West", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.988702, 40.72133], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Slipper Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Slide on into this sexy, freewheeling romp and still be home in time to get your beauty sleep."}, {"Address": "116 E 27th St, New York, NY 10016", "Artist": "Dafnis Prieto / Dafnison Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8564235.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983746, 40.742276], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: Afro-Cuban, Jazz, Latin Jazz", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Jazz Standard", "moreBioInfo": "From Santa Clara, Cuba, Dafnis Prieto\u2019s revolutionary drumming techniques and compositions have had a powerful impact on the Latin and Jazz music scene, nationally and internationally.\n\nVarious honors include a 2011 MacArthur Fellowship, Up & Coming Musician of the Year from the Jazz Journalists Association in 2006, a 2018 GRAMMY Award and Latin GRAMMY nomination for Best Latin Jazz Album for Dafnis Prieto Big Band 'Back to the Sunset', a GRAMMY nomination for Best Latin Jazz Album for 'Absolute Quintet' in 2006, and a Latin GRAMMY nomination for Best New Artist in 2007.

Akiko is here to stay.\u201d\n\nRaised in Osaka, Japan, this talented musician began studying the organ at the age of three, at the famed Yamaha Music School. After discovering her passion for jazz very early on in her musical journey, Akiko launched her career immediately after graduating from the Osaka College of Music.\nWhile living and playing in Osaka, she had many opportunities to perform with world- renowned jazz musicians from the United States. Meeting Grady Tate, in particular, was a life-changing event for Akiko. He took a great interest in her after hearing her play, and ultimately convinced her that to fully pursue her career in jazz she must make the move to the United States. He further showed his belief in her talent by performing on her debut album in Japan, Harlem Dreams.\n\nAfter landing in the mecca for jazz, New York City, it didn\u2019t take long for Akiko to make her mark - she was soon embraced not only by audiences, but by her fellow musicians, as one of the top organ players in the city. It was during these early years that she had the great honor of playing several gigs with jazz greats Frank Wess and Jimmy Cobb.\nBut it was the meeting of organ legend Dr. Lonnie Smith that proved to have the greatest impact on Akiko\u2019s musical development and career. He became an important mentor to Akiko, and she considers him her greatest influence. She flourished and continued to be a constant draw on the NY jazz scene. Her extraordinary musicianship and captivating stage presence ultimately drew Lou Donaldson\u2019s attention, when he chose her in 2006 as his quartet\u2019s organist.\n\nAkiko has ten albums as a leader to her credit. Her debut album in the U.S., \u201cSweet and Funky\u201d ,was selected as a \u201cBest album of 2007\u201d in DOWNBEAT Magazine. Akiko has been a regular in the DOWNBEAT polls since 2008 - culminating this year with the 65th Annual Critics Poll, coming in at #2 in the \u201cRising Star - Organ\u201d category. Hot House Magazine has just named her 'Best Organ\" in the 2017 Readers Poll. Her albums have constantly placed in the top ten on the National Radio Jazz Chart.\nAkiko\u2019s most recent recording, \u201cSo Cute, So Bad\u201d is a live record date, recorded at the Alvas Showroom in Los Angeles, and features Jeff Hamilton (Drums) and Graham Dechter (Guitar). This album was released in both the U.S. and in Japan in May 2017.\n\nJust take a listen to this dynamic performer, and I\u2019m sure you will agree with the legendary Dr. Lonnie Smith - \u201cAkiko is here to stay!\u201d\n\nAkiko Tsuruga website: www.akikojazz.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "453 W 17th St, New York, NY 10011", "Artist": "CHACHI", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7258859.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00614, 40.743883], "Date": "Sun Mar 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-08", "Genre": "Genres: House", "Time": "11:00 PM", "Venue": "1 Oak", "moreBioInfo": "Chachi is a celebrated New York based DJ who tours internationally.

Artists such as St Vincent, Joanna Newsom, The National's Dessner brothers, Laura Mvula, Matt Bellamy of Muse, Agnes Obel, James Blake, Susanne Sundfor, Jeff Buckley and Julia Holter all managed that transition seamlessly: they stepped across to the \"other side\", as it were, and established storied reputations in their adopted field. Crucially, in doing so, they kept, too, a firm grip on the musical touchstones that first led them to devote their lives to creativity.\n\nTo that illustrious list can now be added a new name. Of Belgian, Egyptian and Lebanese heritage, the 21-year-old musician Tamino's British debut single is a song of such startling, visceral, sit-up-and-listen power, it is as if the singer has arrived, out of nowhere, fully formed. Habibi (Arabic for \"my love\" or \"beloved\") is one of those songs that makes a mockery of questions of era and genre. Aptly, from a musician whose upbringing and trans-nationality elude narrow questions of provenance and pigeonholes, it is at once ancient and modern, conjuring, in its portrayal of a love that is majestic but doomed, the romantic decadence of Lawrence Durrell's The Alexandria Quartet and the scorched-earth, ripped-from-the-heart poetry of Nick Cave. Musically, it is, like so much pop today, all over the place, uncategorisable, gloriously impervious to considerations of style, fashion and commerce. In that sense, it is totally now. At the same time, there is something so other-worldly, so defiantly individualistic, about Tamino's songwriting, his octave-traversing voice and ethereal falsetto that attempting to categorise them, or him, quickly seems futile.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "709 Lorimer St, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "DM Salsberg", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10054553.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.950162, 40.718099], "Date": "Mon Mar 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-09", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Rock, Folk, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "9:30 AM", "Venue": "Pete's Candy Store", "moreBioInfo": "Post-Modern Folk.

Known by those that have seen her perform to be a captivating singer/songwriter with haunting and heart-wrenchingly honest lyrics, her intense passion will cut deep enough to hit a nerve. Performing with an acoustic guitar, her catchy vocal melodies will immediately grab your attention while the intimate stories she tells will keep your ears guessing.\n\nWinner of the 2015 CT Music Awards; Song of the Year for her song \"Slow,\" Canyon. has been touring throughout the Northeast making lasting impressions and connections wherever she goes. After 17 years and several failed projects, her recently released full-length album Half stands as a testament to her struggle and enduring persistence to prove herself as a songwriter.\n\n\u201cHalf is the type of album that even after a myriad of listens doesn\u2019t lose a single ounce of excitement or energy. From the first sensual notes of album opener, \"One Way Road\" to the very last whispers of album closer, \u201cInch\", Canyon. is a downright combustible blend of seductive mysticism and spiritual awareness. She weaves through each tune like someone with way more experiences than her relatively young age has let on, that sort of \u2018old soul\u2019 ethos that the best folk singers possess. She is a troubadour secure in her own skin and her own craft and she picks and croons her way through eleven tracks of elegant, pop-infused, indie folk.\n\nCanyon. has truly constructed the full package on this album \u2013 gorgeous poetry and tremendous songwriting, delivered with aplomb, and given a treatment of lush production. But make no mistake, whether delivered with the full package of bells and whistles or standing on stage to face the crowd alone, Canyon., her voice and her words and her ability to construct a truly memorable song are the flower-filled centerpiece at this dinner table. She\u2019s a songwriter with a potent arsenal of music and the hope here is that we continue to hear more of it in the future.\u201d - Chip McCabe, Lonesome Noise\n\nRaised by her single mother in Northern California, Canyon.'s earliest musical influences can be traced back to the cassettes her mother would play on repeat during long road trips. \"I get my independent and adventurous spirit from my mom. Whenever we would hit the road together she used to make a bed for me in the back of the car. I remember just laying for hours watching the sky change out the back window daydreaming to Cat Stevens and Tracy Chapman the most... but there was Neil Young, Sarah McLaughlin and the Indigo Girls as well...\"\n\nOn September 25, 2002, Canyon. celebrated her 18th birthday by borrowing her mother's acoustic guitar, boarding a plane and officially moving to New York City. It marked the beginning of her journey into music. Several years and several guitars later, her voice has developed into one of strength, wisdom and maturity with songs inspired by the life experiences of a young adult in a big city.\n\nCanyon.'s emergence onto the music scene began with The Break Contest 2010 when she, along with friend and former partner Andrew Maturana, were the only acoustic act to be selected to perform at The Bamboozle Festival 2010, which boasted an estimated attendance of 20,000. Since January 2011, Canyon. has been performing in festivals and venues throughout the Northeast living by her model, \"I will play anywhere and everywhere that will let me...\"\n\nWith her folk roots as undeniable and organic as her namesake- which comes from lyrics in the song \"Thrasher\" by Neil Young. Canyon. is poised to make her mark on the Folk genre by re-defining what modern Folk means and finally letting her voice be heard.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "40 Wooster St 3rd floor, New York, NY 10013", "Artist": "Jack Schneider", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9073889.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00262, 40.722275], "Date": "Mon Mar 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Sofar NYC", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "159 Pioneer Street, Brooklyn, NY 11231", "Artist": "Chris Corsano", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-74.011907, 40.679379], "Date": "Mon Mar 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-09", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Free Jazz", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Pioneer Works", "moreBioInfo": "Capable of solo sets of the most beguiling inventiveness, featuring drums, gamelan-like metallic objects, tiny strings, saxophone mouthpieces and whatever else he has at hand.

His early professional experience, in the 40\u2019s, found him touring with bands like Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory and Lionel Hampton.\n\nEventually he settled in New York where he played and recorded with the leading musicians of the 1950\u2019s\u2013 Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Art Tatum and Duke Ellington himself. One of the few bassists to do so, Mingus quickly developed as a leader of musicians. He was also an accomplished pianist who could have made a career playing that instrument. By the mid-50\u2019s he had formed his own publishing and recording companies to protect and document his growing repertoire of original music. He also founded the \u201cJazz Workshop,\u201d a group which enabled young composers to have their new works performed in concert and on recordings.\n\nMingus soon found himself at the forefront of the avant-garde. His recordings bear witness to the extraordinarily creative body of work that followed. They include: Pithecanthropus Erectus, The Clown, Tijuana Moods, Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Ah Um, The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, Cumbia and Jazz Fusion, Let My Children Hear Music. He recorded over a hundred albums and wrote over three hundred scores.\nAlthough he wrote his first concert piece, \u201cHalf-Mast Inhibition,\u201d when he was seventeen years old, it was not recorded until twenty years later by a 22-piece orchestra with Gunther Schuller conducting. It was the presentation of \u201cRevelations\u201d which combined jazz and classical idioms, at the 1955 Brandeis Festival of the Creative Arts, that established him as one of the foremost jazz composers of his day.\n\nIn 1971 Mingus was awarded the Slee Chair of Music and spent a semester teaching composition at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In the same year his autobiography, Beneath the Underdog, was published by Knopf. In 1972 it appeared in a Bantam paperback and was reissued after his death, in 1980, by Viking/Penguin and again by Pantheon Books, in 1991. In 1972 he also re-signed with Columbia Records. His music was performed frequently by ballet companies, and Alvin Ailey choreographed an hour program called \u201cThe Mingus Dances\u201d during a 1972 collaboration with the Robert Joffrey Ballet Company.\n\nHe toured extensively throughout Europe, Japan, Canada, South America and the United States until the end of 1977 when he was diagnosed as having a rare nerve disease, Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis. He was confined to a wheelchair, and although he was no longer able to write music on paper or compose at the piano, his last works were sung into a tape recorder.\n\nFrom the 1960\u2019s until his death in 1979 at age 56, Mingus remained in the forefront of American music. When asked to comment on his accomplishments, Mingus said that his abilities as a bassist were the result of hard work but that his talent for composition came from God.\n\nMingus received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Smithsonian Institute, and the Guggenheim Foundation (two grants). He also received an honorary degree from Brandeis and an award from Yale University. At a memorial following Mingus\u2019 death, Steve Schlesinger of the Guggenheim Foundation commented that Mingus was one of the few artists who received two grants and added: \u201cI look forward to the day when we can transcend labels like jazz and acknowledge Charles Mingus as the major American composer that he is.\u201d The New Yorker wrote: \u201cFor sheer melodic and rhythmic and structural originality, his compositions may equal anything written in western music in the twentieth century.\u201d\n\nHe died in Mexico on January 5, 1979, and his wife, Sue Graham Mingus, scattered his ashes in the Ganges River in India. Both New York City and Washington, D.C. honored him posthumously with a \u201cCharles Mingus Day.\u201d\n\nAfter his death, the National Endowment for the Arts provided grants for a Mingus foundation created by Sue Mingus called \u201cLet My Children Hear Music\u201d which catalogued all of Mingus\u2019 works. The microfilms of these works were then given to the Music Division of the New York Public Library where they are currently available for study and scholarship \u2013 a first for jazz. Sue Mingus has founded three working repertory bands called the Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Orchestra, and the Mingus Big Band, which continue to perform his music. Biographies of Charles Mingus include Mingus by Brian Priestley, Mingus/Mingus by Janet Coleman and Al Young, Myself When I Am Real by Gene Santoro, and Tonight at Noon, a memoir by Sue Mingus.\n\nMingus\u2019 masterwork, \u201cEpitaph,\u201d a composition which is more than 4000 measures long and which requires two hours to perform, was discovered during the cataloguing process. With the help of a grant from the Ford Foundation, the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by Gunther Schuller, in a concert produced by Sue Mingus at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989, ten years after Mingus\u2019 death.\n\nThe New Yorker wrote that \u201cEpitaph\u201d represents the first advance in jazz composition since Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cBlack, Brown, and Beige,\u201d which was written in 1943. The New York Times said it ranked with the \u201cmost memorable jazz events of the decade.\u201d Convinced that it would never be performed in his lifetime, Mingus called his work \u201cEpitaph,\u201d declaring that he wrote it \u201cfor my tombstone.\u201d\n\nThe Library of Congress purchased the Charles Mingus Collection, a major acquisition, in 1993; this included autographed manuscripts, photographs, literary manuscripts, correspondence, and tape recordings of interviews, broadcasts, recording sessions, and Mingus composing at the piano.\n\nSue Mingus has published a number of educational books through Hal Leonard Publishing, including Charles Mingus: More Than a Fake Book, Charles Mingus: More Than a Play-Along, Charles Mingus: Easy Piano Solos, many big band charts\u2014 including the Simply Mingus set of big band music charts\u2013 and a Mingus guitar book.\n\nReprinted in part from More than a Fake Book \u00a9 1991 Jazz Workshop, Inc.\n\nLinks to Additional Biographical and Historical Information on the Web\n\nLibrary of Congress\nAn index to the holdings of the Charles Mingus Collection, Music Division of the Library of Congress.\nhttp://www.loc.gov/performingarts/encyclopedia/collections/mingus.html", "otherInfo": "Charlie Mingus is a short, hulking, brooding man who for years has been recognized as the greatest jazz virtuoso ever to thump a bass fiddle.

The band started when Keith and Bernstein decided to get together over some beers and jam to some classic garage rock. After putting together a few songs that would later become the bands first EP entitled Don't You Know?, they brought in vocalist Xandra to sit in on a session. Her theatrical style and soaring vocals immediately gave the songs their identity and she joined the band fulltime, inspiring the name and the logo of the band Just Fabulous.\n\nThen, in a chance encounter at an East Village dive bar, they met Anna who joined the band to play bass. With the quartet now in place, they began playing at New York venues such as The Delancy, Pianos, The Deep End, Cobra Club, The Gutter, Our Wicked Lady, C'mon Everybody and The Bitter End. After several great shows, Just Fabulous recorded their first 4 song EP at Thunderdome Studio with Duane Lauginiger and mastered by Ryan Schwabe, entitled Don't You Know?\n\nShortly after, Anna moved from New York so the band asked Alanna to join up and play bass. Her high energy and Memphis blues musical background was a perfect fit for the band, picking up where they left off. With several new songs added to their repertoire Just Fabulous is doing what they love most, playing live shows while also planning to record an upcoming new single and B side as well as a full length LP at the end of the year.

Suburban boredom, broken families, substance abuse, limited opportunity \u2013 this is an environment in which authentic, compelling creativity can thrive, if it\u2019s accompanied by a burning desire, unstoppable drive, and complete lack of any backup plan. There have always been powerful voices that rise above the din of mediocrity and monotony. The voice of From Ashes to New founder and frontman Matt Brandyberry is one of those that is forcing itself to be heard.\n\nMatt\u2019s lifelong interest in music progressed along a wide-ranging path: he was ardent hip-hop fan who wrote rhymes while in junior high, then learned piano and guitar. He pursued music with a passion, ignoring warnings from naysayers around him who shook their fingers in disapproval, asserting that he was doomed to fail and would never amount to anything.\nHis early musical efforts were straight-up rap, and he couldn\u2019t get anything happening with it. \"People would say, 'You aren\u2019t a rapper. You are white. Just quit. Just get a real job.\u2019 And I eventually thought I would be that regular 9 to 5 guy.\"\n\nTo make matters worse, Matt was making bad choices. \"Most of what I have done has been a failure,\" he admits with an unsettling candor. \"Things I fell into. Things I believed. I was pretty damn good at baseball, but I made bad choices. I ruined it. I fell into a bad crowd, getting in trouble, and partying too much. I was doing things I shouldn't have been doing instead of following what could have been a career choice.\"\n\nMatt found a steady job as a cable TV installer, and had to relegate writing and performing to his off hours and weekends. Rap gave way to joining local rock bands, but his creative contributions ended up being frustratingly limited.\n\nHe was making good money doing the 9 to 5, but he didn\u2019t have an outlet for the powerful music he was starting to hear in his head, and the voices of people who discouraged him grew louder and almost caused Matt to lose his focus.\n\nThis roadblock seemed insurmountable. Matt realized that he himself possessed the power to overcome the negativity and spitefulness he felt around him. Confidence was something that was totally under his control. An internal voice told him to press forward with his own creativity.\n\nBy pushing past the negativity with From Ashes to New, a rock band with a point of view, Matt found his voice, performing powerful songs that speak of redemption, liberation, and personal salvation.\n\nMatt used money from a workers compensation settlement to begin the FATN journey. At the time, it seemed like yet another questionable choice. Investing his life savings into what amounted to an underground studio-only project, Matt did so in order to generate the quality recordings which eventually got the band some attention.\n\nNegativity threatened to derail From Ashes To New\u2019s dreams once again when several band members jumped ship after the band signed to Better Noise Records. But this became another opportunity, as the band evolved a tighter unit, most recently adding guitarist Lance Dowdle, formerly of hard rock band Emphatic, who adds his own passion and energy. \u201cThe current lineup reflects the true spirit of the band,\u201d Matt says, \u201cand we can\u2019t wait to play for fans all over the world\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough It All,\u201d the band\u2019s breakthrough first single, has launched their sound onto the radio and created multiple touring opportunities. Matt recounts, \u201cThere's always someone involved in our lives that in the end seems to change us. A friend, a family member, a significant other, sometimes we're left to wonder if it was for better or for worse. Often times we don't know what we have until it is gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cLost And Alone is a song about feeling lost and hopeless in today\u2019s society. No matter how many times it feels like we have something to hold onto, that something always seems to find a way to escape us. It paints the picture of the bitter reality that we have to take matters into our own hands and not rely on the world to save us,\u201d Matt explains.\n\nUltimately, From Ashes to New\u2019s message is true to life, raw, and genuine. Their music is a testament to positive inspiration for the people of the world that they, too, can take risks and not settle into an expected life of mediocrity.\n\n\"We are only regular if we make ourselves regular. We are what we tell ourselves we are,\" Matt says. \"Some of our fans tell us they feel things are hopeless and I tell them, 'You have to believe in yourself before anyone else can.'\"\nFormed barely two years ago by vocalist, programmer and creative mastermind Matt Brandyberry, the sextet consists of the cream of Lancaster\u2019s underground scene. \u201cWe have all played with each other in old bands and other projects,\u201d explains Brandyberry. \u201cAnd when those things stalled or fell apart, the guys who wanted to take things a little more seriously began to gravitate toward FATN. It all came together incredibly organically and we clicked almost instantaneously. It was a real \u2018Aha!\u2019 moment, like this was the band we should have been in all along.\u201d\n\nFor Brandyberry in particular, FATN represents a creative endeavor a long time in the making. As a young kid obsessed by world-changing flows of Tupac and Biggie as well as the local Philadelphia Hip Hop scene that surrounded him, writing rhymes became a natural pastime. \u201cIt was until my late teens that my interest in hard rock music properly developed,\u201d explains the frontman \u201cslowly but surely I got into things like Sevendust and it all snowballed from there.\u201d\n\nBefore long, Brandyberry was obsessively playing guitar and piano and, most importantly, penning his own music to go with the raps he had been developing since junior high. \u201cI decided I was going to put everything I had inside of me into doing music, it became everything to me. I was like a sponge - I wanted to learn every technique, every skill so that I had what I needed to out the ideas that I had in my head on paper and eventually turn them into records.\u201d\n\nAnd turn those ideas into records is exactly what he did. With the assistance of producer Grant McFarland, FATN set about molding their rap/rock hybrid into a sky-scrapingly monolithic proposition.\n\n\u201cWe always wanted our songs to sound huge,\u201d admits co-vocalist and melodic linchpin Chris Musser. \u201cOur ambition is to throw as much as we can into them and give the listener the most connecting experience possible. We vent a lot of emotion, a lot of frustrations, a lot of angst through our songs, but we always want them to have a craft to them - something which shines through.\u201d\n\nAnd if recent four-track EP Downfall was a glistening opening gambit, then the forthcoming full-length album will radiate with the fire of a thousand suns. A fearsome mix of contemporary metalcore crunch and soul-searching rap, the band are already punching with a heavyweight strength that belies their so far brief career. It\u2019s a potent approach galvanized further by the background from which the band all come from.\n\n\u201cWhen we were recording the album, we were all holding down full time jobs,\u201d explains Musser. \u201cI work fixing up body panels for airplanes. I\u2019d start work at 6, finish at 4 then go straight to the studio to work until 2 in the morning. That has been my life for the past year and the discontentment of working in a dead-end job has filtered through onto this album massively. We go through the same things that everyone else who has to wake up in the morning and go do something they hate.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put it bluntly, there\u2019s a lot of \u2018Fuck you\u2019 on this album,\u201d laughs Brandyberry. \u201cA lot of stuff about shitty relationships, about working hard for something and people telling you can\u2019t do it, about never accepting that things are just \u2018beyond you\u2019. We\u2019re not the cool band from LA or New York or any of those places, we\u2019re six regular guys from a regular place but that is in our favor, not against us. We understand what it\u2019s like.\u201d\n\nYet with major tours with the likes of Hollywood Undead under their belts,and a record deal that puts them among some of the best known commercial rock bands already signed, FATN look set to take their message to a bigger stage than they could ever previously have imagined.\n\nBlessed with honesty, integrity, grit, determination and, most vitally, a genuinely devastating arsenal of gut-mangling tunes \u2013 FROM ASHES TO NEW have got all the ingredients to turn your world, and the entire scene, on its head.", "otherInfo": "VIP and Tickets on sale 12/6"}, {"Address": "44 W 44th St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Ted Chubb", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8557608.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.982228, 40.75564], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Royalton New York", "moreBioInfo": "Ted Chubb began his career performing in his native Ohio with mid-west legends, B3 organist Bobby Floyd and saxophonist Gene Walker.

Their double-platinum single \u201cMonster\u201d is \u201cthe eighth most-streamed rock song of 2015\u201d with a total of 57 million plays (and counting) on Spotify and would earn the distinction of becoming \u201cthe best-selling digital single in the history of Christian Music.\u201d 2013\u2019s Rise bowed at #4 on the Billboard Top 200 upon release and received resounding and eclectic acclaim from the likes of USA Today, New York Times, Revolver Loudwire, and more.\n\nThe group\u2019s ninth full-length album, UNLEASHED [Atlantic Records/Word], sees them turn everything up louder, amplifying all aspects of their signature hypnotic sound. Channeling an intense muse, John immediately commenced writing just months after Rise hit shelves.\n\u201cBy the time Rise came out, I could take a little bit of a breather and experience it,\u201d he explains. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018this feels important to me, but I need something a little more urgent.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want whatever we did next to be so emotionally heavy. I wanted to make a record that made people feel the music \u2013 an album that would connect people to the music as well as to each other. An album, like some of my favorites, that\u2019d be like a party to listen to \u2013 where people could sing along - together.\nThat idea solidified as Skillet toured Europe in 2013 with Nickelback. Night after night, John watched the non-English speaking audience sing every word back to him. It left an indelible mark on his writing process.\n\n\u201cIt struck me, how music is much bigger than a language,\u201d he affirms. \u201cThere\u2019s a universal feeling. We wanted to get that emotion across more through the music than with the words. I aimed to write songs people could easily relate to anywhere and everywhere.\u201d\nGetting off the road in 2015, John headed to Los Angeles to begin recording what would become UNLEASHED with producer Brian Howes\u2014who helmed the 2006 platinum-selling Comatose and co-wrote the platinum No. 1 smash \u201cAwake and Alive.\u201d Cutting half of the album with Brian, John tapped the talents of multiple producers for the first time in Skillet history, working with both GRAMMY Award winning producer Seth Mosley in Nashville and Kevin Churko [Five Finger Death Punch, Ozzy Osbourne, Disturbed] in Las Vegas.\n\u201cComatose was a very special album for a lot of reasons,\u201d he continues. \u201cWe wanted to record with Brian again and when the chance came up we were both ready to go. I\u2019m also a huge fan of Kevin Churko, and it was amazing to have the opportunity to write with him. When I met Seth we just clicked. The entire process with each of them was such a great experience.\u201d\n\nThe first single \u201cFeel Invincible\u201d explodes to life on a swinging guitar chug transitioning to sweeping electronics and a theatrical vocal call-and-response. Everything culminates on a towering chant that\u2019s impossible to shake just as a melodic guitar lead takes off.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fight song,\u201d says John. \u201cSometimes, everything in the world makes you want to give up. This is a reminder not to. I think, \u2018This is my life. This is my family. I can\u2019t go around being scared all the time.\u2019 I have the strength to face what\u2019s happening.\u201d\nOn the other end of the spectrum, \u201cStars\u201d shines with a passionate and poetic refrain, \u201cHere I am, lifting up my heart to the one who holds the stars.\u201d Amidst the shimmering electronics and orchestration, it carries a message that John hopes will be easy to understand.\n\n\u201cIt goes along with wanting to speak to as many people as possible,\u201d he continues. \u201cOn a deeper spiritual level, for those who may not believe, it\u2019s saying that there\u2019s something bigger out there\u2014whether it\u2019s your community, family, or friends. Basically that we\u2019re not, and don\u2019t have to be alone.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s the snapping crunch of \u201cBurn it Down\u201d or the skittering crash and burn on \u201cOut of Hell,\u201d the record exudes a propulsive energy that can speak to both sides of the band\u2019s audience, whether they\u2019re sharing a bill with Disturbed or Lecrae.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing journey,\u201d John leaves off. \u201cThe fans, the Panheads, means everything to us. They\u2019re the reason we\u2019re here. They make our shows what they are. We wanted to give that energy back to them in UNLEASHED.\u201d\nUltimately, this is Skillet at their most potent, pure, and powerful.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "95 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Bad Kitty", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.988383, 40.721329], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Arlene's Grocery", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Violent In Black, Winterwolf, Bad Kitty, Talk Shivi, KENLO at Arlene's Grocery NYC"}, {"Address": "217 E Houston St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Baba Ali", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.986751, 40.722165], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Mercury Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Baba Ali"}, {"Address": "1285 6th Ave, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "Nick Cabrera", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9156247.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.97996, 40.760926], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, Latin, R&B, soul, Rock", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Mastro's Steakhouse", "moreBioInfo": "Hi I'm Nick.

Kurth) is a German rapper from Minden. The name \"Curse\" is inspired by the English pronunciation of his family name.\n\n2) Curse is also the name of a Black Metal band from Iceland, formed in 1995. Their lyrical themes are Nordic mythology and mysticism. They released 2 demos and 3 full-length albums.\n\n\n1) German rapper.\nBiography\nCurse has had a long musical past. In his youth, he played songs like \"Zwei Mal In Den Kopf\" in his former band Phat Kicks. In the 90ies, his band had gigs in the area of Stadthagen.\n\nOn his first album Feuerwasser (released in 2000), his lyrics have already been self-reflected and they have handled with things that had happened in his life, but also contained classical hip hop tracks such as representing- and battle-tracks. He especially raps about abortive relationships and admits mistakes to himself. For that reason, he is a kind of an outsider in the hip hop scene. The beats on Feuerwasser and many other releases are often produced by Sascha B\u00fchren aka Busy.\n\nIn 2001, his next album Von Innen Nach Au\u00dfen (which means something like \"inside outwards\") was released. On this album, Curse continued his style and the lead single \"Lass uns doch Freunde sein\" was distinguishing from current rap clich\u00e9s and thus gaining attention even outside the hip hop scene. The German hip hop magazine Juice rewarded this album with the title \"Best National Album\". This album has even been released in Japan. It reached the German Top-Ten Charts.\n\nOn his third album Innere Sicherheit his style changed in many aspects: While the beats on his previous albums were mainly produced electronically, the beats on this album are produced with a wide range of instruments: From sophisticated instrumentals with classical transverse flutes (Ich Versteh Dich) over the Crossover song \"Schocktherapie\" to the very emotional \"Und Was Ist Jetzt?\", a piano ballad, there is an broad musical array, which emphasizes and accompanies with the deep lyrics. Also an increasing amount of political society-critical texts can be detected, whereas he is not ignoring his 'old' topics. In this frame also the single \"Widerstand\" has originated with the German Reggae-Artist Gentleman.\n\nAlso with the cooperation with upcoming talents he acquired renown. So, for instance, he afforded Italo Reno & Germany as soon as Stress und Trauma the opportunity to present themselves to a general public with guest appearances on his releases and not least by his artist platform Alles Real Records. Over the Years he made many collaborations with various German and international artists, among others with Kool Savas, Xavier Naidoo, Max Herre (Freundeskreis), Samy Deluxe, J-Luv, Braz (4Lyn), Patrice, Black Thought (The Roots), Pete Rock and RZA.\n\nOn December 2, 2005 Curse released his fourth Album Sinnflut. The lead single \"Gangsta Rap\" entered the German charts on position 25. On Sinnflut Curse returns to his roots, as if the experimental album Innere Sicherheit had never existed. With deep and very private songs as \"Kein Weg zur\u00fcck\" or \"Mein Leben\", or the represent tracks like \"Der Fluch\" or \"Broken Language Reloaded\" featuring Samy Deluxe, which is a remake of the classic \"Broken Language\" from Smoothe Da Hustler Feat. Trigger Tha Gambler from 1995, the record has become homogeneous and multifaceted. Curse fulfilled himself a childhood dream with the features with Black Thought (of The Roots) and the producer legend Pete Rock. Latter has been persuaded to sing the hooks and shout outs, which he did for Nas before.\n\nIn 2005, between The Albums \"Innere Sicherheit\" and \"Sinnflut\", Curse did a Project with 3 swiss Rappers/Producers (Greis (PVP), Taz (Tafs), Claude (sektion chuchich\u00e4stli)). What started as a short Vacation together, ended in a full-length Album. The Swiss Rappers Greis and Taz rapped in Swissgerman (Dialect), Curse in German, Claude was Producer.\n\nIn August 2006 Curse released his Best-of Album \"Einblick zur\u00fcck\" - in English maybe \"Impression Back\". This Album covers his greatest hits from 1996 - 2006, ten years of German Hip Hop. The Album is more of a mixtape, the Tracks were mixed by DJ Kool GQ and DJ Kitsune.\n\n2) Black metal band from Iceland.\nDiscography:\n1999 - Dimension of scattered sound and silence (demo)\n2001 - Cursed Be Thy Name\n2001 - Battlefield of the Gods (promo tape)\n2002 - Victory through total domination volume III\n2002 - Dead Sun Rise\n2006 - Slaughter of the Stars\n2007 - In Life & In Death / Verden og Fanden (split with Sykdom)\n\nOfficial site: http://curse.helviti.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "169 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009", "Artist": "Sur Back", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8506759.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.982079, 40.72829], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Baroque Pop, Art Pop, Experimental Pop, Indie Electronic, Electronic, Indie Pop, Art Rock, Experimental, Pop, Indie, Orchestral Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Lola", "moreBioInfo": "Sur Back is the experimental pop brainchild of former Florida ballerina, Caroline Sans.

The release of their debut full-length 2016\u2019s IN YOUR FACE (AGAIN), produced by Megadeth bassist David Ellefson, showed the world what they were all about.\n\nAfter meeting at the Phoenix SCHOOL OF ROCK in 2013, the fledgling band came to the attention of Ellefson, who took them under his wing, and together they began a sonic assault on the West Coast, playing shows with Social Distortion, DRI, and many more, and set out to work on their Ellefson produced debut studio release.\n\nThe band topped off the year with an appearance in AP Magazine\u2019s 2016 list of \u201c7 of the Best Rising Bands Under 21\u201dand will start 2017 off on an equally high note as they to release their sophomore LP \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl\" on EMP LABEL GROUP on June 16th, 2017, along with playing the first week and a half of 2017 VANS WARPED TOUR dates.\n\nwww.facebook.com/dollskinband\nhttp://www.dollskinband.com\n\nContact:\nManagement: David Ellefson - ellefsondavid@aol.com / dollskinmgmt@gmail.com\nBand email: dollskinband@gmail.com\nBooking: alex@arteryglobal.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "316 Old Allerton Rd, Hunterdon County, NJ 08801", "Artist": "Michael Corsini Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9612374.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.87897, 40.636043], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "Genres: Praise Worship", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Immaculate Conception Church", "moreBioInfo": "I am a husband and father.

Entitled \u2018Lost Dispatch,\u2019 the collection\u2019s 11 tracks unfurl like a bootleg performance of a cocktail jazz group where it\u2019s always the organist\u2019s turn to solo, and someone spiked the punch bowl. Sunset psychedelia nestles alongside passages of space age jazz and dusty, analog exotica.\n\n\u201cOver the years as I've discovered library music recordings from the 1950s and \u201860s, I found myself getting lost in low-fi tones of the exoticised tropics, which has inspired the record,\u201d LoCrasto says. \u201cThe sounds are surrealist; a sonic landscape comprised of analog synths, percussion, woodwinds, and field recordings.\u201d\n\n\u201cTravelogue\u201d sets the album\u2019s intention with swooning island melodies, bird song and percussion that shushes like slow-washing waves, soundtracking a hallucinated world of bedroom rainforests where water droplets slip from waxy leaves, fizzing on overheated amplifiers. \u201cSecret Cove\u201d laps along as woodwinds and synths nudge around each other like eddies in a psychedelic stream. The muted piano of \u201cThe Islander\u201d is like the ghost of jazz heard on the leeward breeze of a beach slipping into darkness. Throughout, the record balances serpentine exercises for eyes-closed inner exploration with lush, open-air tropicalia.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote \u201cAmazonia,\u201d I was at my apartment in Borough Park and it started raining,\u201d LoCrasto explains. \u201cIt was one of those really peaceful weekday afternoon summer rains and I just felt compelled to record it. When I listened back I wanted to play along, so I recorded an organ track and \u201cAmazonia\u201d was born. Not all the songs come about that way. A lot of times the inspiration will come from whatever mood I\u2019m in. It might come from looking at old photographs or sheer boredom. The loneliness of creativity and composing manifests itself all over the record.\u201d\n\nSketches for the record began eight years ago in LoCrasto\u2019s former Brooklyn apartment, and many of the tracks were recorded during 2013-2016 while he was living nomadically between Texas and NYC. As the 50-minute suite took shape, LoCrasto called upon Robin MacMillan of Faraway Sound studios to produce and play drums and percussion on the album.\n\n\u201cI initially wanted to make a synth exotica record because I love exotica music and have loved the tropics my whole life,\u201d LoCrasto says. \u201cGrowing up outside of Dallas, I rarely saw the ocean till I moved to New York. As a kid, my family took a few road trips to South Padre Island and Sarasota but that\u2019s it. There\u2019s definitely some nostalgia to those trips that has stuck. Since then, anytime I\u2019d see a palm tree, or hear a steel pan, or smell Hawaiian tropic, it would resonate. It\u2019s an experience I got a taste of and something I\u2019d fantasize about.\u201d\n\nThe Texas-born, Brooklyn-based artist\u2019s fourth record, Lost Dispatch follows When You're There (Maxjazz, 2006), El Dorado (Hundred Pockets, 2011), and LoCrasto (Storytime, 2015). LoCrasto has recorded and toured with Cass McCombs\u2014who once called him \u201cNew York\u2019s finest percussionist\u201d\u2014Pat Martino, James Iha, Parquet Courts, Greg Osby, Okkervil River, and Wallace Roney, and has appeared as a sideman on over 40 albums.\n\nWith Lost Dispatch, LoCrasto has crafted the perfect sand-and-salt-air soundtrack for warm weather journeying, no matter how close the crashing waves. It\u2019s a sonic love letter to the electrified energy of swingin\u2019 synthesizers, and a sunglasses-on, technicolor trip of third-eye tropicalia, dropping just in time for summer.

A few months later, he auditioned and was accepted to the prestigious contemporary conservatory, Berklee College of Music, where he cultivated and practiced the craft of song.\n\nThe Philadelphia-area native writes poignant lyrics and arranges mournful instrumentals that enhance his vocals, a sultry mix of jazz and blues. When you listen to Jared you don\u2019t just hear his voice you feel it. Jared\u2019s singing is accompanied by his piano playing, supported by a rhythm section with additional musicians on strings, horns, and background vocals. His signature songs, with their mournful and moody style, have been coined \u201cmurder ballads,\u201d and have a particular draw: Long after hearing them, they leave a listener with a heart-twisting, soul-crushing ache.\n\nFor Jared, 27, music has always been an inherent force. At age 6, Feinman\u2019s training began with classical piano, which he learned intensely for 10 years. Born and raised in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, the layered sounds of classical composers, such as Frederic Chopin and Claude Debussy, influenced him. It unlocked a new way of looking at music, and ultimately drew him to the slow, groove hums of jazz. Feinman studied jazz piano under the renowned jazz educator, the late Jimmy Amadie, who had worked with Mel Torme. Feinman proclaimed, \u201cI attribute my feel and approach to harmony largely to Jimmy. He was a powerful influence on me as his youngest student when I was only 15.\u201d\n\nSince returning to Pennsylvania in 2017, Jared has concentrated a lot of time on crafting riveting song lyrics that pair perfectly with his absolute pitch. Part of the secret to his growing songbook is a lulling rhythm that rouses the senses and connects to the mind, as heard in his debut release in 2018, \u201cLove Is An Obstacle.\u201d Followed up with his second single \u201cAll My Life,\u201d released in October 2019, Feinman will continue to release more tracks throughout the rest of 2019 and into 2020.\n\nReflecting on his music, Jared said, \u201cI want to make music that cuts to the bone and leaves a listener longing for more.\u201d Jared Feinman (pronounced Fine*min) lives in Villanova and can be contacted at jared@jaredfeinman.com.", "otherInfo": "On Your Radar Hosted by John Platt from WFUV feat.

Whether performing with his own quartet or supporting Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett on tour, Newman\u2019s expert trumpeteering and effervescent stage presence reignited a big band scene in New York City, and has since enticed a new generation of jazz fans across the globe. The Verve Recording artist continues to reign at his weekly residency in New York, as well as appear on television programs and in special performances across the United States and Europe.\nNewman is known for his impeccable horn playing and rendition of romantic favorites. But what sets him apart is his ability to command a room not only with his musical talent, but as a bandleader who makes each person in the audience feel as if they are a part of his performance. His fusion of music playing and easy going banter captures the vivacity of great bandleaders of the past. This exuberance is evident on Newman\u2019s 2016 debut album, Eyes on the City, which pays tribute to his musical journey in New York.\nAlong with his Quartet, fellow musicians from Cincinnati\u2019s College-Conservatory of Music, Newman has allured audiences during his residencies at some of New York\u2019s most iconic venues. His first foray into creating an old school big band night was at the elegant Duane Park for \u201cAfter Dark,\u201d a jazz and burlesque revue on the downtown scene in Tribeca. \u201cAfter Dark\u201d lead to a weekly residency at the legendary Oak Room at The Plaza Hotel, a venue steeped in history which was frequented by the likes of Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli and countless others over its one hundred year history. Newman and his Quartet played each Wednesday to a mixed crowd seeking a slice of history, welcoming Lady Gaga as a surprise guest, until the venue closed in 2011. Currently, Newman performs every Tuesday and Thursday, as bandleader in a residency at Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel, and select Friday nights at NYC\u2019s legendary Rainbow Room with his orchestra. Brian also routinely appears for special live performances with a diverse array of musical acts, which have included Tony Bennett, Jose Feliciano, Stevie Wonder, Mark Murphy, Dierks Bentley, Willie Nile, Molly Ringwald, David Loeb, Steve Wynn\u2019s Orchestra, Ray Benson\u2019s Asleep at the Wheel and Tommy London.\nNewman\u2019s personal style, which meshes classic suits, vintage tattoos and rock-n-roll, has attracted commercial brands such as Jack Daniel\u2019s, Marc Jacobs and Tiffany & Co., who have collaborated with Newman for special events and performances. The Jack Daniel\u2019s partnership in 2012, which launched the brand\u2019s Sinatra Select premium Tennessee Whiskey, brought Newman alongside Frank Sinatra Jr. himself, in a performance in Cannes, France.\nBrian married burlesque star, Angie Pontani of the World Famous Pontani Sisters in February 2013, with whom he most notably performs in connection with Pontani\u2019s New York Burlesque Festival and Burlesque-a-Pades shows.

Throughout his prolific career as part of three of the greatest live groups in rock history \u2013 Allman Brothers Band, Gov\u2019t Mule and the Dead \u2013 his virtuosic artistry has led to thousands of unforgettable performances and millions of album and track sales. Despite all of the ground that Haynes has covered on his musical journey, the impressive thing is that he still has many miles to explore. On his newest solo album Ashes and Dust, he puts forth one of his most gorgeous, musically rich and personal albums to date. It is endlessly exciting to see one of the most brilliant minds in modern music shine an entirely new light on the depths of his creativity.\n\nAshes and Dust, only the third studio album Haynes has ever released under his own name, is a masterful work of art and a particularly important statement for Haynes. The songs are immediately and clearly different from his usual style \u2013 encompassing beautiful acoustic arrangements, a rootsy/Americana soundscape and honeyed vocals that cut straight through to the soul. Although many of these songs are brand new, some of the tunes that make up this album have been dear to Warren for years. In some cases he has been carrying them around for 20 or 30 years, waiting for the right time to record them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing songs all my life from a more folky, singer-songwriter, even Celtic direction,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while, I\u2019ve been compiling songs that didn\u2019t necessarily fit in with Gov\u2019t Mule or the Allman Brothers or even my last solo album. So this record was really a chance to bring a lot of that music to fruition. It\u2019s really given me the opportunity to take a lot of songs I love, that didn\u2019t have a home, and build a home for them.\u201d\n\nGiven his life-long commitment to experimentation and eclecticism, though, it should come as no surprise that the album reveals yet another new side of his musical personality. Knowing that he wanted to pursue a more folk-based approach on this project, he brought in the New Jersey-based Americana band Railroad Earth as collaborators.\n\n\u201cI have a cool chemistry with those guys\u2014they add their own personality to the songs, but they\u2019re really great at interpreting, as well,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other casually for several years, and then at Del-Fest a few years ago, we winged a few songs together and it went really well. A little later, when I was opening the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY, they joined me for part of the set. We did that with a little more rehearsal, more preparation, and it was a great experience. At that point, I started thinking that maybe I should make my next record with these guys.\u201d\n\nEven with a clear sense of his goals for the album, Haynes and Railroad Earth still needed to explore various avenues and possibilities. They recorded more than 30 songs, often trying entirely different arrangements for each take or even recording late at night and not listening to playbacks until they reconvened the next day.\n\nFans of jam-band powerhouse Gov\u2019t Mule or the most recent soul-charged incarnation of the Warren Haynes Band\u2014or listeners who know Haynes through his 25-year affiliation with the Allman Brothers Band or his work with various extensions of the Grateful Dead family\u2014may be surprised to hear him working in a more song-based context. Several of the tracks on Ashes and Dust, like \u201cCompany Man\u201d and \u201cCoal Tattoo,\u201d are links to the folk tradition of narrative writing.\n\n\u201cI love story songs,\u201d Haynes says. \u201cI was very influenced by the whole concept of writing songs that tell a story. When I first got bitten by the singer-songwriter bug, when I was 14, it was due to those people who transported you to another place and another time with their songs\u201d\n\nWhich is not to say that Ashes and Dust leaves his instrumental adventures behind; several songs such as \u201cBlue Maiden\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cStranded in Self-Pity\u201d open out into more extended musical journeys. \u201cIn the studio, you\u2019re always looking for the balance between structure and focus and improvisation, opening up the music to chance\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut too much of either can keep the music from being as rewarding or as effective as it can be. Luckily my audience loves things to be stretched out. They love to hear the performance aspect. It was nice to take a few dirt roads, musically speaking, and go to some places none of us were expecting.\u201d\n\nHaynes shares that this album also brought out some new dimensions for him as a guitarist. \u201cMy playing here is quite different from what I\u2019ve done in recent projects. It\u2019s showcasing a side of my musicality that\u2019s unlike, in some cases, anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says, noting that he played a hollow-body D\u2019Angelico instrument (\u201ckind of a jazz guitar\u201d) for many of the sessions. \u201cI like to adapt to my surroundings\u2014to the music itself and to the musicians, trying to choose a musical voice that fits into the overall picture a certain way. I played a lot more slide guitar than I\u2019ve played in a long time and a lot of acoustic guitar, things that were more directed to weaving themselves into the fabric of this music.\u201d\n\nOne of the songs, \u201cSpots of Time\u201d (the lyrics of which include the phrase that gives the album its title), may be familiar to ardent Haynes-watchers. The song was written by Haynes and Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers have been playing it on stage in recent years.

Some writers spend years searching and never uncover the other half they seek; for others, a partnership just flicks on like a light. The origin story of the hauntingly beautiful duo The Western Den is wonderfully curious in just this way: Deni Hlavinka, an introspective pianist from small town Virginia, posted a song idea on a college forum for accepted students. Chris West, a bright-eyed guitarist from Bermuda, sent back the song the following day in finished form. Upon meeting in person, they discovered their musical\u2014and personal\u2014bond was eerily close; there was never a discussion of forming a band, never a conscious choice, it just happened, fueled by a sheer desire, a necessity to pursue what felt right.\n\nThe act of reaching out in search of a common creative haven\u2014that same force which brought Hlavinka and West together seven years ago\u2014is a theme of \u2018A Light Left On\u2019, their forthcoming debut record. A careful labor of love, it emerged over the course of two years as a set of demos, which the pair then tracked meticulously over a six-month span. This restraint stands in stark contrast to their previous releases, two EPs which they hurried to release with the same speed and enthusiasm of Hlavinka and West\u2019s initial long-distance collaboration. The result of their patience this time around is an ornate emotional garden, lovingly cultivated and ready for company. In their songwriting, arrangements, and production choices, the band leaves behind the folk label, which always felt like a safe descriptor yet never quite like home, pushing out into orchestral, ethereal, and chordally complex territory, while preserving their sweeping vocal harmonies, at once lush and modest, unmistakably the foundation of their partnership.\n\n\u2018A Light Left On\u2019 details a coming-of-age search\u2014for purpose, for an environment that feels authentic. From its inceptive command to \u201craise it up, give a name / call it close, temporary though all the same\u201d, the album announces its creators\u2019 desire to define themselves within a turbulent landscape of thoughts, to have a light left on somewhere that feels permanent. Absent of that flag-planting resolution, the record offers up the belief that a light is still out there\u2014\u2018I\u2019m still holding on, still, still I\u2019m holding on\u2019\u2014as if spoken to themselves as a mantra, on repeat, to reassure and encourage.\n\nThe Western Den showcases a mature pursuit of beauty that is all their own, and yet they capture the emotional soul-searching that exists in all of us, whether we hide it from the world or share it. In Hlavinka and West\u2019s case, they have chosen to share it, extending their trust in each other to their audience.", "otherInfo": "The Western Den with Olivia Barton"}, {"Address": "406 3rd Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Taylor Plas", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8536198.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.989714, 40.67326], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Roots, Blues, Soul, Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Halyards", "moreBioInfo": "Taylor Plas is an Actor and Musician based in New York.

Throughout his prolific career as part of three of the greatest live groups in rock history \u2013 Allman Brothers Band, Gov\u2019t Mule and the Dead \u2013 his virtuosic artistry has led to thousands of unforgettable performances and millions of album and track sales. Despite all of the ground that Haynes has covered on his musical journey, the impressive thing is that he still has many miles to explore. On his newest solo album Ashes and Dust, he puts forth one of his most gorgeous, musically rich and personal albums to date. It is endlessly exciting to see one of the most brilliant minds in modern music shine an entirely new light on the depths of his creativity.\n\nAshes and Dust, only the third studio album Haynes has ever released under his own name, is a masterful work of art and a particularly important statement for Haynes. The songs are immediately and clearly different from his usual style \u2013 encompassing beautiful acoustic arrangements, a rootsy/Americana soundscape and honeyed vocals that cut straight through to the soul. Although many of these songs are brand new, some of the tunes that make up this album have been dear to Warren for years. In some cases he has been carrying them around for 20 or 30 years, waiting for the right time to record them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing songs all my life from a more folky, singer-songwriter, even Celtic direction,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while, I\u2019ve been compiling songs that didn\u2019t necessarily fit in with Gov\u2019t Mule or the Allman Brothers or even my last solo album. So this record was really a chance to bring a lot of that music to fruition. It\u2019s really given me the opportunity to take a lot of songs I love, that didn\u2019t have a home, and build a home for them.\u201d\n\nGiven his life-long commitment to experimentation and eclecticism, though, it should come as no surprise that the album reveals yet another new side of his musical personality. Knowing that he wanted to pursue a more folk-based approach on this project, he brought in the New Jersey-based Americana band Railroad Earth as collaborators.\n\n\u201cI have a cool chemistry with those guys\u2014they add their own personality to the songs, but they\u2019re really great at interpreting, as well,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other casually for several years, and then at Del-Fest a few years ago, we winged a few songs together and it went really well. A little later, when I was opening the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY, they joined me for part of the set. We did that with a little more rehearsal, more preparation, and it was a great experience. At that point, I started thinking that maybe I should make my next record with these guys.\u201d\n\nEven with a clear sense of his goals for the album, Haynes and Railroad Earth still needed to explore various avenues and possibilities. They recorded more than 30 songs, often trying entirely different arrangements for each take or even recording late at night and not listening to playbacks until they reconvened the next day.\n\nFans of jam-band powerhouse Gov\u2019t Mule or the most recent soul-charged incarnation of the Warren Haynes Band\u2014or listeners who know Haynes through his 25-year affiliation with the Allman Brothers Band or his work with various extensions of the Grateful Dead family\u2014may be surprised to hear him working in a more song-based context. Several of the tracks on Ashes and Dust, like \u201cCompany Man\u201d and \u201cCoal Tattoo,\u201d are links to the folk tradition of narrative writing.\n\n\u201cI love story songs,\u201d Haynes says. \u201cI was very influenced by the whole concept of writing songs that tell a story. When I first got bitten by the singer-songwriter bug, when I was 14, it was due to those people who transported you to another place and another time with their songs\u201d\n\nWhich is not to say that Ashes and Dust leaves his instrumental adventures behind; several songs such as \u201cBlue Maiden\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cStranded in Self-Pity\u201d open out into more extended musical journeys. \u201cIn the studio, you\u2019re always looking for the balance between structure and focus and improvisation, opening up the music to chance\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut too much of either can keep the music from being as rewarding or as effective as it can be. Luckily my audience loves things to be stretched out. They love to hear the performance aspect. It was nice to take a few dirt roads, musically speaking, and go to some places none of us were expecting.\u201d\n\nHaynes shares that this album also brought out some new dimensions for him as a guitarist. \u201cMy playing here is quite different from what I\u2019ve done in recent projects. It\u2019s showcasing a side of my musicality that\u2019s unlike, in some cases, anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says, noting that he played a hollow-body D\u2019Angelico instrument (\u201ckind of a jazz guitar\u201d) for many of the sessions. \u201cI like to adapt to my surroundings\u2014to the music itself and to the musicians, trying to choose a musical voice that fits into the overall picture a certain way. I played a lot more slide guitar than I\u2019ve played in a long time and a lot of acoustic guitar, things that were more directed to weaving themselves into the fabric of this music.\u201d\n\nOne of the songs, \u201cSpots of Time\u201d (the lyrics of which include the phrase that gives the album its title), may be familiar to ardent Haynes-watchers. The song was written by Haynes and Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers have been playing it on stage in recent years. He had hoped that the song would be included if the Allmans made another studio album, but after the legendary band retired in 2014, he decided to record it himself\u2014but not before inviting Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and percussionist Marc Quinones to join him in the studio.\n\nOn \u201cGold Dust Woman,\u201d Grace Potter adds her unique vocal timbre. Sparking a fast friendship and instant chemistry several years ago, Haynes and Potter have performed this song together many times on stage and this endeavor seemed like the perfect opportunity to document it in the studio. That chemistry, along with Railroad Earth\u2019s unique instrumental interpretation, plays out here in fine form on the sole duet on the album.\n\nThe presence of these world-class musicians and artists, along with that of Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin and famed harmonica player Mickey Raphael (who each make an appearance here on \u201cWanderlust\u201d) is yet another reason why Ashes and Dust stands as such a personal, ambitious document of Warren Haynes\u2019 history. With songs that reach back to his initial fascination with music and others that go right up to the present day, it\u2019s a look behind his first-rate playing and into his enduring creative spirit.\n\n\u201cThese songs were each very important to me when they were written, especially since some of them go so far back,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all visual memories and experiences of certain time periods that I tried to capture in song.

Scott's horn parts are those of traditional jazz melody, and the solos follow suit in the jazz tradition.\n\nScott has noted Miles Davis, among his many musical influences, as being the greatest of them all.

On his debut solo album, Capsules, Hayfitz debunks the value of time, nurturing brief yet defining experiences into lush songs covered in vocals as delicate as they are determined.\n\nHayfitz has spent his career practicing exercises in ultimate vulnerability, diving deeper into writing to push his emotions further and break down the technicalities of song structure for richer soundscapes. His various shoestring travels throughout the world featuring life in a backpack have offered him merit to otherwise minute gestures from strangers and family alike.\n\nThe foundation of Capsules was recorded over eighteen days in a Seattle home surrounded by idyllic views of the Puget Sound and the region\u2019s mountains and evergreens. The setting brought Hayfitz the emotional space to deliver the record with resolve, bringing intentional details to each song and distilling the franticness of a Brooklyn lifestyle.\n\nCapsules took on its current shape in a secluded winter cabin in Parker, Pennsylvania where friend turned collaborator, Patrick Gregg, hosted Hayfitz for two separate week-long periods.\nEach inspired by contemporaries like Andy Shauf and Chad Vangaalen, Gregg and Hayfitz collaborated to bring a range of woodwinds to the recording process, with Gregg playing everything from bass clarinet to saxophone.

Internationally known for classic standards, late-night ballads, and the cool jazz flavor he brings to his performances and recordings, he has recently established himself as the consummate entertainer and radio program host with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli\" a nationally syndicated radio program co-hosted with his wife, Broadway star Jessica Molaskey.\n\nBorn on April 6, 1960, in Paterson, New Jersey, Pizzarelli has been playing guitar since age six, following in the tradition of his father, guitar legend Bucky Pizzarelli. Hanging out with his father, John was exposed to all the great jazz music of the era, from Erroll Garner and Les Paul to Django Reinhardt. He began playing with his father at age 20, before going out on his own.\n\nJohn Pizzarelli has recorded as a bandleader for RCA, Chesky, Stash and Novus, and in 1997 appeared in the Broadway musical Dream, a revue of Johnny Mercer songs. Along the way, Pizzarelli and his band have earned rave reviews. Reviewers often compare the Pizzarelli Trio to jazz icons such as Nat \"King\" Cole: \"The John Pizzarelli Trio has never been tighter, and Pizzarelli himself has never been looser,\" said The Village Voice of a recent New York show. \"We can say we\u2019re as lucky to listen to [Pizzarelli] as Nat Cole fans were in the years before he became a legend.\"\n\nFor Pizzarelli, the comparison to the Nat \"King\" Cole Trio is the highest of compliments. \"I've always said in my concerts that Nat 'King' Cole is why I do what I do.\" Using greats like Nat \"King\" Cole and Frank Sinatra and the songs of writers like Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen as touchstones, Pizzarelli is among the prime contemporary interpreters of the great American songbook, bringing to the work his signature style and brilliant guitar playing.\n\nWith Telarc\u2019s recent release of Dear Mr. Sinatra, an homage to 'Ol' Blue Eyes,' Pizzarelli's album count now stands at 21, an odyssey that began with My Blue Heaven in 1990. Some of his most recent CDs include, Knowing You (Telarc 2005), Bossa Nova (Telarc 2004), and Live at Birdland (Telarc 2003).\n\n\nA veteran radio personality, Pizzarelli hosted \"New York Tonight\" on WNEW from 1984-1988. Now, with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli,\" he brings warmth, humor and that long-lost \"live\" feel back to radio. The show takes place in their \"deluxe living room,\" where he and his guests play live and recorded music, and enjoy conversation that is relaxed, candid, and off-the-cuff. Recent guests include Regis Philbin, Liza Minnelli, Peter Cincotti, Keely Smith, Steve Tyrell and Tony Danza.\n\nIn addition to being a bandleader, radio personality and solo performer, John has been a special guest on recordings for major pop names such as James Taylor, Natalie Cole, Tom Wopat, Rickie Lee Jones and Dave Von Ronk, as well as leading jazz artists like Rosemary Clooney, Ruby Braff, Johnny Frigo, Buddy DeFranco, Harry Allen and, of course, Bucky Pizzarelli. He was recently featured opposite Donna Summer, Jon Secada and Roberta Flack on the Grammy Award winning CD, Songs From The Neighborhood: The Music of Mr. Rogers.\n\nJohn has performed numerous times on the country's most popular national television shows such as \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" \"The Late Show with David Letterman,\" \"Live With Regis & Kelly,\" \"The Tony Danza Show,\" \"The CBS Early Show,\" Fox News Channel and Jerry Lewis's Labor Day Telethon.\n\nPizzarelli continues to tour throughout the United States, Europe and Japan, performing classic pop, jazz and swing, while setting the standard for stylish modern jazz.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "510 E 11th St,, New York, NY 10009", "Artist": "Cancion Franklin", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9380391.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.981225, 40.728088], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, Americana, Country", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "11th Street Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Everything from Classic Country to Blues Rock.

That premier album was strongly influenced by many 4AD acts, brought into sharp focus by the mixing of This Mortal Coil\u2019s John Fryer (Lush, NIN, Depeche Mode) and featuring artwork by 4ADs legendary designer, V23's Vaughan Oliver (Pixies, Bauhaus), which further enhanced their strong aesthetic connections to that label. The band maintains a distinctive ethos--embracing their idols, while still forging their own sound.\n\nTheir second LP, Beyond Desire, coming October 13th via Papercup Music finds them working with legendary My Bloody Valentine engineer Guy Fixsen (MBV, WIRE) and Jorge Elbreht (Ariel Pink, No Joy, Frankie Rose, Violens, Lansing-Drieden) with artwork from Timothy O\u2019Donnell (another 4AD design alumni) at Mexican Summer's Gary's Electric studio in Greenpoint.\n\nThe new record finds them exploring something much more than bands within their sphere typically strive for - it's introspection leavened with human connectedness and higher arching themes of maturation and growth that transcend the basic needs of lust and want. This record comes far closer to approximating their live show, with a scorching sound that is often volatile, rife with damaged guitar deconstructions and gleaming figures, yet maintains their eminently melodic sensibilities. Beyond Desire, shifts from shimmering to scorching at the drop of a hat held together by rock solid songwriting. By moving between both ends of the spectrum, the ten tracks on Beyond Desire function both as blissed-out, resplendent expository narratives, and also as pure, white-noise nihilism.\n\nBoth their live performances and album, replete with gorgeous packaging and artwork, are crucial entry points to understanding the band.\n\nTheir upcoming tour will take them across the country from New Orleans to California playing in old and new cities alike over the course of three months.

Despite having no formal background in singing, she gained the respect of local superstars and became an icon in her own right.\n\nWhile she takes cues from musical influences like Nina Simone, Etta James, Sade, Tina Turner, and Mary J. Blige, Warfield has carved out a style all her own, which can best be described as \u201calternative soul with a lil bit of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll.\u201d In 2006, she self-released her debut album \u201cEmbrace Me.\u201d By 2009, she caught the eye of the one-and-only Prince and ultimately joined his group the \u201cNew Power Generation.\u201d\n\nAfter touring for several years and soaking up as much knowledge as she could from the ultimate music mentor, Warfield made her big splash on the national scene in 2014, first as a feature artist for Vh1\u2019s \u201cYou Oughta Know\u201d campaign, and then with the release of her major label debut album \u201cThe Unexpected,\u201d which was executive produced by Prince. What followed were show-stopping performances on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d \u201cThe Late Show with David Letterman,\u201d and \u201cThe Arsenio Hall Show;\u201d a 2014 Soul Train Music Award and nominations for two others; a BET Best New Artist Award nomination; an interview with National Public Radio; and high-profile cosigns from Lionel Richie, Cindy Lauper, and Nancy Wilson of HEART. That same year, Warfield\u2019s performance closing out Essence Fest was hailed as one of the most memorable after shows at the New Orleans House of Blues. In 2015, the accolades only kept growing, with Warfield and the NPG Hornz being named one of the top 10 bands to see at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. It\u2019s no wonder she has left celebrities like Letterman declaring it\u2019s time to \u201ccancel show business!\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Warfield began the next phase of her ascension, collaborating with another one of her childhood influences, the aforementioned Nancy Wilson, to create the band Roadcase Royale. Their lead single \u201cGet Loud\u201d was featured prominently in the 2017 Women\u2019s March and they released their debut album \u201cFirst Things First\u201d later that year. If that weren\u2019t enough, their remake of HEART\u2019s \u201cThese Dreams\u201d was featured in the film \u201cMolly\u2019s Game,\u201d which starred Idris Elba, Jessica Chastain, and Kevin Costner and was released in November 2017.\n\nGoing forward, expect Warfield\u2019s star to only continue growing.", "otherInfo": "Liv Warfield"}, {"Address": "151 Avenue C, New York, NY 10009", "Artist": "Andromeda Anarchia", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9816326.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.977924, 40.72561], "Date": "Tue Mar 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-10", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Avant-Garde, Classical, Cabaret, Improvisation, Rock, Indie Pop, Art Rock, Metal, Experimental, Avant-Prog, Progressive Alternative", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Nublu 151", "moreBioInfo": "\"Andromeda Anarchia is establishing herself as an original force in the realm of progressive music, or alternative music, or\u2026 actually I\u2019d hate to put this music in a box, because although it integrates many influences from jazz, progressive, rock and even pop, its originality puts it in a genre of its own.\" (Ghostly Beard for MUSIC TALKS)\n\nAndromeda Anarchia is a New York based singer, composer, songwriter, lyricist and producer from Switzerland.

She then specialized in contemporary singing styles such as jazz, pop, rock, heavy metal and soul - but always experimenting with all of these styles in a genre-mixing manner, contextualized in progressive and avant-garde music. Andromeda Anarchia then also added another dimension to her vocal expressions and studied extreme vocals (metal screams, growls).\n\nIn her musical work Andromeda Anarchia does not limit herself to singing in the traditional sense, but uses her voice as a versatile instrument and combines different vocal styles in all possible and (almost) impossible ways.\n\nFor her project DARKMATTERS, she collaborates with French label Alter-Nativ and with Music Box Publishing, and got nominated for the Independent Music Awards 2019 (NYC).\n\nPerformance Instruments: Voice (main), Piano, E-Bass\nLanguages: English, German\n\n\"[...] the goliath, penultimate track \u201cThe Filth\u201d brings things back into the bizarre depths of blackened death.

The mesmerizing result is a harmonic convergence.\n\nCombine legendary beat-makers like J Dilla and Flying Lotus with indie rock and electronic icons like Deerhunter and Washed Out, then add Radiohead\u2019s dreamy ambience and you begin to approach the sound of Jaw Gems. Electronic musician, Daedelus says \u201cJaw Gems have done the magic trick of delivering a thoroughly listenable instrumental album that you can also sing along to.\u201d\n\n\u201cDilla is the common thread for how we all met and began playing together,\u201d says keyboardist Hassan Muhammad. \u201cNot many people in Portland knew about him seven years ago, so through various friends we were all pointed out to each other and we were blessed with the opportunity to hold a weekly residency at a bar, playing all the stuff we liked and getting increasingly weird.\u201d\n\nSince their start in 2009, the band has been exploring sonic and rhythmic ideas that emphasize interlaced melodies and heavy grooves. First outfitted solely with dueling vintage synthesizers, a drummer, and an electric bassist, Jaw Gems have now incorporated a Roland sp404 and the Juno 106 analog synth, going on to employ the beat- repeating, sample-warping technologies of the present to help create their wall of sound. Armed with new gear, Jaw Gems were able to evolve their beats, trigger intricate samples, and alter sounds in an increasingly advanced way. \u201cYou can do so much with these devices, and we all have our own ways of using them,\u201d says bassist Andrew Scherzer.\n\nIn August of 2016, Jaw Gems delivered their second album, HEATWEAVER, via STS9\u2019s 1320 Records. The 14-tracks create a thickly layered transcendental auditory world \u2013 a meticulously crafted collection grounded in a modern electronic aesthetic. HEATWEAVER melds neck-breaking, hip-hop synthesizers and nostalgic atmospheres, while simultaneously touching on elements of psychedelic funk, neo-soul, and punk rock. Jaw Gems likes to keep their recording process relaxed to allow for creative diversity.\n\nSetting up shop in a makeshift home studio, the band hunkers down and lets their songs come to life. Put four beatmakers in a room together for a week, and the outpouring of ideas could be endless. \u201cAs we develop as individual musicians each of our sounds morph and evolve in different ways, so when we come together to record we all bring something new to build upon,\u201d says drummer DJ Moore. \u201cOur creative process is never the same,\u201d says keyboardist and sampler Tyler Quist. \u201cOn HEATWEAVER, we let some of our beats stay in a more bedroom beat format, and others we revamped to sound a lot more live.\u201d In this case, Jaw Gems was left with a solid compilation attesting to their evolution as tenacious genre-bending producers.\n\nNow, after catching the attention of acclaimed Alpha Pup Records, Jaw Gems re-released HEATWEAVER on the label this on October 13, 2017, with additional remixes of every track. This re-release features flips from T3 (Slum Village), Daedelus, Brady Watt (Talib Kweli/DJ Premier), THE GRID (Jon Cleary Band), Break Science, Russ Liquid Test, and more. Expect Jaw Gems\u2019 next full-length album on Alpha Pup Records in the coming months, as well.\n\nIn addition to national tours, and landing their dream record deal, other recent Jaw Gems\u2019 highlights include shared stages with icons such as My Morning Jacket, Flying Lotus at L.A\u2019s legendary Low End Theory (FlyLo\u2019s first appearance at the famed L.A. beat scene event in years), STS9, Lettuce, and many more.\n\nVisit JAWGEMS.COM to join their mailing list and stay in the loop about upcoming tour dates.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "55 W 13th St, New York, NY 10011", "Artist": "Adam Tendler", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8722216.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.996578, 40.736451], "Date": "Wed Mar 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Mannes School of Music", "moreBioInfo": "pianist \u2022 author \u2022 composer \u2022 educator \u2022 advocate", "otherInfo": "Adam Tendler leads a discussion and demonstration on midcentury era piano etudes."}, {"Address": " Lower Level, 2537 Broadway, New York City, NY 10025", "Artist": "Ming-Jui Liu, guitarist", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8746950.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.972631, 40.793957], "Date": "Wed Mar 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-11", "Genre": "Genres: Classical Guitar; Chamber Music", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Bar Thalia", "moreBioInfo": "Taiwanese guitarist, composer, and arranger in New York area", "otherInfo": "Arbor Music presents a Bach Cabaret featuring some of the finest musicians in the city singing the finest vocal music ever written.

Their compositions traverse different styles while their live show leaves audiences in awe. Laser Baron, which was released on June 10th, 2014 is Valence\u2019s latest EP and tells the story of a scientist, Dr. Mervin Taylor, who builds a laser so powerful it rips a hole through space and time, transporting him to a future where his technology is a tool of oppression. The band tracked the EP at Carriage House Studios in Stamford, CT and it was mixed and mastered by Mikhail Pivovarov. The story of Laser Baron was written by guitarist Geoffrey Schaefer and Illustrator, Brian Allen from Flyland Designs created the album artwork. As a follow up to their debut album, Sleepwalker, Valence really ups the ante both musically and sonically with this three-song suite.

On the musician\u2019s second solo album, Devour, Hause scours the foundation of that crumbled dream in an attempt to discover how everything we believed growing up could have turned out so differently. The album, initially written to become the third record from Hause\u2019s rock band The Loved Ones, follows his 2011 solo debut Resolutions, a disc that allowed the musician to understand his potential as his own artist.\n\nAs Hause, a Philadelphia native, began penning new music for a new album from The Loved Ones, it became clear that the group, who had taken a break after their second album, had stalled. These songs, however, which showcased a clear thematic journey, were meant to be vocalized by Hause and over the past few years he transformed them into Devour. Hause solidified the album\u2019s sequence before even going into the studio, aiming to craft a narrative arc that drove the album from its dark, heavy first half into a lighter, more hopeful tone. A thematic line of melody runs through the songs, reflecting the overarching ideas in the music itself. The disc explores the heartbreak of shattered childhood promises of a better world and concludes with optimistic hope.\n\n\u201cDevour is about that inherent American appetite,\u201d Hause says. \u201cIt\u2019s in all the songs in some degree. There\u2019s a reason why Tony Soprano became such a huge American icon \u2013 he\u2019s this guy with this insane appetite for women and food and power. I think for the American public to latch onto a figure like that says something. Some of the positive things about America come from that as well, but there\u2019s a real sense of reckoning that comes from devouring everything in front of you. Is it ever enough?\u201d\n\nThe rock songs, tinged with folk and punk tones, are firmly rooted in Hause\u2019s own upbringing and the sensibility that comes from growing up in a blue collar neighborhood driven by the lingering anticipation of upward mobility. In the lyrics, the fulcrum around which the album revolves, Hause grapples with this working class ideal and the fact that America\u2019s recent shifts have caused it to no longer fit. From \u201cThe Great Depression,\u201d which centers on the unfulfilled promises laid out in the Reagan-era \u201880s, to the more specific-minded relationships of \u201cFather\u2019s Son,\u201d Devour comes to terms with the loss of youthful innocence in a rapidly evolving world.\n\n\u201cI wanted to shine a light back on what was going on,\u201d Hause says. \u201cIt was a topic that was close to me and I wanted to write about it. In the end, it leaves you with the idea that if you have music and love you may be able to save yourself. It\u2019s going to be alright. That simple John Lennon concept of all you need is love. That\u2019s how I wrote myself out of the dark and the music begs the listener to come take that risk as well.\u201d\n\nOnce Hause had the track sequence and overall narrative in place he enlisted producer Andrew Alekel along with musician and co-producer Mitchell Townsend. The producers helped Hause collect the right musicians to build the songs in the best way possible, including My Morning Jacket keyboardist Bo Koster, Social Distortion drummer David Hidalgo Jr. and bassist Bob Thomson. Frightened Rabbit\u2019s Scott Hutchison, Alkaline Trio\u2019s Matt Skiba and The Watson Twins also appear on several tracks. Hause and his crew recorded the album over several weeks from mid-February to mid-March at Grandmaster Recorders LTD. in Hollywood, CA, focusing on giving each song the right tone while maintaining an overall musical aesthetic that helps tie the lyrical themes together.\n\n\u201cIt was this group effort,\u201d Hause says. \u201cA lot of trust went into letting Andrew and Mitch be the architects of the record. I trusted that we would get in there and they would know who was right for the music. They wanted to bring these people together in this great studio to get a record that was greater than the sum of its parts. I\u2019m glad I trusted them because it was great to work with everyone there.\u201d\n\nFor the musician, who has toured with Social Distortion, The Gaslight Anthem, Bouncing Souls and Chuck Ragan since launching his solo career, Devour is a cathartic release, both sonically and lyrically. Hause recently relocated to California and is committed to pursing the music he feels best reflects him individually. The journey on the album, the search for the light at the end of the tunnel, mirrors his own trek. The record closes with the delicate introspection of \u201cBenediction,\u201d a song that pulls lyrical lines from all the tracks that precede it. After all the ruined promises and the culminating disappointments of the world, Hause ends the album with the sentiment of possibility. \u201cIt's love my friend in the end that can save us tonight,\u201d he sings. \u201cSo are you in?\u201d", "otherInfo": "Dave Hause & the Mermaid\n\nPRE SALE CODE IS SABOTEURS"}, {"Address": "95 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Sportsfan", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.988383, 40.721329], "Date": "Wed Mar 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Arlene's Grocery", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "New Colossus Festival: The Vernes, Bad Waitress, Parliamo, Sportsfan, Patti, Tugboat Captain at Arlene's Grocery (NYC)"}, {"Address": "95 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Sports Fan", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6613962.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988383, 40.721329], "Date": "Wed Mar 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-11", "Genre": "Genres: Piano, Electronic, Drums Power-pop, Pop, Bass", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Arlene's Grocery", "moreBioInfo": "Sports Fan unleash intelligent, ultra-catchy power-pop through piano, bass, drums and close vocal harmonies.

Born with a membrane between her and the rest of the world, yet still very much connected to and dependent on a larger life force. It\u2019s this origin story that inspired the name of Squirrel Flower\u2019s new album I Was Born Swimming.\n\nWilliams comes from a deep-rooted musical family tree. Her grandparents were classical musicians who lived in the Gate Hill Co-op, an artistic cooperative from upstate New York that grew out of Black Mountain College. Ella\u2019s father, Jesse Williams, spent most of his life as a touring jazz and blues performer and educator, and lends his bass playing to the album (listen for his smooth solo on \u201cHeadlights\u201d). Growing up in a family of hard working musicians fostered a love of music and started Williams down her own musical path. As a child, Williams adopted the alter ego of Squirrel Flower. A couple years later, she began singing with the Boston Children\u2019s Chorus while studying music theory and teaching herself to play the guitar. As a teen, she discovered the Boston DIY and folk music scenes and began writing, recording, and performing her own songs, now returning to the name Squirrel Flower as her chosen moniker. By the time Williams had begun performing live, recording and touring she was already well on her way to the signature artful songcraft heard on the album.\n\nSquirrel Flower\u2019s music is ethereal and warm, gushing with emotional depth that the listener can step into like a warm bath. The band on I Was Born Swimming plays with delicate intention, keeping the arrangements natural and light. The album was tracked live, with few overdubs, at The Rare Book Room Studio in New York City with producer Gabe Wax (Adrienne Lenker, Palehound, Cass McCombs). The musicians were selected by Wax and folded themselves into the songs effortlessly. At the heart of the album lives Williams\u2019 massive, haunted vibrating voice and melancholic, soulful guitar playing. The sounds expand and contract over diverse moods, cutting loose on the heavier riffs of \u201cRed Shoulder\u201d or \u201cStreetlight Blues,\u201d both recorded in her hometown of Boston, and holding back with atmospheric restraint on \u201cSeasonal Affective Disorder\u201d or \u201cBelly Of The City\u201d.\n\nI Was Born Swimming begins with an Iowa drive down I-80 and continues to travel, poetically, between her college town of Grinnell Iowa, Boston, MA and New York City where the album was recorded. Throughout the 12 songs, landscapes change and relationships shift, \u201cThere\u2019s so much in the record about movement and stagnation. Feeling stuck, needing to move, needing to stay still, swimming, falling, running, growing, etc etc.\u201d said Williams. The album\u2019s lyrics feel like effortless expressions of exactly the way it feels to change \u2014 abstract, sad and hopeful.\n\nWilliams eventually returns to the image of her in the sac; born swimming, knowing how to exist, love herself, and not needing anyone else to do it for her.\n\nBorn swimming in blue water\nDidn\u2019t ever need another\nNow I live underwater.\nHeat\u2019s rising\nCan you see it shimmer?\nI\u2019m spinning\nCan you see me shimmer?\nI\u2019m moving faster than it\nCan you see me shimmer?\nSo dip me in the water.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "New Brunswick, NJ", "Artist": "stillhungry", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9299625.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.4518, 40.4862], "Date": "Wed Mar 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-11", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Post-Country, Indie Pop, Pop, Indie, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Mum\u2019s (message for address) ", "moreBioInfo": "Having met while playing in various separate projects, Matteo DeBenedetti, Jenna Murphy, and Erik Romero of Asbury Park-based stillhungry began in early 2019.

Somewhere between Country, Americana, Blues, Soul, Folk, Gospel and Rock n\u2019 Roll you\u2019ll find Matt Stell. Geographically situated between the traditional homes of these and other styles of music, it makes sense that he would learn from and study under these traditions in order to craft a sound that\u2019s all his own. Evidence of this can be found on his current release, Vestibule Blues. Stell\u2014who wrote or co-wrote every track on the album\u2014covered a lot of ground in terms of mood and subject matter. \u201cThere are songs about everything from crimes of passion and retribution, to high school scenes most people can relate to, to funerals, to the peculiar ways that men and women sometimes carry on, etc. The record definitely goes to a variety of different places, and that\u2019s the way I like it. I tend to get bored with repetition.\u201d\n\nMatt Stell and his band are headquartered just outside Stell's hometown of Morrilton, AR. The band includes Conway, Arkansas' own Darren Barry on lead guitar, and Cliff Aaron, on drums. Together this energetic outfit tours the South and Midwest with their own brand of Southern music. They have played hundreds of shows in the past 2\u00bd years and shared the stage with the likes of The Casey Donahew Band, Randy Rogers, Stoney LaRue, Wade Bowen, Eli Young Band, Chris Knight, Jason Boland and the Stragglers, John D.

Both records are proof of the band\u2019s democratic songwriting process, with thoughtful lyrics from Brown and Grajko that invoke hope in dark times, warn against injustice, and imagine a future in which all are free and equal and united by music.\n\nToday, Root Shock is bringing their renowned live show to clubs, festivals, and concert halls across the Northeast and beyond, delighting audiences from all walks of life with a positive message and danceable tunes.", "otherInfo": "Root Shock, Cosmonaut Radio, and Mojo and the Mayhem perform LIVE at Drom in the East Village, NYC!"}, {"Address": "1359 1st Avenue, New York, NY 10021", "Artist": "Brian Kerwick", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9611051.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.95572, 40.76833], "Date": "Wed Mar 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Session 73", "moreBioInfo": "NY-based drummer passionate about the power of music and making you dance.\n\nAs both a performer and a fan, I understand what it takes to create successful music experiences as well as life-long memories for any fan base.

He has been active for many years and is still recording and performing music. Fulks is known for his disdain of mainstream modern country and the country music industry, as exemplified by his scorching rebuke of Nashville titled \"Fuck This Town.\" His live performances feature improvised rearrangments of his original songs, off-the-cuff musical humor, and covers of songs by Michael Jackson and Cher, among others.\n\nBefore beginning his solo career, Fulks joined the Bluegrass band Special Consensus. Here he showcased his unique guitar playing, and appeared on the Grammy-nominated album \"Hole In My Heart\" released in 1989. Fulks' solo debut, \"Country Love Songs\" was released on Bloodshot Records in 1996 to positive reviews. This album was followed by 1997's South Mouth, which cemented Fulks' retro-alternative image.\n\nAs fans had grown used to Bloodshot's rough and sparse sound, many were shocked by the release of Fulks' third album, 1998's \"Let's Kill Saturday Night,\" on Geffen Records. When Geffen disbanded shortly after the release of the record, Fulks found himself without a label, and did the logical thing, starting his own company, Boondoggle Records (distributed by Bloodshot), and releasing an album of previously unreleased material called \"The Very Best of Robbie Fulks.\"\n\n2001 saw the release of both \"Couples in Trouble,\" a dark, brooding, and decidedly non-country album, and, just 3 months later, \"13 Hillbilly Giants,\" a collection of covers of classic country numbers both obscure and well known.\n\nFulks would not release another album until 2005, when the release of \"Georgia Hard\" showed a return to his county roots. He also gained attention for a novelty single he wrote called \"Fountains of Wayne Hotline,\" in which he imagined the power pop band Fountains of Wayne as having a hotline which struggling songwriters could call for help with their song structure.", "otherInfo": "the poetry of Heine"}, {"Address": "702 Union St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Phoebe Robinson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9619241.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.980048, 40.676115], "Date": "Wed Mar 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Union Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Phoebe Robinson"}, {"Address": "158 Ludlow St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "LIFE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8851122.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.987746, 40.72104], "Date": "Wed Mar 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-11", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Pianos", "moreBioInfo": "A Picture of Good Health \u2013 due Friday 20 September 2019, released on own label Afghan Moon in partnership with PIAS.

Internationally known for classic standards, late-night ballads, and the cool jazz flavor he brings to his performances and recordings, he has recently established himself as the consummate entertainer and radio program host with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli\" a nationally syndicated radio program co-hosted with his wife, Broadway star Jessica Molaskey.\n\nBorn on April 6, 1960, in Paterson, New Jersey, Pizzarelli has been playing guitar since age six, following in the tradition of his father, guitar legend Bucky Pizzarelli. Hanging out with his father, John was exposed to all the great jazz music of the era, from Erroll Garner and Les Paul to Django Reinhardt. He began playing with his father at age 20, before going out on his own.\n\nJohn Pizzarelli has recorded as a bandleader for RCA, Chesky, Stash and Novus, and in 1997 appeared in the Broadway musical Dream, a revue of Johnny Mercer songs. Along the way, Pizzarelli and his band have earned rave reviews. Reviewers often compare the Pizzarelli Trio to jazz icons such as Nat \"King\" Cole: \"The John Pizzarelli Trio has never been tighter, and Pizzarelli himself has never been looser,\" said The Village Voice of a recent New York show. \"We can say we\u2019re as lucky to listen to [Pizzarelli] as Nat Cole fans were in the years before he became a legend.\"\n\nFor Pizzarelli, the comparison to the Nat \"King\" Cole Trio is the highest of compliments. \"I've always said in my concerts that Nat 'King' Cole is why I do what I do.\" Using greats like Nat \"King\" Cole and Frank Sinatra and the songs of writers like Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen as touchstones, Pizzarelli is among the prime contemporary interpreters of the great American songbook, bringing to the work his signature style and brilliant guitar playing.\n\nWith Telarc\u2019s recent release of Dear Mr. Sinatra, an homage to 'Ol' Blue Eyes,' Pizzarelli's album count now stands at 21, an odyssey that began with My Blue Heaven in 1990. Some of his most recent CDs include, Knowing You (Telarc 2005), Bossa Nova (Telarc 2004), and Live at Birdland (Telarc 2003).\n\n\nA veteran radio personality, Pizzarelli hosted \"New York Tonight\" on WNEW from 1984-1988. Now, with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli,\" he brings warmth, humor and that long-lost \"live\" feel back to radio. The show takes place in their \"deluxe living room,\" where he and his guests play live and recorded music, and enjoy conversation that is relaxed, candid, and off-the-cuff. Recent guests include Regis Philbin, Liza Minnelli, Peter Cincotti, Keely Smith, Steve Tyrell and Tony Danza.\n\nIn addition to being a bandleader, radio personality and solo performer, John has been a special guest on recordings for major pop names such as James Taylor, Natalie Cole, Tom Wopat, Rickie Lee Jones and Dave Von Ronk, as well as leading jazz artists like Rosemary Clooney, Ruby Braff, Johnny Frigo, Buddy DeFranco, Harry Allen and, of course, Bucky Pizzarelli. He was recently featured opposite Donna Summer, Jon Secada and Roberta Flack on the Grammy Award winning CD, Songs From The Neighborhood: The Music of Mr. Rogers.\n\nJohn has performed numerous times on the country's most popular national television shows such as \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" \"The Late Show with David Letterman,\" \"Live With Regis & Kelly,\" \"The Tony Danza Show,\" \"The CBS Early Show,\" Fox News Channel and Jerry Lewis's Labor Day Telethon.\n\nPizzarelli continues to tour throughout the United States, Europe and Japan, performing classic pop, jazz and swing, while setting the standard for stylish modern jazz.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Brooklyn, NY", "Artist": "John Poveromo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9013772.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9496, 40.6501], "Date": "Wed Mar 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-11", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy, Spoken", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Fancy Show", "moreBioInfo": "A Brooklyn-born, Jersey-raised stand-up with the perfect blend of self-deprecation and optimism makes John a dynamic and unpredictable performer who\u2019s both engaging and fun to watch as he struggles to make sense of himself and the world around him.

The album was a follow-up to the psychedelic cult classic Judy Henske & Jerry Yester Farewell Aldebaran.

Following its release and a couple of live shows, the band split up, Henske and Yester divorced, and she and Doerge married.\n\nYester is credited as the producer of their lone album. The LP was released on the Straight/Reprise label; the CD re-release in 2004 is on Collectors Choice Music.\n\nYester, Henske, and Doerge have continued to produce and record music, and Judy Henske has recently returned to the studio and has been touring as well.\n\n\n\n2.)Rosebud is the jazzy side project of Jump, Little Children (Jump) frontman Jay Clifford.\n\nThe group released 2 records, Rosebud (1999) and Vespers (?).\n\n3.)

Raised in Moncton, Canada in the 1990s-2000s, Devarrow lived an early life of stark contrasts. Having bohemian parents that encouraged artistic expression, openness, and a nomadic lifestyle, Ereaux felt at odds to the anxieties, isolations, and social pressures of suburban life. Along the lines of these contrasts and inspired by artists such as Neil Young, Shakey Graves, and Fleet Foxes, Devarrow writes music which is lyrically and sonically inspired by the attempt to reconcile a wandering spirit with the demands of the modern world.\n\nIn 2015, after two years of traveling, Devarrow self-released The Great Escape, a collection of eleven songs written in a leaky-roofed apartment while living in Vancouver for a winter. To support the release, Devarrow toured Canada and Europe extensively, gaining initial recognition for his wieldy dynamic one-man-band act which creates an energetic, captivating, and intimate live show performed in the raconteur style. At this time, Devarrow moved to Halifax, Canada, where he now resides.\n\nThree years on, hundreds of shows later, and now collaborating with a backing band, Devarrow\u2019s forthcoming self-titled album is the well-practiced lament of a mid-twenties millennial in search of a life of balance in a world that demands invasion and extremes. Within the record, Devarrow captures the struggles, anxieties, and insecurities that feel all too familiar to millennials: information overload, the absurdity of modern wage labour, and fears of loneliness and aging. Devarrow attempts to reconciled these anxieties with the recurring social themes of escapism and tuning out hoping to provide a roadmap towards balance and meaning.\n\nDevarrow takes the contrasts of we and I, community and wandering, city and country, happiness and depression, and blends them into diverse and layered songs.", "otherInfo": "New Colossus Festival x Music Export Canada: Canadian Blast featuring Hot Garbage, St. Arnaud, Jasmine Trails, Caveboy, Ice Cream, Devarrow"}, {"Address": "95 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Jasmine Trails", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9730076.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988383, 40.721329], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Singer, Songwriter, Psychedelic Rock", "Time": "6:15 PM", "Venue": "Arlene's Grocery", "moreBioInfo": "Jasmine Trails\n\nJasmine Trails is Allie O\u2019Manique, a master of languid melancholia at just 20 years old. She grew up outside of Ottawa, on the Rideau River, and her music feels like a search back to those more peaceful, nature-bound times.\n\nJasmine Trails songs are profoundly intimate, often written and recorded not just from bedrooms but from beds, in the aftermath of something not so good. Her forthcoming EP stands out in her discography for its boldness. Gone are the scratchy lo-fi production values, aching hurt and small songs. In their place is astonishingly intelligent psych-pop verging on lush (think Weyes Blood, Sharon Van Etten, Charlotte Gainsbourg), though with slow-pitched, trasheteria oddities (think Tom Waits, Portishead, art-school kids in extra-long sleeves with tattered cuffs) almost imperceptibly offsetting all of the hazy beauty.\n\nSynths and keyboards have largely replaced guitar, and O\u2019Manique has collaborated here with a\nband that includes Ottawa/Hull\u2019s Philippe Charbonneau (Scattered Clouds), Pascal Delaquis (Little Scream, Elisapie) and Jamieson Mackay (Shadowhand). She has been most recently collaborating as a duo with Pierre-Luc Clement (FET.NAT) on synths/keys/percussion.\n\nThe new music found her recording in more professional settings, first at Port William Sound in\nFrontenac County with Evening Hymns\u2019 Jonas Bonnetta and then in a church in Quyon, Quebec with Michael John Dubue (HILOTRONS, Little Scream), the latter of which provided the bulk of the material for this EP.\n\n\u201cWith the band, I\u2019m able to make such a bigger sound and I\u2019m so happy because I feel fulfilled by the music,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore was a much more isolated and vulnerable experience. I was ready for a change \u2013 to start making the music I wanted to hear coming from myself. Now I feel empowered onstage. I definitely feel more powerful.\u201d\n\nTwo things haven\u2019t changed. O\u2019Manique\u2019s formidable voice \u2013 full of gentle warmth and capable of pulling off the highest highs and the lowest lows \u2013 still holds centre court. And a flashback quality remains in the songs \u2013 she\u2019s still processing the past \u2013 though tracks like \u201cDream Girl\u201d and \u201cCandles\u201d shimmer with, and seem informed by, a burgeoning mysticism.\n\nTrails has arrived in the present, at adulthood, armed with a growing command of her significant\npowers and all the places they will take her.", "otherInfo": "New Colossus Festival x Music Export Canada: Canadian Blast featuring Hot Garbage, St. Arnaud, Jasmine Trails, Caveboy, Ice Cream, Devarrow"}, {"Address": "95 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Caveboy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9328435.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988383, 40.721329], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Synth Pop, Indie Pop, Pop", "Time": "6:15 PM", "Venue": "Arlene's Grocery", "moreBioInfo": "With a fresh yet nostalgic perspective on alternative pop, Montreal\u2019s Caveboy root themselves in the timeless music of their parent\u2019s generation and build to unforgettable chaos during their live performances.

They revel in ideas of fearlessness, self\u00ad-sufficiency, the extraordinary, and that which is feral and cannot be tamed.\n\nTheir debut self-titled EP, released in the fall of 2015, charted among the National Top 25 on College Radio, and propelled the band onto the Canadian festival circuit including electrifying performances at Pride Toronto, Hillside, Rifflandia, and in their hometown, Osheaga. The band also turned heads by showcasing at festivals such as Canadian Music Week, CMJ, SXSW, TIFF, and Pop Montreal. The band was invited to perform at SOCAN & CIMA\u2019s Pre-Grammy Celebration of Canadian Excellence in Los Angeles, California, alongside Kaytranada and Donovan Woods. The music of the EP was placed in several television shows and films; with a number of tracks on Space\u2019s Killjoys and Wynonna Earp, as well as songs in FXX\u2019s You\u2019re The Worst and MTV\u2019s Awkward. Also, the band had a B-side track from the EP \u201cColor War\u201d placed in the fourth season of Netflix\u2019s Orange Is The New Black.

The band was chosen as an official winner of the 2018 Allan Slaight Juno Master Class program, an opportunity which allowed them to work with esteemed artists and mentors LIGHTS, Max Kerman of The Arkells, Kardinal Offishall, and many more. In March 2018, Caveboy completed their first cross-Canada headlining tour, finishing in Vancouver with a performance of \u201cSomething Like Summer\u201d at the 2018 Juno Gala Dinner & Awards. Their 2018 summer festival season kicked off with a memorable performance at CBC Musical Festival.\n\nThroughout the winter of 2018/2019, Caveboy partnered with producer Derek Hoffman at Fox Sounds in Toronto to create their debut full-length album. Over the course of several months, the team worked through a catalogue of close to 40 songs written since their 2015 EP. The result is a body of work that the band is extremely proud of; a genuine and honest representation of Caveboy\u2019s musical and personal evolution.

"You could be forgiven for thinking that growing up in the Swiss alps in the 90\u2032s wouldn\u2019t exactly be the best place to be exposed to some of the best underground hip hop New York had to offer at the time. However anglo-swiss producer Laurent Clerc AKA Little People, argues he couldn\u2019t have been in a better place. Thanks to the forward thinking programming of Laurent\u2019s local radio station and a DJ with his finger on the pulse of a golden age in the making in New York \u2013 Laurent\u2019s musical education in all things hip hop was of the highest order. An old Mac and a stack of old LPs were mere catalysts for Laurent to try and emulate the sounds from across the pond.\n\nA subsequent move to the UK introduced electronica to his broadening taste and influenced his own sound. Then followed work soundtracking short films and theater productions which added a cinematic element to his repertoire. Following a disheartening stint doing some production work for a Paris based hip hop label convinced Laurent that he should be doing things on his own terms. A self released EP led to being picked up by Illicit Recordings in London \u2013 through which \u201cMickey Mouse Operation\u201d was eventually released. This was 2006 and his debut album only made a very modest splash. Over the past 4 years it has however turned into something of a sleeper \u2018hit\u2019 \u2013 gathering fervent support in the US and slowly climbing the US iTunes electronic chart in the process. Laurent seems to have timed the release of his second album perfectly \u2013 due to drop in Spring next year just as the interest in his first album is peaking.\n\nLittle people\u2019s sound is part beats, bleeps and snippets of other people\u2019s music. Stemming from hip hop, it effortlessly combines warm synths, intricate melodies and string arrangements. The cinematic quality of his sound led to his music being used on CSI and other shows in the US and UK.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "178 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Peter Calo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7335151.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.986012, 40.730521], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Pangea", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Music of Joni Mitchell and Paul Simon performed by Peter Calo Anne Carpenter"}, {"Address": "125 East 11th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "The Floozies", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7126056.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.989166, 40.731661], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Soul, Funk, Electronic, R&B", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Webster Hall", "moreBioInfo": "The Floozies are producer/guitarist Matt Hill and drummer Mark Hill.

Movements spring forth from words in both art and society. As a singer, songwriter, and activist, Victoria Canal\u2019s voice powers a growing discography of alternative pop anthems as well as myriad of social causes.\nSince her emergence in 2015, the songstress has quietly impacted both culture and music, chronicled by CNN Espa\u00f1ol in a one-hour special entitled Proyecto ser Humano. She would also be tapped by Michael Franti for a marathon of touring, enlisted by Nike as a rep and model for the FlyEase Air Jordan 1 designed for adaptive athletes, and streamed more than 10 million times to date.\nMost importantly though, she confidently shares this power with the world at large.\n\u201cWhen you listen to me, I want you to feel like you can be heard,\u201d she explains. \u201cThat goes for music and activism. In the activist work I do, I hope more people feel empowered. Diversity and representation really matter to me across the board with everything.\u201d\nBorn in Munich, Canal\u2019s international upbringing positioned her to speak on a global platform. Her American mother and Spanish father pledged to travel the world together and raise their children around the globe. A proud \u201cthird culture kid,\u201d she lived everywhere from Shanghai, Tokyo, Amsterdam, London, and Dubai to Atlanta, New York, and Forth Worth.\nIt was in Atlanta that she really recognized the power of music as \u201cthe ultimate bonding language\u201d though. Her maternal grandmother worked as a piano teacher and musical director at the local church, and welcomed a young Victoria to accompany the choir in her home. By the time the family moved to Dubai at 13-years-old, she refined her skills on piano and started writing songs under the influence of John Mayer, Stevie Wonder, Bon Iver, Ben Howard, and Queen, to name a few. Following a year in Barcelona, she enrolled in a conservatory and online school. Her senior year consisted of a transformative five-month backpacking trip where she traveled and volunteered around Australia, Fiji, and New Zealand.\nSettling back in the States near her grandparents, she developed a creative partnership with legendary vocal coach Jan Smith [Drake, Usher], who produced Canal\u2019s Into The Pull EP in 2016. The partnership later yielded \u201cCity Shoes,\u201d which amassed 7.5 million Spotify streams as of 2019.\nIn the aftermath of that release, Canal took a year-long detour as a freshman at New York University\u2019s prestigious Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. At the end of the second semester, Michael Franti serendipitously invited her on tour via Instagram message. Building a profile, she went on to grace hallowed stages such as Red Rocks Amphitheater, the Apollo, and The Kennedy Center in addition to supporting Lawrence, Emily King, and Mac Ayres, among others.\nImpressively, she managed to do all of this having been born with one arm as a result of Amniotic Band Syndrome. The LGBTQ, Spanish-American, and differently-abled songstress draws on an impassioned positivity.\n\u201cMy family never treated me like I was weird,\u201d she says. \u201cMy arm was always just called my \u2018Little arm\u2019. That was it. They made me feel like I could do anything I wanted to and to believe in my dreams. On my dad\u2019s side, my grandma would always tell me this Spanish saying that translates to \u2018Optimism orients the hand of destiny\u2019. My family just has this energy where everything is going to be fine. It\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\nThis energy courses through the music as well. Teaming up with collaborator Martin Luke Brown, her forthcoming 2020 EP emanates boundless confidence with her inspiring take on pop music, beginning with the lead single \u201cDrama\u201d. Backed by an unshakable groove and sparse synths, the track offers up a message of reassurance amplified through Canal\u2019s dynamic vocals.\n\u201cIt really came to be about letting go of people\u2019s opinions, including and especially my own inner critic,\u201d she remarks. \u201cDrama is all about embracing my highest self\u2014no matter what anybody might be trying to make me feel. I can brush that shit off and live my best life.\u201d\nAt the same time, Canal manages to make a difference at every turn through consistently giving back as a humanitarian and sought-after speaker. Internally and externally, her motivational speeches encouraged diversity amongst corporations such as Toyota, Mastercard, TED, and more. She has appeared in campaigns for health-centric brands including Soylent and Rebbl. Plus, she successfully galvanized fundraising efforts for Garden of Dreams Foundations, Thankful.org, Operation Smile, and Autism Speaks.\nAdditionally, Unrealistic Ideas\u2014the production company founded by Academy\u00ae Award-nominated superstar Mark Wahlberg\u2014will document her journey in an upcoming series.\n\u201cI played my first fundraiser in fifth grade, and it felt so good,\u201d she smiles. \u201cI never stopped. To be included and treated equally is a total privilege. Giving back is super important to me.\u201d\nIn the end, Victoria\u2019s voice illuminates the fact that anything is possible.\n\u201cI\u2019m growing a lot as an artist and as a person,\u201d she leaves off. \u201cI want to share that you\u2019re not alone in what you go through and you can achieve anything. I hope to be an example of that.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "415 18th Ave, Belmar, NJ 07719", "Artist": "Pepperwine", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8728061.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.023006, 40.171513], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Groove", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Joe\u2019s Surf Shack", "moreBioInfo": "http://www.pepperwinegroove.com/Bios.html We are feel good grooves with soulful funky vibes.

Derek Warfield is a distinguished name among them. Derek Warfield and They Young Wolfe Tones are bringing that musical tradition forward with a reverence for Ireland\u2019s past and the energy and optimism of a new generation of Irish musicians. \u201cWe\u2019re presenting an old tradition in a new package \u2013 and I\u2019ve the same passion for it now as I had when it all started 50 years ago!\u201d DEREK WARFIELD After spending nearly 40 years as founder/leader of the legendary Wolfe Tones (named after the 18th century Irish Revolutionary Theobald Wolfe Tone), Derek Warfield is revered as a singer, songwriter, historian and entertainer in all parts of the world where Irish roots have been put down. The Wolfe Tones enjoyed phenomenal success with 13 best-selling albums, 3 number one hits, many television appearances and shows in esteemed venues such as New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall and The Royal Albert Hall in London. Since breaking away from the Wolfe Tones in 2001, Derek\u2019s solo career has yielded 11 albums to date, the most successful of them being On the One Road, The Bonnie Blue Flag and Let Ye All be Irish Tonight. With the formation and ongoing success of The Young Wolfe Tones, the legend of Derek Warfield continues. LEGACY \u2013 THE YOUNG WOLFE TONES In 2001, after nearly 40 years performing, the legendary Wolfe Tones parted with their founder and leader \u2013 Derek Warfield. No other Irish folk group, before or since, told the story of Ireland so completely and unapologetically. But for Derek\u2019s hunger and desire to continue to further the story of Ireland through song, an ancient tradition might have lost perhaps its most iconic figure. In 2006 Derek put together a band containing some of the finest musicians and singers in Irish music \u2013 The Young Wolfe Tones. Damaris Woods - Banjo Damaris Woods from Co. Meath and is recognized as one of the foremost banjo players in Irish music. She has made a major contribution in popularizing the banjo within Irish traditional music. Damaris has performed an extremely hectic touring schedule over the last decade across the world. She has appeared on the Irish Spring Tour in Germany and been part of performing groups in North America, Australia and the prestigious Celtic Colours Festival in Cape Briton, Canada. Damaris has appearances on many radio and television shows including Ireland\u2019s The Late Late Show (RT\u00c9). Damaris is also a gifted music and many of her students have been prominent prizewinners in traditional music competitions over the last number of years. On an annual basis Damaris organizes the hugely popular traditional arts camp \u2013 The Ag Seinm Traditional Arts Camp in Co. Cavan, Ireland. Despite her own hectic schedule she still manages to find time to teach at the Joe Mooney Summer School in Drunshambo every year as well as The University of Ulster, Coleraine. Peadar Hickey \u2013 Guitar and Vocals Dublin\u2019s Peadar Hickey has been delivering the songs of Ireland\u2019s history to audiences at home and abroad for over a decade. A regular fixture on the Dublin city folk and traditional music circuit, Peadar learned his trade on stage at The Arlington Hotels, Oliver St John Gogarty\u2019s and The Temple Bar in Dublin\u2019s Cultural Quarter. In 2010, Peadar moved to New York City and now performs mainly on the Irish American circuit, teaming up with notable musicians such as Pio Ryan (banjo), Matt Mancuso (fiddle) and Vonnie Quinn (fiddle). On St Patrick\u2019s Day 2013, Peadar was invited to join All-Ireland winning accordion player Martin O\u2019Connell in a performance at the New York Mayor\u2019s residence \u2013 Gracie Mansion. Peadar is currently an instructor of guitar for traditional Irish accompaniment at the Irish Arts Center in Manhattan. Dan Lowery \u2013 Flute and Vocals Dan Lowery is one of the top Irish flute players in the United States today. Born in Milwaukee, raised in Dallas, and with ancestry from County Cork, Dan spent his youth travelling to Ireland learning traditional Irish music. A tour with Surreel, a band of up-and-coming American Irish musicians, prompted him to move to New York in 2002, where he has lived for the past ten years playing Irish music full-time. In demand as a flute and whistle player, and also as a guitarist, singer and teacher, he has appeared on stage and recordings with numerous musicians and bands, including Ivan Goff, Damien Connolly, Allison Barber, Johnny Cuomo, Ashley Davis, Darren Maloney, the Trinity Hall Session Players and Idle Road. Dan has been a member of Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones since 2010. Derek Warfield\u2019s 50 years of experience coupled with the talent and energy of The Young Wolfe Tones brings the old tradition of Irish balladry into a new age. The story of Ireland is transmitted in their music and song and illuminated by the outstanding musicianship of three wonderful ambassadors of a new generation of traditional players. Derek Warfield and The Young Wolfe Tones deliver Ireland\u2019s traditional music and folk songs with an energy and skill that shows the quality of contemporaries within that tradition. The patriotic spirit of Irish music carried through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s by the Wolfe Tones now marches on in the dynamic sound of The Young Wolfe Tones. SHOWS Irish festivals all over the United States have been host to Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones since 2007. Currently the band plays between 20 and 30 Irish festivals per year all over the country. In addition to musical performances, Derek also delivers lectures on Irish history and the history of the Irish in America. These lectures feature acoustic performances of ballads relevant to the subject matter. Perhaps most notably, the band performed at the great Milwaukee Irish Festival in 2011 - the biggest Irish festival in the world. Pat Byrne from Columbus Ohio, one of the organizing committee at the Dublin Irish Festival in Ohio, had this to say \u201cDerek has always set high standards for his performances and this band raises the bar. The people loved them and gave them an unbelievable rousing and appreciative reception. These Young Wolfe Tones and their legendary leader were given a standing ovation, The Dublin Ohio festival were delighted to have them \u2026 they\u2019re as good as it gets!\u201d Australia was the destination in April of 2011. The band played twelve concerts in two weeks with the highlight being four days performing at the National Folk Festival in Canberra. The same year saw the release of Far Away in Australia \u2013 a CD to coincide with their Australian visit. With 19 tracks the collection is a mixture of classic Irish songs music and literature that connect the two countries. Far Away In Australia fittingly highlights the Irish contributions to Australia in song and music. They perform regularly at the R\u00ed R\u00e1 Irish Pub at Mandalay Bay Casino, Las Vegas and are certainly regarded as a unique stalwart among Las Vegas\u2019 many musical acts. AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY AND CIVIL WARS Many of the Irish festivals around the United States every year also play host to lectures/musical performances on the songs of the Irish in the American Revolution and Civil War by Derek Warfield and The Young Wolfe Tones. Derek deals with ballads of regret, joy, victory and defeat and clearly illustrates Ireland's hand in defending the ideals that the United States was founded on. The lecture/show has been an eye-opener for many folk and history enthusiasts from Ireland and America alike. The response and feedback throughout the festival circuit here has been wonderful and has added such a wide and important aspect to the legacy of Derek Warfield and his part in the history of Irish balladry. It is a rich legacy that was almost entirely neglected before Derek began putting together Sons of Erin, Bonnie Blue Flag, Faugh-a-Ballagh and Washington's Irish \u2014 four albums dealing with the Irish of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. He has also written a book, The Irish Songster of the American Civil War. He comments: \u201cLooking at the tremendous quality of the songwriting among the Irish over generations in the States, as recorded in libraries and collections across the country, it\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that Ireland lost its greatest talent in those times, particularly in those who starved or emigrated during the Famine years.\u201d \u201cI hope it helps to keep alive the memory of the many Irishmen who fought on both sides,\u201d he says. Derek Warfield\u2019s lifelong passion for engaging people in the music and story of Ireland is also very present in the other band members: \u201cCommunication with a live audience through music is what I believed to be of primary importance when I founded the Wolfe Tones in 1963. In performing with The Young Wolfe Tones, I continue to communicate with audiences while also passing on an important tradition to a new generation. But perhaps most importantly, it has been fun and enjoyable and every performance gets better. The experience has reinvigorated me and given the young players and singers the opportunity to display their skills and talents around the world\u201d www.theyoungwolfetones.com www.facebook.com/theyoungwolfetones www.irishworldradio.com DISCOGRAPHY Legacy Faugh-a-Ballagh (Clear The Way) Bonnie Blue Flag Sons Of Erin Liberte 98 Sl\u00e1n Abhaile A Nation Once Again God Save Ireland Green White & Essential Gold Volume 2 (2 CD Set) Green White & Essential Gold Volume 1 (2 CD Set) The Night Is....Young On The One Road Far Away In Australia On The One Road Let Ye All Be Irish Tonight (Available from www.theyoungwolfetones.com) Fifty years on from his debut performance, Warfield is now delighted to present the Young Wolfe Tones.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "415 18th Ave, Belmar, NJ 07719", "Artist": "Cold Weather Company", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9029070.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.023006, 40.171513], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Acoustic, Indie Folk, Alternative Folk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Joe\u2019s Surf Shack", "moreBioInfo": "Cold Weather Company is a New Jersey-based alternative folk band founded by singer/songwriters Brian Curry, Steve Shimchick, and Jeff Petescia.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "335 Paterson Plank Rd, Carlstadt, NJ 07072", "Artist": "Emi Antonio", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8982754.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.083798, 40.831065], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Latin Pop, Pop, Latin", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Lola's Tequila Haus", "moreBioInfo": "2013 marca el a\u00f1o del primer trabajo en solitario de Emi Antonio, cantante y compositor Dominicano radicado en la ciudad de Nueva York, que con su sencillo debut \u201cAmiga\u201d, una balada intensa y poderosa, se dispone a la conquista de nuevos horizontes musicales.\nAcostumbrado a niveles de calidad exigentes y exquisitos dentro de su oficio como m\u00fasico, Emi Antonio se ha desempe\u00f1ado en la ejecuci\u00f3n de m\u00faltiples instrumentos tales como el bajo, guitarra y piano, al igual que demuestra particular sensibilidad en su talento vocal.\nTodo esto sin dejar de lado esa personalidad magn\u00e9tica, que con sentido del humor y sencillez suscita en quienes se exponen a su presencia un aire de familiaridad.\nEmi Antonio, cuenta con una trayectoria musical llena de colaboraciones y participaciones, donde su nombre ha tenido la oportunidad de figurar junto al de grandes m\u00fasicos y figuras, entre ellos: Dan Warner, Lee Levin, Chris Hierro, Jotan Afanador, Eli Menezes, Boris Milan, Tony Dawsey, entre otros.\nFue vocalista de la agrupaci\u00f3n de pop rock \u201cSalida\u201d, llegando a realizar prensa promocional en los principales medios hispanos de los Estados Unidos mientras realizaban giras de conciertos por toda la extensi\u00f3n del territorio norteamericano en el a\u00f1o 2006.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "6 Delancey St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Sudan Archives", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9589360.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.993383, 40.720353], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Experimental Alternative, R&B, fiddle funk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bowery Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "Sudan Archives contains multitudes.

Wilson also saw widespread acclaim heaped on Karen Elson\u2019s sophomore LP Double Roses, which he recorded with her in Los Angeles in 2016. But it's not looking like Wilson is going to get much of a rest in 2018 either, as he'll be continuing on with the worldwide Waters tour and is set to release his own new solo album Rare Birds in the spring. The highly anticipated long player - which features backing vocals from Lana Del Rey, Josh Tillman, fellow Roger Waters bandmates Lucius and an extraordinary musical gift from otherworldly Brian Eno collaborator Laraaji - will be released through Bella Union worldwide. Although much of the album is comprised lyrically of meditations on a failed relationship and its aftermath, Wilson insists that Rare Birds is not really a concept album. \"It's meant more as a healing affair, a rejuvenation, a reconciliation, for others, and for me. I wanted to balance personal narrative with the need I feel for calming healing music. I think we need journeys in sound, psychedelic gossamer-winged music that includes elements consciously and purposefully to incite hope, positivity, longing, reckless abandon and regret. It's all in there.\" And, for this one, music critics will need to retire the comparisons to heritage rockers and Laurel Canyon troubadours as they\u2019re hardly useful anymore. Wilson's new sound takes a synthetic/acoustic, best-of-both-worlds analog/digital hybrid approach to achieve the complexity, sonic density and glossy hi-fi coating of Rare Birds. Heard for the first time on a Jonathan Wilson album are the sounds of synthesizers and drum machines. \"The Neil Young, CSN, Dennis Wilson and Tom Petty comparisons for the first two records were flattering, but I didn't ever really see it that way myself.\u201d The things that Wilson had been obsessing on, and he can clearly hear the influences of, are artists like Talk Talk, Arthur Russell, maybe a Sleigh Bells-meet-George Harrison kinda thing. \u201cI hear mostly ME actually. On this album I\u2019m quoting from earlier versions of myself, continuing a narrative I\u2019ve had musically since I got my first 4-track when I was thirteen. I hear the influence of my vocal coach. I hear the influence of having worked in my studio with Roger Waters for months during the same time period that I was making this record. That gave me the feeling I could expand into certain psychedelic and found sound labyrinths.\u201d There are voices, sirens, children playing, and more enhancing spatial sounds, while musical compadres Lana Del Rey and Josh Tillman (Father John Misty) appear as backing vocalists on \u201cLiving With Myself\u201d and \u201c49 Hairflips\u201d, respectively. Wilson describes Rare Birds as a \"maximalist,\" high density album more influenced by 80s British production more than anything to do with Southern California in 1970s. It\u2019s a dynamic new approach for Wilson that calls to mind one of Peter Gabriel's early solo albums or even mid-period Kate Bush. \"This album is a hell of a lot more Trevor Horn than anything, you know, Laurel Canyon-related,\u201d he adds. The song that \u201cstarted the whole record\u201d was \u201cLoving You\u201d. Says Wilson, \u201cI was floundering in my studio pacing the floors for months, scratching my head for a clue to how I would embark upon the process of making Rare Birds. I was waiting on a sign, a catalyst.\u201d The catalyst came in the form of experimental ambient and new age musician Larajji. The pair had played together in the past, on the east coast, but it\u2019s rare that Larajji is in Los Angeles and available to record. Wilson invited him to his Echo Park studio for few sessions. \u201cI had \u201cLoving You\u201d kicking around in a voice note on my phone for a while, something in it was my subtle ode to John Lennon...Larajii is one of the most musical humans I have ever come across, and every twist and turn he takes is documented here, it was not multiple passes, it was pure Larajji in the moment. I then went and sang a \u201cscratch vocal\u201d , which was always meant to be a scratch but I\u2019ll admit it had spirit so I left it all the way down the line.\u201d Wilson says simply of the song, \u201cit\u2019s very authentic in that the longing was very real.\u201d Of \u201cOver The Midnight\u201d, the first track released from Rare Birds, Wilson says, \u201c I wanted to write a song about a sacred place for lovers to exist and I named that destination, process, mood or feeling \u2018Over the Midnight\u2019. It\u2019s a place where nothing is savage.\u201d In one of Wilson\u2019s favorite lines on the album he sings \u201cThis world it is burning, but don\u2019t it feel incredible?/ Whisper in my ear and tell me what you see in the flames.\u201d \"On some of the songs with string sections, multiple layers of synths, guitars, vocals - all the moving parts - the track count may reach 120-150 tracks\u201d, he explains. \u201cWhat I invariably end up doing is setting up a punishing process of giving myself a sonic puzzle where I then have to sort out the relationships of all these ideas, these tracks, these frequencies. This is how I make all of my albums, and even records I produce for others always seem to have that same lush and layered orchestral component. I subject myself to many months of meditation really, figuring out why I was compelled to add this or that, and editing, getting to the essence of what I hear the song as. More and more that\u2019s maximalist, and big.\u201d And while the recording process is often complex, one of the album\u2019s most striking moments came together quickly. \u201cWhat you hear with \u201cThere\u2019s a Light\u201d is the first time the song was ever played\u201d, says Wilson. \u201cI wrote it on my piano during the album tracking and we cut it the next day. This is the first take. It\u2019s completely the first time I ever sang the song in my life, and the drum take that Joey Waronker put down blows my mind every time.\u201d Of Rare Birds as a whole Wilson says, \u201cI want my music to hit people like an emotional tidal wave. With my songwriting it's never about a clever couplet or smug turn of phrase, it's about the intensity, the impact. Besides, we're all fishing downstream from Townes Van Zandt anyway, so the only thing left to do is go BIG.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Abby Rosenquist", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8368124.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988348, 40.735421], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Upstairs at The Stand", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Citywide with Abby Rosenquist!"}, {"Address": "55 Christopher St, New York, NY 10014", "Artist": "Nicole Zuraitis Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10214712.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.002238, 40.733782], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Singer, Songwriter, Musician, Vocal, singer songwriter, Soul Jazz, Vocal Jazz, Singer song writer, folk, americana, Contemporary Vocal Jazz, Soul-Blues, Jazz Vocals", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "55 Bar", "moreBioInfo": ">> Grammy\u00ae Nominated New York based vocalist and pianist Nicole Zuraitis blends clever songwriting skills, an effervescent presence and unparalleled vocals in a consummate package that has thrilled audiences across Manhattan and across the world.

The band toured heavily throughout 2013 into 2014 in support of the album culminating in a 10 city East Coast tour in October 2014.

I'd call it 'future pop,'\" says Blake. \"Across the album, I juxtapose so many different kinds of music. It's very anthemic, and there's an epic feel. The album metaphor has to do with finding our colors, as we are all chameleons. I'm standing out on the cover because I've found mine. I will always continue to stretch the boundaries of the human voice and create the music that colors my life.\"\n\nUsing Blake's own painstakingly handcrafted library of sampled mouth sounds (\"beatboxing, sound effects, vocal scratching, the works\") as its foundation, Portrait of a Chameleon runs the gamut from the reggae-tinged Nick Hexum co-write \"She Gives Me Her Love\" to the horn-laden funky-freshness of \"Disco in Space,\" from the sexy slow-jam \"Lost in Heaven\" to the poignant life-on-the-fringe cautionary tale \"Not Today,\" the latter inspired by Blake's mother, whom he considers his main inspiration. The album also features the hard-hitting, bass-in-your-face \"Your Touch,\" the soundtrack to 2013's Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 campaign \u2014 which starred Blake, played on more than 19,000 theater screens across the U.S., received more than 1.2 billion impressions, and has already sold 130,000 copies worldwide.\n\nBut perhaps the centerpiece of Portrait is the '80s-tastic pop epic \"Retro Romance.\" A sonic sequel of sorts to \"Heartbreak on Vinyl,\" the frothy, feelgood ode to a Jordache-clad dreamgirl with \"Suzanne Somers thighs\" sounds like a final-love-scene song on a John Hughes soundtrack \u2014 meaning, of course, that it sounds totally awesome. \"Duran Duran, the Cure, Depeche Mode, Prince, and Michael Jackson were always playing when I was growing up, on CD or on vinyl,\" Blake says fondly of his proud '80s influences.\n\nHowever, Portrait of a Chameleon \u2014 out on Blake's on Audio Day Dream Records and distributed through InGrooves \u2014 still has a hypermodern feel, and Blake is looking ahead, hoping that his \"future pop\" will connect with fans of all ages. \"So here we go/A chance to start again/The melody is calling me/There's no time to pretend,\" he boldly declares in the album's opening track.\n\n\"I never wanted to stick to one style or stay in one place,\" Blake stresses. \"And I haven't been more proud of anything in my life than this album.\"\n\n\"Blake Lewis is such an amazing talent, and Portrait of a Chameleon really delivers on showcasing all his skill and artistry.\" \u2014 Ken Jordan, The Crystal Method\n\n\"Blake is a super-soulful and creative dude.

All five band members bring their own influences and observations into the music, resulting in a project that feels contemporary, thoughtfully crafted, and relevant.\n\n\u201cOriginal bluegrass music, written and played by young people, is very much alive,\u201d says band member Evan Murphy. \u201cI hope people take away that songwriting and arranging really matter. It\u2019s about the material and playing it in a way that feels honest. This album isn\u2019t political in the sense that we\u2019re beating people over the head with anything, we just tried to tell stories that feel authentic.\u201d\n\nThe album title alludes to the idealized imagery of a shining city on a hill \u2013 a historical phrase that has often been applied to Boston, where the band got its start. Murphy adds, \u201cWe realized that many of the characters in these songs were in crisis, had been failed in some way, or were failing themselves. It\u2019s an unintentional theme but it came out in the songwriting.\u201d\n\nThe Mile Twelve lineup offers five of the most promising young musicians in bluegrass: David Benedict (mandolin), Catherine \u201cBB\u201d Bowness (banjo), Bronwyn Keith-Hynes (fiddle), Evan Murphy (guitar, lead vocals), and Nate Sabat (bass, lead vocals). All are credited as songwriters because everyone in the band helped shape the material throughout the writing and arranging process. Murphy and Sabat initiated most of the lyrical ideas for City on a Hill while Benedict wrote the instrumental track, \u201cRialto.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all inspire each other and recognize that everyone has different strengths,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cWhat makes this band so collaborative is that everyone in the band can do something at a really high level. That\u2019s the balance. We\u2019re all challenging each other.\u201d\n\nProduced by Bryan Sutton and engineered by Ben Surratt, City on a Hill begins with a lively rendition of Richard and Linda Thompson\u2019s \u201cDown Where the Drunkards Roll.\u201d From there, the album explores a number of unexpected perspectives, such as a modern war veteran with PTSD (\u201cJericho\u201d), a Jewish immigrant fleeing war (\u201cLiberty\u201d), and a man who cannot escape the stigma of the penal system (\u201cInnocent Again\u201d). As the album winds down, the light-hearted power waltz \u201cBarefoot in Jail\u201d and the ethereal, old-time dream sequence \u201cJourney\u2019s End\u201d leads to the poignant \u201cWhere We Started,\u201d a portrait of small-town life written by John Cloyd Miller.\n\nCity on a Hill follows multiple IBMA Momentum Awards, presented by the International Bluegrass Music Association to emerging bluegrass artists. Mile Twelve won the band category in 2017, shortly before releasing their debut album, Onwards. The following year, Keith-Hynes and Benedict secured IBMA Momentum Awards in instrumental categories, while the band earned two major IBMA Award nominations for Emerging Artist and Instrumental Performance of the Year in 2018.\n\nThose kind of accomplishments were far from anyone\u2019s minds when Murphy, Sabat, Keith-Hynes, and Bowness started crossing paths at house parties and pick-up gigs in Boston. In time, they recognized each other as regulars at a Cambridge dive bar called The Cantab Lounge during Tuesday night bluegrass jams. In 2014, they decided to start their own band. By gathering grassroots and industry support, they were well on their way when Benedict, who was living in Nashville at the time, relocated to Boston to join the band in 2016.\n\nBryan Sutton observes, \u201cI\u2019m a fan of bands who strive for a balance of being musically unique and individualized, while at the same time working to include time-honored traditions found in this music. This blend is not an easy thing to accomplish. Mile Twelve does this with well-honed and refreshingly honest songwriting, along with powerful playing, singing, and performing. Not only did I have the privilege of producing this album, but I also got a chance to know the band better. I\u2019m impressed with how much they bring out the best in each other.\u201d\n\nThe band takes their name from the mile marker that sits at Boston\u2019s southern border on route 93, the city\u2019s main artery. It\u2019s a road sign they\u2019ve passed countless times while heading out on tour. Through an active social media audience and radio support from terrestrial stations and Sirius XM, the band has found receptive audiences across the globe, touring all over North America as well as Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.\n\nAsked about the band\u2019s influences, Murphy cites Alison Krauss & Union Station for their precise arrangements and execution, the Del McCoury Band for their grit and groove, and the Punch Brothers for their genre-bending virtuosity. As for writing, Murphy praises the mastery of Gillian Welch and Jason Isbell for their ability to tell a fully-realized story within the confines of a three-minute song.\n\nThese influences shine through in City on a Hill, but at the core the album is a representation of the band\u2019s emerging voice. \u201cWe decided to record this album as live and authentically as possible,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cThere was no metronome, no filler material, no smoke and mirrors. It was very real, you know? We all feel that the end result is an honest statement of who we are.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Bluegrass music with grit, groove and genre-bending virtuosity."}, {"Address": "125 MacDougal St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Lemon City Trio", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8805373.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.000148, 40.730557], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz Fusion, Soul, Jazz-Funk, Soul-Blues, Rockn Roll, Jazz, Blues, Funk, Blues-Rock, Gospel, Soul Jazz, Jazz Blues, Rock", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Groove", "moreBioInfo": "Music that makes you feel good", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1160 Broadway 5th floor, New York, NY 10001", "Artist": "Peter Slavov", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8489210.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988693, 40.744678], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Jazz Gallery, NYC", "moreBioInfo": "Peter Slavov is a New York-based Bulgarian double bassist,composer,session musician,arranger and educator.

His fusion of music playing and easy going banter captures the vivacity of great bandleaders of the past. This exuberance is evident on Newman\u2019s 2016 debut album, Eyes on the City, which pays tribute to his musical journey in New York.\nAlong with his Quartet, fellow musicians from Cincinnati\u2019s College-Conservatory of Music, Newman has allured audiences during his residencies at some of New York\u2019s most iconic venues. His first foray into creating an old school big band night was at the elegant Duane Park for \u201cAfter Dark,\u201d a jazz and burlesque revue on the downtown scene in Tribeca. \u201cAfter Dark\u201d lead to a weekly residency at the legendary Oak Room at The Plaza Hotel, a venue steeped in history which was frequented by the likes of Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli and countless others over its one hundred year history. Newman and his Quartet played each Wednesday to a mixed crowd seeking a slice of history, welcoming Lady Gaga as a surprise guest, until the venue closed in 2011. Currently, Newman performs every Tuesday and Thursday, as bandleader in a residency at Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel, and select Friday nights at NYC\u2019s legendary Rainbow Room with his orchestra. Brian also routinely appears for special live performances with a diverse array of musical acts, which have included Tony Bennett, Jose Feliciano, Stevie Wonder, Mark Murphy, Dierks Bentley, Willie Nile, Molly Ringwald, David Loeb, Steve Wynn\u2019s Orchestra, Ray Benson\u2019s Asleep at the Wheel and Tommy London.\nNewman\u2019s personal style, which meshes classic suits, vintage tattoos and rock-n-roll, has attracted commercial brands such as Jack Daniel\u2019s, Marc Jacobs and Tiffany & Co., who have collaborated with Newman for special events and performances. The Jack Daniel\u2019s partnership in 2012, which launched the brand\u2019s Sinatra Select premium Tennessee Whiskey, brought Newman alongside Frank Sinatra Jr. himself, in a performance in Cannes, France.\nBrian married burlesque star, Angie Pontani of the World Famous Pontani Sisters in February 2013, with whom he most notably performs in connection with Pontani\u2019s New York Burlesque Festival and Burlesque-a-Pades shows. The couple have a daughter, and reside in the neighborhood of Brooklyn.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "131 W 3rd St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Christian Scott", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7530244.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00074, 40.730839], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Blue Note Jazz Club", "moreBioInfo": "An emerging talent on the international jazz scene, New Orleans-born trumpeter Christian Scott's debut album \"Rewind That\" was released on Concord in 2005 and received great critical acclaim. 9 of the 11 tracks on \"Rewind That\" are Scott's original work (also on the record is Scott's take on the legendary \"So What\" and Donald Harrison's \"Paradise Found\").\n\nScott's music builds its tonal foundation off of Matt Stevens' guitar riffs, which could easily find their place in a contemporary rock setting.

Despite much critical acclaim, the album \"went lead,\" as Lauper says, and the band split as Lauper filed for bankruptcy.\n\nIn 1983 she started dating her manager David Wolff with whom she released She's So Unusual, a worldwide hit album which made Lauper a household name. A mixture of teen-friendly pop-rock and edgier, almost punky sounds, the album's biggest hit, Girls Just Want to Have Fun, quickly established itself as a female anthem. Lauper won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards of 1984 for her work on the album. Lauper was the first female artist to have four consecutive Hot 100 Top 5 hits from one album.\n\nSubsequent albums (such as True Colors, A Night To Remember, Hat Full of Stars) did not sell as well, but Lauper remains active to the present day and still retains a very strong fan base.\n\nLauper's latest album Bring Ya To The Brink was released in May 2008 to critical acclaim.", "otherInfo": "The Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation presents LOVE ROCKS NYC, the 4th annual benefit concert for the beloved New York based charity, God's Love We Deliver!

He is the older brother of Stevie Ray Vaughan.\n\nJimmie Vaughan's style was influenced by Freddie King who gave him personal advice. Also two other blues guitarists, Albert King and B. B. King, were important influences. Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson was another important early influence (Jimmie says that he and his younger brother Stevie studied Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson more than any other single guitarist).\n\nJimmie Vaughan developed his own personal style that is easily recognized. He formed the band The Fabulous Thunderbirds with singer and harpist Kim Wilson, bassist Keith Fergusson, and drummer Mike Buck. (The initial Fabulous Thunderbirds members were all proteges of Austin, Texas blues club owner, Clifford Antone.) The band's first four albums, released between 1979 and 1983, are ranked among the most important 'white blues' recordings. Sadly, since those early albums did not sell well, the band was left out without a recording contract for a couple of years (during the times when Jimmie's younger brother achieved popular success).\n\nThe Fabulous Thunderbirds got a new contract in 1986 and made several albums that featured more commercial pop-music sound and production styles. Jimmie left the band in 1989 and made a \"duo album\" called Family Style with his younger brother, Stevie Ray Vaughan. Before the album was released, Stevie died in a helicopter crash in Wisconsin on August 27, 1990. The album was released a few days after the tragic accident (the listed artist on the album was \"Vaughan Brothers\"). The album was light blues-influenced rock with Jimmie singing on several tracks.\n\nVaughan released his first solo album Strange Pleasure in 1994. The album contained a song \"Six Strings Down\" that was dedicated to the memory of his brother. He has continued his solo career since then. Vaughan's solo albums contain mostly blues-rock material that he writes himself.\n\nIn 2001, Vaughan paid an installment on his (and the Fabulous Thunderbirds') huge debt to harmonica swamp blues when he contributed guitar to the Lazy Lester album Blues Stop Knockin'.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "otherInfo": "The Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation presents LOVE ROCKS NYC, the 4th annual benefit concert for the beloved New York based charity, God's Love We Deliver!

Formed shortly after composer Monte Weber met choreographer and vocalist Claire Cuny at a DIY show in Brooklyn in 2015, the duo pairs music with their unique talents of sound design, wearable technology, modern dance, and non-genre specific songwriting.\nMonte comes from a musical family and began his journey at a young age. His parents ran, and still run, a Brazilian Band in Western, MA. This initially lead him to perform and teach Brazilian percussion. As an adult he went on to study music composition in college and graduate school, first focusing on electro-acoustic composition and then studying at IRCAM where he began designing his Kontrol instrument, a way for Weber to make electronic music more tactile in performance. While Monte continues to compose for ensembles, he has always loved playing in bands but never had the opportunity to mix the two genres until he met Claire. Monte states, \u201cReliant Tom gives me the outlet to explore both pulse driven works while maintaining the other musical elements which I find fascinating - timbre, aleatoric processes, and interactive technologies.\u201d\nClaire started playing music much later in life. Beginning her artistic journey as a ballet dancer in Dallas, she later moved to NYC where she immersed herself in the NYC art scene. She danced in immersive dance companies, sang in multiple bands, performed with theatre companies, and started writing songs. She desired to combine all of these interests of study into one project but hadn\u2019t been able to until she met Monte. Claire explains,\u201cIt is very interesting to work together from our differing backgrounds. Our ultimate goal with Reliant Tom is to be a multi-media performance experience that straddles the line between pop and experimental music - and philosophizing about what that even means, and is that even possible as \"experimental pop\"? It seems like it's an oxymoron. I've learned so much from just trying to navigate this with him.\u201d\nThe music focuses on the themes of pitfalls in digital communication and the general blas\u00e9 nature of modern social interaction - all through the guise of avant-pop/avant-punk influenced musical devices. The band's instrumentation is generally comprised of electric guitar, voice, a hybrid electro-acoustic drum kit, synthesizers, as well as elements of Monte's Kontrol Instrument.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2124 Broadway, New York, NY 10023", "Artist": "Jackson Browne", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8653388.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98117, 40.780473], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Singer, Folk, Classic Rock, Songwriter", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Beacon Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "Jackson Browne was born in Heidelberg, Germany (his father was an American serviceman stationed in Germany), but moved to the Highland Park district of Los Angeles, California at an early age and began singing folk music locally. In 1966, his career began by joining the The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.\n\nA precociously talented songwriter, Browne signed a publishing contract with Nina Music, and his songs were performed by Tom Rush, Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, the Byrds and Steve Noonan, among others.\n\nAfter moving to Greenwich Village, New York, Browne worked, for a brief period, in Tim Buckley's back-up band and on Nico's Chelsea Girl. After leaving New York City, Browne formed a folk band with Ned Doheney and Jack Wilce.\n\nIn 1971, Browne signed with Asylum Records and released Jackson Browne (1972), which included \"Doctor My Eyes\", a major hit. He didn't sustain pop success, though, and his next album, For Everyman (1973), while considered of high quality, was a commercial failure.\n\nLate for the Sky (1974) established a significant audience for Browne, and fans and critics often consider this Browne's best album. Highlights include the searching title song, the elegiac \"For a Dancer\" and apocalyptic \"Before the Deluge\", the pure arrangements featuring David Lindley's evocative violin and guitar playing, and the Magritte-inspired cover. The title track was also featured in Martin Scorsese's film, Taxi Driver.\n\nBrowne released his breakthrough album, The Pretender (1976) soon after the suicide of his wife, Phyllis. Featuring livelier production by Jon Landau, the title song is a vividly described account of romanticism in a possibly losing battle with the realities of day-to-day life.\n\nDuring this time, Browne produced and played on Warren Zevon's first two Asylum albums.\n\nBrowne began recording his next LP while on tour, and Running on Empty (1977) became his biggest commercial success. Breaking the usual conventions for a live album, it was truly made on the road, including tracks recorded on buses and in hotel rooms, with none of the songs having appeared on any of his prior albums. Running on Empty contains many renowned songs, such as the propulsive title track (Browne's biggest hit single), \"The Road\", \"Rosie\", and \"The Load-Out/Stay\" (Browne's affectionate and knowing send-off to his concert audiences).\n\nIn 1979, Browne was a founding member of Musicians United for Safe Energy.\n\nBrowne achieved less critical acclaim with Hold Out (1980), although it was commercially successful--his only number 1 record, and with his hit single \"Somebody's Baby\" from the Fast Times at Ridgemont High soundtrack. Lawyers in Love followed in 1983 and contained hints of a more political focus, especially in the mysteriously satirical title track.\n\nPolitical protest came out full force in Lives in the Balance (1986), an overt condemnation of Reaganism and American policy in Central America. Flavored with new instrumental textures, it was a huge success with Browne fans, though not with mainstream audiences. World in Motion (1989) was even more politically-oriented and polarizing. Browne frequently played for causes he believed in, including Amnesty International (making several appearances on the 1986 A Conspiracy of Hope Tour), Farm Aid, and the Christic Institute.\n\nAfter four years of silence and a break-up with his girlfriend, actress Daryl Hannah, Browne returned with I'm Alive, a critically acclaimed album with a more personal perspective that had no hits but still sold respectably. Looking East (1996) was released soon after, but was not as successful critically or commercially. The Naked Ride Home was released in 2002. On 11 May 2003, Jackson Browne made a celebrity guest star debut on the FOX series The Simpsons.\n\nAs a whole, Browne's work is marked by compelling melodies, simple, honest, and insightful lyrics, and a flair for composition rarely seen in the world of rock and roll. He is often referred to as \"a thinking man's rock star.\"\n\nBrowne was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. He also participated in the Vote for Change tour in October 2004, playing a series of concerts in American swing states. These concerts were organized by MoveOn.org with the general goal of mobilizing people to vote in that year's Presidential campaign. Browne's appearances were joint performances with Bonnie Raitt and Keb' Mo', and in one instance with Bruce Springsteen. Three of Browne's albums were selected by Rolling Stone magazine as among its choices for the 500 best albums of all time.\n\nBrowne's two most recent albums are \"Solo Acoustic, Vol. 1\", released in the U.S. on October 11th, 2005, and \"Solo Acoustic, Vol. 2\", released in the U.S. on February 19, 2008, both on Inside Recordings. The \"Vol. 1\" album consists of live recordings of eleven previously released tracks and \"The Birds of St. Marks,\" a song that does not appear on any of Browne's studio albums. The \"Vol. 2\" album contains roughly the same mix of twelve songs (popular hits vs. deep cuts). Interestingly, both albums also contain separately tracked \"intros\" to some songs, giving a brief glimpse of the intimacy between artist and audience at the shows where the songs were recorded.\nhttp://www.jacksonbrowne.com/biography\n\n\"No one gives a shit but Jackson Browne.\" - Randy Newman in \"A Piece Of The Pie\"", "otherInfo": "The Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation presents LOVE ROCKS NYC, the 4th annual benefit concert for the beloved New York based charity, God's Love We Deliver!

She is a veritable triple-threat of musical talent as a guitarist, songwriter and vocalist. As with many blues women of the past, Foley has a long history of defying convention, and being a positive role model for aspiring, young female musicians.\n\nThe Canadian has been working professionally since the age of 16, and by the age of 21, Foley had relocated to Austin, TX and began recording for Antone\u2019s\u2014the esteemed blues label and historic nightclub that helped launch the career of Stevie Ray Vaughan and many others. In the two decades that have followed, Sue Foley has been busy touring and recording steadily, all while toting her signature pink paisley Fender Telecaster. In 2001, she won the prestigious Juno Award (Canadian equivalent of the Grammy) and also holds the record for the most Maple Blues Awards and has earned three Trophees de Blues de France. She has also garnered several nominations at the Blues Music Awards in Memphis, TN.\n\nWith 11 recordings under her own name, an instructional DVD and book, as well as various compilations and projects, Foley is set to release her new album, The Ice Queen (March 2, 2018) on Stony Plain Records. \u201cI\u2019m extremely excited to be working with Holger Petersen and Stony Plain Records. Holger is one of the most knowledgeable \u201creal music\u201d people in the business\u201d, says Foley. \u201cStony Plain is known to put out great music and I know The Ice Queen has found her home.\u201d\n\nRecorded throughout 2017, The Ice Queen represents Foley\u2019s full circle journey \u2013 her return to the roots of her career in Austin with producer Mike Flanigin. The album was recorded with her long-time friends and collaborators Jimmie Vaughan and Billy F Gibbons (ZZ Top) as well Chris \u2018Whipper\u2019 Layton from Double Trouble, Charlie Sexton, and members of the Tedeschi Trucks and Gary Clark Jr bands.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a teenager I idolized Jimmie Vaughan and Billy F Gibbons,\u201d Foley says. \u201cThey're both legends now so this feels like an historical event (at least it does for me). And I grew up sitting at the feet of players like George \u2018Big Beat\u2019 Rains, Derek O'Brien and The Texas Horns. I spent many nights watching Charlie Sexton and the Arc Angels with Chris Layton. I learned and grew more musically in my years in Austin than at any point in my life. The fact that all these mega talented musicians have graced my album is beyond anything I hoped for. I am still pinching myself.\u201d\n\nA flood of inspiration and themes can be found on each of the tracks \u2013 ranging from lost love, anguish, and struggle to release, forgiveness and rebirth. Mostly recorded live-off-the-floor, Foley\u2019s emotional vocal delivery, conviction, accessible yet inspired lyrics and intrepid guitar playing are all laid out, bare and raw for the songs to reveal.\n\nOpening with the radio friendly and funky \u201cCome to Me\u201d, The Ice Queen also features upbeat and rollicking tracks \u201cRun\u201d, \u201cThe Lucky ones\u201d (a duet with Jimmie Vaughan) and \u201cGaslight\u201d. There are several bluesy and soulful tracks including \u201c81\u201d, \u201cThe Ice Queen\u201d, \u201cFool's Gold\u201d (featuring Billy F Gibbons on vocals and harmonica)\u201d, \u201cIf I Have Forsaken You\u201d, and a cheeky, guitar-heavy cover of Bessie Smith\u2019s \u201cSend Me To The \u2018Lectric Chair\u201d. Foley also provides some more mellow and unexpected songs on The Ice Queen with the jazzy \u201cDeath of a Dream\u201d, the flamenco-blues hybrid \u201cThe Dance\u201d and a beautiful cover of the Carter Family\u2019s \u201cCannonball Blues\u201d.\n\nThe Ice Queen represents Sue Foley\u2019s indefatigable commitment to her craft, and her transparency with the journey that birthed her, further proving that\nyou can\u2019t keep a good blueswoman down, particularly when she is The Ice Queen.\n\nsuefoley.com", "otherInfo": "The Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation presents LOVE ROCKS NYC, the 4th annual benefit concert for the beloved New York based charity, God's Love We Deliver!

Along with his brother Rich, he was exposed to a variety of musical genres throughout his youth, eventually discovering a love for most kinds of rock. Absorbing tremendous amounts of everything from Big Star to Led Zeppelin, he eventually teamed with Rich to start a band in the early 80's. Going under the name Mr. Crowe's Garden, the group started in 1984 and performed a jangly kind of college rock that wasn't getting them noticed. A terribly unstable lineup haunted the group for several years, but when representatives from American Records spotted the group performing in a club, they were enamored with Robinson's onstage presence and soulful voice. Signing the band in 1989, a hilarious debate over a name change (label owner Rick Rubin wanted to re-christen the group \"the Kobb Kounty Krows\") eventually led to the simplified Black Crowes moniker.\n\nWorking with producer George Drakoulias, the band learned to shape their sound into a blues-based assault that brought to mind the loose, shambling glory of Exile on Main Street-era Stones. Debuting in 1990, the band's disc Shake Your Money Maker was an enormous success and led to several hit singles. Launched into the mainstream, the band immediately took issue with several of the bands it toured with over corporate sponsorship and became political spokespeople as well as a solid live unit.\n\nTheir constant touring also helped the band as their albums began to lose steam commercially. But fans were impressed by their shows and they drew bigger and bigger crowds as they kept the Crowes on the road for almost all the time between their debut and 2001. In that time they had toured with Jimmy Page and helped usher in the new generation of touring-based rock acts that included other live attractions like Phish and Widespread Panic. But burnout and a career filled with internal struggles put the band on hold, and Robinson started working on more intimate material to combat boredom.\n\nBy 2002, he had hooked up with producer/guitarist Paul Stacey and was hammering out his solo debut in the studio. Titled New Earth Mud, the album was a step towards a poppier side of Robinson that was often overshadowed by the technical prowess of his bandmates. Freed from the constraints of the band, Robinson still remained relatively close to the Southern rock sound he was known for.

Throughout his prolific career as part of three of the greatest live groups in rock history \u2013 Allman Brothers Band, Gov\u2019t Mule and the Dead \u2013 his virtuosic artistry has led to thousands of unforgettable performances and millions of album and track sales. Despite all of the ground that Haynes has covered on his musical journey, the impressive thing is that he still has many miles to explore. On his newest solo album Ashes and Dust, he puts forth one of his most gorgeous, musically rich and personal albums to date. It is endlessly exciting to see one of the most brilliant minds in modern music shine an entirely new light on the depths of his creativity.\n\nAshes and Dust, only the third studio album Haynes has ever released under his own name, is a masterful work of art and a particularly important statement for Haynes. The songs are immediately and clearly different from his usual style \u2013 encompassing beautiful acoustic arrangements, a rootsy/Americana soundscape and honeyed vocals that cut straight through to the soul. Although many of these songs are brand new, some of the tunes that make up this album have been dear to Warren for years. In some cases he has been carrying them around for 20 or 30 years, waiting for the right time to record them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing songs all my life from a more folky, singer-songwriter, even Celtic direction,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while, I\u2019ve been compiling songs that didn\u2019t necessarily fit in with Gov\u2019t Mule or the Allman Brothers or even my last solo album. So this record was really a chance to bring a lot of that music to fruition. It\u2019s really given me the opportunity to take a lot of songs I love, that didn\u2019t have a home, and build a home for them.\u201d\n\nGiven his life-long commitment to experimentation and eclecticism, though, it should come as no surprise that the album reveals yet another new side of his musical personality. Knowing that he wanted to pursue a more folk-based approach on this project, he brought in the New Jersey-based Americana band Railroad Earth as collaborators.\n\n\u201cI have a cool chemistry with those guys\u2014they add their own personality to the songs, but they\u2019re really great at interpreting, as well,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other casually for several years, and then at Del-Fest a few years ago, we winged a few songs together and it went really well. A little later, when I was opening the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY, they joined me for part of the set. We did that with a little more rehearsal, more preparation, and it was a great experience. At that point, I started thinking that maybe I should make my next record with these guys.\u201d\n\nEven with a clear sense of his goals for the album, Haynes and Railroad Earth still needed to explore various avenues and possibilities. They recorded more than 30 songs, often trying entirely different arrangements for each take or even recording late at night and not listening to playbacks until they reconvened the next day.\n\nFans of jam-band powerhouse Gov\u2019t Mule or the most recent soul-charged incarnation of the Warren Haynes Band\u2014or listeners who know Haynes through his 25-year affiliation with the Allman Brothers Band or his work with various extensions of the Grateful Dead family\u2014may be surprised to hear him working in a more song-based context. Several of the tracks on Ashes and Dust, like \u201cCompany Man\u201d and \u201cCoal Tattoo,\u201d are links to the folk tradition of narrative writing.\n\n\u201cI love story songs,\u201d Haynes says. \u201cI was very influenced by the whole concept of writing songs that tell a story. When I first got bitten by the singer-songwriter bug, when I was 14, it was due to those people who transported you to another place and another time with their songs\u201d\n\nWhich is not to say that Ashes and Dust leaves his instrumental adventures behind; several songs such as \u201cBlue Maiden\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cStranded in Self-Pity\u201d open out into more extended musical journeys. \u201cIn the studio, you\u2019re always looking for the balance between structure and focus and improvisation, opening up the music to chance\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut too much of either can keep the music from being as rewarding or as effective as it can be. Luckily my audience loves things to be stretched out. They love to hear the performance aspect. It was nice to take a few dirt roads, musically speaking, and go to some places none of us were expecting.\u201d\n\nHaynes shares that this album also brought out some new dimensions for him as a guitarist. \u201cMy playing here is quite different from what I\u2019ve done in recent projects. It\u2019s showcasing a side of my musicality that\u2019s unlike, in some cases, anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says, noting that he played a hollow-body D\u2019Angelico instrument (\u201ckind of a jazz guitar\u201d) for many of the sessions. \u201cI like to adapt to my surroundings\u2014to the music itself and to the musicians, trying to choose a musical voice that fits into the overall picture a certain way. I played a lot more slide guitar than I\u2019ve played in a long time and a lot of acoustic guitar, things that were more directed to weaving themselves into the fabric of this music.\u201d\n\nOne of the songs, \u201cSpots of Time\u201d (the lyrics of which include the phrase that gives the album its title), may be familiar to ardent Haynes-watchers. The song was written by Haynes and Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers have been playing it on stage in recent years. He had hoped that the song would be included if the Allmans made another studio album, but after the legendary band retired in 2014, he decided to record it himself\u2014but not before inviting Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and percussionist Marc Quinones to join him in the studio.\n\nOn \u201cGold Dust Woman,\u201d Grace Potter adds her unique vocal timbre. Sparking a fast friendship and instant chemistry several years ago, Haynes and Potter have performed this song together many times on stage and this endeavor seemed like the perfect opportunity to document it in the studio. That chemistry, along with Railroad Earth\u2019s unique instrumental interpretation, plays out here in fine form on the sole duet on the album.\n\nThe presence of these world-class musicians and artists, along with that of Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin and famed harmonica player Mickey Raphael (who each make an appearance here on \u201cWanderlust\u201d) is yet another reason why Ashes and Dust stands as such a personal, ambitious document of Warren Haynes\u2019 history. With songs that reach back to his initial fascination with music and others that go right up to the present day, it\u2019s a look behind his first-rate playing and into his enduring creative spirit.\n\n\u201cThese songs were each very important to me when they were written, especially since some of them go so far back,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all visual memories and experiences of certain time periods that I tried to capture in song. They really represent a collection of memories in my life.\u201d", "otherInfo": "The Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation presents LOVE ROCKS NYC, the 4th annual benefit concert for the beloved New York based charity, God's Love We Deliver!

In 1966, his career began by joining the The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.\n\nA precociously talented songwriter, Browne signed a publishing contract with Nina Music, and his songs were performed by Tom Rush, Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, the Byrds and Steve Noonan, among others.\n\nAfter moving to Greenwich Village, New York, Browne worked, for a brief period, in Tim Buckley's back-up band and on Nico's Chelsea Girl. After leaving New York City, Browne formed a folk band with Ned Doheney and Jack Wilce.\n\nIn 1971, Browne signed with Asylum Records and released Jackson Browne (1972), which included \"Doctor My Eyes\", a major hit. He didn't sustain pop success, though, and his next album, For Everyman (1973), while considered of high quality, was a commercial failure.\n\nLate for the Sky (1974) established a significant audience for Browne, and fans and critics often consider this Browne's best album. Highlights include the searching title song, the elegiac \"For a Dancer\" and apocalyptic \"Before the Deluge\", the pure arrangements featuring David Lindley's evocative violin and guitar playing, and the Magritte-inspired cover. The title track was also featured in Martin Scorsese's film, Taxi Driver.\n\nBrowne released his breakthrough album, The Pretender (1976) soon after the suicide of his wife, Phyllis. Featuring livelier production by Jon Landau, the title song is a vividly described account of romanticism in a possibly losing battle with the realities of day-to-day life.\n\nDuring this time, Browne produced and played on Warren Zevon's first two Asylum albums.\n\nBrowne began recording his next LP while on tour, and Running on Empty (1977) became his biggest commercial success. Breaking the usual conventions for a live album, it was truly made on the road, including tracks recorded on buses and in hotel rooms, with none of the songs having appeared on any of his prior albums. Running on Empty contains many renowned songs, such as the propulsive title track (Browne's biggest hit single), \"The Road\", \"Rosie\", and \"The Load-Out/Stay\" (Browne's affectionate and knowing send-off to his concert audiences).\n\nIn 1979, Browne was a founding member of Musicians United for Safe Energy.\n\nBrowne achieved less critical acclaim with Hold Out (1980), although it was commercially successful--his only number 1 record, and with his hit single \"Somebody's Baby\" from the Fast Times at Ridgemont High soundtrack. Lawyers in Love followed in 1983 and contained hints of a more political focus, especially in the mysteriously satirical title track.\n\nPolitical protest came out full force in Lives in the Balance (1986), an overt condemnation of Reaganism and American policy in Central America. Flavored with new instrumental textures, it was a huge success with Browne fans, though not with mainstream audiences. World in Motion (1989) was even more politically-oriented and polarizing. Browne frequently played for causes he believed in, including Amnesty International (making several appearances on the 1986 A Conspiracy of Hope Tour), Farm Aid, and the Christic Institute.\n\nAfter four years of silence and a break-up with his girlfriend, actress Daryl Hannah, Browne returned with I'm Alive, a critically acclaimed album with a more personal perspective that had no hits but still sold respectably. Looking East (1996) was released soon after, but was not as successful critically or commercially. The Naked Ride Home was released in 2002. On 11 May 2003, Jackson Browne made a celebrity guest star debut on the FOX series The Simpsons.\n\nAs a whole, Browne's work is marked by compelling melodies, simple, honest, and insightful lyrics, and a flair for composition rarely seen in the world of rock and roll. He is often referred to as \"a thinking man's rock star.\"\n\nBrowne was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. He also participated in the Vote for Change tour in October 2004, playing a series of concerts in American swing states. These concerts were organized by MoveOn.org with the general goal of mobilizing people to vote in that year's Presidential campaign. Browne's appearances were joint performances with Bonnie Raitt and Keb' Mo', and in one instance with Bruce Springsteen. Three of Browne's albums were selected by Rolling Stone magazine as among its choices for the 500 best albums of all time.\n\nBrowne's two most recent albums are \"Solo Acoustic, Vol. 1\", released in the U.S. on October 11th, 2005, and \"Solo Acoustic, Vol. 2\", released in the U.S. on February 19, 2008, both on Inside Recordings. The \"Vol. 1\" album consists of live recordings of eleven previously released tracks and \"The Birds of St. Marks,\" a song that does not appear on any of Browne's studio albums. The \"Vol. 2\" album contains roughly the same mix of twelve songs (popular hits vs. deep cuts). Interestingly, both albums also contain separately tracked \"intros\" to some songs, giving a brief glimpse of the intimacy between artist and audience at the shows where the songs were recorded.\nhttp://www.jacksonbrowne.com/biography\n\n\"No one gives a shit but Jackson Browne.\" - Randy Newman in \"A Piece Of The Pie\"", "otherInfo": "The Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation presents LOVE ROCKS NYC, the 4th annual benefit concert for the beloved New York based charity, God's Love We Deliver!

Formed shortly after composer Monte Weber met choreographer and vocalist Claire Cuny at a DIY show in Brooklyn in 2015, the duo pairs music with their unique talents of sound design, wearable technology, modern dance, and non-genre specific songwriting.\nMonte comes from a musical family and began his journey at a young age. His parents ran, and still run, a Brazilian Band in Western, MA. This initially lead him to perform and teach Brazilian percussion. As an adult he went on to study music composition in college and graduate school, first focusing on electro-acoustic composition and then studying at IRCAM where he began designing his Kontrol instrument, a way for Weber to make electronic music more tactile in performance. While Monte continues to compose for ensembles, he has always loved playing in bands but never had the opportunity to mix the two genres until he met Claire. Monte states, \u201cReliant Tom gives me the outlet to explore both pulse driven works while maintaining the other musical elements which I find fascinating - timbre, aleatoric processes, and interactive technologies.\u201d\nClaire started playing music much later in life. Beginning her artistic journey as a ballet dancer in Dallas, she later moved to NYC where she immersed herself in the NYC art scene. She danced in immersive dance companies, sang in multiple bands, performed with theatre companies, and started writing songs. She desired to combine all of these interests of study into one project but hadn\u2019t been able to until she met Monte. Claire explains,\u201cIt is very interesting to work together from our differing backgrounds. Our ultimate goal with Reliant Tom is to be a multi-media performance experience that straddles the line between pop and experimental music - and philosophizing about what that even means, and is that even possible as \"experimental pop\"? It seems like it's an oxymoron. I've learned so much from just trying to navigate this with him.\u201d\nThe music focuses on the themes of pitfalls in digital communication and the general blas\u00e9 nature of modern social interaction - all through the guise of avant-pop/avant-punk influenced musical devices. The band's instrumentation is generally comprised of electric guitar, voice, a hybrid electro-acoustic drum kit, synthesizers, as well as elements of Monte's Kontrol Instrument.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "71 Wall St, Norwalk, CT 06850", "Artist": "Everlast", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8791318.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.413882, 41.116881], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, Hip-Hop, Hip Hop, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Wall Street Theater Norwalk CT", "moreBioInfo": "Everlast started his rap/hip-hop career as a member of rapper Ice-T's Rhyme Syndicate, releasing his debut album Forever Everlasting in 1990.

This album had some songs that stuck to his rap/hip-hop roots, but also saw him singing on some acoustic numbers and trying his hand at rock, soul, and metal. The year 2000 saw the release of his third solo album, Eat At Whitey's, and in 2004 he released his fourth, White Trash Beautiful.\n\nSummer 2007 he was asked by Fox (Nancy Miller) to write the theme song for the show \"Saving Grace\", starring Holly Hunter. On being asked to write the theme: \"It was great to get the call from Fox - not only to find out that Nancy Miller was a fan, but also to be asked to write a song for such a cool show.

He is the older brother of Stevie Ray Vaughan.\n\nJimmie Vaughan's style was influenced by Freddie King who gave him personal advice. Also two other blues guitarists, Albert King and B. B. King, were important influences. Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson was another important early influence (Jimmie says that he and his younger brother Stevie studied Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson more than any other single guitarist).\n\nJimmie Vaughan developed his own personal style that is easily recognized. He formed the band The Fabulous Thunderbirds with singer and harpist Kim Wilson, bassist Keith Fergusson, and drummer Mike Buck. (The initial Fabulous Thunderbirds members were all proteges of Austin, Texas blues club owner, Clifford Antone.) The band's first four albums, released between 1979 and 1983, are ranked among the most important 'white blues' recordings. Sadly, since those early albums did not sell well, the band was left out without a recording contract for a couple of years (during the times when Jimmie's younger brother achieved popular success).\n\nThe Fabulous Thunderbirds got a new contract in 1986 and made several albums that featured more commercial pop-music sound and production styles. Jimmie left the band in 1989 and made a \"duo album\" called Family Style with his younger brother, Stevie Ray Vaughan. Before the album was released, Stevie died in a helicopter crash in Wisconsin on August 27, 1990. The album was released a few days after the tragic accident (the listed artist on the album was \"Vaughan Brothers\"). The album was light blues-influenced rock with Jimmie singing on several tracks.\n\nVaughan released his first solo album Strange Pleasure in 1994. The album contained a song \"Six Strings Down\" that was dedicated to the memory of his brother. He has continued his solo career since then. Vaughan's solo albums contain mostly blues-rock material that he writes himself.\n\nIn 2001, Vaughan paid an installment on his (and the Fabulous Thunderbirds') huge debt to harmonica swamp blues when he contributed guitar to the Lazy Lester album Blues Stop Knockin'.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "otherInfo": "The Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation presents LOVE ROCKS NYC, the 4th annual benefit concert for the beloved New York based charity, God's Love We Deliver!

Throughout his prolific career as part of three of the greatest live groups in rock history \u2013 Allman Brothers Band, Gov\u2019t Mule and the Dead \u2013 his virtuosic artistry has led to thousands of unforgettable performances and millions of album and track sales. Despite all of the ground that Haynes has covered on his musical journey, the impressive thing is that he still has many miles to explore. On his newest solo album Ashes and Dust, he puts forth one of his most gorgeous, musically rich and personal albums to date. It is endlessly exciting to see one of the most brilliant minds in modern music shine an entirely new light on the depths of his creativity.\n\nAshes and Dust, only the third studio album Haynes has ever released under his own name, is a masterful work of art and a particularly important statement for Haynes. The songs are immediately and clearly different from his usual style \u2013 encompassing beautiful acoustic arrangements, a rootsy/Americana soundscape and honeyed vocals that cut straight through to the soul. Although many of these songs are brand new, some of the tunes that make up this album have been dear to Warren for years. In some cases he has been carrying them around for 20 or 30 years, waiting for the right time to record them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing songs all my life from a more folky, singer-songwriter, even Celtic direction,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while, I\u2019ve been compiling songs that didn\u2019t necessarily fit in with Gov\u2019t Mule or the Allman Brothers or even my last solo album. So this record was really a chance to bring a lot of that music to fruition. It\u2019s really given me the opportunity to take a lot of songs I love, that didn\u2019t have a home, and build a home for them.\u201d\n\nGiven his life-long commitment to experimentation and eclecticism, though, it should come as no surprise that the album reveals yet another new side of his musical personality. Knowing that he wanted to pursue a more folk-based approach on this project, he brought in the New Jersey-based Americana band Railroad Earth as collaborators.\n\n\u201cI have a cool chemistry with those guys\u2014they add their own personality to the songs, but they\u2019re really great at interpreting, as well,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other casually for several years, and then at Del-Fest a few years ago, we winged a few songs together and it went really well. A little later, when I was opening the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY, they joined me for part of the set. We did that with a little more rehearsal, more preparation, and it was a great experience. At that point, I started thinking that maybe I should make my next record with these guys.\u201d\n\nEven with a clear sense of his goals for the album, Haynes and Railroad Earth still needed to explore various avenues and possibilities. They recorded more than 30 songs, often trying entirely different arrangements for each take or even recording late at night and not listening to playbacks until they reconvened the next day.\n\nFans of jam-band powerhouse Gov\u2019t Mule or the most recent soul-charged incarnation of the Warren Haynes Band\u2014or listeners who know Haynes through his 25-year affiliation with the Allman Brothers Band or his work with various extensions of the Grateful Dead family\u2014may be surprised to hear him working in a more song-based context. Several of the tracks on Ashes and Dust, like \u201cCompany Man\u201d and \u201cCoal Tattoo,\u201d are links to the folk tradition of narrative writing.\n\n\u201cI love story songs,\u201d Haynes says. \u201cI was very influenced by the whole concept of writing songs that tell a story. When I first got bitten by the singer-songwriter bug, when I was 14, it was due to those people who transported you to another place and another time with their songs\u201d\n\nWhich is not to say that Ashes and Dust leaves his instrumental adventures behind; several songs such as \u201cBlue Maiden\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cStranded in Self-Pity\u201d open out into more extended musical journeys. \u201cIn the studio, you\u2019re always looking for the balance between structure and focus and improvisation, opening up the music to chance\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut too much of either can keep the music from being as rewarding or as effective as it can be. Luckily my audience loves things to be stretched out. They love to hear the performance aspect. It was nice to take a few dirt roads, musically speaking, and go to some places none of us were expecting.\u201d\n\nHaynes shares that this album also brought out some new dimensions for him as a guitarist. \u201cMy playing here is quite different from what I\u2019ve done in recent projects. It\u2019s showcasing a side of my musicality that\u2019s unlike, in some cases, anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says, noting that he played a hollow-body D\u2019Angelico instrument (\u201ckind of a jazz guitar\u201d) for many of the sessions. \u201cI like to adapt to my surroundings\u2014to the music itself and to the musicians, trying to choose a musical voice that fits into the overall picture a certain way. I played a lot more slide guitar than I\u2019ve played in a long time and a lot of acoustic guitar, things that were more directed to weaving themselves into the fabric of this music.\u201d\n\nOne of the songs, \u201cSpots of Time\u201d (the lyrics of which include the phrase that gives the album its title), may be familiar to ardent Haynes-watchers. The song was written by Haynes and Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers have been playing it on stage in recent years. He had hoped that the song would be included if the Allmans made another studio album, but after the legendary band retired in 2014, he decided to record it himself\u2014but not before inviting Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and percussionist Marc Quinones to join him in the studio.\n\nOn \u201cGold Dust Woman,\u201d Grace Potter adds her unique vocal timbre. Sparking a fast friendship and instant chemistry several years ago, Haynes and Potter have performed this song together many times on stage and this endeavor seemed like the perfect opportunity to document it in the studio. That chemistry, along with Railroad Earth\u2019s unique instrumental interpretation, plays out here in fine form on the sole duet on the album.\n\nThe presence of these world-class musicians and artists, along with that of Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin and famed harmonica player Mickey Raphael (who each make an appearance here on \u201cWanderlust\u201d) is yet another reason why Ashes and Dust stands as such a personal, ambitious document of Warren Haynes\u2019 history. With songs that reach back to his initial fascination with music and others that go right up to the present day, it\u2019s a look behind his first-rate playing and into his enduring creative spirit.\n\n\u201cThese songs were each very important to me when they were written, especially since some of them go so far back,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all visual memories and experiences of certain time periods that I tried to capture in song. They really represent a collection of memories in my life.\u201d", "otherInfo": "The Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation presents LOVE ROCKS NYC, the 4th annual benefit concert for the beloved New York based charity, God's Love We Deliver!

The Associated Press called them, \u201c\u2026a powerhouse R&B duo who sound as though they were born to sing together,\u201d while Billboard went on to claim that, \u201cThe music world\u2026has definitely shown that it\u2019s ready to love The War and Treaty.\u201d\n\nThe War And Treaty have shared two new tracks from their forthcoming album that bring even more depth and dimension to their music. With its spellbinding intensity, \u201cJealousy\u201d unfolds in a masterfully orchestrated sound that merges soaring harmonies and kinetic beats, symphonic strings and scorching guitar work. And on \u201cHustlin\u2019,\u201d cascading piano tones and gently lilting rhythms build a beautiful contrast to the song\u2019s moody meditation on perseverance and grit. Along with completing the follow-up to Healing Tide, The War And Treaty spent much of 2019 touring with the likes of Brandi Carlile and Jason Isbell, as well as joining the legendary Al Green for a run of dates at such iconic venues as Radio City Music Hall.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "415 18th Ave, Belmar, NJ 07719", "Artist": "Rockstar Racecar", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10148759.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.023006, 40.171513], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Joe\u2019s Surf Shack", "moreBioInfo": "No good punker kids from Jersey", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "149 7th St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Kendall Payne", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/131642.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.991761, 40.673627], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Bell House", "moreBioInfo": "Kendall Payne is a singer/songwriter of Indie rock music.

The Crowes are listed at #92 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of hard rock\".\n\nAt the time of their 1990 debut, the kind of rock & roll the Black Crowes specialize in was out of style. Only Guns N' Roses came close to approximating a vintage Stones-style raunch, but they were too angry and jagged to pull it off completely. The Black Crowes replicated that Stonesy swagger and Faces boogie perfectly. Vocalist Chris Robinson appropriated the sound and style of vintage Rod Stewart while guitarist Rich Robinson fused Keith Richards' lean attack with Ron Wood's messy rhythmic sense. At their best, the Black Crowes echo classic rock without slavishly imitating their influences.\n\nThe Robinson brothers originally formed the Black Crowes in Georgia in 1984. By the time of their 1990 debut, Shake Your Money Maker, the group comprised Chris Robinson (vocals), Rich Robinson (guitar), Johnny Colt (bass), Jeff Cease (guitar), and Steve Gorman (drums). \"Jealous Again,\" the first single from Shake Your Money Maker, was a moderate hit but it was the band's cover of Otis Redding's \"Hard to Handle\" that made the group a multi-platinum success. \"Hard to Handle\" climbed its way into the Top 40, propelling the album into the Top Ten. The acoustic ballad \"She Talks to Angels\" became the band's second Top 40 hit in the spring of 1991. Shake Your Money Maker would eventually sell over three million copies.\n\nThe Black Crowes delivered their second album, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, in the spring of 1992, adding new lead guitarist Marc Ford and keyboardist Eddie Harsch. It entered the charts at number one, but it didn't have as many hit singles as the debut; none of the singles cracked the Top 40 and only \"Remedy\" and \"Thorn in My Pride\" made the Top 100. Nevertheless, the band established themselves as a popular concert attraction that summer, selling out theaters across America. The Black Crowes' third album, Amorica, arrived in late 1994. Amorica debuted in the Top Ten, but none of the singles from the album made the charts; even though the record went gold, it slipped off the charts in early 1995.\n\nThree Snakes & One Charm, the group's fourth album, was released in July of 1996. The album entered the charts at number 15, but it quickly slipped out of the Top 50. Nevertheless, the album received the best reviews of any Crowes album since The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion. Guitarist Marc Ford was fired from the Black Crowes in August, 1997; two years later, the group returned with By Your Side. In mid-2000, the band collaborated with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page on the double-disc Live at the Greek, an eclectic mix of newly recorded Zeppelin covers and additional classic blues cuts. A Tribute to a Work in Progress: Greatest Hits 1990-1999, a 16-track best-of compilation was also released in mid-2000. The Don Was-produced Lions appeared in spring 2001, and a summer tour with Oasis -- the Tour of Brotherly Love -- followed in June. But all was apparently not well with the group, in January of 2002 the band announced that they were on hiatus. Drummer Steve Gorman was fired from the band, and Chris Robinson announced his intentions for a solo career.\n\nThe Black Crowes have since reunited. All members circa 1992 are back, with the addition of one of their previous bassists, Sven Pipien, and harmony singers Mona Lisa Young and Charity White. They are enjoying a renaissance within the group as well as with their longtime fan base and have been consistently touring since formally reuniting in March 2005. In November of 2007, it was announced that North Mississippi Allstar guitarist Luther Dickinson formally joined the band, replacing Paul Stacey. He appears throughout the Crowes' album Warpaint, which will be released in March of 2008.", "otherInfo": "LOVE ROCKS NYC Benefitting God's Love We Deliver"}, {"Address": "140 Wilson Ave 11237140 Wilson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237, USA, New York City, NY", "Artist": "Gorgeous", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8618669.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.925757, 40.700587], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Post-World", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Alphaville", "moreBioInfo": "Music is life.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2124 Broadway, New York, NY 10023", "Artist": "Macy Gray", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9124233.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98117, 40.780473], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: R&B, Soul", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Beacon Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cThese were songs that I would\u2019ve probably written in another life,\u201d says Macy Gray in her trademark rasp. She\u2019s been asked to identify the common denominator linking the wildly varied songs on Covered, her stunning new collection of cover songs. \u201cAnd,\u201d she continues, \u201cthey\u2019re almost all these kind of dark love songs, which is the mood I\u2019m in right now \u2013 to sing these I-wanna-slit-my-wrists-but-I-love-you songs. They already said what I want to say, perfectly.\u201d\n\nTo the casual music fan, Macy Gray tackling a covers album might seem wholly out of left field \u2013 especially since the material she chose to reinterpret is largely drawn from indie rock tunes made over the last decade or so. (Exceptions are Eurythmics\u2019 \u201cHere Comes the Rain Again,\u201d from 1984, and Metallica\u2019s \u201cNothing Else Matters,\u201d from 1992.) But Covered is not your typical covers album. It deftly redefines what such an undertaking is and can be, which makes it very much a Macy Gray project.\n\nA gifted songwriter and dazzlingly singular singer, the mom of three teenagers has been overturning fan expectation and industry formula since kicking off her music career with her debut 1999 CD, On How Life Is. That musical calling card spawned the classic single \u201cI Try,\u201d and both the CD and single were massive global hits. They kicked off a career ride that includes two Grammys, two MTV awards, over 15 million units sold, and a thriving acting career.\n\nWhat awards and sales figures fail to illustrate is the depth and breadth of Macy\u2019s artistry. In an industry that is increasingly stifling of real artists, she\u2019s forged her own vision, creating music that leaps genre barriers from experimental soul to alternative rock, from retro-disco to hip-hop. Her artistic integrity and innovativeness has won her fans across the world, including artists such as John Frusciante, Erykah Badu, Gang Starr, Mos Def, and Pharoah Monche, all of whom have collaborated with her.\n\nAnd Covered shows her at a creative peak.\n\nWhere many such albums are safe, formulaic exercises in reviving standards or jumpstarting jazz warhorses, Macy and producer Hal Willner (Lou Reed, Marianne Faithfull, Laurie Anderson) opted for more biting, contemporary fare. But though they had (and have) a marvelously smooth working relationship, the making of Covered wasn\u2019t without its pause-inducing moments, especially at the beginning of the process.\n\n\u201cBefore we started recording, recalls Macy, \u201cI got obsessed with Nina Simone\u2019s version of \u2018My Way.\u2019 She didn\u2019t worry about what people would think or how they would compare it to anybody else. I saw how she just took that song and every song she ever did, and made them her own. So, I went in with the confidence that we could do whatever we wanted.\n\nThe result is a collection that wittily reimagines songs that are already much beloved by their target demographic fans. Covered manages to retain the emotional honesty of those songs while artfully reconfiguring the musical contexts, and clearing space for Macy to place her indelible stamp on them.\n\nWillner\u2019s and Gray\u2019s \u201cHere Comes the Rain Again,\u201d replaces Eurythmics\u2019 familiar chilled despair with a more palpably vulnerable ache as the music sweeps along moodily and cinematically. Arcade Fire\u2019s \u201cWake Up\u201d starts off plaintively, and then slowly unfolds into a rousing, genre-bending anthem whose indie rock inflections give way to African flavored percussion and a swooping choir. My Chemical Romance\u2019s \u201cTeenagers\u201d has been subversively overhauled, transformed from an angry adolescent joust about the ways society hamstrings and abuses its youth, to the ways teenagers torture everyone around them \u2013 especially their parents.\n\n\u201cI remember when \u2018Teenagers\u2019 first came out,\u201d says Macy, \u201cand I was struck by this kind of Duke Ellington feel to it. The melody was always such a jazz thing. So when we were talking about this album, I immediately thought about that song. But when I read the lyrics, they didn\u2019t have anything to do with me at all. I got the idea to switch it up and make it more relevant to something that I would say. I re-wrote it from a mom\u2019s point of view. It worked out perfectly; it makes sense both ways.\u201d\n\nSublime\u2019s cover version of \u201cTwo Joints\u201d is the inspiration for Macy\u2019s take on it. It\u2019s given a soft reggae undertow and is now (at least in part) a sly, tongue-in-cheek nod toward Macy\u2019s own public persona, and there\u2019s a clever interpolation of the Rare Earth classic, \u201cI Want to Celebrate,\u201d at the song\u2019s end. Radiohead\u2019s iconic \u201cCreep\u201d was lifted by Macy a few years back and integrated into her live set, so longtime fans already think of her as co-owner of it. The studio version takes the tune\u2019s self-flagellation to a new level of emotional brutality.\n\nWhile Macy\u2019s mastery of these songs (and others, including Kanye West\u2019s \u201cLove Lockdown) may surprise people who haven\u2019t been playing close attention, the artistic triumph won\u2019t come as a surprise to longtime fans with discerning ears. They know that the singer-songwriter long ago proved she was capable of everything from moody pop to exuberant disco. But Macy, while justifiably proud of Covered, is also characteristically modest and low-key when assessing it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool,\u201d she chuckles. \u201cEverybody just went in and poured their hearts out. It was a really relaxed atmosphere when we were recording, and good things come out of people when they\u2019re in a good atmosphere.\u201d", "otherInfo": "The Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation presents LOVE ROCKS NYC, the 4th annual benefit concert for the beloved New York based charity, God's Love We Deliver!

Reviewers often compare the Pizzarelli Trio to jazz icons such as Nat \"King\" Cole: \"The John Pizzarelli Trio has never been tighter, and Pizzarelli himself has never been looser,\" said The Village Voice of a recent New York show. \"We can say we\u2019re as lucky to listen to [Pizzarelli] as Nat Cole fans were in the years before he became a legend.\"\n\nFor Pizzarelli, the comparison to the Nat \"King\" Cole Trio is the highest of compliments. \"I've always said in my concerts that Nat 'King' Cole is why I do what I do.\" Using greats like Nat \"King\" Cole and Frank Sinatra and the songs of writers like Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen as touchstones, Pizzarelli is among the prime contemporary interpreters of the great American songbook, bringing to the work his signature style and brilliant guitar playing.\n\nWith Telarc\u2019s recent release of Dear Mr. Sinatra, an homage to 'Ol' Blue Eyes,' Pizzarelli's album count now stands at 21, an odyssey that began with My Blue Heaven in 1990. Some of his most recent CDs include, Knowing You (Telarc 2005), Bossa Nova (Telarc 2004), and Live at Birdland (Telarc 2003).\n\n\nA veteran radio personality, Pizzarelli hosted \"New York Tonight\" on WNEW from 1984-1988. Now, with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli,\" he brings warmth, humor and that long-lost \"live\" feel back to radio. The show takes place in their \"deluxe living room,\" where he and his guests play live and recorded music, and enjoy conversation that is relaxed, candid, and off-the-cuff. Recent guests include Regis Philbin, Liza Minnelli, Peter Cincotti, Keely Smith, Steve Tyrell and Tony Danza.\n\nIn addition to being a bandleader, radio personality and solo performer, John has been a special guest on recordings for major pop names such as James Taylor, Natalie Cole, Tom Wopat, Rickie Lee Jones and Dave Von Ronk, as well as leading jazz artists like Rosemary Clooney, Ruby Braff, Johnny Frigo, Buddy DeFranco, Harry Allen and, of course, Bucky Pizzarelli. He was recently featured opposite Donna Summer, Jon Secada and Roberta Flack on the Grammy Award winning CD, Songs From The Neighborhood: The Music of Mr. Rogers.\n\nJohn has performed numerous times on the country's most popular national television shows such as \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" \"The Late Show with David Letterman,\" \"Live With Regis & Kelly,\" \"The Tony Danza Show,\" \"The CBS Early Show,\" Fox News Channel and Jerry Lewis's Labor Day Telethon.\n\nPizzarelli continues to tour throughout the United States, Europe and Japan, performing classic pop, jazz and swing, while setting the standard for stylish modern jazz.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "The Revel", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8086044.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: New Rock, Rock, Rock And Roll, Classic Rock, Rockn Roll", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "New Jersey brothers, Dillon and Dean D\u2019Antuono live for rock \u2018n roll.\n\nBound to the electric guitar, Dillon and Dean have been dedicated to joining the ranks of those who came before them, and that spirit is expressed in their new EP, Don't Let Me Go.\n\nWith Dean\u2019s voice soaring over the energetic drum, bass and guitars, the message they deliver is loud and clear: Rock \u2018n Roll is very much alive.\n\nRaised on classic rock but influenced by the generation they come from, the brothers are quickly gaining a reputation for their musical chops, and their live performance.

Over his career he has been known by several pseudonyms, including Kris Parker, KRS One, KRS-ONE (as given at his site), The Blastmaster and The Teacha. KRS-One is an acronym for \"'K'nowledge 'R'eigns 'S'upreme 'O'ver 'N'early 'E'veryone\". KRS One is a significant figure in the hip hop community and is often referenced in works by other hip hop artists and critics as being the 'essence' of an MC and one of the greatest to ever hold the mic.\n\nKRS-ONE, originally a member of the hip hop crew Boogie Down Productions, is known for setting the path for both hardcore rap and socially conscious political rap.\n\nYouth and early career\n\nBorn Lawrence Parker in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1965, the future KRS-One grew up with his brother Kenny and their single mother in assorted inner city neighborhoods of Brooklyn and the Bronx. According to interviews with The Source Magazine, one fateful day when he was 12 years old, he and his brother Kenny prepared a pan of flavored rice, which was to be the family's dinner for the evening. The hungry pair ate the whole thing, and when their mother came home from work, she kicked them out of the apartment in a fit of anger. They stayed away for two days before younger Kenny decided to go back home, while Lawrence opted not to return. He spent the better part of the next seven years homeless, much of it at local libraries.\n\nIn his late teen years, Lawrence Parker fell in with some illegal drug dealers and became a courier. Using a bread delivery truck as a cover, Parker and his partner drove around town to make drops. During one of their trips, a police car pulled up behind them with flashing lights. Parker's partner panicked, and led the cops on a chase for several miles which ended with the truck crashing and the two being apprehended. At the trial, the judge made the commentary that the only reason the police had initially tried to pull them over was because they had private plates on a commercial vehicle, there was no original intent to search for drugs.\n\nParker, still a minor, claimed he was a ward of the state, and got sent to a juvenile home for his sentencing, after which he was moved to a Covenant House youth homeless shelter. It was there that he met Scott Sterling, a recent college graduate who just started working at the shelter as a social worker. Parker discovered that Sterling moonlighted as a hip hop DJ under the name Scott La Rock. By this time, Parker had earned the nickname \"Kris\" from the relationship he had developed with local Hare Krishnas that evangelized near the shelter. Heavily influenced by Eastern philosophies, he was also an aspiring rapper, and practiced routines in verbal spars with the other shelter residents.\n\nParker and Sterling, along with two other fellows, decided to form a rap group together, initially calling themselves \"Scott La Rock and the Celebrity Three\". That was short-lived, however, as the two peripheral members quit, leaving Parker (now calling himself KRS-One) and Sterling. They then decided to call themselves \"Boogie Down Productions\". Success is the Word, a 12-inch single release on indie Fresh/Sleeping Bag Records (under the group name \"12:41\") did not enjoy commercial success. Soon after, the pair approached another NY indie, Rock Candy Productions, for a deal. As it turns out, the entertainment company was allegedly a front for a pornography operation, but Parker and Sterling convinced the boss to front them the money to record an album, under the newly created subsidiary label, B-Boy Records. After a few 12-inch single releases, the Criminal Minded album finally surfaced in 1987.\n\nCriminal Minded featured many dis tracks that attacked other hip hop emcees and tracks about street crime (\"wa da da deng wa da da da deng, listen to my nine millimeter go bang\"). KRS One and La Rock appeared on the cover of the album holding firearms, a controversial precedent that would be followed by many rap artists in the years to follow. Musically, the album was based around James Brown samples and reggae influences. They also sampled hard-rock band AC/DC on \"Dope Beat\". During these years, KRS-One was also famously involved in a hip hop battle with MC Shan, of Queensbridge. KRS objected to MC Shan calling Queensbridge the home of hip hop, and attacked him viciously on a seminal battle rap, The Bridge Is Over.\n\nLater career and emphasis on political issues\n\nFollowing the fatal shooting of Scott La Rock in 1987, Boogie Down Productions (BDP) became increasingly political. KRS One was the primary motivation behind the HEAL compilation and the Stop the Violence Movement. KRS One attracted many prominent emcees to appear on the 12-inch single \"Self Destruction.\" As Parker adopted this more conscientious, less violent approach, he stopped calling himself \"The Blastmaster\" (his battle rap nickname), and instead began calling himself \"The Teacha\", turning the nickname KRS-ONE into the backronym \"Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone\".\n\nOn his first solo album, 1993's Return of the Boombap, KRS worked together with producers DJ Premier (Gang Starr), Showbiz and Kid Capri. The catchy yet very hardcore track \"Sound of da Police\" is featured on this album. His second album, KRS One featured Channel Live on the track \"Free Mumia\", a political protest song about Mumia Abu-Jamal, an imprisoned African-American and Black Panther member who a vocal group of activists on the political Left claim is innocent of the crime of which he was convicted. Other prominent guest artists on KRS One included Mad Lion, Busta Rhymes, Das EFX and Fat Joe.\n\nIn 1997, Parker surprised many with his release of the album I Got Next. The record included a remix of the single \"Step into a World\" which featured a sample from the 1970s rock group Blondie by commercial rap icon Puff Daddy. \"Heartbeat\", featuring Angie Martinez and Redman, was based on the old school classic \"Feel the Heartbeat\" by the Treacherous Three. These collaborations with notably mainstream artists took many fans and observers of the vehemently anti-mainstream KRS One by surprise. However, in August 1997 KRS One appeared on Tim Westwood's BBC Radio 1 show and vociferously denounced the DJ and the radio station more generally, accusing them of ignoring his style of hip-hop in favour of commercial artists such as Puff Daddy.\n\nIn 1999, there were tentative plans to release an album called \"Maximum Strength\"; a lead single, \"5 Boroughs\", was released on The Corruptor movie soundtrack. However, KRS apparently decided to abort the album's planned release, just as he had secured a position as a Vice-President of A&R at Reprise Records. KRS moved to southern California, and stayed there for two years, finally ending his relationship with Jive Records with A Retrospective in 2000. The next year, he resigned his position at Reprise and in 2001 The Sneak Attack was released on Koch Records. In 2002, he released a gospel-rap album, Spiritual Minded, surprising many longtime fans. Parker had once denounced Christianity as a \"slavemaster religion\" which African-Americans should not follow. He founded the Temple of Hiphop, and released a new album, Kristyles, in mid- 2003, which was preceded by KRS-One: The Mixtape. In the summer of 2004 he released Keep Right.\n\nKRS One's latest CD Life, was released in June 2006, and another CD, Adventures in Emceein on Koch Records is slated for later in the year. KRS has also confirmed for his next album of new material, expected to be out in 2007, he will be working with Marley Marl.\n\nSeptember 11 comments and ensuing controversy\n\nIn 2004, KRS engendered a controversy when he was quoted in a panel discussion hosted by New Yorker Magazine as saying that Blacks \"cheered when 911 happened\". The comment drew criticism from many sources, including a pointed barb by the New York Daily News that called Parker an \"anarchist\" and said that \"If Osama bin Laden ever buys a rap album, he'll probably start with a CD by KRS-One.\"\n\nParker responded to the furor surrounding his comments with an editorial written for AllHipHop.com. In it, Parker said \"I was asked about why hiphop has not engaged the current situation more (meaning 911), my response was 'because it does not affect us, or at least we don\u2019t perceive that it affects us, 911 happened to them'. I went on to say that 'I am speaking for the culture now; I am not speaking my personal opinion.' I continued to say; '911 affected them down the block; the rich, the powerful those that are oppressing us as a culture. Sony, RCA or BMG, Universal, the radio stations, Clear Channel, Viacom with BET and MTV, those are our oppressors those are the people that we're trying to overcome in hiphop everyday, this is a daily thing. We cheered when 911 happened in New York and say that proudly here. Because when we were down at the trade center we were getting hit over the head by cops, told that we can\u2019t come in this building, hustled down to the train station because of the way we dressed and talked, and so on, we were racially profiled. So, when the planes hit the building we were like, 'mmmm, justice'. And just as I began to say 'now of course a lot of our friends and family were lost there as well' but I was interrupted...\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "6 Times Square 17th Floor, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Dax&Atragun", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8640104.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.99072, 40.7585], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Deep House, Tropical, Progressive House, Progres", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "St. Cloud Rooftop Bar", "moreBioInfo": "What began as a simple friendship grew into a partnership that has resulted into rapidly rising success.With countless gigs and quality releases,American duo Atragun and Dax are taking the industry by storm with their mix of deep house,progressive and trance like elements.\n\nWhile attending Albright college Atragun and Dax met randomly at a local hangout spot on campus in 2012,the two realized that they both shared a passion for music and formed an unlikely friendship that would lead to the formation of their successful duo.Before they knew it,they were playing local gigs near their college throughout all of 2013.The following year saw a huge upgrade as both artists took on New York City and began spinning at the cities hottest clubs,such as Pacha,Webster Hall,Santos Party House,Amazura, LIV Night Club and a plethora of more.\n\nGigs are not the only thing that are plentiful with this duo,a number of quality productions also are included in the duos resume,with a distinct sound that sets them apart from the rest of the crowd,Atragun & Dax\u2019s sound are instantly recognizable and will keep the clubs going for years to come!\n\nOn stage support for:\nDave Edwards, Sultan+Shepard, Disclosure, Myon and Shane 54, Choppa Dunks, Kiesza, Gareth Emery, Justin Curso, Jackal, Mednas, Bruno Fresco ,Dj Spade, Posso, Rick Wonder, Joe Moore, Losharp Kansar, Rebecca and Fiona, Francis Mercier\n\nSupported By:\nMyk Bee\nMonoverse\nSam Allan\nOzzy XPM\nDJ Xquizit\nAimmoon\nAlliance\nLeo Barroso\nNeptunica\nDavid Thullin\nLeo Barosso\nVorden", "otherInfo": "Ticket link and official flyer coming soon,"}, {"Address": "167 Ferry St, Newark, NJ 07105", "Artist": "Anthony Attalla", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8257594.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.158123, 40.728919], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: House", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "VIVO Tapas KITCHEN \u2022 LOUNGE", "moreBioInfo": "As 2018 takes shape, Anthony Attalla has firmly established himself as a rising star in the electronic music community.

Coming off of the success of their band FDTF, childhood friends Daniel Rumpel and Johannes Herbst approached long-term fellow and vocalist Lucas Fendrich with the intention of creating a truly dark and cinematic sound.\n\nIn the beginning, the trio was meant to be a songwriting collective focused on epic songs that provoke an immediate, specific feeling within a listener. Standard song structures and melodies were disregarded in favor of the tone and evocation of the music. Perspectives shifted as soon as the band went into studio with British producer Dan Weller in the fall of 2014. The trio couldn\u2019t deny their band roots and ended up with a vast, dark, cinematic sound \u2013 and the formation of HUNGER.\n\nHUNGER\u2019s sound is the result of three very different, yet complimentary minds. Although it took time to define their musical direction, the three band mates were able to use their differences to come up with a unique vision in which they were all comfortable and confident. Each member of the trio brings something distinctive to the overall collective.\n\nThe band constantly discusses and adjusts the band\u2019s direction \u2013 the song concepts, sound, branding, images, videos, and artwork. Each small aspect makes up a larger vision, and each member of the trio has their own place in the process. Process has no place without inspiration. Their sound is primarily art and story driven. Each song stems from a particular concept, which affects the mood, sound and lyrics of the finished piece.\n\nIn order to create the right atmosphere for their first record, the band used a small home-studio in an old house in the hills outside of Vienna. The house sits directly in the woods and made its own impression on their first album.\n\nIn 2015 the trio decided to relocate to LA. December 2015 will see the release of HUNGER\u2019s first single, Gravity. Gravity is the second story in a trilogy of three connected music videos. Though it was difficult for Daniel, Johannes and Lucas to choose their first single \u2013 \u201cWe just had the feeling that this story and this track is the right thing to release first. This song is very special to us, it is very poppy but at the same time super dark, epic and painful\u2026this song represents the whole project.\u201d\n\nGet \"Gravity\" on iTunes now: http://hyperurl.co/Gravity-Single", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "64 N 9th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249", "Artist": "Smooth Hound Smith", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8558599.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.95987, 40.720886], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Soul, AMERICAN ROOTS MUSIC, Blues, Folk", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Rough Trade NYC", "moreBioInfo": "Smooth Hound Smith is a foot stompin' American roots duo comprised of \"one-man-band\" Zack Smith (guitars/vocals/foot drums/harmonicas/banjo) and Caitlin Doyle (vocals/percussion).

Using primal foot percussion, complex, fuzzed-out, finger-picked guitar patterns, warbled harmonicas, tasty harmonies and A LOT of tambourine, they are able to create something rugged and visceral- a modern interpretation of early blues, soul, and rock 'n' roll music that harkens back to the traditions of hazy front porch folk songs as well as raucous back-alley juke joints.\n\nThe duo has traveled over 150,000 road miles, playing over 800 shows across America, Europe, and Canada, all in the last five years. In addition to their own headlining shows, they have toured as support for bands such as the Dixie Chicks (25 dates in the US and Canada in 2016/2017), The Record Company, and Jamestown Revival.\n\nTheir eponymous debut album garnered attention from media outlets such as Nashville's independent radio, WRLT Lightning 100, as well as publications like American Songwriter and RELIX Magazine.

What brought the three together in their teens is the common sense of optimism that hard work, good ideas and flawless execution can lead American citizens of any race, creed or class to reach their dreams.\n\nThe band integrates elements of hip-hop, rock and go-go music to concoct an original sound influenced by their personal histories. Each member of the band was raised in a different version of the immigrant\u2019s tale to find a better life on American soil. Pierre Desrosiers a/k/a King Green (vocals) is the son of Haitian immigrants from the 1970s. Andrei Busuioceanu a/k/a Gold (bass) arrived in America when he was 5 from Romania. Marcus Parham a/k/a Red (guitars) is an African-American raised as a global citizen attending high school in Ghana and living extensively overseas.

Simple while funky. Classic but contemporary. Straightforward in the way it breaks down complex ideas and genres. And, at the end of the day, undeniably human. That said, it isn't quite a rebirth for the Nashville-born artist, who after stints living in New York and Los Angeles has returned back home to Music City. She's long had that lithe and smoky voice and an intensely expressive mastery over the piano. For those paying attention, Kandace's second album finds her unleashing what was there all along, all at once, for the first time.\n\nFor Kandace it boils down to a question that connects past to present: \u201cWhat would Nina Simone do if she had the technology of today? You could never put Nina in a box\u2014she would do a blues followed a classical piece, a jazz standard and then a Beatles cover. This LP took a lot of inspiration from that\u2014it\u2019s a mix of everything that I am.\u201d Indigo offers a fairly plausible answer to that impossible query: songs that swirl classical composition with quiet-storm cool, jazz poise with hip-hop swing, tropical warmth with soulful depth, and earthen groove with airy psych. With all but two of the tracks here produced by the mighty drummer-producer Karriem Riggins\u2014the living bridge spanning Oscar Peterson and Diana Krall to Erykah Badu and J Dilla\u2014Indigo creates a vibe as familiar as it is previously unheard.\n\nTake \u201cIndigo Part 1,\u201d and \u201cIndigo Part 2,\u201d a pair of interludes that give the album its title, where allusions\u2014Rachmaninoff, Portishead, Sade\u2014emerge and melt into the liquid soundscape. It feels like magic. And then there's \u201cDon\u2019t Need The Real Thing\u201d with a breezy dancehall beat that'd sound at home in today's Top 40, except far more musical and almost hypnotic in its combination of plaintive bass and busy percussion. Kandace\u2019s versatility is underscored when one juxtaposes \u201cBreakdown,\u201d a pop ballad stunner that Kandace co-wrote with the track\u2019s producer Jamie Hartman (Rag'n'Bone Man), and \u201cUnsophisticated,\u201d a sultry jazz ballad that features Roy Hargrove's trumpet playfully intertwined with Kandace's voice and keys.\n\nAsk our heroine how Indigo became the name of the entire project and she replies, with an air of mystery, \u201cThe album is an exotic flower, its own kind.\u201d The more you listen, the more that makes sense. In fact, she could be describing herself.\n\nKandace grew up the bi-racial daughter of a soul singer in a country-western town. Her dad Scat Springs had his own band but also sang backup for an incredible array of musicians: Brian McKnight, Chaka Khan, Aretha Franklin, Michael McDonald, Donna Summer. He did voices on Nashville radio too, while Kandace's mother had a full-time gig raising three talented daughters at home. Kandace's first passions were drawing and cars. \u201cMy dad gave me a Matchbox muscle car and my mom gave me a Barbie,\u201d she says. \u201cI drew a mustache on Barbie and never played with her again. I still have the Matchbox.\u201d\n\nShe collects, rebuilds, and resells cars to this day, but her plans to one day study automotive design were put on hold at age 10 when Scat brought home an upright piano (side note: Kandace still plans to pursue her dream of going to automotive school one day). She couldn't leave the keys alone, and soon mom started taking her to lessons, while dad let her tag along to sessions and led his own three-girl choir in the living room. \u201cHe'd make us do hymns but we hated it,\" Kandace laughs. \"We'd be singing and crying at the same time.\u201d\n\nHer father instilled in Kandace a love of the greats\u2014Nina of course, but also Ella Fitzgerald, Eva Cassidy, Luther Vandross\u2014and eventually they grew closer than ever through music. He helped her record a demo at 15 and got it into the hands of the production team Evan Rogers and Carl Sturken, who have written hits for the likes of Shakira, Christina Aguilera, and Kelly Clarkson, and are best known for discovering Rihanna as a teen and signing her to their production company SRP. They offered Kandace a deal but it was too much, too soon. \u201cMy dad said, \u2018If you sign with these guys, I'll never get the chance to make an album with you,\u2019\u201d says Kandace. \u201cI'm so glad I waited.\u201d She and Scat made that album when she was 17 and though it was never released, a piece of it appears on Indigo. Scat suffered a stroke in early 2017 that rendered him unable to sing, so she pulled one of his original vocals from their record and set it to new music. Powered by her signature Rhodes electric piano, \u201cSimple Things\u201d is the beating heart of this LP.\n\nWhen the time came, Evan and Carl got Kandace into Blue Note Records to audition for president Don Was. She performed a Bonnie Raitt song that he'd originally produced, and he was sold. Her 2014 self-titled EP found her teaming with cutting-edge hitmakers like Pop & Oak and won her late-night TV appearances on Letterman, Kimmel and Fallon, plus sets at festivals like Bonnaroo and Afropunk. Her 2016 full-length Soul Eyes took a different tack. Grown, stripped, and refined, it was essentially a live album\u2014solid, unfussy bedrock for future experimentation. All that history, and the fact that she featured on a couple Ghostface Killah cuts, made Karriem exactly the right person to work with Kandace to catalyze the best parts of various interests into something new.\n\n\u201cI love crossing genres and the direction on Indigo was to marry all the different things to tell her story,\u201d says Karriem, who tracked his drums at various studios while on the road with Krall, and chopped and reassembled his and Kandace's recordings into what you hear. \u201cIt sounds organic because everything was built around the songwriting. She says so much on the piano, and her voice is amazing\u2014it's the focal point of the whole sound. I kept it simple, added a little punch.\u201d\n\nKandace also co-wrote several songs with her longtime collaborators Evan and Carl including \u201cPiece of Me\u201d which finds Kandace channeling Sade to stunning effect. The three also wrote \u201cFix Me\u201d together, taking inspiration from Chopin\u2019s Prelude No. 4, and the groovy lament \u201cLove Sucks\u201d which was produced by Evan and Carl along with the UK\u2019s Jimmy Hogarth (Amy Winehouse, Corinne Bailey Rae).\n\nSome of Indigo's greatest songs are its most unadorned: \u201cBlack Orchid\u201d highlights the acoustic strum of guitarist-songwriter Jesse Harris (who struck Grammy gold with Kandace's early hero Norah Jones by penning her breakout hit \u201cDon\u2019t Know Why\u201d); a cover of The Stylistics' \u201cPeople Make the World Go Round\u201d drifts languidly over Karriem\u2019s drum programming; the remake of Gabriel Garz\u00f3n-Montano's \u201cSix Eight\u201d is molasses slow and crystalline pretty; and the Roberta Flack-popularized torch song \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\u201d (a crowd favorite at Kandace\u2019s live shows) radiates light from the white space between notes. That one was special for Kandace. \u201cPrince picked it for me to play for Purple Rain's 30th anniversary at Paisley Park in 2014,\u201d she says. \u201cHis band played behind me. He stood off to the right. It's something I'll never forget.\u201d That was Kandace's first big break. The legendary artist saw her on YouTube before she'd released a single note and invited her out. It's testament, again, to the power and potential that's been in Kandace this whole time.\n\nIf you listen closely, you'll hear a nod to Prince in the lyrics of \u201cFix Me,\u201d but the best tribute she could pay to him, Ms. Simone, and the humble legacy of the man who introduced her to music, her father, is by, as Karriem words it, \u201ccreating something that adds to the art form.\u201d With Indigo, an album that couldn't have been made by anyone but her, Kandace Springs does exactly that.\n\nFor more information contact Cem Kurosman at Blue Note Records\n(p) 212.786.8634 (e) cem.kurosman@umusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "217 E Houston St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Oxymorrons", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6731806.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.986751, 40.722165], "Date": "Thu Mar 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-12", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative Hip-Hop, Rock Music, Alterative Rock", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Mercury Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "Oxymorrons began as a collaboration between Queens-bred brothers, K.I. and Deee, who joined forces to cultivate a sound that modern music can no longer turn its back on.

Renowned for his DJ skills which have seen him tour all over the world, from Japan to Australia, to Dubai to North America and all over Europe, J:Kenzo also hosts a monthly show on London's Rinse FM showcasing his taste in everything underground. His self titled debut album was released in September 2012 on the Tempa label with great anticipation, some say providing the antidote to the then overly brash commercial Dubstep sound. Deep underground tones, stripped back beats, smoky atmospherics with haunting keys and melodies providing the flavour throughout. Kenzo's output has been consistent with releases and features on classic labels such as Metalheadz and Exit Records as well as a string of singles and EP's for foundational dubstep label Tempa.

The band, with Connie now splitting lead vocals duties with Frank, brings us their debut full length Our City. Spending the better part of 2016 in the studio, these new songs show a band\nleaning heavily on 90's inspired indie rock and alternative while digging deep, getting personal and moving beyond the twee nature of the three quarter time signature.\n\nSelf recorded, engineered and produced by Frank at Tampa's Atomic Audio, calling the album 'more rock' would simply be an understatement. Our City definitely lands subtle jabs with songs like the surfy hometown homage title track and the punchy murder ballad \u201cGet Yours\u201d while occasionally keeping their waltz-y roots planted with \u201cBattles\u201d.

It\u2019s impossible to get bored when the band never stops moving, and when that combines with a smooth, easy sound, Our City is helping me close out the summer in the best possible way.\"\n- Indieentry\n\n\"There\u2019s something unexplainably listenable to their sound, it\u2019s just very easy to digest.

After stints on The Voice Season 4, honing his craft on Vancouver-based cruise ships, and sharing the stage with Justin Bieber, this vocalist and multi-instrumentalist has created a sound of his own.\n\nAnd after playing over 300 shows in 2014 and continuing that streak into 2015, he\u2019s building a fanbase for his loop-based performances and unique style. Often performing a mix of originals and covers, Liberio looks beyond Top 40 and searches for songs both new and old that have the same feel. He also knows his strengths, and blends these songs to fit his aesthetic while maintaining the [core] of each song. An avid music listener, he enjoys blending genres and describes his music as \u201cAdele meets EDM with a hip hop beat\u201d.\n\nLiberio is now known for using a loop pedal and building a band around himself, but it wasn\u2019t always that way. After building a band for a gig but the players not working out long-term, he took inspiration from Ed Sheeran\u2019s approach to a live show. He bought a loop pedal and began learning how to integrate it into his gigs, often sharing with concert-goers how he builds his backing band: himself.\n\nTaking inspiration from a wide variety of musicians and songwriters has helped Liberio create his unique sound. Artists like Billy Joel, Whitney Houston, Chris Cornell, and Adam Levine have inspired him in different ways, and he\u2019s used that to write music that stands out.\n\nHe\u2019s currently working on an EP of originals, \u201cDichotomy\u201d, that he is producing himself. It will feature primarily new music, but also some older music that he\u2019s previously never produced. 2016 will also feature playing multiple shows a week, sometimes with a full band and sometimes continuing his loop-based solo show.\n\nJ. Liberio is the example of a singer/songwriter with the drive, passion, and work ethic it takes to be seen in a busy music landscape. \u201cDichotomy\u201d is described as \u201ca division or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different\u201d, which is how Liberio has created his music to stand out.\n\nConnect with him on Soundcloud, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "140 Merrick Rd, Amityville, NY 11701", "Artist": "Afterburn", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8929523.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.4175, 40.6712], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Hard Rock", "Time": "5:30 PM", "Venue": "Revolution Bar & Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Formed in 2009, AFTERBURN has a sound and story unlike any other modern rock band.

I've done things my whole life that some people would tell me weren't appropriate 'for a girl'.\u201d That narrative that once tore Dirks down is now what empowers her to take charge of her own story, in her own way.\n\nThe Winnipeg-based Dirks is a Juno Award winner with her former group Chic Gamine. While she thrived off of the collaboration, once the band broke up she knew she was ready to go solo. Even though she was terrified to go out on her own, that feeling was a fundamental factor to positively reinforce that the path she was on was the correct one.\n\nAs Begonia, Dirks is bold, brazen with her florid, surprising pop that is tempered with sensitivity and wisdom. Dirks' first solo output with her 2017 debut EP, Lady in Mind, was well-received, being listed on NPR\u2019s 10 Artists You Need To Know in 2017 and \u201cJuniper\u201d reached #1 on the CBC Music Charts in 2017. Noisey wrote that, \u201cBegonia has one of Canada\u2019s most extraordinary voices, and thankfully she uses it to obliterate the misery from this world one live performance at a time.\u201d NPR wrote that Begonia is \u201cthe place where where synth-pop meets old soul and scrappy meets sexy.\"\n\nBegonia\u2019s songwriting style is largely autobiographical. \u201cThere\u2019s always some element of me in these songs whether I like it or not,\u201d she says bluntly. She gets to the heart of her subject matter, whether it\u2019s learning to come into her own or confronting and processing a brutal heartbreak. Dirks\u2019 intimate lyrics and audacious pop style sound allows for her audience to relate to the messiness of life with an honesty that is refreshing.\n\nWith Begonia\u2019s debut full length album entitled 'Fear' expected next year, Dirks\u2019 leans hard into a sense of arrival. Dirks wrote and co-produced the record with a familiar team: Matt Schellenberg and Matt Petters of Royal Canoe, along with Marcus Paquin, who has previously worked with The National, Stars, Arcade Fire, Local Natives, to name a few.\n\nBegonia forms a special kind of musical translucence. A transparency of learning to unlearn some of the parts Dirks didn\u2019t care to have, the ones she wanted to hold onto and nourish, and how that relationship can inform her music. On her latest single \u201cThe Light,\u201d Dirks sings over soulful swells, her vocals curving around the notes of the song and making them explode as she bluntly tells us \u201chang up the phone and scream your name/ again, again/but I like the pain.\u201d Who among us hasn\u2019t wanted to rage and yell and yet curl into and find comfort in the things that brought us pain? Begonia explores the nuances of such heartfelt emotional experiences.\n\nLooking back doesn\u2019t often mean regret or remorse; mourning the version of you that\u2019s no longer there. It may mean paying tribute to the mistakes, failures, and triumphs. Begonia is a celebration for the arrival of the person Dirks has become both personally and professionally; showing that some things can\u2019t be contained, no matter how much, and that fundamentally they shouldn\u2019t be either.", "otherInfo": "The Bowery Electric: Main Room\n\n6:45pm: Kyoto Love Hotel (IE)\n\n7:30pm: Honey Cutt (US)\n\n8:15pm: Pom Poko (NO)\n\n9pm: False Heads (UK)\n\n9:45pm: Thud (HK)\n\n10:30pm: Begonia (CA)"}, {"Address": "146 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "James Supercave", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9529203.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.963479, 40.7101], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Soul, Rock Alternative, Indie, Alternative, indie-pop, Psychadelic Pop, Psych Pop", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Baby's All Right", "moreBioInfo": "ALARM WILL SOUND - out everywhere now!\n\nhttps://www.jamessupercave.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "95 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Deep Sea Peach Tree", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.988383, 40.721329], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Arlene's Grocery", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "New Colossus x BIRP.FM Presents: Go Hawaii, Courrier Sud, Luke De-Scisico, Deep Sea Peach Tree, Marble Arch and Bodywash at Arlene's Grocery"}, {"Address": "25 Avenue A, New York City, NY 10009", "Artist": "Tim Burgess", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8263503.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.985959, 40.722966], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Alternative", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Berlin Under A", "moreBioInfo": "Tim Burgess (born Timothy Allan Burgess on May 30, 1967, in Salford, Lancashire, England) is the lead singer of British rock/indie act The Charlatans.

Favorite musste daraufhin einen Gro\u00dfteil seiner Jugend in Waisenh\u00e4usern verbringen und wurde nat\u00fcrlich durch diese Zeit sehr beeinflusst. Er musste sich alleine durchschlagen und sammelte viele Erfahrungen, die ihn gepr\u00e4gt haben.\n\nIn dieser Zeit kam auch der erste Kontakt mit Rapmusik zustande. Er merkte schnell, dass er einfach rappen muss und so entstanden im Alter von 15 Jahren seine ersten Texte und Aufnahmen.\n\n\u00dcber Umwege geriet Favorites Demotape 2004 an Slick One, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt gerade mit der Gr\u00fcndung von Selfmade Records besch\u00e4ftigt war. Sofort war er von dem Talent, der ausdrucksvollen Stimme und dem Rapstil des damals 18j\u00e4hrigen beeindruckt und somit wurde Favorite der erste Newcomer, der fest zu Selfmade Records geh\u00f6rte.\n\nNach dem Einstand mit dem Track \u201eRuhrpott 4 Life\u201c auf dem Schwarzes Gold Sampler machte sich Favorite an das Album mit seinem Rapkollegen Jason, welches im Oktober 2005 unter dem Titel \u201eRappen kann t\u00f6dlich sein\u201c \u00fcber Selfmade Records erschien und f\u00fcr einen Einstand nach Ma\u00df sorgte.

We are all grateful for the opportunity to get to travel the globe and do what we love to do while also getting to tell others about the amazing gift of salvation that we have from God through His son Jesus. What an honor.\n\nWe started at the University of Mobile in Mobile, AL We have been to all 50 states in the last 19 years and have made many friends along the way. We love being able to share with others the calling that we have to encourage others and share with them the gift of Salvation we have been given in Christ.\n\nHere is the professional bio:\n\nTruly compelling music makes the personal universal. Few artists have done that more consistently or more movingly than Big Daddy Weave. Through more than a decade of hits like \"In Christ,\u201d \u201cAudience of One,\u201d \"You're Worthy Of My Praise,\" \u201cEvery Time I Breathe,\u201d What Life Would Be Like,\u201d and \u201cYou Found Me,\u201d they have shared the journey in a way that has won the ongoing respect of fans, press and industry alike. Their musical journey began with a Dove Awards nomination as New Artist of the Year in 2002 and includes a 2010 Dove Award for the album Christ Has Come. They have been honored at ASCAP's Christian Music Awards, were chosen for the WOW Hits compilations in five of the last six years and are one of the 10 most played artists at Christian radio over the past decade.\n\nMost recently, they hit the top of the Christian AC chart - the fourth time they've done so - with \"Love Come To Life,\" a song about the desire to have the love that Christ put in our hearts be more than words that we say, but a love that comes to life in actions. A song filled with passion and intimacy, and with the musical hooks and majestic sound that have marked so much of their work, it is the perfect introduction to Love Come To Life, their first studio album in more than three years.\n\nLove Come To Life demonstrates once again the passion and energy that have made Big Daddy Weave one of Christian music's most compelling acts for nearly a dozen years. True to form, the project teems with real life and emotion, from longing and struggle to breakthrough and gratitude, with front man Mike Weaver's forthright songwriting and intimate and unmistakable vocals backed by powerful arrangements and stellar musicianship. It derives its power from the fact that life and music intertwine so fully.\n\n\"We've faced a lot of personal challenges and adversity during the past couple of years,\" says Mike, \"Coming to the other side of that leaves us with fresh things to share, and in a place where we can share even more deeply than ever before.\" Those challenges, from the fatigue faced at times by musicians who spend much of their time on the road, to a devastating fire that swept through guitarist/producer Jeremy Redmon's house and studio, and health issues faced by some band members, produced a record that reflects two sides of the Christian life.\n\n\"You've got the ones I term the belly-achers,\" says Mike with a laugh. \"Those are the hurting songs, which are way outnumbered by what came after that, the songs that say, 'We can't wait to worship God because we see even in tragedy, God, You are triumphant.'\"\n\nThe bridge between the two was a spiritual breakthrough Mike felt about a year into the process of writing for the project.\n\n\"I was really at a low point,\" he says, \"struggling with my imperfections. I was in my garage; my man cave where I work out. I felt like God said to my spirit, 'Why don't you let me tell you what I think about you and what I like about you?' He started with, 'I love your heart for people,' and went from there. I was like a broken heap on the floor of my garage. The things he was talking about are not future tense things like a lot of people, the I think 'If I could get to this point and look like this and achieve that I would be all right.' He has this 'I love who you are right now' mentality. 'I accept you right now. You need to accept you right now.' At that point, I couldn't write from that hurting place anymore. I thought, 'I've got to worship now.'\"\n\nThe result is that songs like the title track and \"Save My Life,\" a song Mike describes as \"gut-level honesty,\" give way to others like \"Magnificent God,\" whose spirit of worship is set amid a sound both intimate and majestic; \"Jesus Move,\" a passionate call for Jesus' power to flow into believers written with Phil Wickham; \"Different Light,\" a rocker that celebrates the way faith rewrites even the most troubled past; and \"If You Died Tonight,\" a tenderly insistent request to a friend to consider ultimate truths.\n\n\"This is a record that's a lot more transparent,\" says drummer Jeff Jones. \"It's one that all of us are super excited about. We can give it to people and say, 'This is what God has been doing in our lives.\"\n\nIn fact, the band's own breakthrough, born of a renewed emphasis on personal ministry at their concerts, is part in the record's feel.\n\n\"God has a plan with all of this stuff,\" says Jeremy, \"and maybe it took that extra time and our journey as a band to really bring these songs to life. There have been big changes over the last couple of tours as we've allowed more time for ministry. It's been a season of growth and change for all of us, and the fact that Mike was able to write with worship leaders like Phil, Carl Cartee and Paul Baloche really helped bring all of that into focus for the record.\"\n\nAs always, Jeremy's production is key in bringing the songs to life.\n\n\"We approached each song with a question,\" he says. \"'Where can we take this that will make this sonically a new experience, something we haven't done before.' And I hope the way we did that will open up new ears to our music.\u201d\n\nThat meeting of life and music has been part and parcel of Big Daddy Weave's appeal since their days. Formed at the University of Mobile, the quintet - Mike, his brother Jay, who plays bass, Jeremy, Jeff, and keyboardist/saxophonist Joe Shirk - released an independent album in 2001 and then landed a deal with Fervent Records, their label home ever since. \"One and Only,\" the title track from their first Fervent album, debuted in SoundScan's Christian Top 5 and remained in the Top 20 for six weeks. \"In Christ\" peaked at #2, stayed for 24 weeks on R&R's AC chart, earned a spot on the Dove Hits album, and became one of ASCAP's most-performed songs of 2002 - a milestone also achieved by \"Audience of One\" in 2003. Then, Hurricane Ivan in 2004 damaged several band members' Florida homes and led to Mike's relocation to Nashville. The fact that the move led to Mike's marriage to a Fervent staffer still leaves him shaking his head.\n\n\"Even in the bad times, he's working it out,\" he says with a laugh.\n\nThe band has always kept a busy touring schedule and in fact often recorded parts of their early albums in hotel rooms, \"literally using the turned-up mattress and box springs as sound baffles to record vocals,\" Mike says. The fact that those records touched lives and earned chart success is evident in their recent hits package, The Ultimate Collection.\n\n\"That was some closure in a way,\" says Mike. \"We are thankful for those years, but in as much as we're seeing the things God has done, we are very full of vision for the future and in so many ways it just feels brand new to us right now.\"\n\nWhich is something reflected as the band hits the road with songs from Love Come To Life.\n\n\"We can go forward united as a band,\" says Jay. \"We had been struggling to find balance as family men, touring musicians, and people following the Lord. But the Lord has given us healing and blessed us with being able to find the balance in him. It's been amazing to see God do that in us.\"\n\n\"We are excited about the album,\" adds Joe, \"and I think fans are going to love it. It's an opportunity to point to something way bigger than the band, to the body of believers working together, bringing glory to the Lord. I tell pastors that Big Daddy Weave is the best church I've ever been a part of. When they raise their eyebrows, I say, 'Yeah, I spend more time in fellowship with these guys than any church members spend together. This is the church of the 45-foot bus going down whatever road it is today. It's the fellowship of my Christian brothers.\"\n\n\"This is as much a real family as anything else,\" says Mike. \"The work that God has done in our band makes it all new again because of our sense of purpose, not just to make music but to be used of God. And that's the bottom line--what God wants us to do with this.\"", "otherInfo": "Get your tickets to the Big Daddy Weave \"When the Light Comes\" Tour featuring Bethel Music's Paul and Hannah McClure!"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Sonya Vai", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7467570.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988348, 40.735421], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Upstairs at The Stand", "moreBioInfo": "Sonya Vai fan page", "otherInfo": "Funny Tikka Masala NYC (Hinglish Show)!"}, {"Address": "108 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Ice Cream", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9187839.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98981, 40.718722], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Experimental, Pop, Alternative, Post Punk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "MOSCOT", "moreBioInfo": "Since 2014, Toronto duo Carlyn Bezic and Amanda Crist have been sending pulses through the underground as Ice Cream.

There, she finds parallels for what she wants to say, channels that inspiration into her lyrics and comes up with something unique: Music that\u2019s immediate and timeless, driven by feelings all listeners can relate to yet infused with a perspective that transcends the present.\n\n\u201cI have a song called \u2018Story\u2019 on my new album,\u201d she explains, referencing Letterbox, scheduled for release in the spring of 2017 on Curb Records. \u201cIt brings in a lot of epic characters: Heathcliff and Catherine from Wuthering Heights, Hector\u2019s wife Andromache from The Iliad. I\u2019ve always loved epic stories \u2014 Anna Karenina, The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment \u2014 because they\u2019re filled with relationships that are super serious and dramatic. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m right there in the midst of them.\u201d\n\nYet Letterbox is no droning lecture on literature. It\u2019s a celebration of freedom. Miller has paid plenty of dues to get to the point where she feels she can write what she wants how she wants to, and sing without constraint. Still young, she has survived years in the music business. She impacted initially with the infectious, \u201cYou\u2019re Not Alone.\u201d More than 115,000 downloaded that single on Amazon. ABC\u2019s Dancing with the Stars featured her second single, \u201c6\u20192,\u201d in 2014.\n\nThat\u2019s a success story for sure, one that Miller is grateful to have had. Still, she realized that this was only the first of many steps she needed to take to achieve her goals.\n\nMuch more than literature feeds into Miller\u2019s unfettered performance on Letterbox. First and most enduring is the foundation she received from being born into a family that loved and performed music. They gravitated toward bluegrass and cultivated Marie\u2019s obvious talent through lessons with banjo virtuoso Murphy Henry. Around age 12 she began singing with her family and later with her sister as a duo, appearing at churches, festivals, community picnics and, every Saturday, on the porch of the winery her father and a partner had opened in rural Virginia, across the road from the Miller family home.\n\nMiller also began writing songs when she was about 12 years old. \u201cThe first one I started performing was an original melody and lyrics based on a poem I\u2019d read in Lord of the Rings,\u201d she says, with a grin. \u201cI was really into American music at the time \u2014 the kind of music you\u2019d hear in a Ken Burns documentary, the people\u2019s music, the storytelling of bluegrass and Irish music. I was attracted initially to the New Grass artists, like Nickel Creek and Alison Krauss and mainly Chris Thile. She pauses and then laughs, a little embarrassed. \u201cI was actually 100 percent certain when I was 14 that Chris Thile and I were going to get married someday.\u201d Miller then found herself diving into the lyrics and melodies from the likes of The Eagles to Stevie Wonder to modern hitmaker Sara Bareilles. This wide range of influences impacted her music making when she signed with Curb Records in Nashville at the age of 16 where she fulfilled her dream to write songs. \u201cI began my life as a traveling musician then,\u201d she says. \u201cI love performing, but it was so uncomfortable to be 16 or 17 and have everybody telling me what to do. I remember one time five people criticized what I was wearing. When you\u2019re 17 years old you\u2019re uncomfortable with yourself already, so to have a bunch of old people talk to you about your clothes, it was just really weird.\u201d\nDiscouraged, Miller returned to Virginia. She took time off from music, went to college for a while, but kept practicing and writing. With a new confidence, she eventually went back to Nashville. Before long she had made her mark in music. And from there, we come to this pivotal moment in her story.\n\nWorking with producers Eric Rosse (Sara Bareillis, Tory Amos) and Chad Capelin, Miller moved decisively into a new creative milieu with Letterbox. Begin with the title. \u201cIt\u2019s from the Beatles\u2019 song \u2018Across the Universe,\u2019\u201d she points out, and then sings the John Lennon lyric: \u201cThoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox.\u201d\n\nWhy do these words speak to her? \u201cI still write letters to my friends and to my grandparents and to my boyfriends ... when I have them,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered that sometimes, when you want to say something, you just can\u2019t. It\u2019s too awkward. So Letterbox is about how I love to write letters but it\u2019s also radically relational, about friendships, parents, a child or romance. It\u2019s about how we affect each other as people.\u201d\n\nMiller describes the songs on Letterbox as \u201calmost literal letters to people in my life. \u2018Glitter Gold,\u2019 \u2018Boardwalk\u2019 and \u2018Angeline\u2019 are like letters you leave on someone\u2019s doorstep \u2014 teenage, broken-heart messages. \u2018More\u2019 is a letter that you never sent. \u2019Stones You Throw\u2019 is about how the world feels ripples from every little thing we say or do, whether we like it or not. We live constantly in the ripples of other people\u2019s actions, whether they\u2019re from love or hatred.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s exultant first single, \u201cThis Side of Paradise,\u201d which Miller describes as \u201chopeful and daring\u201d ... the promise to wait, in the language of many a folk song, for \u201cthe day that I see my own true love again\u201d on \u201cLonely Ends\u201d ... compelling imagery, vocals that whisper and soar, from a lover \u201cLost at Sea\u201d ... Every moment on Letterbox rings true and lingers afterwards, like a memory or a passage from a favorite book.\n\nThis is the true Marie Miller, breathing in all that life has to offer and crafting it with her own sense of hope, wonder and enchantment.\n\nAnd, in case you\u2019re wondering, \u201cNow, if people tell me what to wear or what to say, I just totally ignore them.\u201d\n\nShe laughs out loud. It feels good to be free. It feels good to share that freedom through music. With Letterbox, we savor it all, as if delivered to us alone, from a friend not so far away.", "otherInfo": "Marie Miller - Rockwood Stage 3"}, {"Address": "318 W 53rd St, New York City, NY 10009", "Artist": "Cory Johnson", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.985669, 40.764451], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Broadway Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Enjoy a line-up of comics: Ron Barba, Cory Johnson, Evan Hernandez, Jack O'Funny, Anthony Fella, Madi Sacks, Greg Cantone, Mike Lucido!"}, {"Address": "198 Broadway, Amityville, NY 11701", "Artist": "Pathology", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8983032.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.41742, 40.67899], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Death Metal, Brutal Death Metal", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Amityville Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "PATHOLOGY is epitomized as the ultimate death metal assault to the ears.

Roman Rene Ramirez was born in Fremont, California on June 11, 1988, and he began playing guitar at the age of 11. In his teens, Ramirez began working with local bands, and Sublime became one of Ramirez's favorite acts (as well as Muse, Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, and the Bad Brains). Ramirez was well familiar with Sublime's body of work when a friend who worked at a recording studio introduced him to Eric Wilson, the group's bassist. Wilson invited Ramirez to jam with him on some Sublime songs, and then organized another session with Ramirez and Wilson joined by drummer Bud Gaugh. Wilson and Gaugh were impressed enough with Ramirez that they invited him to join them in a new edition of the group, and Sublime with Rome made its debut in 2009 at Cypress Hill's Smokeout Festival in San Bernardino, California. Ramirez was soon touring steadily with Sublime with Rome, and in 2010 he co-wrote and sang the song \"Lay Me Down\" with the band the Dirty Heads, which rose to the top of Billboard's Alternative Songs chart. In 2011, Sublime with Rome headed into the studio and released an album of new material, Yours Truly, which was released by indie punk label Fueled by Ramen; later that same year, Bud Gaugh retired from the group, with Josh Freese signing on as the trio's new drummer. The following year, Rome released his first solo EP, Dedication (also released by Fueled by Ramen), and he also guested on the 2012 album by the Dirty Heads, Cabin by the Sea. The year 2013 proved to be a busy one for Ramirez; he contributed songwriting and guitar work on Selena Gomez's album Stars Dance, collaborated with Enrique Iglesias on a pair of singles", "otherInfo": "Sometimes you just got to grab your guitar, pack a bag, and hit the road!\n\nMy Super Buddy, Duddy B, and I are embarking on a month-long tour next spring.\n\nFrom coast to coast, we'll be playing some of your favorite songs and some collaborative Jam Sessions!\n\nI'll also be performing some new material off an upcoming EP release.

It is about wanting to escape everyday life while also craving time with one who\u2019s present. It\u2019s a plea to remain the same in the face of constant change, and the certainty of going nowhere fast.\u201d Written after playing nearly 200 shows over two years in support of their 2017 album, Popular Manipulations, The Districts\u2019 fourth full-length You Know I\u2019m Not Going Anywhere almost never arrived.\n\nAs they began to contemplate a new album, Grote and his longtime bandmates Pat Cassidy (guitar), Connor Jacobus (bass), and Braden Lawrence (drums) faced a transitional period that was painful for both personal and professional reasons, and found themselves fatigued and disoriented as a group. Grote also felt dysphoric from the anxiety-provoking state of the world today, while facing a daily battle with the dire health problems of his beloved dog. The Districts were forced to rethink everything. \u201cThis album was written as an escape and as reassurance. I was falling in love with someone new and trying to juggle this desperate desire to escape with the need to show up in my life. It\u2019s pretty damn hard to be present and completely checked out all at once,\u201d Grote explains. \u201cIt felt like much of my world had reached such a pitch that all I could do was try to tune it out. I felt really uncertain about the future of the band and super detached from much of what I used to identify with, on a personal level and with our music. I was thinking, \u2018Do I want to keep doing music?\u2019 \u2018Do I want to keep doing it in this context?\u2019\u201d\n\nGrote retreated to his bedroom and started writing with no objective other than to create. Free from expectations, and with an acoustic guitar, synthesizer, and drum machine at hand, he discovered a newfound creative freedom. \u201cOriginally, I had no intention of them even being a record. It was strictly a process of trying to connect to something outside of and larger than myself\u2014kind of this rocky imbalance of isolating myself while trying to maintain connections as time rushed on. There was a lot of back and forth between working as a group and not feeling capable of doing that,\u201d reflects Grote. \u201cI ended up taking these recordings super far along, whereas normally I would almost compulsively share them with my bandmates as soon as I had an idea. This time I was sitting on them and putting work into them in a way that I hadn\u2019t known I enjoyed doing.\u201d\n\nHe ended up with a batch of 32 songs; but, these songs didn\u2019t sound like \u2018The Districts.\u2019 Yet to his surprise, when Grote later played early demos for his bandmates, they loved them. Turns out these were Districts songs, and the Philadelphia-based band later decamped to a cabin in Red Hook, N.Y., where they recorded and produced the lion\u2019s share of the album themselves alongside frequent collaborator Keith Abrams.\n\nWhile You Know I\u2019m Not Going Anywhere builds on preceding albums, it takes an ambitious leap to a new level, exhibiting a widened sense of experimentation and expansiveness at its heart. There\u2019s Rhodes, Mellotron, strings, samples, drum machines, tape loops, Wurlitzer, \u201cambient swells,\u201d piano, synthesizers; Grote lists 12 instruments next to his name alone. Airy and understated, discordant and exuberant, and earnest all at once, You Know I\u2019m Not Going Anywhere is the culmination of The Districts\u2019 growth and maturation through milestones and setbacks alike.\n\nThe haunting, atmospheric opener \u201cMy Only Ghost\u201d is an ode to the secrets and memories we share with the ones we\u2019ve lost; the rapturous, pulsating \u201cVelour and Velcro\u201d is a love song about the unknown future we\u2019re all riding into; and the stripped-back \u201cDescend\u201d deals with death and separation. The songwriting sees Grote drawing a sort of spiritual comfort from music and creativity as he worked. Despite the song\u2019s dark undertones, the \u2018nihilist disco\u2019 of \u201cCheap Regrets\u201d finds The Districts as electrifying as ever. \u201cThe act of writing a song, trying to sculpt something out of the human experience, can feel quite vain. So do the extremes of American culture, which constantly reinforces the self. The mirror reconfirms you. It's all iPhones, selfies, and mirrors,\u201d says Grote. \u201cThis song is a criticism of the divisions that result from a self-oriented society and an attempt to transcend them, while simultaneously being an example of these very ideas. The song is the statue to the self; it is about itself.\u201d\n\nCredit also to Dave Fridmann (The Flaming Lips, Spoon, MGMT), whose mix expertly layered all of the elements into a cohesive whole. That\u2019s most obvious in the subtle, synth-laden psychedelia of album standout \u201cHey Jo,\u201d which floats on plucked guitars and Grote\u2019s airy vocals before kicking into a rousing, Wall Of Sound chorus where he tunefully repeats \u201cFuck my head.\u201d The song nods to Grote favorites like Lee Hazlewood and Harry Nilsson. \u201cAll of their arrangements are surreal in a way that\u2019s not relying on normal psychedelic things,\u201d he says.\n\nPulling from the propulsive Popular Manipulations, the jagged indie rock of 2015\u2019s A Flourish and a Spoil, and the rootsy vibe of their 2012 debut, Telephone, the band here followed their creative instincts every step of the way, resulting in their most sophisticated and adventurous record to date. \u201cI really just needed to be myself instead of being what someone else thought I should be, whether that was like some masculine bar-band singer or\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u201d Grote says, laughing. \u201cI just want to be myself, and I want to try and do that as best as I can. This record is paradoxically the most-Districts record ever with no intention of ever being one at all. It\u2019s about breaking free from how you\u2019re seen, always being yourself first and holding on to who you are\u2014but also about coming together as a whole and putting your 'self' aside. Doing all that, I\u2019ve realized, \u2018Oh, this is how I want to make music from now on!\u2019\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "271 W 119th St, New York, NY 10026", "Artist": "Daniel Gonzalez (drumiel)", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9579291.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.953174, 40.806126], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Latin, Jazz, Funk, R&B, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Room 623", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Lehcats\n\nLimited Capacity: Click on link\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/196140558134076"}, {"Address": "960 Brush Hollow Rd, Westbury, NY 11590", "Artist": "Martina McBride", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8232262.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.558438, 40.773391], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Country", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "NYCB Theatre At Westbury", "moreBioInfo": "Contemporary country singer Martina McBride rose to stardom in the late '90s, starting out with a more traditionalist approach and later moving into pop-friendlier territory. She was born Martina Mariea Schiff in Medicine Lodge, KS, in 1966 and discovered country music through her father, who led a local band called the Schifters. By her teen years, she was singing and playing keyboards with the Schifters, and after high school she gigged around Kansas with several different bands. She married soundman John McBride, and in 1990 the couple moved to Nashville, where John worked for artists like Charlie Daniels and Ricky Van Shelton; Martina, meanwhile, worked as a demo singer, and her husband produced her demo tape, which got her signed to RCA in 1991. Around the same time, John was hired as Garth Brooks' production manager, which helped land Martina an opening slot on tour with Brooks. Her debut album, The Time Has Come, was released in 1992, offering a set of songs indebted to traditional honky tonk and progressive-minded country-folk. The pop-inflected 1993 follow-up, The Way That I Am, was her commercial breakthrough, with the lead single \"My Baby Loves Me\" zooming up the country charts to the number two position. The affecting story-song \"Independence Day\" became something of a signature number, and another single, \"Life #9,\" also reached the Top Ten. McBride's 1995 follow-up, Wild Angels, gave her a second Top Five hit in \"Safe in the Arms of Love,\" and its title track became her first-ever number one single. 1997's Evolution became her first Top Ten country album, and the Jim Brickman duet \"Valentine\" not only went Top Ten, but crossed over to become her first big hit on the adult contemporary charts. Evolution went on to spawn two number two hits (\"Happy Girl\" and \"Whatever You Say\") and two number one hits (\"A Broken Wing\" and \"Wrong Again\"), and sold over two million copies, launching McBride into the top rank of country stardom. She issued a Christmas album in late 1998 and returned with a proper follow-up, Emotion, in 1999. Its lead single, \"I Love You,\" hit number one country and also crossed over to adult contemporary radio, and the follow-ups \"Love's the Only House,\" \"There You Are,\" and \"It's My Time\" were all successful as well (the first two also reached the Top Ten). 2001's Greatest Hits compilation was the first McBride album to top the country charts, and sold well enough to make the pop Top Five as well. It contained four new tracks, all of which were eventually released as singles; \"Blessed\" hit number one, and \"When God-Fearin' Women Get the Blues\" and \"Where Would You Be\" both reached the Top Ten. Martina from 2003 celebrated womanhood, while Timeless from 2005 was a collection of country classics; both became Top Ten album hits, the latter reaching number three.

They also incorporate symphonic elements into their sound. The past years, their melodies have taken much more melancholic turn and the sound is overall much darker.\n\nBiography\nInsomnium began to take shape during the bleak spring of 1997. In a quiet town of Joensuu, located in the easternmost part of Finland, four young men were forming a fierce metal band. From the beginning it was clear that this band would make music that was brutal and yet melodic, full of contrasts and changing atmospheres. They took what they regarded as the best aspects of their favourite bands and moulded these influences into a new kind of entity. The result was the marriage of melodic Scandinavian death metal and traditional Finnish tunes. Lyrics turned out to be sorrowful, dream-like tales of love and death that usually took place amidst the Finnish nature. Influences were taken from the Finnish folklore as well as the world literature.\n\nAfter two years of intensive training Insomnium made their first demo-cd, which received praises from all over the world. The second demo was made the following year and it gained a lot of attention as well. This time, record companies got interested, too. In the beginning of 2001 founding members, guitarist Ville Friman, drummer Markus Hirvonen and bassist/vocalist Niilo Sev\u00e4nen, attached a new guitarist, Ville V\u00e4nni to the band. Now Insomnium was stronger than ever and ready to rise to the next level. A deal with Candlelight was signed the same spring and recording of the first album began in the summer.\n\n- In the Halls of Awaiting - was released in April 2002 and it introduced a band that had evolved in many ways. The legacy of Scandinavian death metal was still the core of the music but new layers had appeared around it. There were more nuances and depth in the songs, and the music was more versatile and challenging than before. Progressive shades had crept into the songs, and in many ways the band had stepped aside from the mainstream of melodic death metal. Debut album received excellent reviews in many magazines around the globe, especially in Germany, Finland and North America. The recording of the second album began in summer 2003. The process was somewhat painful but finally in December the new album was ready. - Since the Day It All Came Down - continues the development that the first album began. Songs are more versatile and surprising, progressive influences are ever clearer. Some tracks may even be described as experimental. But the straightforward side of the music hasn\u00b4t gone anywhere, since catchy guitar-harmonies, crushing riffs and soothing acoustic interludes are all still there. Melodies are still the most essential element in the music of Insomnium, but this time the tunes are even more melancholic and wistful than on the debut album. This is a sad and dreary album, heavier and gloomier than the first one, and undoubtedly more challenging. So when you take this path, keep in mind that it takes a while before your eyes get used to the dark...\n\n..And darker it got. With their third release, - Above The Weeping World -, the music got more agressive, harder, louder and the progressive elements grew once again. The first European tour is over, and Insomnium is once again a step closer to world domination.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.insomnium.net", "otherInfo": "Accessible accommodations should purchase a General Admission ticket and will be taken care of at the venue day of event."}, {"Address": "39-20 27th St, Long Island City, NY 11101", "Artist": "Coby James", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9197361.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.936936, 40.75353], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Evangel Church", "moreBioInfo": "Upon first listen to the debut single \u201cParadise\u201d, new artist, Coby James, showcases the instincts and song craft of a seasoned veteran.

The secret of this success lies within 2 basic characteristics: 1) an amazing roster of musicians and 2) Brian's ideals of having fun with the audience instead of performing to the audience. As other bands come and go, Brian Kirk & The Jirks continually set the standard with tons of experience while thinking outside of the box.\n\nBehind the flashing lights, photoshopped pictures, and fashion trends lies the foundation of live shows: good music. This is where The Jirks shine. Brian has enlisted an all star cast of musicians that play with maturity, originality, accuracy, and pure love of the art form. Along with Brian is the incredible singing of David Pershan & Kristin Grassi and backed by thick vocal harmonies and multiple instrumentation including a 3 piece horn section. BK&J have the ability to play an extremely diverse repertoire of songs complete with killer solos and great groove. This allows the band to walk into virtually any situation and play what's needed, whether it be rock, funk, pop, hip hop, swing, jazz, oldies, or modern songs. Whatever the style, Brian Kirk & The Jirks play it and play it well!\n\nOn top of this musical foundation is a weapon no one else has: Brian Kirk himself! With his hilarious antics and infectious personality, Brian has been gaining fans for almost 20 years! Constant audience interaction is what it's all about with him and this sets Brian apart from most front men. Another unique technique he uses is not writing a set list. Instead Brian calls songs based on the crowd in front of him and more importantly from requests he gets. Fans are treated more like friends and not just spectators. The audience is part of the show and this allows a stronger bond between the band and its fans.\n\nThe diversity, originality, and basic know how of such a seasoned band makes Brian Kirk & The Jirks the ideal band for clubs, weddings, corporate/private functions, or any other situation where you need a fun band to throw a great time!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "5th & Ocean Ave, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "Rachel Ana Dobken", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10134088.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.01, 40.22], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Blues-Rock, Indie Rock, Psychedelic Soul, Psychedelic Rock, Rock, Soul, Blues", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Wonder Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Rachel Ana Dobken (drums, guitar, vocals, piano) has a knack for blending indie-rock, soul and jazz.

She was born Martina Mariea Schiff in Medicine Lodge, KS, in 1966 and discovered country music through her father, who led a local band called the Schifters. By her teen years, she was singing and playing keyboards with the Schifters, and after high school she gigged around Kansas with several different bands. She married soundman John McBride, and in 1990 the couple moved to Nashville, where John worked for artists like Charlie Daniels and Ricky Van Shelton; Martina, meanwhile, worked as a demo singer, and her husband produced her demo tape, which got her signed to RCA in 1991. Around the same time, John was hired as Garth Brooks' production manager, which helped land Martina an opening slot on tour with Brooks. Her debut album, The Time Has Come, was released in 1992, offering a set of songs indebted to traditional honky tonk and progressive-minded country-folk. The pop-inflected 1993 follow-up, The Way That I Am, was her commercial breakthrough, with the lead single \"My Baby Loves Me\" zooming up the country charts to the number two position. The affecting story-song \"Independence Day\" became something of a signature number, and another single, \"Life #9,\" also reached the Top Ten. McBride's 1995 follow-up, Wild Angels, gave her a second Top Five hit in \"Safe in the Arms of Love,\" and its title track became her first-ever number one single. 1997's Evolution became her first Top Ten country album, and the Jim Brickman duet \"Valentine\" not only went Top Ten, but crossed over to become her first big hit on the adult contemporary charts. Evolution went on to spawn two number two hits (\"Happy Girl\" and \"Whatever You Say\") and two number one hits (\"A Broken Wing\" and \"Wrong Again\"), and sold over two million copies, launching McBride into the top rank of country stardom. She issued a Christmas album in late 1998 and returned with a proper follow-up, Emotion, in 1999. Its lead single, \"I Love You,\" hit number one country and also crossed over to adult contemporary radio, and the follow-ups \"Love's the Only House,\" \"There You Are,\" and \"It's My Time\" were all successful as well (the first two also reached the Top Ten). 2001's Greatest Hits compilation was the first McBride album to top the country charts, and sold well enough to make the pop Top Five as well. It contained four new tracks, all of which were eventually released as singles; \"Blessed\" hit number one, and \"When God-Fearin' Women Get the Blues\" and \"Where Would You Be\" both reached the Top Ten. Martina from 2003 celebrated womanhood, while Timeless from 2005 was a collection of country classics; both became Top Ten album hits, the latter reaching number three.

They also incorporate symphonic elements into their sound. The past years, their melodies have taken much more melancholic turn and the sound is overall much darker.\n\nBiography\nInsomnium began to take shape during the bleak spring of 1997. In a quiet town of Joensuu, located in the easternmost part of Finland, four young men were forming a fierce metal band. From the beginning it was clear that this band would make music that was brutal and yet melodic, full of contrasts and changing atmospheres. They took what they regarded as the best aspects of their favourite bands and moulded these influences into a new kind of entity. The result was the marriage of melodic Scandinavian death metal and traditional Finnish tunes. Lyrics turned out to be sorrowful, dream-like tales of love and death that usually took place amidst the Finnish nature. Influences were taken from the Finnish folklore as well as the world literature.\n\nAfter two years of intensive training Insomnium made their first demo-cd, which received praises from all over the world. The second demo was made the following year and it gained a lot of attention as well. This time, record companies got interested, too. In the beginning of 2001 founding members, guitarist Ville Friman, drummer Markus Hirvonen and bassist/vocalist Niilo Sev\u00e4nen, attached a new guitarist, Ville V\u00e4nni to the band. Now Insomnium was stronger than ever and ready to rise to the next level. A deal with Candlelight was signed the same spring and recording of the first album began in the summer.\n\n- In the Halls of Awaiting - was released in April 2002 and it introduced a band that had evolved in many ways. The legacy of Scandinavian death metal was still the core of the music but new layers had appeared around it. There were more nuances and depth in the songs, and the music was more versatile and challenging than before. Progressive shades had crept into the songs, and in many ways the band had stepped aside from the mainstream of melodic death metal. Debut album received excellent reviews in many magazines around the globe, especially in Germany, Finland and North America. The recording of the second album began in summer 2003. The process was somewhat painful but finally in December the new album was ready. - Since the Day It All Came Down - continues the development that the first album began. Songs are more versatile and surprising, progressive influences are ever clearer. Some tracks may even be described as experimental. But the straightforward side of the music hasn\u00b4t gone anywhere, since catchy guitar-harmonies, crushing riffs and soothing acoustic interludes are all still there. Melodies are still the most essential element in the music of Insomnium, but this time the tunes are even more melancholic and wistful than on the debut album. This is a sad and dreary album, heavier and gloomier than the first one, and undoubtedly more challenging. So when you take this path, keep in mind that it takes a while before your eyes get used to the dark...\n\n..And darker it got. With their third release, - Above The Weeping World -, the music got more agressive, harder, louder and the progressive elements grew once again. The first European tour is over, and Insomnium is once again a step closer to world domination.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.insomnium.net", "otherInfo": "Accessible accommodations should purchase a General Admission ticket and will be taken care of at the venue day of event."}, {"Address": "85 West St, New York, NY 10006", "Artist": "Nick Cabrera", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9156247.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.014611, 40.709548], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: R&B, soul, Rock, Latin, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bill's Bar & Burger", "moreBioInfo": "Hi I'm Nick.

There, she finds parallels for what she wants to say, channels that inspiration into her lyrics and comes up with something unique: Music that\u2019s immediate and timeless, driven by feelings all listeners can relate to yet infused with a perspective that transcends the present.\n\n\u201cI have a song called \u2018Story\u2019 on my new album,\u201d she explains, referencing Letterbox, scheduled for release in the spring of 2017 on Curb Records. \u201cIt brings in a lot of epic characters: Heathcliff and Catherine from Wuthering Heights, Hector\u2019s wife Andromache from The Iliad. I\u2019ve always loved epic stories \u2014 Anna Karenina, The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment \u2014 because they\u2019re filled with relationships that are super serious and dramatic. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m right there in the midst of them.\u201d\n\nYet Letterbox is no droning lecture on literature. It\u2019s a celebration of freedom. Miller has paid plenty of dues to get to the point where she feels she can write what she wants how she wants to, and sing without constraint. Still young, she has survived years in the music business. She impacted initially with the infectious, \u201cYou\u2019re Not Alone.\u201d More than 115,000 downloaded that single on Amazon. ABC\u2019s Dancing with the Stars featured her second single, \u201c6\u20192,\u201d in 2014.\n\nThat\u2019s a success story for sure, one that Miller is grateful to have had. Still, she realized that this was only the first of many steps she needed to take to achieve her goals.\n\nMuch more than literature feeds into Miller\u2019s unfettered performance on Letterbox. First and most enduring is the foundation she received from being born into a family that loved and performed music. They gravitated toward bluegrass and cultivated Marie\u2019s obvious talent through lessons with banjo virtuoso Murphy Henry. Around age 12 she began singing with her family and later with her sister as a duo, appearing at churches, festivals, community picnics and, every Saturday, on the porch of the winery her father and a partner had opened in rural Virginia, across the road from the Miller family home.\n\nMiller also began writing songs when she was about 12 years old. \u201cThe first one I started performing was an original melody and lyrics based on a poem I\u2019d read in Lord of the Rings,\u201d she says, with a grin. \u201cI was really into American music at the time \u2014 the kind of music you\u2019d hear in a Ken Burns documentary, the people\u2019s music, the storytelling of bluegrass and Irish music. I was attracted initially to the New Grass artists, like Nickel Creek and Alison Krauss and mainly Chris Thile. She pauses and then laughs, a little embarrassed. \u201cI was actually 100 percent certain when I was 14 that Chris Thile and I were going to get married someday.\u201d Miller then found herself diving into the lyrics and melodies from the likes of The Eagles to Stevie Wonder to modern hitmaker Sara Bareilles. This wide range of influences impacted her music making when she signed with Curb Records in Nashville at the age of 16 where she fulfilled her dream to write songs. \u201cI began my life as a traveling musician then,\u201d she says. \u201cI love performing, but it was so uncomfortable to be 16 or 17 and have everybody telling me what to do. I remember one time five people criticized what I was wearing. When you\u2019re 17 years old you\u2019re uncomfortable with yourself already, so to have a bunch of old people talk to you about your clothes, it was just really weird.\u201d\nDiscouraged, Miller returned to Virginia. She took time off from music, went to college for a while, but kept practicing and writing. With a new confidence, she eventually went back to Nashville. Before long she had made her mark in music. And from there, we come to this pivotal moment in her story.\n\nWorking with producers Eric Rosse (Sara Bareillis, Tory Amos) and Chad Capelin, Miller moved decisively into a new creative milieu with Letterbox. Begin with the title. \u201cIt\u2019s from the Beatles\u2019 song \u2018Across the Universe,\u2019\u201d she points out, and then sings the John Lennon lyric: \u201cThoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox.\u201d\n\nWhy do these words speak to her? \u201cI still write letters to my friends and to my grandparents and to my boyfriends ... when I have them,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered that sometimes, when you want to say something, you just can\u2019t. It\u2019s too awkward. So Letterbox is about how I love to write letters but it\u2019s also radically relational, about friendships, parents, a child or romance. It\u2019s about how we affect each other as people.\u201d\n\nMiller describes the songs on Letterbox as \u201calmost literal letters to people in my life. \u2018Glitter Gold,\u2019 \u2018Boardwalk\u2019 and \u2018Angeline\u2019 are like letters you leave on someone\u2019s doorstep \u2014 teenage, broken-heart messages. \u2018More\u2019 is a letter that you never sent. \u2019Stones You Throw\u2019 is about how the world feels ripples from every little thing we say or do, whether we like it or not. We live constantly in the ripples of other people\u2019s actions, whether they\u2019re from love or hatred.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s exultant first single, \u201cThis Side of Paradise,\u201d which Miller describes as \u201chopeful and daring\u201d ... the promise to wait, in the language of many a folk song, for \u201cthe day that I see my own true love again\u201d on \u201cLonely Ends\u201d ... compelling imagery, vocals that whisper and soar, from a lover \u201cLost at Sea\u201d ... Every moment on Letterbox rings true and lingers afterwards, like a memory or a passage from a favorite book.\n\nThis is the true Marie Miller, breathing in all that life has to offer and crafting it with her own sense of hope, wonder and enchantment.\n\nAnd, in case you\u2019re wondering, \u201cNow, if people tell me what to wear or what to say, I just totally ignore them.\u201d\n\nShe laughs out loud. It feels good to be free. It feels good to share that freedom through music. With Letterbox, we savor it all, as if delivered to us alone, from a friend not so far away.", "otherInfo": "Marie Miller - Rockwood Stage 3"}, {"Address": "30 N Van Brunt St, Englewood, NJ 07631", "Artist": "Rome", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9687634.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.974796, 40.89516], "Date": "Fri Mar 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-13", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Soul, Pop, Reggae", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bergen Performing Arts Center", "moreBioInfo": "Rome Ramirez first rose to fame in 2009 when he became singer and guitarist with Sublime with Rome, a group that featured Bud Gaugh and Eric Wilson of Sublime, with Ramirez taking the place of the late Bradley Nowell, the founder and frontman of Sublime who died in 1996 as the band's first major-label album was awaiting release. Roman Rene Ramirez was born in Fremont, California on June 11, 1988, and he began playing guitar at the age of 11. In his teens, Ramirez began working with local bands, and Sublime became one of Ramirez's favorite acts (as well as Muse, Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, and the Bad Brains). Ramirez was well familiar with Sublime's body of work when a friend who worked at a recording studio introduced him to Eric Wilson, the group's bassist. Wilson invited Ramirez to jam with him on some Sublime songs, and then organized another session with Ramirez and Wilson joined by drummer Bud Gaugh. Wilson and Gaugh were impressed enough with Ramirez that they invited him to join them in a new edition of the group, and Sublime with Rome made its debut in 2009 at Cypress Hill's Smokeout Festival in San Bernardino, California. Ramirez was soon touring steadily with Sublime with Rome, and in 2010 he co-wrote and sang the song \"Lay Me Down\" with the band the Dirty Heads, which rose to the top of Billboard's Alternative Songs chart. In 2011, Sublime with Rome headed into the studio and released an album of new material, Yours Truly, which was released by indie punk label Fueled by Ramen; later that same year, Bud Gaugh retired from the group, with Josh Freese signing on as the trio's new drummer. The following year, Rome released his first solo EP, Dedication (also released by Fueled by Ramen), and he also guested on the 2012 album by the Dirty Heads, Cabin by the Sea. The year 2013 proved to be a busy one for Ramirez; he contributed songwriting and guitar work on Selena Gomez's album Stars Dance, collaborated with Enrique Iglesias on a pair of singles", "otherInfo": "Sometimes you just got to grab your guitar, pack a bag, and hit the road!\n\nMy Super Buddy, Duddy B, and I are embarking on a month-long tour next spring.\n\nFrom coast to coast, we'll be playing some of your favorite songs and some collaborative Jam Sessions!\n\nI'll also be performing some new material off an upcoming EP release.

Since their formation in 2006, the San Diego-based band has managed to release a new album almost every single year since their inception, and have sold over 100,000 albums in the underground scene. The band\u2019s hunger to churn out bludgeoning metal coupled with meaningful themes instantly separates them from the rest.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that PATHOLOGY have created some of the most vivid and grotesque death metal in the current genre. The founding members of PATHOLOGY have roots in other extreme death metal bands, such as drummer Dave Astor as the founding member of both the grind-spazz project THE LOCUST and militant death squad CATTLE DECAPITATION.\n\nPATHOLOGY\u2019s current formation stands at its strongest with Dave Astor on drums, Daniel Richardson guitar, bass player Richard Jackson and Obie Flett to diversify the perfect lineup. Revealing an intense mixture of brutal riffs, crushing drums and imagery so blood-soaked, sickeningly twisted and filled with death that it\u2019s impossible to look away.\n\nBrimming with heavy grooves, and a tight, relenting style, PATHOLOGY delivers savory slabs of brutality Make no mistake; PATHOLOGY is not in any way suitable for a weak stomach \u2013 the onslaught of rumbling grooves coupled with guttural growls leaves fans old and new assured of the presence of PATHOLOGY\u2019s brutality.\n\nPATHOLOGY has toured North America, Mexico, Canada and Europe with death metal legends like OBITUARY, DEICIDE, NILE, VADER, IMMOLATION and GRAVE. They have a devoted fan base as seen by their 225,000 plus followers across their social media websites and the credibility of a hard-working, down-to-earth band who have paid their dues and risen from the underground and continue to invade and crossover to new and younger fans.\n\nThe group refuses to tone down its dangerously high level of hostility, wreaking havoc on anything that dares to step into its destructive path. Breaking the mold to create and maintain a unique, raw sound has skyrocketed PATHOLOGY to the top of the death metal elite. Championing their reigning status to stand strong outside of the mainstream solidifies PATHOLOGY as the most forward-thinking merchants of mayhem around.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}]
