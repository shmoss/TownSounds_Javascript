They tour the Northwest regularly as a duo, and put on theatrical shows with their full ensemble. They are alumni of the Johnny Mercer Songwriters Project and have played before Randy Newman.\n\nPortland's The Bylines exists in a unique musical plane, one at once grounded in the big-band past of glamorous pop performances and rooted in a present realm of intricate and highly addictive songwriting. With a focus on grand live spectacle--a facet of music often lost in the digital age--the group is equally at home in velvet-curtained jazz halls, large rooms and intimate venues.\n\nThat sound is the product of a marriage both sonic and literal. The Bylines is made up of two songwriters whose styles and influences converge to bring The Bylines' catchy, addictive sounds to vibrant life. Frontwoman Marianna Thielen, the glamorous face of the group, brings to the fore a background in composition, classical vocal work and, most obviously, musical theater, illuminating the stage with endlessly watchable bravado backed up by her powerful -- yet playful -- vocal prowess. Meanwhile, gliding his fingers across the keys is Reece Marshburn, letting loose a symphony of intricate melodies rooted in a combination of classical, jazz and pop music.\n\nThe resulting combination is a unique pop confection drawing on decades of influences, as if Cole Porter, Carole King, Dusty Springfield, Freddie Mercury, Paul Simon, Rufus Wainwright and Regina Spektor combined forces and filtered their unique compositions through classical maestros and film composers, then sprinkled it with a keen pop sensibility and a commitment to putting on the most involving, charismatic and personalized live shows this side of the Copacabana.\n\nThe Bylines have used their unique-yet-familiar sound to play to audiences large and small throughout the country, and have released both a studio(self titled, recorded by Bob Stark at Kung Fu Bakery) and a live album(The Bylines Live, recorded at the Alberta Rose Theatre in Portland, OR). The Bylines are proud alumni of the Johnny Mercer Songwriting Project, and have had support from the Regional Arts and Culture Council.\n\nWhether performing as a Thielen/Marshburn duo or with a larger band, the result is a blend of butter-smooth melodies, densely layered songwriting and powerful vocals. Most importantly, though, The Bylines musical cocktail goes down easy, and emphasizes something that is so often forgotten when such prolific songwriters present their craft: listening to music is, above all, supposed to be an experience\u2026 and a fun one.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Emma Brooke ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/259119.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Erica Sunshine Lee ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9312955.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Country Pop Music, Southern Rock, Outlaw Country, Country Rock, Country, Blues & Country.", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "When you mix a country girl heart, gypsy soul with a kick ass rock and roll attitude and a splash of the islands, you get Erica Sunshine Lee.\n********\nErica Sunshine Lee is an incredibly prolific singer/songwriter and just released her new EP \u201cREADY\u201d - featuring new single on country radio \u201cChange the world\u201d: the follow up EP to her 8th studio album \"BURIED TREASURE\" and has spent the last decade touring literally all over the USA, Europe, and the South Pacific.

He was heavily involved with the Occupy Oakland protests and expressed its rage and hope brilliantly in 2015's Wedgewood. This year, he followed up the album with his most intimate, and perhaps most singer-songwriter-y album to date: Kings Corner. The songs started (mostly) as much of his early, unrecorded work from over a decade and a half ago, that were never properly released. He intended to record these songs to give away to fans, but as he worked on it, he realized the songs could use work and be a legit album.

In the two years since, the members of Wildermiss\u2014Cole, guitarists Josh Hester and Seth Beamer, and drummer Caleb Thoemke\u2014have built up a massive and fiercely loyal grassroots following in its hometown of Denver, Colorado, and crisscrossed the country winning over fans as the supporting act on tours with the Oh Hellos, Jared and the Mill and Bronze Radio Return.\n\nMore than a fan favorite, the quartet has also earned accolades from the press and radio in the Mile High City on the strength of its music and live show. \u201cCarry Your Heart,\u201d a Lost With You single that has attracted more than half a million streams on Spotify, received heavy rotation on KTCL, the taste-making station that first introduced the country to the Oh Hellos, The Fray, Flobots, Churchill, and many other breakout acts in the past fifteen years.\n\nIn addition to selling out the Bluebird Theater and thrilling capacity crowds with intimate back-to-back New Year\u2019s Eve dates at the Larimer Lounge, Wildermiss has played prime mainstage sets at all of the city\u2019s biggest music festivals, including iHeart Radio\u2019s Big Gig at the 18,000-seat amphitheater Fiddler\u2019s Green, the Westword Music Showcase and the Underground Music Showcase, which drew tens of thousands of fans, in addition to sharing a bill at the 6,500-seat 1STBANK Center arena with the Revivalists, Elle King, American Authors.\n\nThe outfit\u2019s ascent has all been organic. The members of Wildermiss have attracted fans the old fashioned way by writing memorable songs and playing their hearts out each night, winning over fan after fan one at a time. As viewers who happened to catch Wildermiss on Last Call With Carson Daly can attest, the act isn\u2019t a tough sell. Portions of the band\u2019s set at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles were captured for broadcast, and the performance was so compelling that it ended up airing on two different episodes of NBC\u2019s late-night show.\n\nBut just as those performances served as a sneak peek for the fortunate few across the country who were still up in the wee hours of the morning, Lost With You merely hinted at the potential of Wildermiss. In My Mind, the outfit\u2019s new seven-song EP, surpasses any expectations set by the group\u2019s highly acclaimed debut. From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band. If you look and listen closely, there is far more to this band than meets the eyes and ears.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Swae Lee ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9285663.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "New album SR3MM | SWAECATION | JXMTRO available now http://smarturl.it/SR3MM", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ivory Layne ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8996034.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "One classy broad.\nArtist/Writer/Producer.\nStreaming on Apple Music and Spotify.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jason Lovins Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8965200.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Worship, Christian Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Jason Lovins Band based out of Ashland, KY, stems from the Appalachian Mountains and a culture traditionally dominated by country and southern gospel music.

In the two years since, the members of Wildermiss\u2014Cole, guitarists Josh Hester and Seth Beamer, and drummer Caleb Thoemke\u2014have built up a massive and fiercely loyal grassroots following in its hometown of Denver, Colorado, and crisscrossed the country winning over fans as the supporting act on tours with the Oh Hellos, Jared and the Mill and Bronze Radio Return.\n\nMore than a fan favorite, the quartet has also earned accolades from the press and radio in the Mile High City on the strength of its music and live show. \u201cCarry Your Heart,\u201d a Lost With You single that has attracted more than half a million streams on Spotify, received heavy rotation on KTCL, the taste-making station that first introduced the country to the Oh Hellos, The Fray, Flobots, Churchill, and many other breakout acts in the past fifteen years.\n\nIn addition to selling out the Bluebird Theater and thrilling capacity crowds with intimate back-to-back New Year\u2019s Eve dates at the Larimer Lounge, Wildermiss has played prime mainstage sets at all of the city\u2019s biggest music festivals, including iHeart Radio\u2019s Big Gig at the 18,000-seat amphitheater Fiddler\u2019s Green, the Westword Music Showcase and the Underground Music Showcase, which drew tens of thousands of fans, in addition to sharing a bill at the 6,500-seat 1STBANK Center arena with the Revivalists, Elle King, American Authors.\n\nThe outfit\u2019s ascent has all been organic. The members of Wildermiss have attracted fans the old fashioned way by writing memorable songs and playing their hearts out each night, winning over fan after fan one at a time. As viewers who happened to catch Wildermiss on Last Call With Carson Daly can attest, the act isn\u2019t a tough sell. Portions of the band\u2019s set at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles were captured for broadcast, and the performance was so compelling that it ended up airing on two different episodes of NBC\u2019s late-night show.\n\nBut just as those performances served as a sneak peek for the fortunate few across the country who were still up in the wee hours of the morning, Lost With You merely hinted at the potential of Wildermiss. In My Mind, the outfit\u2019s new seven-song EP, surpasses any expectations set by the group\u2019s highly acclaimed debut. From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band. If you look and listen closely, there is far more to this band than meets the eyes and ears.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Clint Black ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10343550.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "After 30 years of \u2018killin\u2019 time,\u2019 Clint Black is ready to celebrate. The multi-million selling country icon is set to embark on a tour commemorating the 30th anniversary of his groundbreaking debut album Killin\u2019 Time, which all but altered the landscape of country music. Three decades later, Clint remains humble as ever about the massive influence he has had on the genre.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really feel like I was leading a change in country music,\u201d Clint remarks. \u201cIt just felt like big success to me. I would hear things like, \u2018So-and-so is going to record, and they\u2019re using their own band because you did.\u2019 Or, \u2018So-and-so wants to write more of their own songs, because you did.\u2019 But I don\u2019t feel like I changed anything, other than contributing my work to the big picture. It\u2019s hard to look at myself and see the impact I\u2019ve had. I do know that my songs have touched a lot of people.\u201d\n\nIf Black won\u2019t say it outright, his staggering career speaks for itself. His is one of the most storied careers in modern music. Black surged to superstardom as part of the fabled Class of '89, reaching #1 with five consecutive singles from his triple-platinum debut, Killin' Time. He followed that with the triple-platinum Put Yourself in My Shoes, and then a string of platinum and gold albums throughout the '90s. Perhaps most impressively, Clint wrote or co-wrote every one of his more than three dozen chart hits, including \"A Better Man,\" \"Where Are You Now,\" \"When My Ship Comes In,\" \"A Good Run of Bad Luck,\" \"Summer's Comin',\" \"Like the Rain\" and \"Nothin' But the Taillights,\" part of a catalog that produced 22 #1 singles and made him one of the most successful singer/songwriters of the modern era. Along the way, he\u2019s earned more than a dozen gold and platinum awards in the U.S. and Canada, landed nearly two dozen major awards and nominations, won a GRAMMY Award, countless Country Music Association, American Music Awards and Academy of Country Music Awards, as well as a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nRaised in the suburbs of Houston, Texas, Clint Black is the youngest of four brothers. He began performing with brother, Kevin at the family\u2019s backyard barbecues. After high school, he spent 10 years on the local nightclub circuit and in 1989, he led a movement of young talent that transformed country music leading into the \u201890s.\n\nIn 2004, he scaled the top of the charts by trading lines with Buffett, Alan Jackson, George Strait, Toby Keith and Kenny Chesney on the Hank Williams classic \u201cHey Good Looking.\u2019\u201d He contributed \u201cThe Great Mississippi Flood\" to the 2005 post-Katrina charity album Hurricane Relief: Come Together Now. He released albums in 2004, 2005 and 2007.\n\nHis interest in releasing new music waned when his record label closed its doors in 2008. He explains, \u201cI had interest from major companies to sign deals, but declined\u201d.\nClint Black has hardly been idle since then. He\u2019s written and produced songs for Hasbro\u2019s children\u2019s shows and in 2010 and 2012 starred in the films Flicka 2 and Flicka: Country Pride, the latter with his wife and daughter.\n\nIn 2013, the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain began marketing an album of Black\u2019s hits, which continues to sell strongly and in early 2015, he collaborated with Joe Nichols on a Superstar Duets NBC-TV special for the Academy of Country Music.\nIn 2015 released On Purpose, his first studio album of new material in nearly a decade. He dedicated the album to his father, who passed away in 2012.\n\n\u201cMy dad was a huge country fan and is the first reason I listen to country music. He is probably the reason I\u2019m a songwriter today. He was my introduction to \"who\u2019s behind the music\". I grew up wanting to be the writer behind the song. That really all started with him.\u201d\n2018 was a particularly busy year for the Class of \u201889 alum. Always finding ways to challenge himself creatively, Clint produced his first ever holiday musical, titled Looking For Christmas, which focuses on family, love, and the magic of Christmas. It\u2019s expected to tour in 2019.\n\n\u201cThis has been in the works for a while now and it was great to see the audience reaction. Working with James Sasser has been both a blessing and a learning experience and I believe that the story is relatable to many Americans, both young and old.\u201d\nNow, with the 30th anniversary of Killin\u2019 Time approaching, Clint has earned the right to sit back, and let his body of work speak for itself.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Niki Kennedy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10024935.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-Songwriter based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.", "otherInfo": "Join me for a virtual concert on Sessions (click the link or download the Sessions app to tune in)."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Julia Haltigan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9199503.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Julia Haltigan", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Acclaimed bombshell songstress Julia Haltigan came up on the Lower East Side of New York City when it oozed a heady mix of danger, possibility and art.

Julia\u2019s signature artistry evokes Brigitte Bardot, Marianne Faithfull, Iggy Pop, Debbie Harry, and Lou Reed.\n\nHer latest EP, Hot Tears, is a masterful collection, teeming with themes of heartache, images of broken bones, car chases, and nostalgia.

But when the sun goes down, he straps on his signature Gretsch 6120, steps up to the mike and is transformed into REVEREND HORTON HEAT, a hellfire-spewing, rock and roll dare-demon.\n\nJim\u2019s tome is iconic: From recording with Lemmy Kilmister, being revered by country music legends like Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins, touring with Soundgarden, ZZ Top, The Cramps, Social Distortion, White Zombie and the Sex Pistols (a young Lydon was connected to Jim\u2019s original 1985 demo), to providing touring opps to upstarts Kyuss, Hank III, Marilyn Manson and countless others across decades on the road.\n\nHeath and longtime confidant and slap-bass general Jimbo Wallace have polished up their 12threlease, Whole New Life, which Heath calls \u201cthe most positive material I have ever written. It focuses heavily on rock and roll but there is a human interest parallel - songs about growing up poor, vices, marriage, having children and walking the rapturous streets of America.\u201d\n\nCall it a new twist on an old sound, Whole New Life was recorded between Fun Guy Studios and Modern Electric in the band\u2019s hometown of Dallas. The eleven track rumination features new sticksman Arjuna \u2018RJ\u2019 Contreras. The Texas based jazz pupil came to the bands attention from a friend\u2019s reference in the summer of 2017, and brought a whole new backbeat to the legendary rockabilly administration. After clicking with Contreras, Heath hired a new pianist in 2018, Matt Jordan, to flesh out the sound with the pomp and power of Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. \u201cI love playing with these guys, it truly is a whole new band, so the title fits perfectly.\u201d\n\nRecording the album, Heath recalled that \u201cBack in the 1950\u2019s, reverb chambers were really hip and I always loved their warmth. I\u2019m all about Sam Phillips and the things he did with tape machines and tape echo. I love that kind of production value, even if it is older than me! It really sent me to this whole other headspace where I worked with a lot of vintage gear on this album - some of which I built myself for a truly unique sound - ribbon, old tube microphones, pre-amps and stuff. Additionally, a year before I started piecing this together I worked especially hard on my singing voice. Whole New Life brought out something in me where I am screaming more and making more throaty sounds. It's got some Louisiana feel to it, a bit of gruff and some Roy Orbison style in it. We tested out new tracks on our most recent tour and they are working better with the audience than any new songs we premiered since the early days of the band.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis tour started around 1986,\u201d Heath chuckles dryly. REVEREND HORTON HEAT still performs nearly 200 shows annually, including their trademark Horton\u2019s Hayride Festival in Southern California, which has expanded to an end-of-the-year jamboree under the name Horton\u2019s Holiday Hayride. The band has also wowed sold-out crowds with their multi-city residencies across America, including performances at Coachella, Reading, Austin City Limits, Riot Fest and countless other festivals. The Texas troubadours also took a unique approach to the term \u2018Special Guests\u2019 on recent tours. Recalling the time the band opened for Jerry Lee Lewis, Heath had a vision, \u201cThe idea of playing in Jerry\u2019s backing band would have been pretty neat. So every once in a while we\u2019ll have a load of fun putting that aspect in our live set. In the middle of our set, we\u2019ll have a special guest come on stage for a mini-set where REVEREND HORTON HEAT is the backing band. The first time we did it was with Lemmy Kilmister. We stopped our set midway, the road crew dragged a Marshall amp on stage, wiped the Rickenbacker clean and out came Lem. He was adamant on playing deep cuts, but I fought tooth and nail with him to do \u2018Ace Of Spades.\u2019 I told him, \u2018Lemmy, we must do this song, we have to give the people want they want.\u2019 He took a drag of his smoke, looked me square in the eye, and said \u2018Never give them what they want, give them what they need!\u2019\u201d\n\nWith over 1 million albums sold and nearly 35 years in the game, Heath and company have been delivering blood-pressure inducing scriptures to millions of fans worldwide. Call it rock and roll, psychobilly or what have you, REVEREND HORTON HEAT is often considered an early architect of the latter genre (at least on this side of the Atlantic) and occupies a peculiar place in American musical terrain.\n\nWhole New Life was delivered November 30, 2018.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Keller Williams ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8567342.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Keller Williams Solo, Keller Williams with The Travelin' McCourys, Keller with More Than A Little, Keller The Keels, Grateful Grass, The KW KWahtro, WMD's, KIDS and more at www.KellerWilliams.net", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Music lover and performer", "otherInfo": "80 minutes of song slinging and request taking coming at you live from my cellar!\n\nKeller's Cellar merch avail at https://www.districtlines.com/keller-williams"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ So Hype ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7069503.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "DJ So Hype", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Derrick Reeves, known as Hype or DJ So Hype, is an American DJ and producer of segway music. \u201cHype\u201d, meaning extravagant or intensive publicity or promotion., suits his personality and skill-set perfectly when talking about his craft. This is due to his well-known ability to work with any genre of music, or combination of multiple genres at one time, to produce dynamic and high energy music sets. In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture. As the resident DJ since 2004 of some of Vegas\u2019 hottest clubs and lounges including Rum Jungle, Jet Nightclub & Koi Nightclub inside of the Planet Hollywood. Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip. Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cWEST COAST WEDNESDAYS\u201d EVERY WEDNESDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

But not every artist gets asked by their heroes to join\nthem, as artists, on their stage. It's a compliment that Jacob Moon keeps getting from the\nmusicians who have inspired him since he started as a singer-songwriter out in Hamilton,\nOntario. Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "A different theme every day!

They took their name from the famous French painter Henri Matisse.\n\nMatisse was originally formed in 1997 by Aris Siafas, Giannis Massouras, Grigoris \u039aolias, Petros Tsolis, Kostas Synodinos and Basilis Zervos without making any significant actions as a band. The band became active, when they started performing and writing songs for the first time in January 1999. In the beginning of their career the band was making live performances, mostly in small venues in Athens. Still though, they didn't have enough money for recordings. Matisse have also supported many acts including Reamonn, Puressence, Shed Seven, The Frank and Walters, Drugstore. They continued their live performances and demonstrations for the next three years, until they signed a contract with Sony BMG Greece in 2001. By winter of 2002, they began recording their EP 4 (Four), which was released in the summer of 2003.\n\nTwo years after the release of their EP 4 (Four), in June 2005 Matisse released their debut album Cheap As Art which hit the #3 spot on Pop & Rock Magazine's \"Best of the Year List\". The lead single of the album She Smiles, became a radio classic. Enthusiastically received by the critics Cheap As Art set off the band to a great start.\n\nA few days after the release of their debut, Matisse opened the first day of the Rockwave Festival as supporting act for Garbage and Marilyn Manson. Their performance was welcomed by journalists and public alike. In the begining of 2006, the band started writing material for their second album, with few changes in their line-up; Kostas Synodinos departed from the group and Petros Tsolis was replaced by Nikos Manosopulos. In December of the same year they also supported Kaiser Chiefs in their live performance in Greece. In May 2007 their second album Toys Up was released.\n\nIn 2007, Aris Siafas left the band for personal reasons. He was replaced by Alex Kavadias, a Greek-Australian singer. The band re-released Toys Up, in deluxe edition, with videos, remixes, as well as a new mix from their cover on Cyndi Lauper's song \"She Bop\" performed by their new singer Alex.\n\nOfficial Site:\nhttp://www.matisse.gr", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bambounou ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7506327.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Techno, Tech House, Electronic", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kink ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8266631.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Deep House, Electronic", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "PUP ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10366519.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Punk Rock", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "We're called PUP.

He has his black-belt in voice and bottleneck guitar and his banjo playing scares the crap out of me.\u201d\n\u2013 David Lindley, musical adventurer\n\nVery few musicians of any stripe so personify a musical genre as completely as Tony Furtado embodies Americana roots music. Tony is an evocative and soulful singer, a wide-ranging songwriter and a virtuoso multi-instrumentalist adept on banjo, cello-banjo, slide guitar and baritone ukulele who mixes and matches sounds and styles with the flair of a master chef (he\u2019s also an accomplished sculptor, but that\u2019s another story). All of the music of America is in Tony\u2019s music. Relix hit the nail on the head when writing of Tony: \u201cTrue talent doesn\u2019t need categories.\u201d\n\nA native of Pleasanton, California, who now makes his home in Portland, Oregon, Tony Furtado took up the banjo at age 12, inspired by the Beverly Hillbillies TV show and a sixth grade music report. He first attracted national attention in 1987, when he won the National Bluegrass Banjo Championship in Winfield, Kansas. Not long after that, Tony opted for the life of a full-time professional musician, joining Laurie Lewis & Grant Street. A second victory at Winfield, in 1991, bookended his years with Grant Street.\n\nIn 1990, Tony signed a recording deal with Rounder Records, one of the country\u2019s preeminent independent record companies. Beginning with Swamped in 1990, he recorded six critically acclaimed albums for the label, collaborating with such master musicians as Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Tim O\u2019Brien, Stuart Duncan, Kelly Joe Phelps and Mike Marshall. During this period, Tony also performed and recorded with the band Sugarbeat and the Rounder Banjo Extravaganza with Tony Trischka and Tom Adams.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s\u2014influenced by such musical heroes as Ry Cooder, David Lindley and Taj Mahal\u2014Tony added slide guitar, singing and songwriting to his musical toolbox and began leading his own band. He is a tireless road musician who performs in a dizzying variety of formats: solo, in a duo or trio or with his full five-person band. He especially values the opportunities he has had to tour with such legendary musicians as Gregg Allman and with such esteemed slide guitarists as David Lindley, Derek Trucks and Sonny Landreth.\n\nTony has performed throughout the world at top venues and appeared at such prestigious music festivals as the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Jazz Aspen, Kerrville Folk Festival, Strawberry Music Festival, Winnipeg Folk Festival, Sisters Folk Festival, San Jose Jazz Festival and countless others. \u201cI love playing live,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my energy is focused on the love of playing music and rolling with the moment. It\u2019s a give and take from the audience to the stage, and back. And the music that is created is something that otherwise might not occur without that flow.\u201d\n\nTony has recorded and produced almost a dozen CDs for various labels such as Dualtone, What Are Records and Funzalo Records. Tony enthusiastically describes his newest CD, The Bell, as \u201cthe most personal of my career.\u201d To be released this summer on his own YousayFurtado Records, The Bell is an important release for several reasons: it represents a return to Tony\u2019s banjo-playing roots, with the banjo and cello-banjo more prominent than in recent years; the original songs concern such weighty themes as the loss of his father, the birth of his son and his own creative rebirth with the move to a new record label and management team; his working band is featured; and, most important of all, this is the first album in a long time on which Tony had complete artistic control.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dash Berlin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10377967.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Music", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Top 25' Dash Berlin including the new singles 'Home' and 'Love Out Loud'!

Barely two weeks have passed since he wrapped up a support tour for Pearl Jam front man Eddie Vedder, and more than five years have gone by since there was a month when he wasn\u2019t on stage. Not to mention the albums: Rhythm and Repose (2012), the Grammy-nominated Didn\u2019t He Ramble (2015), and a soon to be released Between Two Shores (2018); a bevy of EPs; and to top it off, a five week \u201cCamino by sea\u201d in a traditional Irish naomho\u0301g, a journey which was captured on film and released as the full-length The Camino Voyage (2018).\n\nHe has earned both his exhaustion and now his respite: a month in one place. Taking a residency at the Centre Culturel Irlandais, Hansard has come to France to put shape to a new album. The intention is to create \u201can acoustic record with sparse accompaniment\u201d in concert with long-time friends and collaborators Joe Doyle (bass), ROMY (piano, string arrangements, and vocals), and Javier Mas (Spanish guitar, lau\u0301d).\n\nParis, however, has other plans. One night at dinner, friend, author, and classical singer Judith Mok introduces Hansard to the Khoshravesh brothers, who studied classical and traditional music in their native Iran before relocating to Paris. The simple meal quickly turns into a session. Hansard recalls working through one song particularly. \u201cThe Khoshravesh brothers joined me and I was transported. The song took on a new depth: I heard it differently, and new possibilities emerged. The ease by which they followed their own melodic line while being sympathetic to mine was intoxicating.\u201d By the end of the night, the brothers agreed to join Hansard in Black Box studios, where he will be working with producer David Odlum, and what was to be a straightforward album begins to take an interesting turn.\n\nThe roster of musicians quickly increases. Along with Joe Doyle, Romy, and the Khoshravesh brothers, Hansard invites Dublin electronic musicians Dunk Murphy (Sunken Foal) and Deasy to participate in the sessions, eager to see what might spark from the diverse range of musical traditions. Each day is unwritten, defined by an openness, a willingness to follow the spirit of the moment wherever it may lead. \u201cWhen you surround yourself with great musicians and do your best to keep up, stay loose, give little direction, and allow everyone to bring what they bring, something transformative may happen,\u201d Hansard says.\n\nOver the next few months, more musicians cycle in: Graham Hopkins and Earl Harvin (drums, percussion), Michael Buckley (saxophone, horns and flute), Breannda\u0301n O\u0301 Beaglaoich (accordion), Rosie McKenzie (violin), Aida Shahghasemi (Iranian singer and daf player), Eamon O\u2019Leary (banjo, bouzouki, and mandolin), Anna Roberts-Gevalt, (fiddle), Bri\u0301an Mac Gloinn (Ye Vagabonds, fiddle), Marke\u0301ta Irglova\u0301 (vocals), and Rob Moose (strings arrangements). They work with no agenda, no preconceived notion of what the sessions will turn into. But by April, it\u2019s clear that an album has emerged from this group exercise. \u201cSometimes,\u201d says Hansard, \u201cwhen you take a small musical fragment and you care for it, follow it and build it up slowly, it can become a thing of wonder.\u201d\n\nThe resulting album, This Wild Willing (April 12, ANTI- Records), is indeed a collection of wondrous things.\nThose who have followed Hansard\u2019s career since his Academy Award winning turn in the film Once will have witnessed one artistic arc: the journey of a Dublin busker who cut his teeth on the greats - Dylan, Van Morrison, Leonard Cohen \u2013 and followed the path of the troubadour, the singer-songwriter to great effect.\n\nBut there is another thread running through Glen Hansard\u2019s musicianship. In his decades as lead singer of Irish stalwarts The Frames, rock and folk ambitions coexist with moments of strangeness, intimacy, and stillness: love songs drowning in the last fevers of the Spanish Flu (\u201cSanta Maria\u201d), protagonists who ponder throwing it all away and disappearing in a fugue state (\u201cKeepsake\u201d). And above all, the band, veering from silence to cacophony, ready to underpin soaring emotional and dynamic shifts.\nThis Wild Willing marks an inflection point in his career, a turning where he marries the sonic inventiveness of the best of his work in The Frames to the discipline he\u2019s found as a lyricist in his solo career.\n\nIt is an album guided and formed by the twin totems of resolve and surrender \u2013 the resolve to see a thing through alongside a willingness to surrender, to trust in that which lies outside yourself \u2013 the other musicians in the room, your lover, your healer, your audience.\n\nLead track \u201cI\u2019ll Be You Be Me\u201d finds Hansard weighing the risks of such vulnerability, of the giving of oneself to another. His restrained vocal belies the fury of the underlying instrumental\u2019s building storm. \u201cI\u2019ll be you, be me and I\u2019ll be you/I\u2019ll take your truth, your lies, your secrets,\u201d he sings, negotiating the consuming potential of desire. There is danger here, but it is without rancor or ill-will \u2013 the danger of a hare with its belly exposed. There is also a duality in the invitation: the audience is drawn in just as surely as the song\u2019s object, to the immersive world conjured by the album.\n\nA sense of unease lingers in the mysterious \u201cClosing Door\u201d and \u201cRace to the Bottom.\u201d The latter serves as a sort of diary of Hansard\u2019s residency in Paris, finding him \u201ccoughing my lungs up on the Rue des Irlandais/becoming a risk to myself\u201d an \u201c\u2019X\u2019 on my back\u201d as he wanders the city. Hansard insists, \u201cIt\u2019s more about the decline of a person or persons rather than of human kind,\u201d and yet it is hard to escape the sense that a collective worry is being tapped into, with the desecration of Joan of Arc in one memorable line echoing the more recent destruction of the statue of Marianne \u2013 that other great symbol of France \u2013 in the unrest that beset the country in the winter of 2018. It is lyric as prognostication, somehow in tune with coming shockwaves.\n\nIt isn\u2019t all darkness, however. \u201cDon\u2019t Settle,\u201d one of the few tracks not recorded in France, retains the raw energy of the various tour sound checks which brought it to life. It offers not warning, but guidance, as it considers paths of original artistic voices -\nShane McGowan, Lisa O\u2019Neill, Woody Guthrie, and James Baldwin to name a few \u2013 and implores younger artists to stay the course. It finds its conclusion on the record\u2019s penultimate track, \u201cGood Life of Song,\u201d summing up the possibility inherent in the bardic path. For Hansard \u201cthere\u2019s joy and sorrow for me in this recording, where they meet is a hallowed spot.\u201d Alongside these is a trio of songs: \u201cBrother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d \u201cMary,\u201d\n\nand, \u201cThreading Water,\u201d each of which is presented so openly that it is easy forget that they are exploring private, intimate territory rarely seen in Hansard\u2019s lyrics. Here is Hansard at home in Ireland, rambling through October, preparing for winter. Here is a declaration of love, a poem put to song. Here is simple gratitude for a good life.\n\nThe album ends with the deceptively simple, \u201cLeave a Light...\u201d Lingering in the melody is the memory of a journey undertaken with friends, those living and those who have sailed on. And in the lyric is a path out, from disorder and discord, into the place where surrender and resolve meet. \u201cSo, say goodbye to the long, cold winter,\u201d Hansard sings, \u201cAnd farewell to all we\u2019ve left behind. Leave a light on and come out of the shadows.

A student of house music, Williams has accomplished a full sweep of merited recognition that has accelerated over the last five years.\nEmerging onto the house scene in 2010, T.Williams instantly marked himself as a breakthrough artist with a difference; his unique take on house music has been fruitful has in turn, rewarded him with a loyal allegiance of supporters. Whilst he may appear new to the house scene, Tesfa Williams is far from a newcomer to music with almost twenty years of experience behind him having cut his teeth in the grime scene as Dread.D.\n\nSigned at the tender age of 17 to Jon E Cash\u2019s Black Op\u2019s with \u2018Invasion\u2019, Williams went on to have mass success in the grime and bass world, selling thousands of singles worldwide. After a five year reign in the realm of grime, Williams found himself veering towards the world of house music.\n\nIn 2010 a number of zeitgeist releases from Williams proved too good to ignore, one such release was hit record \u2018Heartbeat\u2019 featuring vocalist Terri Walker. The track played extensively worldwide before settling in at no.2 as iTunes best dance track of the year. In 2011 T.Williams defined himself further by releasing solo works on his own Deep Teknologi imprint, Local Action and Pattern.\n\nWilliams\u2019 remixes for Maya Jane Coles, Charli XCX, Ben Westbeech and Skream were also received with high regard. The end of 2011 saw T.Williams receive a number of accolades and cemented his ability to carve out a career as a serious taste maker. He was nominated as \u2018Best Breakthrough DJ\u2019 by DJ Mag, named as one of the \u2018DJ Stars of 2012\u2019 by Time Out and picked by The Guardian for his Fact Magazine mix as one of their favourites of the year.\n\nIn 2012, two relationships came to the fore and propelled Williams to even greater heights. The first was his weekly show on the legendary London radio station, Rinse FM, a show that featured the likes of Jessie Ware, Soul Clap, MK, Dusky and Duke Dumont as guests; culminating in T mixing Rinse 21, one of the most vital of the renowned mix series to date.\n\nWith all of these accolades behind him T.Williams signed to PMR records in 2013 alongside the likes of Julio Bashmore & Disclosure. He gained a spot on the prestigious Radio 1 \u201cResidency\u201d which facilitated a number of bookings and performances at multiple clubs and festivals around the world, by the end of 2014 Williams had performed over 100 shows across 4 different continents. Having accumulated a global perspective from touring the world, the aficionado started a new Label \"Today,Tomorrow Records\u201d with the focus on releasing music from the pool of talented people he had made connections with over the years.\n\nThis lead to a massive collaboration with UK garage legend MJ Cole in 2015, on the labels first EP \u201cAcoustic Treatment\u201d which gained huge support from Radio 1\u2019s Danny Howard. This seal of approval saw Tesfa play at London's world renowned Fabric, in room 1 alongside Groove Armada and Moxie.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

Described by Mojo as \u201cunashamedly lush, lovely, classic pop\u201d, it featured in the magazine\u2019s Top 10 Americana Albums of 2019, garnering further praise across the board, including from the Scottish Express who awarded it a five-star review, declaring - as The Independent once did - that Bruntnell is \u201cone of the best songwriters in Britain\u201d.\n\nPeter Bruntnell has been receiving much the same consistently high praise, since his debut album Cannibal - released in 1995 through Almo Sounds. NME told its readers that \u201chis songs should be taught in schools\u201d; \u201cone of England's best kept musical secrets\u201d, said Rolling Stone; \u201cMelodically rich, lyrically ingenious and emotionally, intellectually affecting songs that bears comparison with the all-time greats\u201d, wrote The Guardian in their 2016 Cult Heroes feature on Bruntnell.\n\n2020 sees Peter Bruntnell re-join forces with London-based indie label Loose, to re-issue his influential and diverse catalogue, beginning in April with Peter\u2019s first 2 albums: Cannibal and Camelot In Smithereens. Both albums were originally released on Jerry Moss and Herb Albert\u2019s post A&M imprint Almo Sounds - the original home to Garbage and Gillian Welch amongst others. April also saw the release of Black Mountain UFO, a now very hard to find album originally released in 2011. All three albums are being made available digitally for the first time.\n\nOn Record Store Day 2020 Loose are releasing Bruntnell\u2019s seminal americana album Normal For Bridgwater. Upon release in June 1999, NME described it as \u201ca diabolic pact between Uncle Tupelo and The Eagles\u201d, whilst Mojo made it their Americana Album Of The Month, saying, \u201cI defy anyone not to be moved by the superb songwriting\u201d and The Independent told us that \u201cif this collection doesn\u2019t get him widespread recognition, then the world\u2019s an ugly place.

But it was in the sweaty climes of the Lock Up Stage at Reading and Leeds 2008 that his solo career really started to take off. Inside the packed out tents, heaving with adoring fans and intrigued passers-by, Frank led the congregation in a mass sing-a-long; a stirring set that not only sparked the interest of the British mainstream but resonated unassumingly across the pond as a wealth of American punk bands watched approvingly from the sidelines.\n\nNo stranger to the festival, Frank had not only played the Lock Up Tent with former hardcore band Million Dead back in 2005 but also as a tentative solo artist in 2007 when debut album \u2018Sleep Is For The Week\u2019 was just an underground success. Within the following year, Frank\u2019s popularity grew with yet more touring and the release of second album 'Love Ire & Song' in March 08. He started to play larger headline shows and develop the live band that he was looking for.\n\nThe profits of all his hard work came together that festival weekend; it kicked started a new wave of interest and thanks to the unwavering support from Radio 1 DJs Mike Davies and Steve Lamacq, the rest of Radio 1 began to follow suit. Soon enough when Frank\u2019s single 'Long Live The Queen' \u2013 taken from \u2018Love Ire & Song' \u2013 was released in October, it made the R1 C-list, was Single Of The Week on Sara Cox\u2019s show and helped sell out Frank\u2019s largest UK headline tour culminating in a bursting-over-capacity-finale at London\u2019s Scala. The following single 'Reasons Not To Be An Idiot' released in January of this year eclipsed those successes by graduating to the R1\u2019s B-list, 6Music\u2019s A-list and XFM\u2019s daytime playlist, prompted a Live Lounge session for Sara Cox, a Hub Session for George Lamb as well as making iTunes Single Of The Week all helping to recruit a new army of Frank followers.\n\nIt was also during this time that sections of the US punk fraternity began to take notice. Having watched the infamous Lock Up Stage set at Reading and Leeds, Vinnie from Less Than Jake got in contact asking to release 'The First Three Years' album (a collection of all early and previously unreleased material, live tracks and b-sides released in the UK in December 08 on his vinyl label Paper and Plastick. Chuck Ragan took him on the Revival Tour with Tim Barry across America, he did a few shows with up and coming stars Fake Problems and New Jersey boys The Gaslight Anthem invited him to support them on their huge UK and European dates in the early part of this year. It was evident that word was spreading throughout the punk scenes both sides of the Atlantic and by the time Frank flew in to Austin, Texas for the annual industry showcase SXSW in March, a whole new chapter in his story was about to begin.\n\nFrank\u2019s brand of folk songwriting, catchy melodies and punk passion had reached the ears of the CEO of US independent label Epitaph Records, Bad Religion\u2019s legendary guitarist: Brett Gurewitz. Excited by what he had heard and seen when Frank headlined LA\u2019s notorious Viper Rooms in March, Gurewitz got in contact and soon enough plans were formulated and a worldwide deal was inked. With loyalty and integrity firmly intact, Frank kept his relationship with his existing label Xtra Mile Recordings for all releases in the UK and Ireland and so the two labels will work closely for what will undoubtedly be an exciting new era in Frank\u2019s ever evolving career.\n\n\u201cFrank Turner\u2019s music is a revelation to me,\u201d says Gurewitz. \u201cI can\u2019t stop listening to it. It\u2019s a real privilege to get out there and help Xtra Mile spread the Frank Turner gospel.\u201d\n\nEpitaph is the perfect home for Frank. With its fiercely independent spirit, rich in punk and hardcore history it is also home to the song-writing talents of Nick Cave and Tom Waits on sister label Anti; mirroring Frank\u2019s cross-over appeal of punk ethics and strong song-writing abilities. Inspired by the likes of Bad Religion as a kid, this really is a dream come true for Frank.\n\nSo with this exciting plot in place the year ahead is looking pretty good. His third studio album, \u2018Poetry Of The Deed\u2019, released worldwide in September, sees Frank venture in a more rock direction recruiting his outstanding band for the recording process. Performing live has always been at the very heart of the Frank Turner experience and whilst he\u2019s still writing all the songs, they will be recorded live to help bring that experience to the album. Grammy nominated producer Alex Newport \u2013 who has previously worked with Death Cab For Cutie, At The Drive-In, Two Gallants \u2013 is on production duties after contacting Frank directly asking if they could work together. Coinciding nicely with the release are tours in America and Europe as well as the massive UK headline tour in October, where having previously supported The Gaslight Anthem at London\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, he will return triumphantly to headline for the last night of the tour.\n\nBefore that though, another summer of further touring and festivals lies ahead. He will jet off to the East Coast of America to support The Offspring for 12 dates of their tour in July, performing solo to potentially 30,000 people. He\u2019ll play at Camp Bestival and Jersey Live fest and return full circle to this year\u2019s Reading and Leeds Festival. This time, however, he will play the larger Radio 1/NME tent midway through the afternoon and judging by what happened last year it\u2019ll be another defining moment in this story of one beardy man and his acoustic guitar. The best is yet to come.", "otherInfo": "\"Be More Kind\" in full!\n\nThis show is a slightly different one. Free to watch, everyone welcome, I'll be encouraging people to buy records and merch, to keep @Xtra_Mile and my merch folks in house and home. It'll help me out too.\n\nWe'll be back to venues next week, but times being what they are, I hope people can forgive me for doing one show that's (partly) for my own benefit. Anyways.

Shorr was born and raised in Portland, Maine on July 11, 1994, where she was the youngest of seven children born to a single mother. Shorr soaked up a rich variety of influences from her siblings, and at the age of six, she began writing songs. At 13, Shorr learned to play guitar and gained experience playing in a rock band in Portland, singing Pink Floyd and Nirvana covers in a friend\u2019s basement. While she loved rock and pop, Shorr was certain that her future lay in country music after hearing Johnny Cash's cover of \"Hurt, originally by Nine Inch Nails. Determined to make her mark, Shorr took extra classes so she could graduate from high school early, and then held down two jobs at once so she could raise the money to move to Nashville.\n\nBy the time she was 19, Shorr had settled in Music City, and she landed a job at a hot dog stand while she searched for an audience to hear her songs. Things began looking up for Shorr when she became part of a weekly songwriter\u2019s showcase called Song Suffragettes that highlights the work of talented female singer/songwriters in Nashville. Song Suffragettes helped raise Shorr\u2019s profile which resulted in her first publishing deal, solidifying her dream of becoming a professional musician in Nashville.\n\nWith two of her fellow Suffragettes, Hailey Steele and Lena Stone, Shorr wrote a song about resilience titled \u201cFight Like A Girl\u201d and released it as an independent digital single in January 2016. The tune quickly won positive press and airplay on digital radio and social media sources with SiriusXM\u2019s The Highway channel naming Shorr a \u201cHighway Find\u201d and CMT making her part of their \u201cArtist Discovery\u201d program. With that momentum, she released The Y2K Mixtape, an eight-song collection of some of Shorr\u2019s earliest music that led to her becoming 2016\u2019s second best-selling debut female in all of country music (behind only Grammy-winner Maren Morris).\n\nAirplay of a second single, \u201cHe\u2019s Just Not That Into You\u201d, led into 2017 where Shorr and her next EP, Slingshot, received a barrage of critical acclaim from Rolling Stone Country (\u201cArtist You Need To Know\u201d), Taste of Country (\u201c2017\u2019s Hottest Artists Under 25\u201d), Sounds Like Nashville, Morning Hangover, Country Music Chat, Whiskey Riff and CMT. Teen Vogue came calling and in May 2017, the publication named Shorr one of \u201c10 Female Artists Who Are Changing the Music Game\u201d. She was the only country artist featured in their annual music issue which specifically dubbed Shorr \u201cThe New Nashville\u201d. Later that year, Kalie was named to the CMT Next Women of Country Class of 2018, a prestigious list that recognizes the newest and brightest female artists in country music.\n\nCreatively, Shorr spent most of 2017 writing songs and working on a new sound that infuses her country core with many of the rock influences she grew up on. Producer and songwriter Skip Black (Jana Kramer, Theory of a Deadman) helped her finally find the common thread that connects the big guitars of rock music to the story-telling and passion for lyric that cements her in country. It was a deep dive into song craftsmanship and sonic production that yielded her first 2018 single, \u201cTwo Hands\u201d, featured on Shorr\u2019s newest EP Awake.\n\nAmidst critical acclaim for her punk-country sound on Awake, Kalie was named one of the \u201cTop 10 Country Artists To Watch In 2018\u201d by the Huffington Post just as \u201cTwo Hands\u201d was added to prominent playlists at SiriusXM The Highway, Radio Disney Country, TuneIn's Country Roads, Pandora, Amazon Music and Apple Music. The \u201cTwo Hands\u201d music video was also added to CMT, GAC and to Vevo's DSCVR Country playlist.\n\nIn January 2018 after being inspired by speeches at the Golden Globe Awards, Kalie co-wrote a song called \u201cTimes-Up\u201d that went on to be recorded by 23 women of Song Suffragettes with an accompanying music video that received major press coverage from the Associated Press, Boston Globe, Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle, Voice of America and many more including a feature on Grammy.com.\n\nShorr recently wrapped the CMT Next Women of Country Tour with country superstars Sara Evans and RaeLynn and will continue extensive touring throughout the summer.\n\nIn May, Shorr was the only independent artist named to Taste of Country\u2019s \u201c2018 Hottest Artists Under 25\u201d list just as her brand new single \u201cCandy\u201d hit radio airwaves and streaming playlists.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "AWOLNATION ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10362006.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Indie, Indie Rock, Rock, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "AWOLNATION crafted one of the most influential songs in years with the chart-topping, record-breaking track 'Sail.'

Her freshly dropped album, \"Asymmetry\", has received rave reviews from critics, including The Georgia Straight, who decidedly named it their Album of the Week.

Songwriters Sima Cunnningham and Macie Stewart formed their unbreakable bond performing throughout the fringes of Chicago's many interlocking communities, collaborating with titans from the city's indie rock, hip-hop, and improvised worlds. But together, along with drummer Matt Carroll, they've stretched the boundaries of what guitar music can do starting with the band's experimental 2016 self-titled EP and their adventurous debut 2018 LP Parts. Now their longstanding partnership culminates with the stunning and muscular follow-up Fantasize Your Ghost.\n\nOhmme formed in 2014 as an outlet for Cunningham and Stewart to explore an unconventional approach to their instruments. \"That's the whole genesis of the band: us walking up to our guitars and saying, 'how can we make this noisemaker do something different?'\" says Cunningham. But as their musical collaboration strengthened, bringing Parts and intensive tours with acts like Wilco, Iron & Wine, Twin Peaks, and more, the band's scope and focus has also broadened. Fantasize Your Ghost is the direct result of the band spending more time on the road than in Chicago, a record deeply concerned with questions of the self, the future, and what home means when you're travelling all the time.\n\n\"Grinding on tour last year for so long, it can alter your mental state where you have to think about your life in a different way than you would if you're home. A lot of the songs stemmed from just thinking about all of the possibilities that life could be and could take,\" says Stewart. On the commanding single \"3 2 4 3,\" which tackles the terrifying realization of needing to make a change. The song opens with the two singing in transfixing harmony, \"Looked in the mirror the other day / Caught my reflection / My mouth had moved a different way / The muscles were straining.\" Their deft scene-setting and the way their disparate voices blend together heightens the song's inherent anxiety. Later, they sing, \"Filling the holes to make amends / Tearing them up to start again.\" These moments of emotional clarity fill Fantasize Your Ghost.\n\nWritten across 2019, early sketches of the album's tracklist were demoed at Sam Evian's Flying Cloud Studios in upstate New York. \"That's where we really started to see the record come together,\" says Cunningham. The sessions were intensely collaborative and open: the product of long, existential conversations between Stewart and Cunningham in the van about their lives and how to channel the anger they were feeling about the state of the world. Tracks like the driving opener \"Flood Your Gut\" underwent several revisions with Ohmme uncovering several new directions the song could go before finishing it. The refrain \"your whole vision's not enough\" is a call to action, says Cunningham. \"Do you want to be someone who can disconnect or someone who is hyper-engaged and present?\"\n\nFantasize Your Ghost was recorded over a six day session in August 2019 when the band decamped to the Post Farm in southern Wisconsin, where Cunningham runs a yearly DIY music festival. With indie rock journeyman producer Chris Cohen and the idyllic setting just outside Chicago, the songs came to vibrant life. Though Parts showcased their wildly burgeoning influences and talents, Fantasize Your Ghost captures the astounding magnetism and ferocity of their live show. \"Selling Candy\" is the perfect example. It's a small snapshot of childhood complete with nostalgic references to summertime hot dogs and wandering the city but set to an explosive, stadium-ready fuzzed-out arrangement. Elsewhere, songs like the dystopian dance rocker \"The Limit\" further stretch their already dynamic palette.\n\nFantasize Your Ghost encapsulates the thrilling and sometimes terrifying joy of moving forward even if you don't know where you're going. It's an album that asks necessary questions: When life demands a crossroads, what version of yourself are you going to pursue? What part of yourself will you feed and let flourish and what do you have to let go of? When they sing, \"Just walk out the door and / Don\u2019t tell them goodbye\" it's drastic but also exhilaratingly hopeful. This is a record of strength, of best friends believing in each other. Unapologetic and brave, Ohmme are ready to figure it all out together.", "otherInfo": "Ohmme live on Dr Martens Instagram - Stay In Series #drmartenspresents\n\n5/21 at 2pm PST/4pm CT"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Arielle Silver ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10247758.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Americana, Indie Folk, Alt-country", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Arielle Silver crafts songs that are luminous, literate, and alive. A Thousand Tiny Torches, the singer-songwriter\u2019s new Indie Folk Americana collection, is a testament to her renewal of inspiration, the rekindling of dreams, and the redemptive power and connective compassion that defines her artistry.\n\nHer rich, expressive alto voice frames expansive melodies that echo the American heartland. Now based in Los Angeles, Arielle knows this geography well. A performing itinerary transported her from Club Passim in her adopted hometown of Boston to venues including Eddie\u2019s Attic in Atlanta and Nashville\u2019s 12th & Porter, plus stops to the Southwest, as she steered a vegetable oil-fueled vehicle across Texas to Abilene, Odessa and Austin.\n\nTen years ago, with three well-received releases accompanied by national tours, she lost sight of her future as an artist. \u201cThough my heart still ached to write songs and sing, I found that I couldn't do it anymore,\u201d she recalls.\n\nArielle moved to the City of the Angels. She divorced and remarried, taught yoga philosophy, and worked behind the scenes in the music industry. She penned and published essays and poems, and was nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best New Poets. She baked innumerable pies. After being rejected for a PhD program, she constructed a blue \u201cshe shed\u201d in her backyard. And it was in this rustic space \u2013 surrounded by 47 volumes of her journals \u2013 that she rekindled her love for music and dedicated herself to writing one song per week.\n\nThe result is A Thousand Tiny Torches. Produced by Shane Alexander, the project is propelled by the masterful playing of a sterling cast of players with credits from Lady Gaga to KT Tunstall to Lukas Nelson: Denny Weston Jr., drums; Carl Byron, keyboards; Darby Orr, bass; Jesse Siebenberg, steel guitar; and Mike Mullins on mandolin. Michael Gehring tracked the project at Secret World Studios in Los Angeles in the famous Sound City Studios complex, and GRAMMY-winners Brian Yaskulka and Hans DeKline mixed and mastered, respectively. A loyal group of supporters funded the recording through a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nA consummate storyteller, Arielle\u2019s narratives crosscut exacting details with universal themes. On the lead single \u201cWhat Really Matters,\u201d she recalls a harrowing season in Southern California as gunshots ricocheted through a country bar and the surrounding hills ignited with apocalyptic wildfires.\n\nIn contrast are incandescent songs with characters and conversations etched in fine lines and deep empathy. Vivid imagery glows with headlights, porch lights, lighthouses, bolts of lightning, fireflies, and stars that have been shining for ten billion years.\n\nAfter launching her return with a holiday single, Arielle is now back onstage at house concerts and listening rooms, including the fabled Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Hollywood. Plans are underway for West Coast tours and upcoming dates in Boston. This time, she says, she is doing it for the right reasons. \u201cWhen I was younger I was performing,\u201d she confirms. \u201cNow, I\u2019m connecting.\"\n\nArielle Silver says that when she made her break with music, her ambition for everything stopped. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see the future. It was beautiful. I became so present in a way I never had been before, and the sense of being present lasted for a long time.\u201d Now, in themes that speak to losing and rediscovering the path, emerges a musical alchemy of renewal and rebirth: A loving light that is reflected from A Thousand Tiny Torches.", "otherInfo": "Join the livestream here: http://instagram.com/ariellesilver\n\nTomes & Tunes is a weekly Instagram series, hosted by Arielle Silver, where songwriters talk books and swap songs.\n\nEpisode 4 features guest songwriter, Crissie McCree.\n\nFollow \"Arielle Silver\" on Instagram (@ariellesilver) to watch episode #4.\n\nCatch previous episodes on @ariellesilver IGTV."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Emily Rose Official ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9378857.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Country, Alt-country, Pop, Americana", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A voice reminiscent of Emmy Lou, with the honesty of Linda Ronstadt, Emily Rose invites you in with every line.\nShe\u2019s a jangly, retro country singer, focusing on the true grit of the songs she believes in.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sharam ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10389163.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Techno, Deep House, Progressive And Everything In Between, Tech-house", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Continuously reimagining his sound and style, the Grammy-winning artist Sharam digs deep into his bag of production tricks for his new project Collecti (pronounced \u201ccollect-eye\u201d), drawing heavily from the darker influences of techno.

The way their voices blend together in song conjures an imagined romance, much like their own. Before they met, Benjamin and Mia worked hard at their craft but each felt separately, something was missing. Their first songwriting session together, in 2004, led to the discovery that what they were missing was each other. Fast forward to today, they have now released five studio albums, one live album, were named semi-finalists at the 2018 International Songwriting Competition, and were nominated at the 2018 International Acoustic Music Awards.\n\nTheir most recent project, \u201cLive at Home\u201d was recorded in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, at a house concert in Azalea\u2019s living room. The recording captures the acoustic heart and soul of six songs from their 2017 studio release, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, two new original songs, and a cover of \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d, from the motion picture \u201cOnce\u201d. Tickets were sold as a crowdfunding perk to help raise funds to record the aforementioned studio release.\n\n\u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was released on October 13, 2017 and was supported by a multi-province 2 week tour. Written and recorded in their home studio, this project features love songs, beautiful vocal harmony and showcases Benjamin & Mia\u2019s musical abilities. The album sits comfortably in the \u201cContemporary Roots\u201d genre featuring songs that borrow from North American and Eastern European folk traditions, as well as conventional pop sensibilities.\n\n\u201cI See The Church\u201d from the album \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was nominated at the 2018 IAMA (International Acoustic Music Awards) in the \u201cBest Group/Duo\u201d category .\n\nHamilton Blues Lovers Blog has this to say about the album,\n\n\u201cHamilton musical duo, Azalea keeps growing with every recording and their latest, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d proves it. The production is amazing and they\u2019ve created a fabulous melding of pop and roots music. Their lush vocal harmonies flow through the entire album as the sometimes infectious and always beautiful melodies bolster the sound. It\u2019s a perfect mix of vocals and music that can\u2019t help but effect you emotionally\u2026\u201d\n\nIn May 2015 Azalea was hand picked by GigSalad & CD Baby to play their junket for Canadian Music Week in Toronto, Ontario. In honour of this occasion, Azalea recorded and released a limited edition EP called \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d. As a salute to GigSalad & CD Baby\u2019s DIY methodology, \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d was made completely in house with fabric bound hand packaging.\n\nIn 2013, Azalea released the EP \"Inside Out\". An album which streamlined their folk- tinged pop sound and showcased songs to tug at the heart strings with haunting melodic and harmonic lines. Reminiscent of The Civil Wars, and Fleetwood Mac \u201cInside Out\u201d shed light on Azalea\u2019s Alt-Country side. The pitch for its successful crowd- funding campaign gave some insight into their work:\n\n\". . . it has always been our goal to release quality music that is culturally relevant and speaks to the heart. . . . However, we wanted to take listeners on a journey beyond the routine of everyday life to the place that connects them with their emotions, beliefs, and values in a real way.\u201d\n\nIn late 2012 Azalea released \u201cAt the End of This Year...\u201d, their seasonal single which has received the nod of approval from CBC radio.\n\nAzalea\u2019s 2010 release, \u201cCoffee & Kisses EP\", was among the top three finalists for Recording of the Year, Rock Recording of the Year, Instrumentalist of the Year, and Producer of the Year at the 2010 Durham Region Music Awards. The album was featured in prominent music magazines and generated good response from college radio across Ontario.\n\nYears before anyone knew Benjamin & Mia Hackett as Azalea, they performed, travelled, and recorded an album as Benjamin & Mia. \u201cThe Carousel of Life\u201d (2007) is the root of their love for each other and for their musical life together. That first album thrust them into the life they know, love, and hope to express in song, to every listener.\n\nAzalea\u2019s chemistry is undeniable - their stage presence magnetic! To experience Azalea in concert is to be invited into their love story. They will will draw you in and pull on your hearts strings. Azalea will take you on an emotional rollercoaster as they move through their repertoire of simple & sweet love songs, then take you south with swampy tunes which are full of rich vocal harmony and live looping.

But his highest point on the Opry was playing it with sons Jonathan and Nathan, which they have done twice .\n\nIn 1971 John initiated what Rolling Stone called 'the' most important record to come out of Nashville, and what the 2004 ZAGAT survey called the most important record in country music, \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken.\" Asking both Earl Scruggs and then (10 days later) Doc Watson if they would record with the band was followed by his brother Bill lining up Merle Travis. This started the ball rolling and shortly Louise Scruggs then helped line up, at their request, Jimmy Martin, Maybelle Carter, and Roy Acuff..Earl Scruggs secured Vassar Clements and Junior Huskey, and the NGDB went to Nashville in August of '71 to make what would become an historic album, released on United Artists Records in spring of 1972.\n\nAs a multi-instrumentalist (banjo, guitar, mandolin, fiddle) and solo entertainer, John McEuen plays to the boomer/'old hippie' crowd and the traditional/bluegrass and folk audience, as well as the older country audience... and now the younger group is showing up to see 'where it all came from'.\n\nJohn has made over 40 albums (six solo) that have earned four platinum and four gold recognition awards, Grammy nominations and awards, CMA and ACM awards, Western Heritage Award, Emmy nomination, and IBMA record of the year award.

A student of house music, Williams has accomplished a full sweep of merited recognition that has accelerated over the last five years.\nEmerging onto the house scene in 2010, T.Williams instantly marked himself as a breakthrough artist with a difference; his unique take on house music has been fruitful has in turn, rewarded him with a loyal allegiance of supporters. Whilst he may appear new to the house scene, Tesfa Williams is far from a newcomer to music with almost twenty years of experience behind him having cut his teeth in the grime scene as Dread.D.\n\nSigned at the tender age of 17 to Jon E Cash\u2019s Black Op\u2019s with \u2018Invasion\u2019, Williams went on to have mass success in the grime and bass world, selling thousands of singles worldwide. After a five year reign in the realm of grime, Williams found himself veering towards the world of house music.\n\nIn 2010 a number of zeitgeist releases from Williams proved too good to ignore, one such release was hit record \u2018Heartbeat\u2019 featuring vocalist Terri Walker. The track played extensively worldwide before settling in at no.2 as iTunes best dance track of the year. In 2011 T.Williams defined himself further by releasing solo works on his own Deep Teknologi imprint, Local Action and Pattern.\n\nWilliams\u2019 remixes for Maya Jane Coles, Charli XCX, Ben Westbeech and Skream were also received with high regard. The end of 2011 saw T.Williams receive a number of accolades and cemented his ability to carve out a career as a serious taste maker. He was nominated as \u2018Best Breakthrough DJ\u2019 by DJ Mag, named as one of the \u2018DJ Stars of 2012\u2019 by Time Out and picked by The Guardian for his Fact Magazine mix as one of their favourites of the year.\n\nIn 2012, two relationships came to the fore and propelled Williams to even greater heights. The first was his weekly show on the legendary London radio station, Rinse FM, a show that featured the likes of Jessie Ware, Soul Clap, MK, Dusky and Duke Dumont as guests; culminating in T mixing Rinse 21, one of the most vital of the renowned mix series to date.\n\nWith all of these accolades behind him T.Williams signed to PMR records in 2013 alongside the likes of Julio Bashmore & Disclosure. He gained a spot on the prestigious Radio 1 \u201cResidency\u201d which facilitated a number of bookings and performances at multiple clubs and festivals around the world, by the end of 2014 Williams had performed over 100 shows across 4 different continents. Having accumulated a global perspective from touring the world, the aficionado started a new Label \"Today,Tomorrow Records\u201d with the focus on releasing music from the pool of talented people he had made connections with over the years.\n\nThis lead to a massive collaboration with UK garage legend MJ Cole in 2015, on the labels first EP \u201cAcoustic Treatment\u201d which gained huge support from Radio 1\u2019s Danny Howard.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "FLETT ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10359317.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Virtual weekly open mic hosted by FLETT and Infireworks Music."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Norman Brannon ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tim Burgess ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8263503.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tim Burgess (born Timothy Allan Burgess on May 30, 1967, in Salford, Lancashire, England) is the lead singer of British rock/indie act The Charlatans.

NME told its readers that \u201chis songs should be taught in schools\u201d; \u201cone of England's best kept musical secrets\u201d, said Rolling Stone; \u201cMelodically rich, lyrically ingenious and emotionally, intellectually affecting songs that bears comparison with the all-time greats\u201d, wrote The Guardian in their 2016 Cult Heroes feature on Bruntnell.\n\n2020 sees Peter Bruntnell re-join forces with London-based indie label Loose, to re-issue his influential and diverse catalogue, beginning in April with Peter\u2019s first 2 albums: Cannibal and Camelot In Smithereens. Both albums were originally released on Jerry Moss and Herb Albert\u2019s post A&M imprint Almo Sounds - the original home to Garbage and Gillian Welch amongst others. April also saw the release of Black Mountain UFO, a now very hard to find album originally released in 2011. All three albums are being made available digitally for the first time.\n\nOn Record Store Day 2020 Loose are releasing Bruntnell\u2019s seminal americana album Normal For Bridgwater. Upon release in June 1999, NME described it as \u201ca diabolic pact between Uncle Tupelo and The Eagles\u201d, whilst Mojo made it their Americana Album Of The Month, saying, \u201cI defy anyone not to be moved by the superb songwriting\u201d and The Independent told us that \u201cif this collection doesn\u2019t get him widespread recognition, then the world\u2019s an ugly place.

The limited edition white vinyl release of Normal For Bridgwater will be available exclusively for Record Store Day 2020.\n\nPraise for Bruntnell also comes from the likes of musician and author Willy Vlautin (The Delines, Richmond Fontaine), who frequently states that \u201cPeter Bruntnell is my favourite singer in the world\u201d, with Jay Farrar (Son Volt, Uncle Tupelo) and Peter Buck (REM) also amongst his fans.

But it was in the sweaty climes of the Lock Up Stage at Reading and Leeds 2008 that his solo career really started to take off. Inside the packed out tents, heaving with adoring fans and intrigued passers-by, Frank led the congregation in a mass sing-a-long; a stirring set that not only sparked the interest of the British mainstream but resonated unassumingly across the pond as a wealth of American punk bands watched approvingly from the sidelines.\n\nNo stranger to the festival, Frank had not only played the Lock Up Tent with former hardcore band Million Dead back in 2005 but also as a tentative solo artist in 2007 when debut album \u2018Sleep Is For The Week\u2019 was just an underground success. Within the following year, Frank\u2019s popularity grew with yet more touring and the release of second album 'Love Ire & Song' in March 08. He started to play larger headline shows and develop the live band that he was looking for.\n\nThe profits of all his hard work came together that festival weekend; it kicked started a new wave of interest and thanks to the unwavering support from Radio 1 DJs Mike Davies and Steve Lamacq, the rest of Radio 1 began to follow suit. Soon enough when Frank\u2019s single 'Long Live The Queen' \u2013 taken from \u2018Love Ire & Song' \u2013 was released in October, it made the R1 C-list, was Single Of The Week on Sara Cox\u2019s show and helped sell out Frank\u2019s largest UK headline tour culminating in a bursting-over-capacity-finale at London\u2019s Scala. The following single 'Reasons Not To Be An Idiot' released in January of this year eclipsed those successes by graduating to the R1\u2019s B-list, 6Music\u2019s A-list and XFM\u2019s daytime playlist, prompted a Live Lounge session for Sara Cox, a Hub Session for George Lamb as well as making iTunes Single Of The Week all helping to recruit a new army of Frank followers.\n\nIt was also during this time that sections of the US punk fraternity began to take notice. Having watched the infamous Lock Up Stage set at Reading and Leeds, Vinnie from Less Than Jake got in contact asking to release 'The First Three Years' album (a collection of all early and previously unreleased material, live tracks and b-sides released in the UK in December 08 on his vinyl label Paper and Plastick. Chuck Ragan took him on the Revival Tour with Tim Barry across America, he did a few shows with up and coming stars Fake Problems and New Jersey boys The Gaslight Anthem invited him to support them on their huge UK and European dates in the early part of this year. It was evident that word was spreading throughout the punk scenes both sides of the Atlantic and by the time Frank flew in to Austin, Texas for the annual industry showcase SXSW in March, a whole new chapter in his story was about to begin.\n\nFrank\u2019s brand of folk songwriting, catchy melodies and punk passion had reached the ears of the CEO of US independent label Epitaph Records, Bad Religion\u2019s legendary guitarist: Brett Gurewitz. Excited by what he had heard and seen when Frank headlined LA\u2019s notorious Viper Rooms in March, Gurewitz got in contact and soon enough plans were formulated and a worldwide deal was inked. With loyalty and integrity firmly intact, Frank kept his relationship with his existing label Xtra Mile Recordings for all releases in the UK and Ireland and so the two labels will work closely for what will undoubtedly be an exciting new era in Frank\u2019s ever evolving career.\n\n\u201cFrank Turner\u2019s music is a revelation to me,\u201d says Gurewitz. \u201cI can\u2019t stop listening to it. It\u2019s a real privilege to get out there and help Xtra Mile spread the Frank Turner gospel.\u201d\n\nEpitaph is the perfect home for Frank. With its fiercely independent spirit, rich in punk and hardcore history it is also home to the song-writing talents of Nick Cave and Tom Waits on sister label Anti; mirroring Frank\u2019s cross-over appeal of punk ethics and strong song-writing abilities. Inspired by the likes of Bad Religion as a kid, this really is a dream come true for Frank.\n\nSo with this exciting plot in place the year ahead is looking pretty good. His third studio album, \u2018Poetry Of The Deed\u2019, released worldwide in September, sees Frank venture in a more rock direction recruiting his outstanding band for the recording process. Performing live has always been at the very heart of the Frank Turner experience and whilst he\u2019s still writing all the songs, they will be recorded live to help bring that experience to the album. Grammy nominated producer Alex Newport \u2013 who has previously worked with Death Cab For Cutie, At The Drive-In, Two Gallants \u2013 is on production duties after contacting Frank directly asking if they could work together. Coinciding nicely with the release are tours in America and Europe as well as the massive UK headline tour in October, where having previously supported The Gaslight Anthem at London\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, he will return triumphantly to headline for the last night of the tour.\n\nBefore that though, another summer of further touring and festivals lies ahead. He will jet off to the East Coast of America to support The Offspring for 12 dates of their tour in July, performing solo to potentially 30,000 people. He\u2019ll play at Camp Bestival and Jersey Live fest and return full circle to this year\u2019s Reading and Leeds Festival. This time, however, he will play the larger Radio 1/NME tent midway through the afternoon and judging by what happened last year it\u2019ll be another defining moment in this story of one beardy man and his acoustic guitar. The best is yet to come.", "otherInfo": "\"Be More Kind\" in full!\n\nThis show is a slightly different one. Free to watch, everyone welcome, I'll be encouraging people to buy records and merch, to keep @Xtra_Mile and my merch folks in house and home.

Song Suffragettes helped raise Shorr\u2019s profile which resulted in her first publishing deal, solidifying her dream of becoming a professional musician in Nashville.\n\nWith two of her fellow Suffragettes, Hailey Steele and Lena Stone, Shorr wrote a song about resilience titled \u201cFight Like A Girl\u201d and released it as an independent digital single in January 2016. The tune quickly won positive press and airplay on digital radio and social media sources with SiriusXM\u2019s The Highway channel naming Shorr a \u201cHighway Find\u201d and CMT making her part of their \u201cArtist Discovery\u201d program. With that momentum, she released The Y2K Mixtape, an eight-song collection of some of Shorr\u2019s earliest music that led to her becoming 2016\u2019s second best-selling debut female in all of country music (behind only Grammy-winner Maren Morris).\n\nAirplay of a second single, \u201cHe\u2019s Just Not That Into You\u201d, led into 2017 where Shorr and her next EP, Slingshot, received a barrage of critical acclaim from Rolling Stone Country (\u201cArtist You Need To Know\u201d), Taste of Country (\u201c2017\u2019s Hottest Artists Under 25\u201d), Sounds Like Nashville, Morning Hangover, Country Music Chat, Whiskey Riff and CMT. Teen Vogue came calling and in May 2017, the publication named Shorr one of \u201c10 Female Artists Who Are Changing the Music Game\u201d. She was the only country artist featured in their annual music issue which specifically dubbed Shorr \u201cThe New Nashville\u201d. Later that year, Kalie was named to the CMT Next Women of Country Class of 2018, a prestigious list that recognizes the newest and brightest female artists in country music.\n\nCreatively, Shorr spent most of 2017 writing songs and working on a new sound that infuses her country core with many of the rock influences she grew up on. Producer and songwriter Skip Black (Jana Kramer, Theory of a Deadman) helped her finally find the common thread that connects the big guitars of rock music to the story-telling and passion for lyric that cements her in country. It was a deep dive into song craftsmanship and sonic production that yielded her first 2018 single, \u201cTwo Hands\u201d, featured on Shorr\u2019s newest EP Awake.\n\nAmidst critical acclaim for her punk-country sound on Awake, Kalie was named one of the \u201cTop 10 Country Artists To Watch In 2018\u201d by the Huffington Post just as \u201cTwo Hands\u201d was added to prominent playlists at SiriusXM The Highway, Radio Disney Country, TuneIn's Country Roads, Pandora, Amazon Music and Apple Music. The \u201cTwo Hands\u201d music video was also added to CMT, GAC and to Vevo's DSCVR Country playlist.\n\nIn January 2018 after being inspired by speeches at the Golden Globe Awards, Kalie co-wrote a song called \u201cTimes-Up\u201d that went on to be recorded by 23 women of Song Suffragettes with an accompanying music video that received major press coverage from the Associated Press, Boston Globe, Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle, Voice of America and many more including a feature on Grammy.com.\n\nShorr recently wrapped the CMT Next Women of Country Tour with country superstars Sara Evans and RaeLynn and will continue extensive touring throughout the summer.\n\nIn May, Shorr was the only independent artist named to Taste of Country\u2019s \u201c2018 Hottest Artists Under 25\u201d list just as her brand new single \u201cCandy\u201d hit radio airwaves and streaming playlists.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "AWOLNATION ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10362006.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Indie, Indie Rock, Rock, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "AWOLNATION crafted one of the most influential songs in years with the chart-topping, record-breaking track 'Sail.'

With the NGDB he has played over 8,500 shows - and performed 2500+ solo in addition to that - and flown 3 million miles to do it. McEuen has performed on over 300 television shows. At the end of the 50th NGDB tour John left the group to fill the demand for his own shows and solo work.\n\nHis recent Made in Brooklyn album on the prestigious Chesky Records - with many star performers sitting in - was Stereophile Magazine's Record of the Month.\n\nOne of his particular points of pride has been performing on the Grand Ole Opry - featured numerous times solo, and as a guest with several other Opry member acts; he brought Steve Martin there in 2010 for the Opry debut of The Crow. But his highest point on the Opry was playing it with sons Jonathan and Nathan, which they have done twice .\n\nIn 1971 John initiated what Rolling Stone called 'the' most important record to come out of Nashville, and what the 2004 ZAGAT survey called the most important record in country music, \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken.\" Asking both Earl Scruggs and then (10 days later) Doc Watson if they would record with the band was followed by his brother Bill lining up Merle Travis. This started the ball rolling and shortly Louise Scruggs then helped line up, at their request, Jimmy Martin, Maybelle Carter, and Roy Acuff..Earl Scruggs secured Vassar Clements and Junior Huskey, and the NGDB went to Nashville in August of '71 to make what would become an historic album, released on United Artists Records in spring of 1972.\n\nAs a multi-instrumentalist (banjo, guitar, mandolin, fiddle) and solo entertainer, John McEuen plays to the boomer/'old hippie' crowd and the traditional/bluegrass and folk audience, as well as the older country audience... and now the younger group is showing up to see 'where it all came from'.\n\nJohn has made over 40 albums (six solo) that have earned four platinum and four gold recognition awards, Grammy nominations and awards, CMA and ACM awards, Western Heritage Award, Emmy nomination, and IBMA record of the year award. In addition, John has performed on another 25 albums as guest artist. As 'a presenter', McEuen has produced over 250 concerts (his first one was Bob Dylan in 1965 at a long Beach high school).\n\nJohn has known and worked with Steve Martin since high school years to the present. They both worked in Disneyland's Magic Shop as teenagers. John scored Steve's television specials, and arranged his music; Recently, John's production of Steve's album The Crow - New Songs for the five-string banjo won the Grammy for Best Bluegrass album.\n\nJohn's own XM Satellite radio show, Acoustic Traveller on The Bridge, runs twice a month and is in its 10th year.\n\nMcEuen created the music scores for 14 film/television projects, including the Emmy nominated 10-hour mini-series for Warner Bros. 'The Wild West.'\n\\\nJohn is also CEO of SyndicatedNews.Net\n\nJohn has also raised his six kids (five boys and a girl) ages between 38-48, and a 34-year-old stepson.\n\nSome of the artists John McEuen has performed or recorded with include: Dolly Parton, Steve Martin, Willie Nelson, Bill Wyman, Johnny Cash, June Carter Cash, Jerry Garcia, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Phish, Jerry Jeff Walker, Kevin Nealon, Alison Krauss, Bill Cosby, Stephen Wright, Mark OConnor, Tommy Lee Jones, Sissy Spacek, Linda Ronstadt, Leon Russell, Maybelle Carter, Kris Kristofferson, Bob Dylan, Kenny Rogers, Steve Vai, Doc Watson, Jimmy Buffett, The Smothers Brothers, Rowan & Martin, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Bobby Sherman, Jose Feliciano, Allman Brothers, John Denver, Roy Acuff, Earl Scruggs, Jack Benny, Glen Campbell, Steve Goodman, Waylon Jennings, Robin Williams, Little River Band, Marshall Tucker Band, Doobie Brothers, Andy Williams, Merle Travis, Vassar Clements, Dizzy Gillespie, The Osmond Brothers, Everly Brothers, Crystal Gayle, Gary Morris, Doug Kershaw, Michael Martin Murphey, The Doors, Donovan, Lee Marvin, Ramblin Jack Elliot, David Amram, Arlo Guthrie, America, Bill Monroe, and Asleep at the Wheel and dozens more...\n\nA large percentage of his performances now include multi-media, as he goes out as described below:\n\nMcEuen - brings his banjo, guitar, fiddle, and mandolin - to share his music and memories of his 55-year life in music.

A Thousand Tiny Torches, the singer-songwriter\u2019s new Indie Folk Americana collection, is a testament to her renewal of inspiration, the rekindling of dreams, and the redemptive power and connective compassion that defines her artistry.\n\nHer rich, expressive alto voice frames expansive melodies that echo the American heartland. Now based in Los Angeles, Arielle knows this geography well. A performing itinerary transported her from Club Passim in her adopted hometown of Boston to venues including Eddie\u2019s Attic in Atlanta and Nashville\u2019s 12th & Porter, plus stops to the Southwest, as she steered a vegetable oil-fueled vehicle across Texas to Abilene, Odessa and Austin.\n\nTen years ago, with three well-received releases accompanied by national tours, she lost sight of her future as an artist. \u201cThough my heart still ached to write songs and sing, I found that I couldn't do it anymore,\u201d she recalls.\n\nArielle moved to the City of the Angels. She divorced and remarried, taught yoga philosophy, and worked behind the scenes in the music industry. She penned and published essays and poems, and was nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best New Poets. She baked innumerable pies. After being rejected for a PhD program, she constructed a blue \u201cshe shed\u201d in her backyard. And it was in this rustic space \u2013 surrounded by 47 volumes of her journals \u2013 that she rekindled her love for music and dedicated herself to writing one song per week.\n\nThe result is A Thousand Tiny Torches. Produced by Shane Alexander, the project is propelled by the masterful playing of a sterling cast of players with credits from Lady Gaga to KT Tunstall to Lukas Nelson: Denny Weston Jr., drums; Carl Byron, keyboards; Darby Orr, bass; Jesse Siebenberg, steel guitar; and Mike Mullins on mandolin. Michael Gehring tracked the project at Secret World Studios in Los Angeles in the famous Sound City Studios complex, and GRAMMY-winners Brian Yaskulka and Hans DeKline mixed and mastered, respectively. A loyal group of supporters funded the recording through a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nA consummate storyteller, Arielle\u2019s narratives crosscut exacting details with universal themes. On the lead single \u201cWhat Really Matters,\u201d she recalls a harrowing season in Southern California as gunshots ricocheted through a country bar and the surrounding hills ignited with apocalyptic wildfires.\n\nIn contrast are incandescent songs with characters and conversations etched in fine lines and deep empathy. Vivid imagery glows with headlights, porch lights, lighthouses, bolts of lightning, fireflies, and stars that have been shining for ten billion years.\n\nAfter launching her return with a holiday single, Arielle is now back onstage at house concerts and listening rooms, including the fabled Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Hollywood. Plans are underway for West Coast tours and upcoming dates in Boston. This time, she says, she is doing it for the right reasons. \u201cWhen I was younger I was performing,\u201d she confirms. \u201cNow, I\u2019m connecting.\"\n\nArielle Silver says that when she made her break with music, her ambition for everything stopped. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see the future. It was beautiful. I became so present in a way I never had been before, and the sense of being present lasted for a long time.\u201d Now, in themes that speak to losing and rediscovering the path, emerges a musical alchemy of renewal and rebirth: A loving light that is reflected from A Thousand Tiny Torches.", "otherInfo": "Join the livestream here: http://instagram.com/ariellesilver\n\nTomes & Tunes is a weekly Instagram series, hosted by Arielle Silver, where songwriters talk books and swap songs.\n\nEpisode 4 features guest songwriter, Crissie McCree.\n\nFollow \"Arielle Silver\" on Instagram (@ariellesilver) to watch episode #4.\n\nCatch previous episodes on @ariellesilver IGTV."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Emily Rose Official ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9378857.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Country, Alt-country, Pop, Americana", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A voice reminiscent of Emmy Lou, with the honesty of Linda Ronstadt, Emily Rose invites you in with every line.\nShe\u2019s a jangly, retro country singer, focusing on the true grit of the songs she believes in.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sharam ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10389163.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Techno, Deep House, Progressive And Everything In Between, Tech-house", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Continuously reimagining his sound and style, the Grammy-winning artist Sharam digs deep into his bag of production tricks for his new project Collecti (pronounced \u201ccollect-eye\u201d), drawing heavily from the darker influences of techno.

The way their voices blend together in song conjures an imagined romance, much like their own. Before they met, Benjamin and Mia worked hard at their craft but each felt separately, something was missing. Their first songwriting session together, in 2004, led to the discovery that what they were missing was each other. Fast forward to today, they have now released five studio albums, one live album, were named semi-finalists at the 2018 International Songwriting Competition, and were nominated at the 2018 International Acoustic Music Awards.\n\nTheir most recent project, \u201cLive at Home\u201d was recorded in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, at a house concert in Azalea\u2019s living room. The recording captures the acoustic heart and soul of six songs from their 2017 studio release, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, two new original songs, and a cover of \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d, from the motion picture \u201cOnce\u201d. Tickets were sold as a crowdfunding perk to help raise funds to record the aforementioned studio release.\n\n\u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was released on October 13, 2017 and was supported by a multi-province 2 week tour. Written and recorded in their home studio, this project features love songs, beautiful vocal harmony and showcases Benjamin & Mia\u2019s musical abilities. The album sits comfortably in the \u201cContemporary Roots\u201d genre featuring songs that borrow from North American and Eastern European folk traditions, as well as conventional pop sensibilities.\n\n\u201cI See The Church\u201d from the album \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was nominated at the 2018 IAMA (International Acoustic Music Awards) in the \u201cBest Group/Duo\u201d category .\n\nHamilton Blues Lovers Blog has this to say about the album,\n\n\u201cHamilton musical duo, Azalea keeps growing with every recording and their latest, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d proves it. The production is amazing and they\u2019ve created a fabulous melding of pop and roots music. Their lush vocal harmonies flow through the entire album as the sometimes infectious and always beautiful melodies bolster the sound. It\u2019s a perfect mix of vocals and music that can\u2019t help but effect you emotionally\u2026\u201d\n\nIn May 2015 Azalea was hand picked by GigSalad & CD Baby to play their junket for Canadian Music Week in Toronto, Ontario. In honour of this occasion, Azalea recorded and released a limited edition EP called \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d. As a salute to GigSalad & CD Baby\u2019s DIY methodology, \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d was made completely in house with fabric bound hand packaging.\n\nIn 2013, Azalea released the EP \"Inside Out\". An album which streamlined their folk- tinged pop sound and showcased songs to tug at the heart strings with haunting melodic and harmonic lines. Reminiscent of The Civil Wars, and Fleetwood Mac \u201cInside Out\u201d shed light on Azalea\u2019s Alt-Country side. The pitch for its successful crowd- funding campaign gave some insight into their work:\n\n\". . . it has always been our goal to release quality music that is culturally relevant and speaks to the heart. . . . However, we wanted to take listeners on a journey beyond the routine of everyday life to the place that connects them with their emotions, beliefs, and values in a real way.\u201d\n\nIn late 2012 Azalea released \u201cAt the End of This Year...\u201d, their seasonal single which has received the nod of approval from CBC radio.\n\nAzalea\u2019s 2010 release, \u201cCoffee & Kisses EP\", was among the top three finalists for Recording of the Year, Rock Recording of the Year, Instrumentalist of the Year, and Producer of the Year at the 2010 Durham Region Music Awards. The album was featured in prominent music magazines and generated good response from college radio across Ontario.\n\nYears before anyone knew Benjamin & Mia Hackett as Azalea, they performed, travelled, and recorded an album as Benjamin & Mia. \u201cThe Carousel of Life\u201d (2007) is the root of their love for each other and for their musical life together. That first album thrust them into the life they know, love, and hope to express in song, to every listener.\n\nAzalea\u2019s chemistry is undeniable - their stage presence magnetic! To experience Azalea in concert is to be invited into their love story. They will will draw you in and pull on your hearts strings.

Songwriters Sima Cunnningham and Macie Stewart formed their unbreakable bond performing throughout the fringes of Chicago's many interlocking communities, collaborating with titans from the city's indie rock, hip-hop, and improvised worlds. But together, along with drummer Matt Carroll, they've stretched the boundaries of what guitar music can do starting with the band's experimental 2016 self-titled EP and their adventurous debut 2018 LP Parts. Now their longstanding partnership culminates with the stunning and muscular follow-up Fantasize Your Ghost.\n\nOhmme formed in 2014 as an outlet for Cunningham and Stewart to explore an unconventional approach to their instruments. \"That's the whole genesis of the band: us walking up to our guitars and saying, 'how can we make this noisemaker do something different?'\" says Cunningham. But as their musical collaboration strengthened, bringing Parts and intensive tours with acts like Wilco, Iron & Wine, Twin Peaks, and more, the band's scope and focus has also broadened. Fantasize Your Ghost is the direct result of the band spending more time on the road than in Chicago, a record deeply concerned with questions of the self, the future, and what home means when you're travelling all the time.\n\n\"Grinding on tour last year for so long, it can alter your mental state where you have to think about your life in a different way than you would if you're home. A lot of the songs stemmed from just thinking about all of the possibilities that life could be and could take,\" says Stewart. On the commanding single \"3 2 4 3,\" which tackles the terrifying realization of needing to make a change. The song opens with the two singing in transfixing harmony, \"Looked in the mirror the other day / Caught my reflection / My mouth had moved a different way / The muscles were straining.\" Their deft scene-setting and the way their disparate voices blend together heightens the song's inherent anxiety. Later, they sing, \"Filling the holes to make amends / Tearing them up to start again.\" These moments of emotional clarity fill Fantasize Your Ghost.\n\nWritten across 2019, early sketches of the album's tracklist were demoed at Sam Evian's Flying Cloud Studios in upstate New York. \"That's where we really started to see the record come together,\" says Cunningham. The sessions were intensely collaborative and open: the product of long, existential conversations between Stewart and Cunningham in the van about their lives and how to channel the anger they were feeling about the state of the world. Tracks like the driving opener \"Flood Your Gut\" underwent several revisions with Ohmme uncovering several new directions the song could go before finishing it. The refrain \"your whole vision's not enough\" is a call to action, says Cunningham. \"Do you want to be someone who can disconnect or someone who is hyper-engaged and present?\"\n\nFantasize Your Ghost was recorded over a six day session in August 2019 when the band decamped to the Post Farm in southern Wisconsin, where Cunningham runs a yearly DIY music festival. With indie rock journeyman producer Chris Cohen and the idyllic setting just outside Chicago, the songs came to vibrant life. Though Parts showcased their wildly burgeoning influences and talents, Fantasize Your Ghost captures the astounding magnetism and ferocity of their live show. \"Selling Candy\" is the perfect example. It's a small snapshot of childhood complete with nostalgic references to summertime hot dogs and wandering the city but set to an explosive, stadium-ready fuzzed-out arrangement. Elsewhere, songs like the dystopian dance rocker \"The Limit\" further stretch their already dynamic palette.\n\nFantasize Your Ghost encapsulates the thrilling and sometimes terrifying joy of moving forward even if you don't know where you're going. It's an album that asks necessary questions: When life demands a crossroads, what version of yourself are you going to pursue? What part of yourself will you feed and let flourish and what do you have to let go of? When they sing, \"Just walk out the door and / Don\u2019t tell them goodbye\" it's drastic but also exhilaratingly hopeful. This is a record of strength, of best friends believing in each other. Unapologetic and brave, Ohmme are ready to figure it all out together.", "otherInfo": "Ohmme live on Dr Martens Instagram - Stay In Series #drmartenspresents\n\n5/21 at 2pm PST/4pm CT"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rick Wonder ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8912713.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Electro House", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "New York native Rick Wonder has become one of the tri-state area\u2019s premiere DJs in nightlife, with residencies at elite venues including 1OAK, Catch Roof and Providence.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

A philosophy derived from the Japanese art of repairing cracked ceramics with gold to highlight flaws instead of hiding them, kintsugi speaks to the way an object's history is part of its aesthetic value. \"Considering what we were going through internally, and with what a lot of the lyrics are about, it had a great deal of resonance for us \u2014 the idea of figuring out how to repair breaks and make them a thing of beauty,\" says bassist Nick Harmer, who suggested the name to singer-guitarist Ben Gibbard and drummer Jason McGerr. \"Philosophically, spiritually, emotionally, it seems perfect for this group of songs.\"\nLong before they gave the album its name, the band embarked on a process that forced them to do things differently than they ever had before. For instance, in the course of making their seven previous albums, the Seattle band hadn't written much in the studio together. They had always preferred to hone their arrangements separately, or with just two or three of them playing at once. But when it came time to record Kintsugi, Death Cab for Cutie went into the studio with the openest of minds. Their willingness to try anything \u2014 including a twenty-minute exploration that evolved into one of the album's finest tracks, \"The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive\" \u2014 yields Death Cab's most compelling new work in years: an album that packs as much sonic as it does emotional wallop.\nKintsugi is the band's first time recording with a producer other than their own Chris Walla, the guitarist and multi-instrumentalist whose talents behind the board had helped shape Death Cab's sound since Gibbard released the You Can Play These Songs With Chords cassette in 1997. For Kintsugi, they worked with Rich Costey (whose production credits include albums by Franz Ferdinand, Muse, and Interpol), recording at his Los Angeles studio Eldorado over the course of twelve weeks in the first half of 2014. \"He was all in in a way that I don't think a lot of producers are nowadays,\" says Gibbard. \"We couldn't have landed on a better collaborator for this record. He accomplished what we've always attempted, which is to make Death Cab sound on a record how we sound live. And we're a rock band live. The difficulty now for the live show is making them rock as hard as they rock on the record. That's a new quagmire for this band.\"\nWork on Kintsugi began back in early 2013, as all Death Cab LPs have, with Gibbard writing and demoing the songs on his own before arranging and recording them with his band mates. They initially convened in fall of 2013 at Walla's Hall Of Justice studio in Seattle. Ten days into recording, Chris decided to step down as producer. Says Gibbard. \"Nothing dramatic, he just said, 'I don't think I'm the right guy to do this album and we should find someone else.'\" The band all felt that they needed to shake things up a bit. \"We challenged each other more and left no stone unturned. That was as gratifying as it was frustrating at times, but I couldn't be happier with the end product,\" says McGerr. Walla has since decided to leave the band but participated in the recording process as fully and vitally as he had on their previous albums. In fact, Costey didn't even know Walla was leaving the band until after Kintsugi was finished. Chris played his final show with the band in September at Rifflandia Festival in British Columbia.\nWhen they started recording, there weren't any rules at all. They'd work on a song for a while and then regroup with Costey to figure out elements to expand or elaborate. \"These guys have a chemistry that's existed for a long time, and that chemistry can't be ignored,\" says Costey. \"When you have a band that can play as well as they can play with each other, having them jam together in real time can actually be the quickest way to try a bunch of ideas and get them on tape.\" Songs such as the instantly memorable \"Good Help (Is So Hard To Find),\" the warm and vulnerable \"Little Wanderer\" and the brooding lead single \"Black Sun\" were all tracked with the four members of the band playing together in a room, reacting to each other in real time, adding layers \u2014 and later subtracting some. \"All four of us being on the floor together in the studio was something that hadn't happened in years, because Chris was always behind the glass or in the control room,\" says McGerr. \"But this was more like when we're onstage, where everyone has their eyes closed and we're playing in the moment. With 'The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive,' it turned into a twenty-minute thing they captured in the control room on a two-track. We had started it in Seattle months prior and it just wasn't getting there. Rich brought us into the control room and was like, 'This is our song.'\"\nCostey credits another element of their production set-up with helping achieve the perfect balance of their classic approach and the new one: \"My studio has one big live recording space and two control rooms,\" he says. \"Once we got basic tracks together, Chris would work on them in the other control room. And he would end up doing completely different versions of the songs. For 'Black Sun,' Chris did all this super old school sequenced synth stuff that we used on the final track, and it really brought that song to another level.\"\n\"Black Sun\" is also a perfect example of Gibbard's customarily honest, fearless approach to writing about affairs of the heart. \"'Black Sun' is about divorce and the ugliness and conflicting emotions that come with that: anger, sadness, finger-pointing, acceptance, forgiveness, understanding. To me, the idea of a black sun has multiple meanings: The black sun could be an eclipse, where one thing eclipses another. The sun is supposed to be a radiating light on the world but in this instance it is blacked out. We've all been that at some point in our life when we're supposed to be shining upon someone giving them support, but for some reason are unable to do that. I am the black sun, and the song is as much an indictment of myself as anything.\"\nAlthough, in the case of \"Black Sun,\" Gibbard says he's willing to elaborate on the elements of the song that are autobiographical, he's never been one to reveal the precise meaning behind his lyrics. \"I know that people will assume these songs are about certain things, and in some instances they are going to be correct,\" he says. \"But I'm not going to give people a road map.\"\nGibbard acknowledges that, early on in the process of writing this group of songs, as he was still trying to make sense of the major changes happening in his life, he had to remind himself not to change his creative process. \"If there's a reason people can relate to my songwriting, maybe it's they feel like they're getting an honest, fearless approach to writing about affairs of the heart. I'm certainly not going to censor that just because people think they know something about my personal life. I would be cowardly as a songwriter and not be true to what I've always done if I shy away from these events in my life because I was in relationship with a public figure.\n\"I know the lyrics aren't 100% fiction and they're not 100% nonfiction, and only Ben knows what that blend is,\" says Harmer. \"But with this group of songs, I do think he is writing from a genuinely vulnerable and honest place and I'm proud of him for putting himself out there and being fearless about it.\"\nOne of the songs on Kintsugi that Gibbard says he holds closest to his heart is \"Little Wanderer,\" where he sings, \"You sent a photo out of your window of Paris of what you wished that I could see. But someone's gotta be the lighthouse and that someone's gotta be me.\" He explains: \"There are innumerable songs about, like, 'The road ain't no place to start a family.' 'Home Sweet Home' by Motley Crue, 'Gone Til November,' by Wyclef Jean, and so on. But nobody ever writes a song about sitting at home, waiting for someone to come back. And for so much of my life, I've been the one off somewhere in the world trying to maintain a connection through digital portals. Now, being with someone who travels pretty much all the time, I feel like I've gotten a taste of my own medicine. All the songs are personal, but that one is personal in a way that is very tender to me.\"\nHere, too, \"The Ghosts of Beverly Drive\" encapsulates important elements of the album's larger theme \u2014 embracing flaws and being open to change. \"If only you had known me before the accident,\" it begins, \"for with that grand collision came a grave consequence.\" Says Gibbard: \"There's this charade you play with someone when you start seeing each other, that no one has ever made you feel this way before,\" says Gibbard. \"'The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive' is about when you say to the person you're with, 'Let's just acknowledge that we are not the first people to feel this way. Let's be honest with each other that we've been in love before or that we've fallen out of love with people before, and that's OK.'\"", "otherInfo": "Hey everyone,\n\nLooking forward to playing this Thursday\u2019s Live From Home show at 4pm PT!\n\nThis week\u2019s livestream is in benefit of Community Lunch, a non-profit that provides hot, nutritious meals and survival services to those experiencing homelessness and low-income people in Seattle.

Eight years after that impromptu busking session, the Portland, Oregon-based quintet has grown from a rootsy, string-centric outfit to a full-fledged rock band with an easy but powerful grasp of soul, blues, and British Invasion era pop. On their new album Labor of Love, Fruition shows the complete force of their newly expanded and electrified sound, matching their more daring musicality with sophisticated, melody-minded songcraft. With Anderson, Asebroek, and Naja trading vocal duties and offering up their own singular brand of gutsy yet graceful songwriting, Fruition infuse each track on Labor of Love with timeless urgency and three-part harmonies that never fail to enthrall.\n\nThe follow-up to their 2013 album Just One of Them Nights, Labor of Love came to life over the course of a year-long process of exploring new sonic terrain that included everything from Phil Spector-esque pop to dreamy psychedelia to Motown-inspired soul. \u201cIn the past our approach was always to just get in the studio and get it done, but for this one we decided we were going to take all the time in the world to make the album great,\u201d says Anderson. Teaming up with engineer Justin Phelps (Amanda Palmer, Jolie Holland, Chuck Prophet), Fruition self-produced Labor of Love and mined major inspiration from the inventive precision of longtime Beatles producer George Martin. \u201cThis is the first album where we made a point of bringing out the character of each song to the fullest,\u201d says Thompson, who helmed the mixing of the album. \u201cWith our previous albums we tended to treat each song the same, but this time we really went all the way with whatever sound we were going for.\u201d\n\nDespite pushing into so many disparate directions, Labor of Love emerges as a wholly unified album that subtly imparts the sense of being swept along on a journey. That unity\u2019s got much to do with an open-hearted spirit that sets in from the first notes of the dobro, mandolin and electric guitar driven title track, carries on to the sleepy soul of \u201cSanta Fe,\u201d then unfolds into the beautifully epic balladry of \u201cThe Meaning.\u201d Another key factor in the album\u2019s journey-like feel: Fruition\u2019s ingenious use of between-song transitions, such as the Brazilian-style percussion that lifts Labor of Love from the breezy R&B of \u201cAbove the Line\u201d to the joyful worldbeat-folk of \u201cThe Way That I Do.\u201d \u201cWe brought in a local band called Tapwater one night and enlisted their samba line,\u201d recalls Asebroek. \u201cThey taught us all the drum parts and about ten of us formed a whole drumline, which was just a really fun and unique experience for the band.\u201d\n\nThough Anderson, Asebroek, and Naja each bring a distinct sensibility and boldly nuanced lyricism to their respective songs, a mood of warm melancholy instills much of Labor of Love. \u201cA common theme for all three songwriters is trying to embrace being out on the road all the time, but also feeling like you\u2019re missing out on the everyday lifestyle that most people get to have,\u201d says Leonard. Embedded within that tension is a wistful romanticism that imbues many of the album\u2019s songs. \u201cMost of the love songs are very much about those rare moments of getting to be with the people you love,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cAnd then other songs are about coming back to the people you love, and trying to deal with the strange ways things change because of being apart.\u201d The band chose Labor of Love\u2019s title to reflect that balance of sacrifice and satisfaction, Naja points out. \u201cWe don\u2019t sleep nearly enough and we\u2019re away all the time and we do work really hard,\u201d she says, \u201cbut that\u2019s our job, and it\u2019s pretty much the best job in the world.\u201d\n\nAll near-lifelong musicians, the members of Fruition came to Portland from varied corners of the country and gradually crossed paths by way of their adopted hometown\u2019s music scene. \u201cMimi and Kellen were going to busk one day and I went along with them, \u2018cause that\u2019s what we always did to pay for that night\u2019s dinner and drinks,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cSo we started playing and just instantly nailed these three-part harmonies, to the point where we\u2019d get done with a song and burst out laughing at how good it sounded.\u201d The magic of those harmonies ended up proving instrumental in rounding out the rest of the band. \u201cThe first time I ever played with them, we were jamming in a friend\u2019s attic and the harmonies surrounded me,\u201d says Thompson, who joined Fruition in 2011. \u201cI had goosebumps for an hour afterward, and I decided right then I was quitting my other band and moving to Portland.\u201d Releasing their debut EP Hawthorne Hoedown in 2008, Fruition devoted the coming years to relentlessly writing and performing, The band moved from busking on the street, to scraping their way onto the lower levels of festival lineups, to opening tours for bands like ALO and Greensky Bluegrass and onward to being invited to play bigger festivals with ever bigger billing on those lineups. Last year saw them appear at Bonnaroo, Northwest String Summit and Telluride Bluegrass where Rolling Stone cited their artful choice of covers and \u201craucous originals filled with heartfelt lyrics and stadium-worthy energy.\u201d This year will see them share a Red Rocks bill with JJ Grey and Mofro and The Infamous Stringdusters, along with a full headline tour of the United States.\n\nThat breadth of touring experience has steadily reshaped the band and ultimately allowed them to achieve a sound they\u2019ve long aspired toward. \u201cA few of the songs on the new album actually came from years ago, in an era when we were much more of a string band,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cWe\u2019d imagined the songs in a particular way but didn\u2019t have the ability or experience to get them where we wanted to be\u2014we didn\u2019t even own the right instruments.\u201d But despite broadening their repertoire, a certain spirited simplicity still forms the heart of Fruition. \u201cWe all tend to write on acoustic guitar and let things start in the same stripped-down, folky sort of way that we always did,\u201d says Naja. \u201cSo where the songs come from hasn\u2019t really changed much at all. What\u2019s different is where we let them go from there.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kendal Conrad ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9406034.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "R&b, Country, Pop", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Country music singer/songwriter", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Southern Halo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10212195.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Rock, Country Pop, Pop Country, Country, Contemporary Country, Modern Country", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Mississippi Delta, recognized by many as the birthplace of Rock and Roll and the Blues, is heavily rooted in the upbringing of the Morris sisters.

Townes (born January 22, 1965 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), also known as DJ Jazzy Jeff, is an American hip hop and R&B record producer and turntablist. He is best known for his early career with Will Smith as DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. DJ Jazzy Jeff graduated from John Bartram High School in Philadelphia where he is enshrined in the school's \"Wall of Fame\".\n\nHistory\n\nWhen he was growing up, he found that listening to his parents was unbearable. He got a job as a newspaper boy at age 7 to support his family. Once he grew up, he developed a reputation and following as a school and block party DJ extraordinaire, Jazzy Jeff was the feature of the duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. As a duo, they had several gold and platinum-selling albums and singles in the late 1980s and early 1990s, earning them the first rap Grammy ever presented in 1989 for Parents Just Don't Understand. When Smith branched out into television with the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Jazzy Jeff played a recurring character named \"Jazz\", Smith's best friend on the show. The two characters always greeted each other with their signature handshake (swinging mid-five, point-back/snap with both characters saying \"Pssh!\").\n\nJazz' trademarks include being physically ejected from the house by Uncle Phil (James Avery), screaming as he went flying out the front door. This was referenced in the song \"N.Y, N.Y.\" by Lloyd Banks from his second album Rotten Apple, with the lyric \"I throw a bitch out the crib like Jazzy Jeff\". [1]\n\nDJ Jazzy Jeff is not to be confused with Jeffrey Myree from the earlier hip hop group Funky Four Plus One, which in fact filed and won a lawsuit over the name Jazzy Jeff against Jeff Townes and Jive records when they signed DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince. After DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince broke up, Townes went on to become a prominent R&B, soul, and neo soul record producer, establishing the A Touch of Jazz production company in his native Philadelphia. Among the artists that Jazzy Jeff has helped develop are Jill Scott and Musiq. Even though he separated from Will Smith as music partners, they are still best friends and still occasionally work together. Some songs by Will Smith were produced by Jeff Townes (Ex. Here He Comes), and he has performed on some songs by Will Smith such as \"So Fresh\" and \"Potnas\". In addition, he appears in several of Smith's music videos such as \"Will2K\", \"Freakin' It\", and \"Party Starter\". On some occasions, he makes appearances with Smith on live concerts, producing DJ scratches.\n\nHe, along with DJ Cash Money, is credited with making the transform scratch famous.\n\nOn July 2, 2005, DJ Jazzy Jeff performed with Will Smith at the Live 8 concert in Philadelphia. In the past, Will has performed on concerts with DJ Jazzy Jeff for the scratches. Moreover, Will acknowledges him in his music like \"Comin' To The Stage\" from the album Lost & Found or \"Potnas\" in his album Willennium.\n\nHis 2007 release TROTM (The Return of the Magnificent) is a classic work which returns to the roots of hip-hop with a neo-soul mixture included. This album featured numerous collaborations with old school and new school artists including CL Smooth, Big Daddy Kane, Pos from De La Soul, Method Man, Peedi Crakk (a remake of Brand New Funk), Rhymefest, and Raheem DeVaughn.\n\nIn 2007, he appeared with Rhymefest in the video DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Fest directed by Konee Rok, in which he makes music in his home recording studio with Rhymefest and they reveal that they are working on an album together called \"I'm the DJ, I'm the Rapper\".\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nSolo work as DJ Jazzy Jeff\n\n* Unreleased album from Sony Records (1998)\n* One cut in Battle of DJs\n* The Magnificent (2002)\n* Soulheaven Presents Jazzy Jeff in the House (2004)\n* The Soul Mixtape Groovin' Records USA (2005)\n* Hip-Hop Forever II Rapster Records (2004)\n* Hip-Hop Forever III BBE Records (2006)\n* The Return of The Magnificent EP (2007)\n* The Return of the Magnificent (2007)\n* The Return of Hip Hop EP (2007)\n\n\nAs DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince\n\n* Rock the House (1987) #83 US (Gold)\n* He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper (1988) #4 US (3x Platinum)\n* And in This Corner\u2026 (1989) #39 US (Gold)\n* Homebase (1991) #12 US (Platinum)\n* Code Red (1993) #64 US (Gold)\n* Greatest Hits (1998) #144 US, #20 UK\n* Before The Willennium (1999)\n* The Very Best of D.J.

In addition to his work with Oates, he has made music as a solo artist, first recording with Robert Fripp in the late \u201870s, producing the much-acclaimed Sacred Songs as well as working on Fripp\u2019s critically praised Exposure.\n\nFrom the mid-\u201970s to the mid-\u201980s, Daryl and John would score six #1 singles, including \u201cRich Girl\u201d (also #1 R&B), \u201cKiss on My List,\u201d \u201cPrivate Eyes,\u201d \u201cI Can\u2019t Go For That (No Can Do) (also #1 R&B), \u201cManeater\u201d and \u201cOut of Touch\u201d from their six consecutive multi-platinum albums\u2014\u201976\u2019s Bigger Than Both of Us, \u201980\u2019s Voices, \u201981\u2019s Private Eyes, \u201882\u2019s H2O, \u201883\u2019s Rock N Soul, Part I and \u201884\u2019s Big Bam Boom.

By 1987, the R.I.A.A. recognized Daryl Hall and John Oates as the NUMBER-ONE SELLING DUO in music history, a record they still hold today. Daryl has recorded such solo works as Soul Alone in 1993 and Can\u2019t Stop Dreaming in 2003, both of which were well received with international critical acclaim.\n\nIn November of 2007 Daryl created his latest project: a monthly web series, Live from Daryl\u2019s House (http://www.livefromdarylshouse.com).

Together with founding Nitty Gritty Dirt Band member Les Thompson, Andrew's band Beyond Borders expands that range dramatically, blending an eclectic mix of acoustic and electric instruments along with crisp arrangements and tight 3 and 4-part harmony.\n\nSince permanently leaving his corporate environmental engineering career in 1996, the award-winning folk and Americana artist's musical journey has traced over half a million miles of blue highways and small towns, and earned him a wealth of critical acclaim and enthusiastic fan response for his five CDs and captivating performances.\n\nWherever McKnight takes the stage, audiences are at once spellbound and relaxed by his entertaining rural stories delivered with just the right touches of down home humor, causing one concertgoer to label him \"equal parts Robert Frost, William Least Heat-Moon and Jeff Foxworthy!\"\n\nOver his 15-year career he has enjoyed many accolades within the folk music world; Folk Alliance International Performance Alley Showcase (2010), 2011 Southeast and 2009 Northeast Regional Folk Alliance Formal Showcases, a Performing Songwriter Top 12 DIY selection and the Rocky Mountain Folks Festival Songwriter Showcase, Kerrville New Folk Finalist and Falcon Ridge Emerging Artist. Andrew and his band & Beyond Borders are members of the prestigious Virginia Commission for the Arts Touring Assistance Program. His five solo CDs have earned much critical acclaim and airplay around the world as well as a wealth of NPR stations and several XM/Sirius satellite shows.\n\nTaking his cue from the lyrics of his award-winning song \"Good Things Matter\", he often shares his talents both on the road and close to home near northwestern Virginia's Blue Ridge to help \"neighbors in need\", such as local programs for mental health and elder care, a Massachusetts community radio station, a California at-risk youth program, and a suburban Seattle food bank.\n\nIn addition to his passion for community causes, he is a longtime advocate for preserving American landscapes and heritage. Several of McKnight's songs are rooted in Appalachian history and culture, including the haunting Civil War ballad \"The Road to Appomattox\". He has also long been active in helping find solutions to the Appalachian agony of mountaintop removal coal mining.\n\nThose passions, and the thoughtful ways he expresses them, have drawn legions of fans who sustain his independent career. In the early 90s Andrew grasped the power of the internet to grow and connect with a loyal listenership, and his career has blossomed largely through their \"efangelism\" instead of the traditional elements of the music business. Many friends and fans even host concerts in their homes for 30 to 50 listeners, venues he refers to as \u201csafe houses on the folk underground railroad\u201d.\n\nWhile no stranger to elite stages like the Kennedy Center, the Rocky Mountain Folks Festival or the Katharine Hepburn Theater, McKnight's music seems to spread most rapidly through many of the diverse causes that have embraced his music over the years. He's been recently profiled in a Wine Compass video episode with his friends at Catoctin Creek Distilling Company, his song \"Made by Hand\" is in 'Low Coal', a new movie about the West Virginia coalfields, and \"Good Things Matter\" was featured in a recent podcast of Bread for the World, a global faith-based organization working to end hunger. His environmental anthem \"The Other Way\" appears on 'Songs from the Tackle Box', a 2010 compilation CD dedicated to fisherman and responsible stewardship of America's rivers and resources.\n\nHis music is heard on hundreds of broadcast and internet radio programs around the world including many National Public Radio stations, XM Satellite, and the nationally syndicated \"Art of the Song\" and \"River City Folk\".\n\nIn addition to his own performing and recording career, Andrew has produced or performed on recordings by many different artists, been a contributing writer for Blue Ridge Country and Americana Rhythm magazines, and is a sought-after clinician for songwriting and music business workshops.

I found myself in a place of unknowing,\u201d Maher says. \u201cSo I naturally started gravitating toward writings and quotes from people having experienced the tension between certainty and mystery.\u201d He began saving these prayers, quotes and excerpts while also studying prophetic voices who significantly impacted the history of the church - believers who wrestled with matters of faith, who challenged the status quo and left marked legacies.\n\nAmidst creativity unfolding, the record-making process began, unbeknownst to Maher, when he stepped into the studio to record a song based on the timeless Bill Gaither hymn \u201cBecause He Lives.\u201d Initially, he was recording the song for a one-off compilation project, but Maher\u2019s label heard the demo and immediately deemed it his next radio single. \u201cAll of a sudden, it was like, \u2018You\u2019re making a record,\u2019 and what\u2019s funny is my first response was, \u2018But I don\u2019t have any songs,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe more I thought about it, I realized I had already begun the writing process for all these songs, based on all these people I had been studying. I just wasn\u2019t aware of how beautifully it was starting to come together.\u201d \u201cBecause He Lives (Amen)\u201d became the catalyst to initiate an entire chain of songwriting sessions based on a short list of difference makers.\n\nMaher brought together a host of talented songwriters among who were Thad Cockrell (Leagues), Jon Foreman (Switchfoot), Bo and Bear Rinehart (NEEDTOBREATHE), Jason Ingram and several others for the project.\n\nWith songs loosely crafted and ready for the studio, Maher collaborated with longtime friend and producer Paul Moak (Third Day, Mat Kearney) to bring to life the themes of unity and the struggle of living in the \u201cin-between.\u201d This duality was not only explored lyrically but also sonically as the two men creatively experimented in-studio on \u201cSaints and Sinners.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were looking at the idea of the tension between the saint and the sinner - of looking at two contrasting things, and incorporating that into the production of the music. For example, you take an imperfect being, who generates analog sound waves, and they get recorded into a computer that turns them into digital information. You can create so much within a computer that there is a fine line of tension between it sounding perfect versus human, so we tried to arrive at a reconciliation between the two,\u201d Maher explains.\n\nThe lives and work of other influencers became the blueprint for additional cuts, like the album\u2019s driving first track, \u201cFuture Not My Own,\u201d which is based on a prayer inspired by martyr Oscar Romero. \u201cThis prayer really brings to light that we\u2019re announcing a kingdom that\u2019s here, that\u2019s coming, and that\u2019s being built, that we won\u2019t see the finish of. That\u2019s a huge aspect of being a part of the Church, the body of Christ.\u201d\n\nMaher is an outspoken champion of unity and collaboration, not just amongst Christians on a level of faith but also on a civic level,\u201d he says. Perhaps the most outspoken example of this desire is the gospel-tinged \u201cSons and Daughters.\u201d Although the song was written before the Ferguson incident made headlines, the timely track is an ode to Martin Luther King, Jr., and Maher\u2019s attempt to speak into racial reconciliation. \u201cGod used the church in the \u201960s to inspire a nation for healing. Most people don\u2019t think about the fact that a lot of people in the civil rights movement initially were pastors. Faith was the thing that motivated people toward eradicating injustice,\u201d he says. \u201cSons and Daughters\u201d is a special song, and I hope it will play a part in inspiring more Christian leaders toward re-engagement in the issue of civil rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirelight\u201d is inspired by the ministry of Mother Teresa. Maher\u2019s inspiration for the idea of a firelight comes from her saying, \u201cIf I ever become a saint - I will surely be one of \u2018darkness. I will continually be absent from heaven - to light the light of those in darkness on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything Is Grace\u201d is based on a quote by St. Therese of Lisieux out of \u201cHer Last Conversations\u201d that reads, \u201cEverything is a grace, everything is the direct effect of our father's love - difficulties, contradictions, humiliations, all the soul's miseries, her burdens, her needs - everything, because through them, she learns humility, realizes her weakness. Everything is a grace because everything is God's gift. Whatever be the character of life or its unexpected events - to the heart that loves, all is well.\u201d\n\n\u201cRest\u201d sets Psalm 23 to music and features the vocal harmonies of The Vespers. This song, in particular, came at a time when Maher\u2019s grandmother\u2019s health was failing, and the acoustic-driven track proved to be a source of encouragement for his family.\n\nSince his 2008 major label debut, Maher has become a staple in the artistic and songwriting community. A five time-GRAMMY\u00ae nominee, he has garnered multiple radio successes writing and recording songs like \u201cLord, I Need You,\u201d \u201cHold Us Together,\u201d \u201cChrist Is Risen,\u201d \u201cAll The People Said Amen\u201d and \u201cYour Grace Is Enough.\u201d Maher has penned songs recorded by Chris Tomlin, Crowder, Third Day, Matt Redman, Hillsong, Passion and Meredith Andrews, among others. Maher continues to perform and speak as a part of global high-profile events, including the upcoming World Meeting of Families, marking Pope Francis\u2019 first visit to the US this year. In 2013, Maher performed on stage with Pope Francis in front of more than 3 million people at World Youth Day in Rio de Janeiro. Maher and his team are already in the planning stages of participating in World Youth Day 2016 taking place in the summer of 2016 in Krakow, Poland.\n\nMaher has found that while we all come from different backgrounds, amass a range of experiences and even harbor conflicting opinions, the one thing that always binds us together is our humanity. \u201cIt\u2019s the sinful side of me that helps me identify with other broken people and not see myself as better. Christianity doesn\u2019t make me better than anybody else,\u201d he contends. \u201cThe process of being transformed is sometimes a really messy process. When you can remember how far off you were when God found you, your own conversion stands as a testimony to God and mercy, but it also gives you a way to relate to other people.\u201d After all, we were created by a loving God who designed us for a greater purpose. We are each on the pilgrimage of searching out that purpose, being transformed, saints and sinners.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Paul Loren ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10358722.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Soul, R&b", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Raised on the rich legacy of soul music, Paul Loren sings songs that will make you move.\n\nA talented songwriter and producer, he takes elements from classic R&B, Pop and Jazz, and makes them truly his own.\n\nWith a dynamic and powerful stage show, Paul Loren evokes the great Ray Charles, Sam Cooke and Otis Redding at their prime.", "otherInfo": "Join Paul Loren and iconic music venue My Father's Place for a Virtual Concert Experience."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Josh Vietti ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10376302.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Hip-hop, Jazz, R&b, Pop, Classical, Gospel, Rnb-soul, Christian-gospel, Christian/gospel, R&b/soul, Hip Hop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Contact Josh Vietti at bookings@joshvietti.com For more information please visit his website: http://www.joshvietti.com https://youtu.be/DXoj5KIyJSo", "otherInfo": "What\u2019s up everybody!

In the two years since, the members of Wildermiss\u2014Cole, guitarists Josh Hester and Seth Beamer, and drummer Caleb Thoemke\u2014have built up a massive and fiercely loyal grassroots following in its hometown of Denver, Colorado, and crisscrossed the country winning over fans as the supporting act on tours with the Oh Hellos, Jared and the Mill and Bronze Radio Return.\n\nMore than a fan favorite, the quartet has also earned accolades from the press and radio in the Mile High City on the strength of its music and live show. \u201cCarry Your Heart,\u201d a Lost With You single that has attracted more than half a million streams on Spotify, received heavy rotation on KTCL, the taste-making station that first introduced the country to the Oh Hellos, The Fray, Flobots, Churchill, and many other breakout acts in the past fifteen years.\n\nIn addition to selling out the Bluebird Theater and thrilling capacity crowds with intimate back-to-back New Year\u2019s Eve dates at the Larimer Lounge, Wildermiss has played prime mainstage sets at all of the city\u2019s biggest music festivals, including iHeart Radio\u2019s Big Gig at the 18,000-seat amphitheater Fiddler\u2019s Green, the Westword Music Showcase and the Underground Music Showcase, which drew tens of thousands of fans, in addition to sharing a bill at the 6,500-seat 1STBANK Center arena with the Revivalists, Elle King, American Authors.\n\nThe outfit\u2019s ascent has all been organic. The members of Wildermiss have attracted fans the old fashioned way by writing memorable songs and playing their hearts out each night, winning over fan after fan one at a time. As viewers who happened to catch Wildermiss on Last Call With Carson Daly can attest, the act isn\u2019t a tough sell. Portions of the band\u2019s set at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles were captured for broadcast, and the performance was so compelling that it ended up airing on two different episodes of NBC\u2019s late-night show.\n\nBut just as those performances served as a sneak peek for the fortunate few across the country who were still up in the wee hours of the morning, Lost With You merely hinted at the potential of Wildermiss. In My Mind, the outfit\u2019s new seven-song EP, surpasses any expectations set by the group\u2019s highly acclaimed debut. From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band. If you look and listen closely, there is far more to this band than meets the eyes and ears.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Liz Longley ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9911752.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Acoustic, Pop, Singer - Songwriter, Singer-songwriter Pop, Singer-songwriter Acoustic Folk Rock, Ameriana, Singer & Songwriter, Folk, Singer Songwriter Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Best known for her stop-you-in-your-tracks voice, Liz Longley is an accomplished singer-songwriter based out of Nashville.

Billed not as a solo album, but as a project by David Nail and the Well Ravens, Only This and Nothing More finds its frontman leaving behind the familiar comfort of his longtime record label and, instead, uncovering new ground with help from two longtime partners; multi-instrumentalist Andrew Petroff and producer Jason Hall. Inspired not only by his country roots, but also the guitar-heavy stomp of Oasis, the reverb-heavy wash of Ryan Adams, the rhythmic punch of the Black Keys, and the anthemic swell of Kings of Leon, Nail and the Well Ravens co-wrote a collection of songs that placed a contemporary spin on older sounds.

No wonder Rolling Stone Country named Shane Owens one of the magazine's \"10 New Country Artists You Need to Know!\"\n\nNew music. New album. New shows. Shane Owens continues to more forward, but he also remains rooted in the sound that launched his career, breathing new life into a sound that's at once fresh and familiar. \"I've grown my business the old-school way,\" he explains. \"I played the honky-tonks for years. I developed myself and my sound. It can be tough when you've got a traditional sound, but I can't be anything I'm not. If it was easy to do, everybody would do it. And I'm nowhere near done doing it.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Clap Your Hands Say Yeah ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8315551.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Indie Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s 2005 self-released debut album set a precedent for how bands might begin to approach making music independently. The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions. We have to build something to last, rather than just build it because it looks good at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Annie Zeleski", "otherInfo": "donate:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/Ounsworth"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tom Graham Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8171122.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Classic Rock, Classic Blues, Acoustic, Singer Songwriter, Ameriana, Folk, Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tom Graham is a musician and singer-songwriter based in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Since 1998, the band has consisted of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael \"Flea\" Balzary (bass) along with longtime members John Frusciante (guitar) and Chad Smith (drums).\n\nThe band initially formed for a once-off support act for a friend's band, calling themselves Tony Flow And The Miraculously Majestic Masters Of Mayhem. Upon renaming themselves Red Hot Chili Peppers, they played a handful of small club venues in Los Angeles in 1983, before they were signed to EMI Records.\n\nCurrent members:\n\nVocal: Anthony Kiedis (1983-present).\nGuitar: John Frusciante (1998-present).\nBass: Michael Peter \"Flea\" Balzary (1983-present).\nDrums: Chad Smith, (1988-present).\n\nPrevious members:\n\nNotable guitarists (in chronological order):\nHillel Slovak (1983-1984),\nJack Sherman (1984),\nHillel Slovak (1985-1988),\nJohn Frusciante (1988-1992),\nArik Marshall (1992-1993),\nJesse Tobias (1993)\nDave Navarro (1993-1998)\n\nNotable drummers (in chronological order):\nJack Irons (1983-1984),\nCliff Martinez (1984-1987),\nJack Irons (1987-1988),\nD.H. Peligro (1988),\n\nThe Chili Peppers' original guitarist, Slovak, was replaced in 1984 by Jack Sherman, while Slovak and Irons recorded music with their band at the time, What Is This? Upon Slovak's return, Sherman was fired from the band.\n\nFollowing Slovak's death of a heroin overdose, a young John Frusciante took over as guitarist in 1988. Frusciante, however, quit the band in 1992 due in part to his sadness at the band becoming so successful in such a short time; complex personal issues, involving an addiction to heroin, were also a factor. He was then replaced by Arik Marshall. Approximately a year later, Marshall left the band, to be replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.\n\nAfter the release of 1995's One Hot Minute, Navarro's escalating drug habits became a subject of conflict. In 1998, Navarro was fired from the band, to be taken over by none other than former guitarist, Frusciante, who has remained in the band ever since.\n\nFounder and guitarist Hillel Slovak did not actually appear on the self-titled debut album, despite performing and writing the content with the band prior to recording. He was replaced by Jack Sherman for the recording of the album, but returned to the band for second album, Freaky Styley. The third album, Uplift Mofo Party Plan, is in fact the only album to include all four founding members. After this, Slovak overdosed on heroin, and subsequently did not appear on future albums (Mother's Milk, Blood Sugar Sex Magik - on which Frusciante provides guitars, One Hot Minute - Navarro, Californication and By the Way - Frusciante) Frusciante is also on their latest release Stadium Arcadium.\n\nBassist flea claims to have nearly quit following the tour for 2002 album By the Way due to feeling sidelined following Frusciante's development as a guitarist. Flea has been quoted as saying that the issue has now been resolved. Flea is also the only member to have been in the band perpetually as Anthony was kicked out for a short time in 1984 due to his drug problems.\n\nFrusciante has also been making solo albums for a number of years. His new album with the band Ataxia came out May 29 2007, and is titled Automatic Writing II.\n\nIn 2003 Flea played bass on The Mars Volta's album Deloused In The Comatorium. Frusciante added guitar to tracks on Deloused and 2005's Frances The Mute. He also played rhythm guitar on The Mars Volta's Amputechture. Omar A. Rodriguez-Lopez, guitarist for The Mars Volta, appeared on Stadium Arcadium, playing the solo on \"Especially In Michigan\".\n\nThrough the years, Kiedis' lyrics have dealt with a variety of topics, which have shifted as time has progressed. Themes within his expansive repertoire include love and friendship, teenage angst and good-time aggression, various sexual topics and the link between sex and music, political and social commentary (Native American issues in particular), romance, drugs, loneliness, globalization and the cons of fame and Hollywood, poverty, alcohol, and dealing with death.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Justin Trawick ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7196522.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Justin Trawick and The Common Good\u2019s debut record, \u201cThe Riverwash EP\u201d, exemplifies the raw emotional live sound Trawick and the band have cultivated over the years playing in clubs and festivals up and down the East Coast.

I\u2019ve never had voice lessons, and it wasn\u2019t until after graduating from college that I started teaching myself how to play guitar. So, if you\u2019d told me then that I\u2019d end up making a living as a singer-songwriter, I wouldn't have believed you. Even now, with the release of my fifth studio album, Morning Light, I can barely believe it.\n\nMy performing career began in the smoky corners of Knoxville, TN\u2019s restaurants and bars, singing cover songs for distracted drunks and underage college students. I didn\u2019t seriously consider pursuing a career in music until May 9, 2007, after an unexpected opportunity to open for John Legend at Knoxville\u2019s Tennessee Theatre. The guy that walked on stage that night, wasn\u2019t the same guy that walked off. One set, six songs in just thirty minutes, changed my life forever.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve shared a tour bus with Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Famers, performed in front of crowds of over 20,000 people, and been lucky enough to share the stage with artists like Brandi Carlile, Heart, Gavin DeGraw, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, James Blunt, Edwin McCain, Chris Isaak, and Daughtry, as well as tour Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, performing for our men and women in uniform stationed overseas.\n\nMusic has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It\u2019s taken me to parts of the world I would\u2019ve never seen and connected me with lifelong friends I would\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s given my life purpose. Without music, I may have never met the two greatest loves of my life, my wife, Mandy, and my daughter, Annabelle Rose Baker. However, at the same time, music almost tore my life apart.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2013, I was touring over 200 days a year. By many standards, I was living the dream, but life on the road was taking its toll. While my music career had never been better, my personal life had never been worse. At home, waiting for me, was the life that I\u2019d dreamed of, and I was missing it. First words were being spoken, first steps taken, and it was all passing me by like road signs on the highway. Sadly, the two people I was working hardest to protect, were the ones getting hurt the most.\n\nThen one day I walked into an empty house and found my wife\u2019s wedding ring on the kitchen table along with a note that read, \u201cI will not be sorry for the choice YOU made.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, success as a singer-songwriter didn\u2019t seem nearly as important if it meant failing as a husband and as a father. I was at an intersection in my life and a choice had to be made. I could continue down the road I was on, whatever the cost, or change my direction and come home.\n\nThankfully, I made the choice to refocus on my family, and in January of 2014, I put down my guitar and started picking up the pieces. I stopped recording and touring, and traded the stage lights, for front porch lights, but as it turns out, the day that I decided to stop making music, was the day a new chapter in my music career began.\n\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve learned is that you get what you give in this life. 5 years ago, I GOT a second chance, and everything that\u2019s happened has GIVEN me this moment.\n\nToday, I am a better husband. I\u2019m a better father, and hopefully, I\u2019m a better songwriter. Music may have tried to tear my family apart, but now it\u2019s graciously bringing us back together. So, I see music as a celebration of every wrong turn and right turn that has led me here, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t give thanks for that old wooden box with six strings.\n\nHere\u2019s to the hope that keeps us holding on and to never losing sight of the things that are truly important. Here\u2019s to the promise and possibility of each NEW DAY. Here\u2019s to the beauty of the present moment and to trying our best to make the most of it.

The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions. We have to build something to last, rather than just build it because it looks good at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Annie Zeleski", "otherInfo": "donate:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/Ounsworth"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tom Graham Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8171122.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Classic Rock, Classic Blues, Acoustic, Singer Songwriter, Ameriana, Folk, Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tom Graham is a musician and singer-songwriter based in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

So Brent locked himself in an LA studio with producer and songwriter Lewis Pesacov, of Fool's Gold fame, and they put together the funky foundations for \"High To Low.\u201d Brent and Lewis built the song around the bass-line. The result is exuberant, good time rock n roll.

The band features Avi Salloway (Bombino/Hey Mama/Avi & Celia) joined by an inspired cast of singular artists who have performed across five continents including concerts at the Coachella Music & Arts Festival, Newport Folk Festival, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Montreal Jazz Fest, Carnegie Hall, and Lincoln Center. From 2013-16, Salloway toured the globe with Bombino, the Tuareg guitar hero from Niger, Africa. While on the journey and since returning, Salloway wrote the material on the band\u2019s latest album, Strike the Match (Sand & Gold Records).\n\nSalloway has been bringing these songs to life with the Wylder Family, a group of dear friends and musical kindred spirits. In between shows, the band spent ten days recording at Eyeland Studio in the Columbus Theatre, home of The Low Anthem. The music weaves together American folk and rock with sensibilities from the Sahara Desert: think Andrew Bird meets Ali Farka Toure, Pete Seeger and Talking Heads. Strike the Match expands on American musical traditions, building a bridge to their African roots and coloring the songs with experimental art-rock textures: gilded string lines, synthesizers, and angular guitars. Mother Earth is at its center, surrounded by stories of love, conflict, change and dreams.\n\nSalloway shares, \u201cThis album is a reflection of the world we\u2019ve been born into, one filled with supernatural beauty and incomprehensible struggle. My social and environmental activism work has taken me to territories that have been colonized and occupied in the Middle East, North and West Africa, the South Pacific and Standing Rock, here at home. I have experienced the creative spirit rise up in the face of darkness and adversity and it is the most life-affirming feeling I have witnessed. This record has become the artifact at the intersection of these moving events in my life.\u201d\n\nOn Strike the Match, Billy Wylder grapples with some of the most pressing questions of our time. How can we reorient ourselves to nature as a source of strength for resistance to the forces that seek to destroy and profit from it? How can we use music to move beyond capitalism and nationalism to a global society for the benefit of the earth and all living beings? How can we reconcile our painful history with hope and optimism for the future? The album calls the listener to engage with these questions and illuminates the path towards participating in the creation of a more just and sustainable world.\n\nThe band is named after Salloway\u2019s grandmother, Wilma \u201cBillie\u201d Hotaling.\u201d She was a prolific painter, author, musician, and educator. Billie wrote Count the Stars Through the Cracks, a harrowing historical fiction novel about a young brother and sister\u2019s escape from the Antebellum South along the Underground Railroad. Billie\u2019s writing was raw and fearless and her book delivered a powerful narrative about America\u2019s hard truths and the long journey to freedom. \u201cMy grandma Billie led by example, showing me what creativity looks like and how critical art can be as a form of love and resistance. She is part of me and part of the Wylder family,\u201d Salloway reflects.\n\n\u201cRaised in a progressive home and taught to play by Pete and John Seeger, activism is a constant in Avi Salloway\u2019s life and art. During the past decade, he\u2019s performed in world crisis spots, from the Palestinian territories to Standing Rock, always delivering a message of music\u2019s power to heal and bring change.\u201d \u2013The Hippo\n\n\"Engaging mash-up of various strains of American folk and rock and Tuareg desert blues.\" \u2013The Boston Globe", "otherInfo": "Tune in Thursday, May 21 to catch Avi live on the ZenBarn facebook page.

There\u2019s one major distinction, however, that separates her from other similarly studied musicians. That is Holly\u2019s devotion to the legendary rock band Phish. Having attended over 300 shows by the Burlington-based quartet, she became obsessed by their famous rendition of \u201cTweezer\u201d from Lake Tahoe on July 31, 2013.

Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage. Whether Love Saves The Day makes one dollar or a million isn\u2019t a big concern to him. It stands as a huge success because he made the gritty, honest album that he intended by \u201ckeeping it raw, keeping it immediate, keeping it real.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that he has honed over the years: \u201cbe original and be true to what you do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To Benefit 3rd and Lindsley, Nashville"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sara Evans ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10276459.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Multi-platinum entertainer SARA EVANS is at the top of her game.

The accomplished singer/songwriter/producer/multi-instrumentalist\u2014a true quadruple threat\u2014released her impactful and emotional debut album Symptoms last year, and it's only the beginning of her journey with a new single and more new music on the way.\n\nBorn and raised in Hawaii, the Los Angeles-based Crowe was practically brought into the world with music in her life: she started playing violin at the young age of three years old, and her father was a concert pianist alongside his career as an astronomer. \"My parents were very musical\u2014they met performing theater together,\" she explains. \"Music was a huge part of our family and my upbringing.\"\n\nAfter teaching herself how to sing while listening to Broadway musical recordings, Crowe eventually got accustomed to performing locally and accrued the confidence and motivation to try her hand at songwriting and music production, with formative influences that included Jewel and Alanis Morrissette. \"They had strong, empowering lyrics,\" she states. \"Jewel had this beautiful voice\u2014all she had to do is grab a guitar and tell her stories. That was mesmerizing to me. Alanis was all about raw, unapologetic emotion and power, and her lyrics were very dynamic while still retaining introspection.\"\n\nIn 2018, Crowe won the John Lennon Songwriting Contest for her song \"Breaking Things,\" which was co-written and co-produced with her partner and first songwriting collaborator Josh Anderson; a year later, she released her debut album Symptoms, the result of two and a half years of work with Anderson in Los Angeles on songs she'd originally written in her bedroom. \"It was my first chapter as a writer, producer, and artist,\" she states while discussing the album's origins. \"It was such a journey to have people around me and a team who could help guide me in this city.\"\n\nA deeply felt and expressive pop album, Symptoms was inspired by Lady Gaga's own approach to production and songwriting: \"She's a powerhouse performer. A lot of my production is inspired by her, along with songwriters like Sia and Taylor Swift\u2014strong women that are powerful, dynamic, and cathartic above all else.\"\n\nSymptoms' title track\u2014as well as the album as a whole\u2014draws from an abusive experience that took place before moving to the West Coast. \"After I went through that experience, my body went into shock and I started experiencing panic attacks and anxiety,\" she recalls. \"It was about telling myself that everything was going to be okay\u2014and a musical diary that revealed the ways I was coping with what I'd been through.\"\n\nThe transformative \u201cChess Game,\u201d co-written by Kailey Shaffer, zeroes in on the struggles that young women in the music industry often face, as well as how to transcend and evolve amidst such struggles. As young women in our industry, we felt like we were tired of playing everyone else\u2019s games,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe were inspired to write something uplifting\u2014an infectiously driven and empowering anthem in the face of adversity. The symbolism of the lyrics represents transformation, realizing your inner strength and having the courage to take back and own your true power.\u201d The song was an anthem and debuted in the Billboard Dance Charts.\n\n\"Each song is a different piece of a puzzle\u2014a symptom of who I am,\" Crowe continues. \"I took my traumatic experiences and turned them into these fun pop songs to help me get through what I've experienced.\" The latest single from Symptoms, \"Sky Is Falling,\" is particularly close to Crowe's heart; the epic, wide-open ballad finds her drawing from the pain and perseverance of her father's passing. \"It's my most personal song\u2014it encompasses all the things at the core of what I've gone through,\" she explains.

While \u201cBreaking Down\u201d and \u201cNo Good\u201d are superb examples of rollicking rock, they are just one of many genres that Hamish dips his toes into on the new album Out Of My Head, produced by Jim Scott (Tom Petty, Tedeschi Trucks Band).

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "KOAH ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10353311.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Rock, Indie, Electronic, Alternative, Southern Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "KOAH is an accomplished singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist active in both the United States East Coast and West Coast.

In January of 2016, The Eagles of Death Metal released Kenny\u2019s version of \"I Love You All The Time\" as a part of their Pay it Forward Campaign to raise money for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.\nOn his latest self-titled release, Kenny teamed up with three-time Grammy Winning Producer Justin Guip (Sound engineer for Levon Helm and current touring drummer for Hot Tuna) to create a record that expanded on his signature one-man band sound. The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks. With an influential voice that lies somewhere between Neil Young and Jack White, Kenny delivers clear and concise visions of dynamic musical deliverance. Combining a deep dive into tone, originality and believability, he ushers the listener into his brand new living room of roots riddled rock and roll.\nNever going for the standard attack, he flies far from the 12-bar blues, three-chord rock and Americana stereotype to land some place between a rock and a new place. The album illustrates a highly skilled writer who utilizes the same down-home approach in his music as he does with his day-to-day interactions with others. It\u2019s a combination that will continue to see Kenny reach exciting new levels as he helps future fans \u201csee the light\u201d of his musical message.\nTo hear his full discography, watch recent videos, and check out upcoming tour dates visit www.KeithKenny.com\n(Excerpt from John Pfieffer & Jessica Smith of The Aquarian Weekly)", "otherInfo": "Virtual Tip Jar!\nVenmo: Keith-Kenny-1\nPaypal: Keith@KeithKenny.com or Paypal.me/KeithKenny\nCashApp: $KeithKenny\n\nMerchandise!

If you ask the two remaining members of The Tragic Radicals, apparently several. A four year revolving door of band members has brought guitarist, Aj Caves, and former TR bassist, turned drummer extraordinaire, Tyler Chittick, to one conclusion; less really is more.\nRewind to the chilly month of January, 2016 in Fullerton, CA: The rock band soon to be known as The Tragic Radicals was born. Since the recent disbanding of her all-girl rock group, The Slivers, Aj, bored and bandless, turned to Craigslist, to scout out musicians for her next (and hopefully more successful) band. With a little diligence, it wasn\u2019t too long before drummer, Nathan, bassist, Tyler, and singer, Cassidy, were assembled, auditioning in Aj\u2019s living room. The band began rehearsing there weekly, and the four-piece picked up and put their scent on, roughly, a dozen of Aj\u2019s existing songs, came up with a suitable moniker, and were hitting stages within a couple of months. Over the next few years, the group played steady gigs, recorded two EPs (one unreleased), and also underwent numerous personnel changes.\nFast forward to late August, 2019: Two singers, four drummers, and nearly one hundred shows later, The Radicals found themselves tragically (or not so tragically) half the band they used to be. Having recently become a three-piece after letting go of their second (and last) singer in June 2019, the band was surprised to see their summer filling up very fast. The new formation of TR soon was gaining momentum as an instrumental act, and was booked solid through the end of August. Promoters were all over them. They were playing venues anywhere from the Sunset Strip to Long Beach, to Orange County, an exciting and unexpected turn of events for a band who was fully anticipating a struggle booking gigs without a vocalist. In a matter of six weeks, with nearly a dozen shows down, the band was nearing the end of their stretch, with only two left on the calendar, both of which at The World Famous Doll Hut in Anaheim, CA. The first of the two shows was one they\u2019d been preparing for. A Saturday night prime slot with a stacked bill, this was an excellent opportunity for The Tragic Radicals to earn some decent exposure, as it promised a great turnout. They did not predict the departure of their drummer on the day of the gig.\nThough blindsided and disappointed, indeed, the show must go on. No stranger to flakey musicians, the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was setting in for the two longest running members of The Tragic Radicals as they had hours to prepare for their performance as a duo. This was not the first time Aj and Tyler had been forced to curb their act on short notice. If one thing has remained constant in TR, it\u2019s etiquette, and there would be no backing out of shows due to the lack of professionalism from other members. Put on the spot, the two would naturally resort to just guitar and bass, jokingly dubbing these modified performances as their \u2018Almost Acoustic Christmas\u2019 shows; for whatever reason, this seemed to happen every December, coincidentally. Even though this was far from their first rodeo, it was clear they began to silently doubt their abilities matching the caliber of the lineup that night, fearing the intensity of their sound would suffer without drums. Consultation between the two was unnecessary as Tyler posed the idea of ditching the bass, and instead doing drums and guitar, and without debate, the musical arrangement was settled.\nWith a packed house, surrounded by many semi-famous musicians, the nervous pair took the stage at The Doll Hut that night, hoping to make it through their set semi-painlessly. The crowd\u2019s growing audible response as each new song was playedLittle did it would prove to be the most successful incarnation of The Tragic Radicals yet. In the months following their impressive, pivotal August performance, The Tragic Radicals would have a new look, a new sound, and a new following. Not to mention, new opportunities. In a very short amount of time, they found their calendar packed once again, filled with not only gigs, but appearances on podcasts like Taxi TV, The Flabby Hoffman Radio Show, Die Laughing Records Radio Podcast, and C4OC\u2019s House of Metal Radio Show. Somehow, they\u2019d managed to achieve more in a matter of weeks than they had as a full band in almost four years-time. It was an exciting time for TR, and finally they began reaping the benefits after years of hard work.\nAnd so it goes, with success comes some criticism. Now and again, skeptics who can\u2019t seem to wrap their heads around how a two-piece, instrumental band, with no vocals or bass will argue that TR cannot compete with the live sound capabilities of a traditional four or five-piece rock band. Aware of the criticism, the pair has had much to prove when it comes to their live act. Eliminating the vocals and bass does present some challenges, but the two-piece is adapting quite well, crafting clever songs with shortened or modified arrangements to make up for the sounds of absent band members. For years Tyler and Aj were frustrated with TR\u2019s inability to expand their song catalog. Due to the constant rotation of members, it was nearly impossible to write new material at the desired pace. Relieved of aforementioned obstacles, The Tragic Radicals are rapidly writing new songs, and are preparing to record and release new music by January 2020. The creative process requires a slightly different approach now, but Aj\u2019s melodic riffs and ability uniquely arrange songs to replace lyrics is a major asset to the band. Playing through both guitar and bass amps on stage, she maintains her distinct guitar tone while incorporating low end to fill the void of Tyler\u2019s missing bass. Perfectly accompaniment, Tyler lends emphasis to accents and dynamics, drumming as though he was playing bass. An incredibly versatile musician, capable of mastering numerous instruments, his skills and flexibility allow him to keep up with Aj\u2019s frequent song reworking and tendency to experiment with time changes. The two manage to captivate audiences with, not only their blatant chemistry, but their genuine, intense stage presence, and roll with the punches charm.", "otherInfo": "Every Thursday We'll Be Playing 3 Original Tracks - Personal Faves, And Requests Welcomed!

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

Johnson began playing and writing songs on his four-track in the mid-'90s before he formed I Rowboat, a Velvet Underground-inspired indie rock band. Johnson began dabbling in folk with I Rowboat guitarist Dan Strack and drummer Brian Belval as the Fruit Bats. When I Rowboat disbanded, Johnson played guitar and banjo with Califone. That group's Tim Rutili and Ben Massarella, who also own Perishable Records, urged the Fruit Bats to record their work for the label, which resulted in the trio's 2001 debut, Echolocation. Over the next two years the group toured and refined its lineup and sound, adding Lisee as well as more pop and experimental elements to its folk-rock base. In 2002, the group signed to Sub Pop, who released their sophomore effort, Mouthfuls, in spring of 2003. Two years later, after relocating to Seattle and expanding to a four-piece, the band released their third full length album, Spelled in Bones.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name).

De La Swing es ese tipo de artista inconformista cuya carrera y evoluci\u00f3n musical es cuidada hasta el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo detalle y donde la profundidad, creatividad e innovaci\u00f3n sonora se abrazan sin acritud seg\u00fan pisa el escenario. Son su pasi\u00f3n y buen rollo hacia la m\u00fasica lo que impera en su d\u00eda a d\u00eda y lo que hacen de sus sets un aut\u00e9ntico viaje sonoro y \u00fanica su conexi\u00f3n con el p\u00fablico. Y es que si el de Madrid destaca con sus sesiones desenvueltas en un constante Groove y fusionando techno y house de la nueva escuela, sus producciones van un paso m\u00e1s all\u00e1. Con una mentalidad solida, f\u00e9rtil y arriesgada, De La Swing es el alma m\u00e1ter detr\u00e1s de labels tan en alza en el panorama nacional como Elrow Music, Florida Music & Ker Recordings, habiendo tambi\u00e9n colaborado y remezclado para sellos como Form, Drakos Recordings y Amazing Lab. Pero su amor por la m\u00fasica y el eclecticismo musical le ha hecho mostrar su otra cara art\u00edstica; su faceta m\u00e1s underground bajo el pseud\u00f3nimo \u2018Smoked Signal\u2019, habitualmente presente como residente del Ker Club de la Ciudad Condal y habiendo compartido vivencias y an\u00e9cdotas en su escenario con nombres como Martinez Brothers, Art Department, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Seth Troxler, Scuba o Los Suruba entre otros. English version: Born in Madrid in the 80\u2019s, Domingo Bellot starts his musical career at the age of 16. Influenced in its beginnings by techno and drum&bass, his technical skills, ability to connect with the crowd and he\u2019s diverse musical style has made him one of the most versatile DJ\u00b4s in Spain. Over the past 5 years De La Swing has shared turntables with different top level Djs as Marco Carola, Loco Dice, Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Laurent Garnier, Joseph Capriati, Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch, Paco Osuna or Vitalic among others, and has played at festivals like Monegros Desert Festival (Spain), Eastern Electric Festival (London), Kingsday Madness (Holland), We are Together (Marseille), Plages Electroniques (Cannes), Ultra Cape Town/Johannesburg & Origin Festival (South Africa), resulting rapidly a well-known and familiar Dj in countries as Spain, France, Italy and Holland. Since 2010 this Madrid born is one of the emblematic ElRow residents, the after hour based in the ever growing electronic hub of Barcelona, that has become one of the best clubs worldwide, brainchild of the organisers of Europe's only desert festival, Monegros, and owners of the acclaimed techno club Florida 135 in Fraga, Huesca. Equally important are his recent El Row residencies during the summer season in Privilege Ibiza -in 2012 and 2013- and Space Ibiza in 2014. De la Swing is that type of non-conformist artist which lives in a continuous sound evolution, where the depth, darkness and fun are always present in his sets and throughout which he shows his creativity and innovation on stage, driving his passion and vibrancy to create a different story every time, while establishing a unique connection with the crowd. While in the studio, De la Swing is a solid and fertile mind being in charge of different labels as Elrow Music, Florida Music & Ker Recordings, having also produced and remixed for labels like Form, Drakos Recordings and Amazing Lab. However, his skills and abilities go further on. We can also enjoy its more underground side with his aka \u2018Smoke Signal\u2019, usually as resident in Ker Club Barcelona once a month, sharing his talent with artists such as Martinez Brothers, Art Department, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Seth Troxler, Scuba or Los Suruba.

He rapidly broke through onto the Garage pirate radio stations and forums gaining instant recognition, and was subsequently snapped up by international promoters to perform tours of Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Russia. Majestic has since crossed into a multitude of dance music genres from UK Garage to House to Drum & Bass and Dubstep performing with leading artists across the scene such as Sigma, DJ EZ, Dream Teem, Agent X, MJ Cole, Judge Jules, Micky Slim, Jack Beats, Laidback Luke, The Wideboys, Netsky, High Contrast, Loadstar, Shy FX, Skream, Bar9, Nero and Jacob Plant to name a few.\n\nAs well as a legendary MC known for being risqu\u00e9 in spreading his word, Majestic is also making waves as an artist in his own right. His single \u201cIn The VIP\u201d written and produced with the Wideboys that took a satirical look at the VIP Club culture, was released on Skint Records. After receiving serious hits on YouTube and Radio Support from MistaJam, DJ Target, Kissy Sell Out and Steve Smart on heavy rotation, the record also made its way onto the MOS Bass Culture annual.\nMajestic\u2019s lyrical flow then caught the eye of American Dubstep superstar Skrillex who sampled Majestics legendary, almost anthemic, \u201cRuffneck Bass\u201d spit for his latest massive single of the same title, played by the worlds biggest DJs and over 50m views online.\n\nAfter signing up to be Dubstep wonderkid, Jacob Plant\u2019s official hype man, the pair released, \u201cMosh Pit\u201d on Speakerbox. Majestic has been in the studio collaborating on a number of cutting edge tracks they intend to PA live at their shows. They have already performed for massive student brand Under The Radar on their tour dates up and down the country, as well as for Fresher\u2019s events at all the leading Universities in the UK. Plus having just wowed the crowd at Brighton\u2019s Shakedown festival performing on the main stage in front of 8000 revellers, in-between Razorlight and Example, they are certainly heading for superstar status!\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder Majestic is in demand to perform Live, with Mistajam quoting Majestic as being the \u201cbest live MC in the game\u201d after requesting him to perform alongside him at Exit festival in Serbia and Eddie Temple Morris bringing him onboard The Big Reunion Shows this winter not to mention continuing tours with The Wideboys, the hype has only just begun. After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece. Majestic is also opening for the Prodigy as part of his festival looks with Kiss FM UK.\n\nSo with the Majestic message travelling fast, hyping the crowd into a frenzy, Majestic takes on the role of grand puppeteer, from waiving lighters in the air to chanting back at the DJ, his commands are dutifully followed and quite a sight to behold. Through years of hard graft, quite literally behind the scene, Majestic has studied the sound of the underground for well over a decade.

It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label.

But not every artist gets asked by their heroes to join\nthem, as artists, on their stage. It's a compliment that Jacob Moon keeps getting from the\nmusicians who have inspired him since he started as a singer-songwriter out in Hamilton,\nOntario. Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "A different theme every day!

Labels like Schematic in Miami, Interdimensional Transmissions from Detroit & Viewlexx out of The Hague set the foundation for Daze. Daniel Gomez adopted his Daze moniker early on at his mother\u2019s suggestion. Practicing on a set-up she bought him, Daze was spinning at weddings by age 14, funneling his earnings into vinyl to play raves on the side. That eventually led to producing his first tracks in 2004 on a cracked version of Fruity Loops and later that year, he jumpstarted a electro / techno white label called Omniamm. Daze\u2019s risk-taking & punk approach is at the core of everything he does and it\u2019s a big part of the ethos of his current label, Omnidisc. \"We're not searching for chart topping hits. We\u2019re more interested in curating a catalog of music you\u2019ll remember when you walk out the door. We seek out tracks that are as raw as possible & welcome imperfections. We love the charm of an unpolished record\u201d, says Daze. It\u2019s also this freeform & experimental approach together with an element of surprise that sets him apart from the pack as both a DJ & Producer. As a DJ, he prefers to express his versatility across long sets. He is known to cut & weave from Electro to Techno into Italo Disco, into a record by Yazoo deliberately intended to provoke a reaction. \u201cI once played a Paula Abdul record at Berghain\u2026 basically, it\u2019s like it or leave it,\u201d says Daze. As a producer, his output ranges from releases on Kompakt\u2019s Speicher series, to remixes on Phantasy, Comeme, Monkeytown & more\u2026 but he also reaches far beyond techno & has created original runway soundtracks for award winning American streetwear designer John Elliott & the Australian brand Song for the Mute. \"I\u2019m obsessed with the detailed manipulation of audio. It\u2019s at the core of how I make music & I constantly feel the need to involve myself with projects that challenge & allow me to think out of the box... whether it\u2019s creating a single recognizable noise for the new MacBook, or an advert for a fashion campaign blending original music with sound design,\u201d says Daze. Danny Daze\u2019s radical approach to preserving music\u2019s integrity while breaking its boundaries may seem volatile, but it\u2019s not random. \u201cI\u2019ve always gone against the grain & it\u2019s important for everything I do to feel authentic.

They were vibrant, priapic, anthemic and focused. As they showed on a three-track demo, and on the subsequent debut single for independent label Neat (\u2018Roll The Dice\u2019/\u2019Love Xs Love\u2019), they were more than mere Def Leppard slaves. In fact, the Pettin\u2019 had an international sound that owed something to AC/DC, UFO, Thin Lizzy and Foreigner, but also had its own raging momentum.\n\nNot that the band found the road straightforward. But, thanks to a work ethic that took them around the country, plus a valuable session for Radio 1\u2019s prestigious \u2018Friday Rock Show\u2019, the band eventually landed a crucial deal with the major label Polydor Records. Moreover, their 1983 debut album (\u2018Lettin\u2019 Loose\u2019) was co-produced by the creative Mack together with Queen guitarist Brian May. Now, that\u2019s pedigree.\n\nAmazingly, that album has survived more than 20 years of high-speed hi-tech developments intact. While other, more celebrated records have dated badly, \u2018Lettin\u2019 Loose\u2019 re-affirms the belief back then that the Pettin\u2019 would follow Leppard to big time stature. What went wrong at the time has little to do with the band, or lack of ambition/talent.\n\nIn America, where they should have broken big long before Bon Jovi gave Love A Bad Name, they were held back by the label\u2019s insistence on an anaemic re-mix (as well as a title change to \u2018Heavy Pettin\u2019, which caused more confusion than anything else). If the band\u2019s essential, vital British brio had been left as conceived in the first place, who knows what might have been achieved. Still, a slot on the bill for the 1983 Reading Festival, the day that Black Sabbath infamously headlined when fronted by Ian Gillan, did them no harm and touring with Kiss, Ozzy, and Motley Crue helped the quintet\u2019s progress.\n\nTwo years later, the Pettin\u2019 return to the studio, this time with producer Mark Dearnley (who\u2019d worked with AC/DC and Krokus). The result? \u2018Rock Ain\u2019t Dead\u2019, which surprised many with a slicker yet conversely tougher approach. The lads really had progressed, although ironically if things had gone to plan, this would have been produced by Lance Quinn, of Bon Jovi and Lita Ford fame. However, just hours before the band were due to fly to Philadelphia, to work with Quinn at his Warehouse Studios, the decision was taken by PolyGram (to whom both Heavy Pettin and Bon Jovi were signed in the US) that, instead, he should start work immediately on what was to be Jovi\u2019s second record, \u20187800 Degrees Fahrenheit\u2019.\n\nPerhaps then, it should have been obvious that record company politics were to scupper Pettin in the crucial American market. Despite continuing to show up well in the UK, once again the US was to prove elusive \u2013 through no fault of the five musicians. In many respects, this was the point when the writing was scrawled over every available wall space. Regardless of their obvious determination and grassroots support in Britain, it seemed as if Pettin\u2019s realistic chance of significant international success had gone. A third album, \u2018The Big Bang\u2019, was released by FM Revolver in 1989. Although it still proved this lot were way ahead of so many others who were selling truckloads of units and getting acclaim from the media; as the 1980s faded into memory, so too did Heavy Pettin\u2019.\n\nDriven by a desire, a passion and a capacity simply to invoke the magic and rapport the band enjoyed, they released Prodigal Songs in 2007. The album was well-received by their loyal fans and the limited pressing sold out making it a highly sought-after collector\u2019s item.\n\nIn 2017, original members Hamie, Punky, and Gordon joined by Jez Parry on bass and Michael Ivory on drums performed for the first time in 25 years at Scotland\u2019s Winter Storm. Reinvigorated, Heavy Pettin, now joined by ex-Gun guitarist Dave Aitken due to Punky hanging up his guitar and going into retirement, did several shows in 2018 including a 6 date UK tour, with 3 sold-out gigs in Nottingham, London and Edinburgh, as well as 2 sold-out headline gigs in Milton Keynes and Glasgow.\n\nThe 2019 Heavy Pettin\u2019 assault started in North Wales with HRH AOR Festival, then off to Germany\u2019s Headbangers Open Air Festival in July, and Aug/Sept tour including The Golden Age of Rock Festival Belgium, with Dee Snider and Angel, plus a mainland British tour with RockGoddess.\n\nHeavy Pettin\u2019 is currently finishing 2019 recording and mixing a new Independent EP, \u20184 Play\u2019 for mid-February fan release.on their Facebook site.\nTrack Listing :\n1.

First, DREAMERS\u2019 aesthetic embodies psychedelia. It hearkens back to simpler times on the internet, when pixilated 8-bit imagery of starry nights looked like HD. The group flaunts its self-made exploding rainbow gifs like a unicorn in heat. Second, contrary to what these psychedelic visions may musically imply, DREAMERS plays smart pop. The 12 tracks on the trio\u2019s debut LP This Album Does Not Exist sizzle and spark with three-minute tunes to perk you up and make you shake. Third, according to DREAMERS, there\u2019s a point to this. When DREAMERS\u2014Nick Wold (vocals/guitar), Nelson (bass/vocals), and Jacob Wick (drums)\u2014talk about This Album Does Not Exist, they assume a collective tone of considerate existentialism. They seek to counter the crassness of pop, the snobbery of jazz, and the pretention of indie that zaps the fun out of music with meaning. Yet, they want to draw you in, indiscriminate of taste, style, or ideology. \u201cNothing exists by itself,\u201d muses Wold. \u201cEverything in your mind is created in your mind and you see the world through that lens. Everything has a subjective reality in addition to an objective one, especially with music and art. So on this record, we\u2019re toying with that idea of existence and nonexistence.\u201d Yet, these songs of playfulness come from a place of less\u2014homelessness, joblessness, borderline hopelessness. In 2014, Wold simultaneously vacated a relationship and an apartment and began living in his Brooklyn practice space. The brick warehouse used to be a brewery, he recalls, with rats as ubiquitous as the graffiti crawling the walls. \u201cIt was just a cinderblock room with no windows, no bathrooms, \u201d begins Wold before Nelson chimes in, \u201cMusical prison!\u201d Recalls Wold, \u201cI showered with this $20 a month gym membership I had.\u201d When he returned to the studio, \u201cI just tried to make it look like I was coming in for a night session.\u201d During the two years of living in this \u201cmusical prison,\u201d Wold reduced his bartending gig to just once per week. It freed up his schedule to write more than 100 songs, many of which ended up on This Album Does Not Exist. Meanwhile, both Nelson and Wick bottomed out on the musician lifestyle and returned to office jobs in New York and Los Angeles, respectively. As Nelson says, \u201cWe found ourselves in \u2018normal\u2019 situations and quickly decided to yank ourselves out of it.\u201d So now, after bouts of vagrancy, nomadism, and vigilant attempts at normalcy, DREAMERS is now committed to its collective vision of artistry, inclusion, and idealism. \u201cThe role of the artist in society is to be the dreamer, the one who thinks ahead,\u201d considers Wold. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to pull people in. It\u2019s a way of trying to coax people into our world, continues Nelson. \u201cWe want to bring people in to listen to our music and enjoy themselves....and then hopefully it\u2019ll lead to a deeper connection.\u201d That\u2019s the dreamer MO, after all\u2014to find the joy in living and to chase it. ---- After more than two years of nomadism and cross-country touring, as well as two EPs, Los Angeles\u2019 DREAMERS released its debut full-length LP This Album Does Not Exist on August 26, 2016. The smart alt pop trio, comprised of Nick Wold (vocals/guitar), Nelson (bass/vocals), and Jacob Wick (drums), wrote much for the album in Brooklyn before moving to L.A. and tracking at Fairfax Recordings (formerly Sound City Studios). Led by singles like \u201cDrugs\u201d and \u201cSweet Disaster,\u201d DREAMERS pits the party and the paranoia of escapism in seemingly effortlessly tight, three-minute tunes. Album tracks like \u201cPain Killer\u201d and \u201cLucky Dog\u201d follow in this vein, swinging with handclaps and driving with sing-along choruses. Throughout This Album Does Not Exist, DREAMERS toys with themes of existence and existentialism, but it\u2019s easy enough to get sucked into their world and dance the big questions away. \\\\cosmic rock// \"THIS ALBUM DOES NOT EXIST\" is out NOW Download: http://smarturl.it/DreamersDoesNotExist Streaming:http://smarturl.it/DreamersDoesNotExWS", "otherInfo": "Live stream at https://live.bandsintown.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Madwave ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10374551.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Trance", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Considered to be one of the pillars of the Swiss trance scene, Madwave is more than a professional artist who captivates the crowd behind the decks!

Labels like Schematic in Miami, Interdimensional Transmissions from Detroit & Viewlexx out of The Hague set the foundation for Daze. Daniel Gomez adopted his Daze moniker early on at his mother\u2019s suggestion. Practicing on a set-up she bought him, Daze was spinning at weddings by age 14, funneling his earnings into vinyl to play raves on the side. That eventually led to producing his first tracks in 2004 on a cracked version of Fruity Loops and later that year, he jumpstarted a electro / techno white label called Omniamm. Daze\u2019s risk-taking & punk approach is at the core of everything he does and it\u2019s a big part of the ethos of his current label, Omnidisc. \"We're not searching for chart topping hits. We\u2019re more interested in curating a catalog of music you\u2019ll remember when you walk out the door. We seek out tracks that are as raw as possible & welcome imperfections. We love the charm of an unpolished record\u201d, says Daze. It\u2019s also this freeform & experimental approach together with an element of surprise that sets him apart from the pack as both a DJ & Producer. As a DJ, he prefers to express his versatility across long sets. He is known to cut & weave from Electro to Techno into Italo Disco, into a record by Yazoo deliberately intended to provoke a reaction. \u201cI once played a Paula Abdul record at Berghain\u2026 basically, it\u2019s like it or leave it,\u201d says Daze. As a producer, his output ranges from releases on Kompakt\u2019s Speicher series, to remixes on Phantasy, Comeme, Monkeytown & more\u2026 but he also reaches far beyond techno & has created original runway soundtracks for award winning American streetwear designer John Elliott & the Australian brand Song for the Mute. \"I\u2019m obsessed with the detailed manipulation of audio. It\u2019s at the core of how I make music & I constantly feel the need to involve myself with projects that challenge & allow me to think out of the box... whether it\u2019s creating a single recognizable noise for the new MacBook, or an advert for a fashion campaign blending original music with sound design,\u201d says Daze. Danny Daze\u2019s radical approach to preserving music\u2019s integrity while breaking its boundaries may seem volatile, but it\u2019s not random. \u201cI\u2019ve always gone against the grain & it\u2019s important for everything I do to feel authentic.

They were vibrant, priapic, anthemic and focused. As they showed on a three-track demo, and on the subsequent debut single for independent label Neat (\u2018Roll The Dice\u2019/\u2019Love Xs Love\u2019), they were more than mere Def Leppard slaves. In fact, the Pettin\u2019 had an international sound that owed something to AC/DC, UFO, Thin Lizzy and Foreigner, but also had its own raging momentum.\n\nNot that the band found the road straightforward. But, thanks to a work ethic that took them around the country, plus a valuable session for Radio 1\u2019s prestigious \u2018Friday Rock Show\u2019, the band eventually landed a crucial deal with the major label Polydor Records. Moreover, their 1983 debut album (\u2018Lettin\u2019 Loose\u2019) was co-produced by the creative Mack together with Queen guitarist Brian May. Now, that\u2019s pedigree.\n\nAmazingly, that album has survived more than 20 years of high-speed hi-tech developments intact. While other, more celebrated records have dated badly, \u2018Lettin\u2019 Loose\u2019 re-affirms the belief back then that the Pettin\u2019 would follow Leppard to big time stature. What went wrong at the time has little to do with the band, or lack of ambition/talent.\n\nIn America, where they should have broken big long before Bon Jovi gave Love A Bad Name, they were held back by the label\u2019s insistence on an anaemic re-mix (as well as a title change to \u2018Heavy Pettin\u2019, which caused more confusion than anything else). If the band\u2019s essential, vital British brio had been left as conceived in the first place, who knows what might have been achieved. Still, a slot on the bill for the 1983 Reading Festival, the day that Black Sabbath infamously headlined when fronted by Ian Gillan, did them no harm and touring with Kiss, Ozzy, and Motley Crue helped the quintet\u2019s progress.\n\nTwo years later, the Pettin\u2019 return to the studio, this time with producer Mark Dearnley (who\u2019d worked with AC/DC and Krokus). The result? \u2018Rock Ain\u2019t Dead\u2019, which surprised many with a slicker yet conversely tougher approach. The lads really had progressed, although ironically if things had gone to plan, this would have been produced by Lance Quinn, of Bon Jovi and Lita Ford fame. However, just hours before the band were due to fly to Philadelphia, to work with Quinn at his Warehouse Studios, the decision was taken by PolyGram (to whom both Heavy Pettin and Bon Jovi were signed in the US) that, instead, he should start work immediately on what was to be Jovi\u2019s second record, \u20187800 Degrees Fahrenheit\u2019.\n\nPerhaps then, it should have been obvious that record company politics were to scupper Pettin in the crucial American market. Despite continuing to show up well in the UK, once again the US was to prove elusive \u2013 through no fault of the five musicians. In many respects, this was the point when the writing was scrawled over every available wall space. Regardless of their obvious determination and grassroots support in Britain, it seemed as if Pettin\u2019s realistic chance of significant international success had gone. A third album, \u2018The Big Bang\u2019, was released by FM Revolver in 1989. Although it still proved this lot were way ahead of so many others who were selling truckloads of units and getting acclaim from the media; as the 1980s faded into memory, so too did Heavy Pettin\u2019.\n\nDriven by a desire, a passion and a capacity simply to invoke the magic and rapport the band enjoyed, they released Prodigal Songs in 2007. The album was well-received by their loyal fans and the limited pressing sold out making it a highly sought-after collector\u2019s item.\n\nIn 2017, original members Hamie, Punky, and Gordon joined by Jez Parry on bass and Michael Ivory on drums performed for the first time in 25 years at Scotland\u2019s Winter Storm. Reinvigorated, Heavy Pettin, now joined by ex-Gun guitarist Dave Aitken due to Punky hanging up his guitar and going into retirement, did several shows in 2018 including a 6 date UK tour, with 3 sold-out gigs in Nottingham, London and Edinburgh, as well as 2 sold-out headline gigs in Milton Keynes and Glasgow.\n\nThe 2019 Heavy Pettin\u2019 assault started in North Wales with HRH AOR Festival, then off to Germany\u2019s Headbangers Open Air Festival in July, and Aug/Sept tour including The Golden Age of Rock Festival Belgium, with Dee Snider and Angel, plus a mainland British tour with RockGoddess.\n\nHeavy Pettin\u2019 is currently finishing 2019 recording and mixing a new Independent EP, \u20184 Play\u2019 for mid-February fan release.on their Facebook site.\nTrack Listing :\n1.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is.

You\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhy should I care about The Urban Voodoo Machine? They\u2019ve been around for ages, haven\u2019t they? Aren\u2019t they a novelty band who wears funny make-up? Don\u2019t they sometimes play jazz? Aren\u2019t half of them dead or something?\u201d\n\nSo bear with us, sunshine, cos you clearly need educating.\n\nThe story starts with Paul-Ronney Angel, a man with a double-barrelled first name. I could be a wanker about this and say the story starts with Bon Scott-era AC/DC \u2013 with Tom Waits, or the Clash, Louis Armstrong, the Pogues, the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, Johnny Cash, Lionel Bart or Bertolt Brecht \u2013 but let\u2019s stick with Paul-Ronney, it\u2019s quicker.\n\nPaul-Ronney Angel ate his parents and fled the fjords of Norway with just a bottle of moonshine and several slices of decomposing fish in his back pocket. (Before he left they tried him in the Norwegian Army \u2013 he lasted a total of five hours.)\n\nAfter that, Angel washed up in London during the dying breaths of Thatcherism and took advantage of all that swinging London had to offer: he sold The Big Issue, busked Johnny Thunders & Robert Johnson numbers in Soho bus stops and played guitar for anyone who\u2019d have him.\n\nThe Urban Voodoo Machine came to him in 2002 as a fully-formed idea. He\u2019d lead a band who\u2019d play \u2018Bourbon Soaked Gypsy Blues Bop\u2019n\u2019Stroll\u2019. They\u2019d dress in black and red. There would be a LOT of them. And their music would sound like a great night out in a dangerous part of town. From the get-go, The UVM fused junkyard blues and stinging rockabilly with mariachi horns, fiddles, sinister cabaret and punk rock tangos. \u201cI wanted to play rock\u2019n\u2019roll music with a different instrumentation,\u201d says Angel, \u201ctaking inspiration from everything from delta blues, latin and gypsy music without losing the spirit and attitude of punk.\u201d His lyrics \u2013 part Lemmy, part Bob Dylan \u2013 made other (more acclaimed) songwriters sound totally. Fucking. Boring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not Americana and were definitely not \u2018retro\u2019,\u201d says Angel. \u201cI write songs about living in London right now. Although having a shit time, no money, heartbreak, mental illness, addiction and suppression from the big guy is kinda universal and timeless, I guess\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah-yeah-yeah,\u201d you\u2019re thinking, \u201cbut can they cut it live?\u201d Well, there\u2019s a reason why they\u2019ve played Glastonbury, Download, Latitude, Bestival, Hard Rock Calling and toured with The Pogues and New York Dolls. With an act honed alongside the burlesque dancers, snake-charmers and fire-eaters they call friends, The UVM have become one of the greatest live acts in the country \u2013 terrifyingly bizarre, hysterically funny; a riot for the eyes and sensation for the ears: a sing-a-long, drink-a-long, clap-a-long affair.\n\nIn 2006 they launched the Gypsy Hotel Club in the then-unfashionable part of London\u2019s East End, Dalston, a monthly Bourbon Soaked Snake Charmin\u2019 Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Cabaret night for likeminded misfits, movers and shakers. Time Out Magazine wrote, \u201cIf you have 12 hours to live, spend it at Gypsy Hotel!\u201d\n\nMagazines and newspapers have lauded them for their \u201cmariachi-influenced blues, whiskey-soaked country rags and punkabilly-style rave-ups\u201d (The Washington Post) and noted that they\u2019re \u201cdrawing deep from a dirty well where Tom Waits, Nick Cave and Dick Dale are enjoying a burlesque all-nighter with Ennio Morricone\u201d (Classic Rock). They became one of the few bands that could appear on Clive Anderson\u2019s Loose Ends on BBC Radio 4 and Britain\u2019s biggest heavy metal festival Download in the same year and win at both.\n\nIn 2014, when Paul-Ronney named their third album Love, Drink & Death! he had no idea what the year had in store. In October, fiddle-player Rob Skipper died of an accidental heroin overdose, aged just 28. Guitarist Nick Marsh (formerly frontman of Flesh For Lulu) fought throat cancer throughout that year. He died in June 2015, aged 53. The Voodoo Machine transformed themselves into a New Orleans-style marching band for his funeral. The Urban Voodoo Machine Marching Band also played the Classic Rock Awards that year \u2013 the only band to do so without electricity.\n\nAnd that brings us to new album Hellbound Hymns. Marsh plays on eight of its 13 songs. (Angel: \u201cHe was really putting the hours in when he knew the cancer had come back. He was like, \u2018Right, these might be my last recordings with this band, so let\u2019s roll the tape and make it a good one!\u201d) To borrow one of the song titles, it\u2019s all mixed-up. It\u2019s part wake, part protest, part valediction \u2013 a party at the gates of hell \u2013 because the greatest tribute you can pay the dead is to live life to the full: \u201cWe will sing and we will dance/We will drink and we will laugh/We will not forget the past and our fallen brothers\u2026\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lisa Stanley ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10387833.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Easy Listening, Country, Celtic, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Lisa Stanley is undoubtably one of Irelands top female vocalists.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

He started writing tunes around that time. Later he studied music at the Conservatory in Cologne and also took classes with creative masters such as Dave Holland, Steve Coleman, Muhal Richard Abrams, George Lewis, and Steve Lacy.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2009, he lived in Amsterdam where he became part of that city\u2019s internationally renowned improvised music scene.\nSince 2002, he has been touring internationally with the trio Kaufmann/Gratkowski/de Joode, an improvising unit which has released four CDs so far, to much critical acclaim.\n\nIn the late \u201890s and \u201800s, Achim led two groups with reed player Michael Moore: trio kamosc and gueuledeloup quartet.\nIn 2007, he recorded kyrill, a set of compositions for piano trio featuring Valdi Kolli and Jim Black. Their follow-up cd, entitled verivyr, was released in 2011.\n\nHe has also collaborated with his wife, poet/painter Gabriele Guenther, on the audiodrama Borderline \u2013 From the Shadows of a Journey, and has written music for various chamber ensembles.\nIn his solo work, mixed techniques are used to create a fluctuating world of sounds and gestures. Resonance and reverberation, space and density play an important role in both his solo and ensemble work.\n\nSince his move to Berlin, he got involved in various new projects, such as the trio gr\u00fcnen with Robert Landfermann and Christian Lillinger, Oni Kramler (with Matthias Schubert, Antonio Borghini, and various guests), and a trio with cellist Okkyung Lee and trumpeter Axel D\u00f6rner.\n\nIn 2013, the sextet SKEIN (Kaufmann/Gratkowski/de Joode plus Richard Barrett, Okkyung Lee, and Tony Buck) had its premiere at the dOeK festival in Amsterdam and subsequently recorded for SWR radio.\n\nHe recently released duo albums with long-standing collaborators Michael Moore and Thomas Heberer.\n\nIn addition, Achim has played and/or recorded with Han Bennink, Mark Dresser, George Lewis, Steve Swallow, Tobias Delius, Wolter Wierbos, Mark Helias, Paul Rutherford, Thomas Lehn, Ab Baars, Paul Lovens, Dylan van der Schyff, Peggy Lee, Chris Speed, Tom\u00e1sz Stanko, Gerd Dudek, Bill Elgart, Paul Lytton, Harri Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Andrea Parkins, Harris Eisenstadt, Ingrid Laubrock, Tristan Honsinger, Shelley Hirsch, Steve Swell, Thomas Heberer, Urs Leimgruber, Roger Turner, Fay Victor, Fred Lonberg-Holm, John Hollenbeck, Bob Brookmeyer, Simon Nabatov, L\u00ea Quan Ninh, Gerry Hemingway, John H\u00e9bert, Al Foster, Adam Nussbaum, and many more.\n\nHe was awarded the German SWR Jazz Award in 2001, and the prestigious Albert Mangelsdorff award in 2015.\n\n\u201cFor many years, Achim Kaufmann has been one of the most inspiring and exciting personalities of the European jazz and improvisation scene. His music bears witness to great harmonic subtlety and structural depth. A brilliant pianist and composer, his reflected exploration of tradition has led him to a nuanced, contemporary sound language that encompasses poetry, energy and abstraction in equal measure.\u201d Julia Neupert, SWR Radio\n\nwww.achimkaufmann.com\n\nInto The Shed\nInto The Shed is a concert series focusing on presenting musicians who are all a part of the big and vibrant Berlin jazz and improvised music scene.

As\u00ed, de esa manera tan simple y casual, nace Shinova. Medio a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s, grab\u00e1bamos nuestro primer disco, \"Latidos\" (2009), e impulsados por aquella experiencia y con el motor de nuestra contrastada insensatez lleno de combustible, decidimos engendrar una segunda obra a la que titulamos \"La Ceremonia de la Confusi\u00f3n\" (2011).

The Edmonton, Kentucky-based rock n\u2019 roll quartet Black Stone Cherry was raised on musical forefathers such as Cream, Led Zeppelin, Muddy Waters, and the Faces, among other 1970s staples, and, now, with its sixth album, Family Tree, BSC salutes its classic rock heritage and honors its legacy with a beast of a Southern rock n\u2019 roll album.\n\n\u201cWe caught divine intervention with this one,\u201d guitarist Ben Wells says with a good chuckle. \u201cWe hit a creative spark and tapped into a spirit and a fire we hadn\u2019t before.\u201d Drummer John Fred Young adds: \u201cFamily Tree showcases all of our collective musical influences and how we have taken those to create something that is truly our own unique Southern American Rock \u2018N Roll Sound.\u201d\n\nFor 17 years, Black Stone Cherry has put forth a new vicious breed of Southern rock, injecting youthful vitality and a myriad of fresh new influences into the beloved American rock tradition. To date, the band has released five critically acclaimed albums, and one well-received blues EP. Black Stone Cherry has also rocked 12,000-cap arena shows, topped the UK charts, and shared the stage with a diverse roster of superstars, including Def Leppard, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Bad Company, M\u00f6torhead, and ZZ Top.\n\nBlack Stone Cherry came together in 2001 in Edmonton, Kentucky, eventually coalescing around the lineup of Chris Robertson, vocals and guitar; Ben Wells, guitar and vocals; Jon Lawhon, bass and vocals; and John Fred Young, drums. Young's dad Richard, and his Uncle Fred, are two members of the iconic country-fried rock n\u2019 roots band The Kentucky HeadHunters, and the high school-aged boys came up honing their craft in the group\u2019s Practice House, a 1940s bungalow.\n\n\u201cWe grew up in the Kentucky Headhunters\u2019 rehearsal space, looking up at posters of Cream, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, the Stones, Montrose, and the Faces. We were like kids someone took in a time capsule and put in the woods,\u201d says drummer John Fred Young.\n\nLike the band\u2019s previous album and EP, Black Stone Cherry opted to self-produce and track Family Tree at David Barrick's Barrick Recording, the same studio where BSC recorded its self-titled debut and Kentucky albums . BSC also opted to not over-rehearse in advance of the album, instead preferring the immediacy and spontaneity of in the-moment takes. \u201cThere was a lot of laughter in the studio this time, and an air of comfort because we had self-produced the last few releases. It helped us get down to the nitty gritty bones of our music,\u201d says bassist Jon Lawhon. The band also entrusted guitarist and vocalist Chris Robertson to mix the album. This homespun approach perfectly suited the loose but epiphanic creative sessions that birthed Family Tree.\n\nFamily Tree boasts BSC\u2019s tried-and-true lucky number with its 13 songs, and, like all BSC releases, features songwriting contributions from each member. The result is a modern and meaty blues-based rock album, with unexpected sonic twists like punchy horn sections, barrelhouse pianos, Southern gospel organ, atmospheric synthesizer passages, and forays into funk and country.\n\nThe title track melds brawny blues riffage with BSC\u2019s most telepathic ensemble playing, showcasing the group\u2019s maturation as a unit without detracting from its Southern, hard rock wallop. The album also packs some satisfyingly surprising moments. \u201cCarry Me On Down The Road\u201d is a sleek slice of pure 1970s American rock n\u2019 roll\u2014something you would hear blaring out of a 1972 Chevy El Camino. \u201cJames Brown\u201d offers forth some stanky swamp-funk, replete with wah-wah guitars and gospel girl vocals. \u201cBad Habit,\u201d however, dripping sensual innuendo hammered home by a horny groove-rock beat, delivers some prime hooky and heavy BSC.\n\nOne Family Tree centerpiece is the rustically elegant \u201cMy Last Breath,\u201d a sweetly downhome ode to the unbreakable bonds of family. The song\u2019s goose bump-inducing call and response male and female vocal breakdown is one of those musical moments where light just shines through the speakers and you know everything is going to be alright.\n\nTwo special guests bring Family Tree full circle, one being Chris\u2019 5 year-old son singing backup on the brawny swaggering \u201cYou Got The Blues,\u201d and the other being jam band icon Warren Haynes\u2019 vocal and guitar cameo on the delta stomp of \u201cDancing In The Rain.\u201d The band first met Warren 17 years ago when they first came to New York to showcase for their new label. \u201cI remember coming to New York when we first were signed, and hearing Warren\u2019s voice behind me the minute my feet hit the street,\u201d recalls bassist Jon Lawhon. \u201cHearing him play on this track all these years later gave me chills.\u201d\n\nHaving Warren guest on the album was a wonderful gesture of \u201cyou\u2019re in the family now.\u201d It was truly a validation of all the miles the band has clocked on tour, and the dues the guys have paid being away from home. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how four good old boys from nowhere Kentucky can still be around 17 years later,\u201d singer/guitarist Chris Robertson says. Ben Wells concludes: \u201cI don\u2019t remember how life was outside of Black Stone Cherry.

It's fueled by pounding keys, squalling guitar lines, and lightning drumming before the voice of Christian Zucconi questions everything around him: faith systems, his sense of belonging, communities, his own psyche. \u201cAll this time I thought you were a leader/It turns out you're only a deleter.\u201dIt could be interpreted as a political statement, but it's also highly personal. \u201cAll this time been burning with a fever / It turns out I've always been my healer,\u201dis also switched in as a rhyming line, and in the end sees Zucconi and his collaborator, wife and frontwoman Hannah Hooper realizing that amid every progression and every regression you always come back to yourself for the answers. They're already within you.\n\nToday in a cafe in their LA neighborhood of Silver Lake,the pair sit down as two people who have experienced and borne witness to a great deal of change, trauma and growth in the past three years. You may associate the band as a beacon for positivity and optimism. They're still a five-piece \u2013albeit with a new drummer in Ben Homola \u2013and at their core, remain a vessel for looking at the glass half full. Hence their opening sentiment: a rallying cry for tearing down false idols and building anew.\n\nAfter the band completed touring their 2016 album Big Mess, it all got tumultuous. Back in LA, Hannah had committed to taking some personal time to pursue an art show of her paintings. Just before theshow and before the band started writing again, they lost a dear friend. As Hannah painted,she felt connected to him, and was consumed by thoughts of death and the afterlife. All the while the left side of her body had started to feel out of her possession. \u201cIt felt like I was having a slow stroke,\u201d she recalls. She got an MRI to be safe. The day she finished painting the show, the results came through. The news was bad \u2013she needed brain surgery. \u201cWhat the fuck?! I just went white.\u201d\n\nWith Hannah's shocking news and the world outside feeling like it was in constant crisis, making music became the greatest remedy for the band and they started to write. They wrote more than they've ever written. Decamping to Northern California they worked in a way they never had before, experiencing a collective catharsis.\n\nThey made very aggressive grunge. \u201cIt felt good to scream,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cWe write music as a way to deal with good times or bad.\u201d The shows, the songsandthe writing took Hannah out of a state of constant freak-out. It didn\u2019t only help heal Hannah, but also helped heal Christian, who wasn't just a Buddha-like figure for Hannah and their young daughter but,was helping keep the band in productive spirits too.\n\nIn October 2018, the band \u2013 including Homola, guitarist Andrew Wessen and bassist Daniel Gleason \u2013 traveled to El Paso, Texas with esteemed producer Dave Sitek [of TV On The Radio] for a month. This was a shift for the band, who had previously worked almost entirely in house with founding member and former drummer/producer Ryan Rabin. Rabin left amicably prior to the band beginning work on this album. Sitek had heard 'Deleter' and loved it but he wanted to work with the band to veer away from their previous grunge-leanings. He wanted to take them outside the box and stretch them beyond what they had ever had to deal with. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cIt's like playing a sport with a new teammate. We just became better.\u201d\n\nWorking in Texas was a headtrip. \u201cWe had never recorded in a place where time did not exist, because it doesn\u2019t exist at Sonic Ranch if you don\u2019t want it to. We watched the sun rise every singleday, I had lost the concept of time,\u201d Andrewadds. Ben felt the same and helped set the scene in Texas: \u201cWe never missed a sunrise, listening back with the studio doors wide open, sitting around a tired fire surrounded by miles and miles of pecan trees. Hannah and I laughed uncontrollably, couldn\u2019t even produce words, couldn\u2019t stop crying -Were we happy or losing our minds? Haha I\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\nNot only did they learn new tricks, but Sitek encouraged them both to simplify their sound and to extend it. The songs they made during this period are so ambitious, that it pushed them to become a seven-piece band ontour. The limitations were gone. They were away from the world, immersed and unplugged in the middle of nowhere. They were also half a mile from the border and during the height of Trump's family separations crisis.\n\nBeing close to that inspired the song 'Promises.' \u201cNothing disappoints me like the news,\u201dsings Christian, taking into consideration his own experience as a father. \u201cYou're just following orders, closing your eyes and telling lies while they're taking our daughters.\u201d The track sounds like a paranoid futuristic Western.\n\n\u2018Youth\u2019 is an anthem reminding people never to forget their inner child. \u201cWhen we finished Youth a group of us drove to El Paso and went grocery shopping, bought fireworks, went to a guitar shop and stopped at a food stand. We had been up for 2 days. We looked insane, we felt insane & and it was insane. But I\u2019ll never forget how the song felt as we sped down the highway, Dave driving 150 mph, all of us just crammed in. I can literally picture it perfectly because I was so fucking proud of the song and couldn\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t exist 1/2 day before,\u201d Andrew recalls.\n\nSongs like \u2018Expectations\u2019 and \u2018Places\u2019speak to the more internal and personal friction many of us feel these days. \u2018Places\u2019line, \u201cthere\u2019s a place we\u2019re all running from, and we don\u2019t know how to get there,\u201d is Christian examining his experience in a constantly evolving world.\n\nWhen the band got back to LA, they got in the studio with a second producer \u2013Malay, famed for working with Frank Ocean and Lorde. They found themselves more prolific than ever, in an easier mode of creativity. Songs like \u2018Inside Out\u2019 were written and recorded in just a couple of days. Hannah remarks that the song reminds us that life is more beautiful the more honestlywe live it.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to collaborate with brilliant musical minds whose only agenda was to make honest and exciting music. It\u2019s what you hope for. Malay is the perfect example of someone who creates from his inner music fan,\u201d Dan recalls.\n\nHannah has always been the visual force for all of Grouplove\u2019s art, and in June 2019, she was given the opportunity to showcase her own paintings at the legendary artist Shepard Fairey\u2019s gallery. Now, post-surgery, she\u2019s still recovering. Butshe sees it as a gift; a way to connect with others.\n\nIt's been almost ten years since Grouplove met on a commune in Greece and brought the idea of themselves being a band back to California. They'd never have anticipated making it this far. Healer represents a re-birth and one that almost comes full circle to their initial idealism. \u201cWhen we all met in Greece, Christian and I were leaving New York at an all-time low. We just wanted to have a fun summer. We wanted to make art. And we're still doing that. We found that feeling again on this album, of hopelessness put into a medium of expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis album is us fighting for that feeling,\u201d says Hannah.\u201cThere's a darkness that's real and everyone deals with it at a certain point in their life. We\u2019re addressing that life is hard.We understand and we are going through it with you.\u201d\n\nGrouplove is: Hannah Hooper, Christian Zucconi, Andrew Wessen, Daniel Gleason, Benjamin Homola", "otherInfo": "Instagram Live & Chat"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Atreyu ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10386416.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Heavy Metal Thunder", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Web - http://atreyuofficial.com\nMerch - http://atreyu.rockworldmerch.com", "otherInfo": "GET YOUR TICKETS NOW AT BRANDONSALLER.VEEPS.COM\n\nThis will be the most produced performance I have done online to date.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON). The Allaire Show features John sharing the stage with local and up-and-coming talent as well as more experienced and established musicians, some who\u2019ve come from as far away as Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\n\nAWARDS\n- American Songwriter Assoc. \"Best Lyrics\" Award 2009 for \"Magnets\" (Nashville, TN)\n\n- Toronto Independent Music Awards \"Best Live Act\" (2009)\n\n- CBC Telefest top independent music video in Ontario (1989)\n\n- Top independent video in Canada 1989 as selected by MuchMusic\n\n- Canadian College and University Radio Assoc. top album of the month - \"All's Well\" (1989)\n\n- PROCAN (now SOCAN) independent songwriter award for \"Cry at Night\" (1987)", "otherInfo": "Pub Party Fridays brought to you by Flora Hall Brewing.

The album\u2019s visual, a collage made by the young colombian artist Sara Agudelo Gutierrez and created from a photo taken by the Montreal photographer Mawuko, represents this blend between identities, this blend between urban and nature, tradition and modernism, dream and reality.\n//\nMontr\u00e9alais depuis pr\u00e8s de 15 ans, le multi-instrumentiste colombien Ramon Chicharron transmet l\u2019amour de ses origines par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de sa musique. Avec sa voix si particuli\u00e8re, ses rythmes entra\u00eenants d\u2019influence latines et carib\u00e9ennes, auxquels s\u2019ajoutent une touche d\u2019\u00e9lectro, la musique de Ramon est une v\u00e9ritable invitation au voyage. Avec sa plume \u00e0 la fois sensible, engag\u00e9e et dr\u00f4le, il s\u2019inspire du d\u00e9sir de vivre plus simplement, d\u2019un monde sans fronti\u00e8res et des difficult\u00e9s rencontr\u00e9es lorsque l\u2019on poursuit son r\u00eave.

prolific Brill building pop Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and \u2013 fingers crossed - Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music - and give them an experience that they will never forget.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Every Friday I will transport my viewers into the past where they will feel as thought they are sitting behind the recording console at Motown's Hitsville recording studio.

Released in 2011, it was immediately acclaimed on both sides of the Atlantic.

Billingham writing a dark, noir tale of murder, lust and revenge around 8 King & Dalgleish songs.

In his own way he goes about singing songs from all over the spectrum with an ease that is only fitting of one who is many years older and a prowess on guitar that is singular in its ability to stand alone without accompaniment. Its a wonderful mystery to behold how the essence of any song can be captured so simply by one voice and a guitar, but he does it with originality, taste and an unexpected power for someone who isn\u2019t really on the radar to the wider music community. And it is with a resigned sense of purpose that this 29 year-old Canadian continues to write, interpret and perform music in often the humblest of capacities. This is his path. And he must follow it to the end.\n\n\n\n\u201cI always say \u2018you must inspire yourself, find your path, be true to it and follow it to the end\u2019 because that\u2019s really all that needs to be done in this life. If you can do that then there is nothing to worry about. Whatever your path may be, it will always teach you everything else you need to know about life on the way. For me there is a feeling of obligation to music because it is so clearly the best thing I can offer to the world, but I often fight it in favour of other things only to eventually realize I\u2019m not honouring my true path. So it becomes a balance between seemingly opposing forces that in the end put me right where I need to be.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe opposing force he is referring to is his commitment to a contemplative life of meditation practice. A life traditionally aided by long hours of silence and rigid structure; not a life typically lived by a working musician. After several years of torn aspiration between the life of a Buddhist monk and pursuing a serious music career as a singer/songwriter, Corey is settling somewhat into a situation he feels best serves both of these energies. He feels by maintaining a low-key, almost anonymous attitude to his live performances and online presence he can still allow room to teach guitar (another precious pastime) and spend a few hours alone each day in silent meditation.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the most part I play gigs around here in Southern Ontario. Usually just really ordinary pubs, cafes and restaurants to people who may or may not be listening all that intently but I can show up, play my heart out and leave without having to worry too much about selling tickets, or CD\u2019s and merchandise, trying to make something happen or grow my brand or whatever. I can play covers the way I want, maybe play some originals if I feel like it, work out the kinks of my delivery and be spontaneous. I often don\u2019t even say who I am. Sometimes I don\u2019t really say anything at all. Which is exactly how I go about making my videos as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nOver the years, a devoted worldwide following has sprang up through his YouTube channel where he posts performances of popular and not-so-popular cover songs as well as his own material which has helped define his purpose with music. He plays many kinds of songs without pandering to any one listening demographic and often without much of anything in the way of effects or editing. Just 20 years of craftsmanship and passion on display. The response is overwhelmingly positive as viewers experience the consistent quality and creativity of each performance. Whether its the music of musical heroes or his original songs, its difficult not to be impressed by the standard at which he sets each time he plays.\n\n\n\n\u201cPutting up videos on YouTube has been such a wonderful way for me to exercise my musical freedom and play all the songs I love \u2014 from artists I admire \u2014 and challenge myself to grow as a musician publicly. It allows me to connect with people from all over the world and reminds me why its important for me to do what I\u2019m doing, because they appreciate it. I earn very little money from this medium but its been a constant motivator and mirror for me to reflect and improve which makes it such a valuable aspect of what I do. I really neglected it while I was away travelling recently, which was necessary because I was busy gigging, busking and trying to make ends meet but now that I\u2019m back home with my recording gear I\u2019m looking forward to making videos more consistently.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter spending 18 months in Australia and California doing performances mostly on the street as well as in \u201cordinary pubs and restaurants\u201d half a world away, Corey has returned to Canada and settled in Kitchener, Ontario where he performs regularly, teaches students and still finds time for silence and meditation. Always following his path.

Her next single \u201cKing Boy\u201d trumped her first becoming the 5th most played song of the year on Sirius XM 20 on 20 while also selling over 20,000 copies, a major feat for an independent artist.\n\nWith the success of her first 2 releases Bowman found herself writing with more and more producers/songwriters. She had been working on new music with a writer at Warner Chappell Publishing when the synch team there received a request for a song about staying warm. Alongside the producer Bowman wrote \u201cKeep Me Warm,\u201d a release that would play in a national McDonald\u2019s ad campaign for over a month, as well as receive airplay on 3 different radio formats: Top 40, Hot AC, and AC.\n\nContinuing to work alongside different writers/producers she caught the attention of Kobalt Music. A publishing company who\u2019s rosters includes the likes of Max Martin, Mumford and Sons, Simon and Garfunkel, Lionel Richie, Dixie Chicks, Beck, and countless other successful artists and songwriters. Eventually signed to a Kobalt publishing deal herself Bowman released \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d through AWAL, Kobalt\u2019s global artist services company. \u201cGood Time Good Life\u201d debuted on NBC\u2019s This Is Us, ran in a national Target ad, a national Beaches Resort ad, and was chosen by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to drive The Oscar\u2019s 2017 promo aired on ABC for over 2 months. The Oscar promo lead to Bowman\u2019s national TV debut on Good Morning America where she performed \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d followed up with a performance at the Radio Disney Music Awards, and Live with Kelly and Ryan.\n\nWith the success of \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d and a move out west (a NJ native now in Los Angeles) Bowman found herself working on music going in a slightly different direction. She was doing less co-writes and found herself writing everyday on her own. Songs started pouring out of her. Her life was changing and the music she was writing was some of the realest she had ever written. In March of 2018 Bowman found herself traveling to London to explore a new city and work on new music. A NJ native, now based in Los Angeles, traveling to London. It was on a whim that she decided to attend an open mic night where she\u2019d perform a couple of her new songs for the first time. It was at that open mic night that she would meet the 2 cowriters/producers that would bring this new direction of music, this new project, to life. Bowman traveled back to London for over a month in the summer and in the fall to work on what will be her first ever EP.

In the fall of \u201999 she moved to Salzgitter, Germany where she collaborated on a commercial pop project, marking her first experience singing in a professional studio. In May 2000 she returned to Austin to explore performing and song writing. Following her role as supporting vocalist and dancer for the Austin high-energy rock band Young Heart Attack in 2001, Martin launched her solo career in 2002 with an opening slot for Wilco and her debut album Pretty Things. Shortly after the album\u2019s release, she moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia and had her first commercial success when two of her songs were placed in the award-winning British-Canadian two-part drama Sex Traffic (2004) and in the TV drama series Snakes and Ladders (2004).\n\nWith her second album, Two Hearts (2008), Martin gained considerable attention as a hot up-and-coming artist with several East Coast Music Awards and Nominations. Her Two Hearts music video rose to #5 on the Much More Music Countdown, leading to tours across Canada, the US and Ireland. She performed high-profile shows with Canadian rock icon Matt Mays and sang on Parliament Hill in Ottawa for The Queen of England. You Come Home was placed in the internationally distributed teen drama series The Best Years (2010). Two Hearts won Martin two 2008 Music Nova Scotia Awards, and a 2009 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\nHer third album I Can Too (2010) received rave reviews and includes a collaboration with Blue Rodeo\u2019s Greg Keelor on her rendering of Andrew Sisk\u2019s Subject To Change. \u201cWhat sets I Can Too apart is Martin\u2019s commitment to honestly exploring complicated relationships.\u201d (Exclaim Magazine, October 2010). Following multiple East Coast Music Award Nominations and extensive touring across Canada with Juno nominated indie rock band Cuff The Duke, Martin began touring independently in Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nIn 2011 Martin worked on building her label Come Undone Records, and focused on developing a global online presence with fans via community-based projects. She worked with PledgeMusic.com to release A House Concert (2011) containing fourteen live acoustic versions of songs from her first three studio albums. Martin was nominated at the 2011 Music Nova Scotia Awards for Digital Artist of the Year and A House Concert was nominated at the 2012 East Coast Music Awards for Folk Recording of the Year. This project also raised awareness and funds for the Canadian Mental Health Association. During 2011-2012 Christina continued her community development initiatives with a yearlong Artist in Residency through Geriatric Medicine Research (GMR) at Dalhousie University and The Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 2014 she released an EP titled Remember Me, featuring five songs inspired by and dedicated to individuals affected by dementia. Co-produced and written by Dale Murray, the EP won the 2014 Music Nova Scotia Award for Inspirational Recording of the Year.\n\nSleeping With A Stranger (2012), Martin\u02bcs fifth award-winning album, reflects the artist\u2019s coming of age lyrically and musically. \u201cIt\u02bcs one of those rare albums where you have to listen to it all in one sitting. Like a good book that\u2019s hard to put down, Sleeping With A Stranger tickles the ears and within three bars you\u2019re completely hooked.\u201d (Americana UK, October 2012). The album won her the 2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Recording of the Year Award. It was nominated for three East Coast Music Awards Come Undone Records was nominated for Music Nova Scotia Company of the Year. What I Always Knew was placed in the CBC television drama Heartland and her single Falling For You remained on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 countdown for five months.\n\nMartin returned home from Europe in the spring of 2014, following eighty concert dates which included a performance at Rolling Stone Weekender Festival, a publicity partnership with PopUp Records in Hamburg, and an endorsement from the esteemed Duesenberg Custom Guitar Shop in Hannover, Germany. She secured relationships for her future from her home base as Artist in Residence in the city of Dachau, Germany.\n\nIt\u2019ll Be Alright (2015) found Christina attaining what her music has always suggested, a place where the ghosts of her musical heroes freely mingle with the architecture of modern music. Working closely with her long-time producer and guitarist Dale Murray, drummer Brian Murray and bassist Jason Vautour, Martin made a conscious effort to confound the expectations of those who have categorized her in the past. This record utilizes far more sonic textures, allowing Martin to explore the many sides of her musical personality. The album won a 2016 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year and her It\u2019ll Be Alright single rose to #6 on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 chart. You Ran From Me was voted the #14 most played Canadian song on Sonica for 2015, and Somewhere With You was placed in the CBC Television show Heartland.\n\nFollowing two years of touring across Germany, Poland, The Netherlands, The UK, Switzerland, Austria, France and Canada, Martin returned home briefly in 2016 to write her newest album. A fervent anthem for those who are lost and longing, Lungs Are Burning was the first single from her album Impossible To Hold (Released March 23, 2018). The first single was triggered by the rising Fentanyl drug crisis killing thousands of Canadians, with Christina\u2019s lyrics set to music by her and Dale Murray. With lyrics like \u201cwhile I\u2019m watching the babies\u201d and \u201cgot to go out and get some, baby\u201d, Martin captures the desperation of \u201cchasing the dream\u201d and the horror of living it. Murray\u2019s stately production brings that stark reality home with a bite. Martin: \u201cThe song is an modest attempt to bring light to the heavy topic of addiction, and reflects my own personal sense of loss, longing and a deep void, and the ache I feel from losing my brother and friends to addiction and mental illness.\u201d For her Canadian tour dates, Christina has partnered with Center for Addiction and Mental Health to increase engagement and awareness.\n\n\u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is Martin\u2019s sixth and strongest studio album, achieving a perfect balance between organic ambience and impeccable production. \u201cI\u2019m writing about faith and love more than ever with songs like \u2018Keep Me Calm\u2019 and \u2018Always Reminding\u2019, but I haven\u2019t shaken the need to write about the darker things that are part of our human journey\u201d. Combining good taste, passionate singing and thoughtful lyrics, \u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is where music and poetry meet. The album won the 2018 Music Nova Scotia Award for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\n\nAWARDS\n\n2018 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Impossible To Hold)\n2016 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (It\u2019ll Be Alright)\n2014 Music Nova Scotia Inspirational Recording of the Year (Remember Me \u2013 EP)\n2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Sleeping With A Stranger)\n2009 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n\nARTIST IN RESIDENCIES COMPLETED\n\n2013-2015 Dachau, Germany\n\n2010-2011 Halifax NS, Canada \u2013 Dalhousie Geriatric Medical Research & Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN)\n\nFESTIVALS/CONFERENCES\n\n2019 Ottawa Blues Fest - Ottawa ON, Canada\n2019 Area506 - Saint John NB, Canada\n2018 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto, Canada\n2017 Sonder Fest \u2013 Manchester, United Kingdom\n2016 Reeperbahn Festival \u2013 Hamburg, Germany\n2016 Rising Tide Festival @ Fundy National Park- Alma NB, Canada\n2016 Harmony Bazaar Festival \u2013 Lockeport NS, Canada\n2016 Maverick Festival \u2013 Suffolk, United Kingdom\n2013 Rolling Stone Weekender Festival \u2013 Weissenh\u00e4user Strand, Germany\n2011 Winter Olympics @ Atlantic Canada House \u2013 Vancouver BC, Canada\n2011 Canada Games \u2013 Halifax NS, Canada\n2011 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2010 Belfast Nashville Songwriters Festival \u2013 Belfast, Ireland\n2009 Folk Alliance \u2013 Memphis TN, USA\n2009 North By North East \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2009 Stan Rogers Festival \u2013 Canso NS, Canada\n2002 SXSW - Austin TX, USA", "otherInfo": "How's the yard work coming along for everyone?

The younger brother of Cajun fiddler Michael Doucet, Doucet has used his distinctive hybrid of folk-style fingerpicking and bluegrass-like flatpicking to strengthen the performances of Beausoleil, the band he's shared with his brother for over 21 years. With the release of his debut solo album, Quand J'ai Parti in 1991, Doucet successfully stepped into the spotlight.\nDoucet first played the guitar after recuperating from a broken arm sustained while practicing with his high school football team. Although he initially taught himself to play by using Bob Dylan and Paul Simon songbooks, Doucet became fascinated with flatpicking after listening to an album by Doc Watson.\n\nTogether with his brother and banjo player Raoul Breaux, Doucet played Cajun music in Louisiana clubs in 1975. When the project proved commercially unsuccessful, the band broke up with Doucet enrolling in college and his brother going on to form the Cajun rock band Coteau and the original lineup of Beausoleil. A turning point in Doucet's evolution as a guitarist came when he heard the playing of the late Clarence White on an album, The Kentucky Colonels 1965-1967, in 1980. Inspired by White's use of unusual chords and imaginative melodies, Doucet began to develop his own unique style.\n\nAlthough Doucet did not play on Beausoleil's first recording session in Paris, he joined the group before the recording of their debut album, The Spirit of Cajun Music, in 1976.\n\nGrand Texas Doucet moved to New Orleans, where he continues to reside, in 1980 to work at the World's Fair. In addition to his solo album and recordings with Beausoleil, Doucet was featured on albums by Chuck Guillory (Grand Texas), Octa Clark & Hector Duhon (Ensemble Encore) and Michael Doucet (Dit BeauSoleil).\nDoucet was accompanied on Quand J'ai Parti by members of Beausoleil (Michael Doucet, Jimmy Breaux, Tommy Comeaux, Billy Ware and Tommy Alesi) and influential dobro player Josh Graves, whom he met during a \"Legends of Folk Violin\" tour.\n\n\nMore to come", "otherInfo": "A weekly show of tunes I play now and used to play long ago.

R. Castillo. While a lot of artists can say the same, the influence of music on Castillo\u2019s life began years before he was born. When Castillo\u2019s father was a boy, he idolized his brother who was nine years older and in the Navy. Castillo\u2019s uncle would come home on leave from the Navy and play guitar on the front porch, and Castillo\u2019s father aspired to play just like his older brother. Tragically, his uncle lost his life serving in the Navy and his father\u2014now the oldest son and responsible for his family\u2014never learned to play like he wanted. \u201cAs he got older [my father] said, \u2018If I ever have a son, I want to put a guitar in his hands and make sure he learns to play,\u2019\u201d Castillo says, and to honor the brother he lost, Castillo\u2019s father put a guitar into his son\u2019s hands at a very early age. His mother also loved music. She encouraged him to sing and find harmonies as she introduced him to all kinds of music, and both his father and mother\u2014a \u201ccloset poet\u201d and \u201cgrammar queen,\u201d respectively\u2014encouraged their son to write. It was no surprise then when their son was fronting bands and performing his own music by the time he was 13. With the bands he was in during middle and high school, Castillo would work his own original music into sets of well-known covers at parties and festivals, and the reaction was always very positive. \u201cIt always seemed that every time I\u2019d announce, \u2018Here\u2019s a song that I wrote,\u2019 it immediately drew people in, which caught my attention,\u201d Castillo recalls. \u201cI saw that people all the sudden weren\u2019t just out there dancing and having a good time, their attention was on the song that I\u2019d written. The reaction of those first few folks\u2014they don\u2019t realize it, the influence they had\u2014as they were out there listening and giving me those words of encouragement after they heard the songs, it really encouraged me to continue with the song writing. It really set me on the path that I\u2019m on today.\u201d Despite his early success, he didn\u2019t immediately run off to Nashville to pursue a record deal; his family assumed that first he would get a college education, though they encouraged him to continue with his music while doing so. However, avoiding the temptation to quit college wasn\u2019t easy when record labels started showing interest during his sophomore year. \u201cIt kind of scared my folks a little bit, because they thought that I was just going to stop everything and pack my bags and move to Nashville. It just seemed like the right thing at that point in time.\u201d It was the advice of friend Casey Monahan at the Texas Music Office that persuaded him he could do both, a decision he\u2019s happy with in retrospect: \u201cI often look back at that moment and I know that it didn\u2019t have a huge an impact. If I had moved over there, it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. I was still able to do everything they wanted us to do, but at the same time we were still able to take care of things at home and I was able to continue my education.\u201d Over the last 15 years\u2014through his formative years, his time at the University of Texas, and up to the present day\u2014Castillo has written over a thousand songs for himself and other artists, 25 percent of which are in Spanish. His songwriting strays from that of many other artists, as his music is often more specific and personal than other artists\u2019 music. \u201cA lot of the stuff is based on life experiences and stuff that I\u2019ve gone through, personal stories,\u201d Castillo says of his songwriting. \u201cI try to take actual stories and actual experiences and lay them out in that three and a half minute length of a song.\u201d For Castillo, the joy of songwriting isn\u2019t in mass appeal, but connecting on a deeper, more-personal level with his listeners. \u201cI want to write about real things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about writing the basic love songs where everybody can relate. I want to write about stuff that people out there listening can actually hold on to and say, \u201cThat\u2019s my song. That guy wrote that song about my life and what I\u2019m going through.\u201d His latest single, \u201cThe Flip Side of Sober,\u201d was released on July 4, and is apart of a full CD release entitled The Hombre that Castillo expects to be released in late September. Other songs on the 16-track album include the classic Leo Sayer hit, \u201cMore Than I Can Say\u201d (one of his mother\u2019s favorites), and unofficial Texas High School football anthem, \u201cAny Given Friday.\u201d \u201cSome of my fellow artists and writers are like, \u2018Man you\u2019re nuts. You\u2019re the only one who would serve up that many songs in one project,\u2019\u201d Castillo remarks. \u201cBut hey, it\u2019s music. I\u2019m cranking it out.

The younger brother of Cajun fiddler Michael Doucet, Doucet has used his distinctive hybrid of folk-style fingerpicking and bluegrass-like flatpicking to strengthen the performances of Beausoleil, the band he's shared with his brother for over 21 years. With the release of his debut solo album, Quand J'ai Parti in 1991, Doucet successfully stepped into the spotlight.\nDoucet first played the guitar after recuperating from a broken arm sustained while practicing with his high school football team. Although he initially taught himself to play by using Bob Dylan and Paul Simon songbooks, Doucet became fascinated with flatpicking after listening to an album by Doc Watson.\n\nTogether with his brother and banjo player Raoul Breaux, Doucet played Cajun music in Louisiana clubs in 1975. When the project proved commercially unsuccessful, the band broke up with Doucet enrolling in college and his brother going on to form the Cajun rock band Coteau and the original lineup of Beausoleil. A turning point in Doucet's evolution as a guitarist came when he heard the playing of the late Clarence White on an album, The Kentucky Colonels 1965-1967, in 1980. Inspired by White's use of unusual chords and imaginative melodies, Doucet began to develop his own unique style.\n\nAlthough Doucet did not play on Beausoleil's first recording session in Paris, he joined the group before the recording of their debut album, The Spirit of Cajun Music, in 1976.\n\nGrand Texas Doucet moved to New Orleans, where he continues to reside, in 1980 to work at the World's Fair. In addition to his solo album and recordings with Beausoleil, Doucet was featured on albums by Chuck Guillory (Grand Texas), Octa Clark & Hector Duhon (Ensemble Encore) and Michael Doucet (Dit BeauSoleil).\nDoucet was accompanied on Quand J'ai Parti by members of Beausoleil (Michael Doucet, Jimmy Breaux, Tommy Comeaux, Billy Ware and Tommy Alesi) and influential dobro player Josh Graves, whom he met during a \"Legends of Folk Violin\" tour.\n\n\nMore to come", "otherInfo": "A weekly show of tunes I play now and used to play long ago.

And that makes Rodg one of the rare-breed. The humble Dutchman is one of the best kept Armada Music secrets, delivering top-notch releases on a regular basis.\n\nAn impressive string of features on various Armada compilations proved to be the stepping stone for Rodg, renowned for a sound that sticks out. Since, he has put out a slew of genre-defying cuts, changing the game entirely through massive collaborations and solid remixes for artists such as Paul Oakenfold, Armin van Buuren, Solid Stone, Cosmic Gate and Ruben de Ronde.\n\nThanks to extensive support from a gamut of top-tier performers (e.g. Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Above & Beyond, Markus Schulz, Gareth Emery, Nicky Romero, W&W, Andrew Rayel and even Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and David Guetta), Rodg has been getting the recognition he deserves, even touted \u201cOne of the best producers of 2016\u201d by Armin van Buuren. Seeing his in-studio diligence pay off, Rodg released his debut album in mid-2016 and grabbed early support from Armin van Buuren, Gareth Emery and Above & Beyond, all the while riding the US airwaves with title track \u2018High On Life\u2019, which accumulated over two million streams on Spotify to date.\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t stop there. After countless collaborations with long-time friend and production partner Ruben de Ronde, on came a collaborative effort that dropped jaws and pushed their sound to an even higher level. With their joint album called \u2018Togetherr\u2019, Rodg and Ruben de Ronde emerged with a body of work that serves as a testament to their consistent high-quality output and became Mixmag\u2019s \u201calbum of the month\u201d with a 9 out of 10 rating.\n\nOn the live front, the Rodg sound has become inseparable from Armin van Buuren\u2019s live sets and the Dutchman himself has since brandished his own sonic blend at A State Of Trance shows in Utrecht, Ibiza, and Mexico, Armada Nights, and various other unforgettable shows at H\u00ef Ibiza, Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival and more.

It's a sound rooted in big melodies, blasts of brass, percussive punch, and old-school grooves, with songs that shine a light not only on frontwoman Alanna Quinn-Broadus' larger-than-life voice, but her songwriting chops, too.\n\nThe band formed in Nashville, where Alanna and guitarist Jared Colby relocated after cutting their teeth as working-class musicians in Boston. Once in Tennessee, they teamed up with drummer Matt Snow, and bassist Gabriel Golden, forming a core lineup that often swells to as many as ten members -- including backup vocalists and a two-piece horn section -- in concert. Together, the band looked beyond Nashville's country-filled past and, instead, took inspiration from Motown's soul, Stax's funky strut, and rock & roll's rebellion. Tattooed, brash, and unapologetically unique, they stood out in a town dominated by Americana music, charting a unique course whose highlights have since included an appearance at Bonnaroo, a string of cross-country shows supporting acts like Lee Fields and St. Paul and the Broken Bones, and an audience that celebrates the band's diversity.\n\nOn their fourth release, 2018's So Bad You Can Taste It, Alanna matches the brassy spirit of the band's previous records \u2014 including their full-length debut, Achilles \u2014 with rare vulnerability. There's still plenty of soulful stomp here, from the upbeat sweep of the record's lead single, \"I Know,\" to the funky fire of \"Giving It All Away.\" There's also a more mature, sober look at the demands thrust upon independent artists \u2014 or anyone's who's willing to chase down an uncertain horizon, no matter how rough the journey may be. With songs that examine the midpoint between desperation and drive, So Bad You Can Taste It is the band's most genuine work to date.\n\n\"There are mountains and valleys to any journey, and this record is about being in the valley,\" explains Alanna Quinn-Broadus. \"It's about the low moments. It's basically the opposite of someone's Instagram feed, because it's not a highlights reel. It's just real.\"\n\nLow moments notwithstanding, So Bad You Can Taste It marks a creative high for Alanna Royale, whose members recorded the record's six songs with producer Kelly Finnigan and engineer Mindy Watts across multiple studios. Joining them were guests like trombonist Nadav Nirenberg -- known for his work alongside artists like Wyclef Jean, Breakdown Brass, and Wu Tang -- as well as Kirk Donovan, Meggan Utech, and Alexis Saski. Working with this expanded crew, Alanna Royale carved out a song-based sound that targeted not only their audience's dancing shoes, but their heads and hearts, too. Songs like the powerful, poignant ballad \"I Used to Dream\" were reworked multiple times, resulting in a record that's nuanced, heartfelt, and unafraid to show off its own scars.\n\n\"The title, So Bad You Can Taste It, says it all,\" Alanna explains. \"This record is all about the idea of something that's in front of you, and you can see it and feel it, but it's just out of reach. That thing can be your sanity or your sobriety or your success. I sometimes think it's harder to see the light at the end of the tunnel, rather than not seeing any light at all. Once you know the possibility of light is there, you have no option but to go after it. That can be really hard and really dangerous\u2026which makes it really worthwhile to sing about.\"", "otherInfo": "Homestyle Music is a weekly remote online show, which is open to artists from around the world.

Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cielo Pordomingo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10382907.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Electro Pop, Alternative, Synth Pop, Trip-hop, Electronica, Folk Rock, Orchestral, Alternative Folk, Synth-pop, Folktronica", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Composer, Singer, Songwriter & Arranger. #EmmyWinner\n\nHer music reflects her soul, merging electronic rhythms with orchestral elements.\n\nIn 2013 Cielo presented D FRET, her debut solo album, where she composed music, lyrics, vocals and arrangements; and received enthusiastic reviews in Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nIn 2016 Cielo she presented her second album FUGALINE, with a tour in Argentina & Mexico.

Godog was founded by Warner Brothers Records Alumni to create an all encompassing music company that supports it's artists with radio promotion and publicity. \"Not Ready to Say I'm Sorry Yet\" is the first release from the joint venture.\n\nMark grew up listening to great songwriters. With Prince, Billy Joel, Little Texas and Garth Brooks as early inspirations, he quickly learned how to write passionate songs. As an only child, he was forced to play all the instruments himself writing and recording over 200 songs before finishing High School.\n\nWhen asked to contribute a song for the local Homeless Awareness Project in his hometown of Toledo, OH, he wrote the song, \"Where's Santa Now?\" That song instantly got airplay so he volunteered to promote the charity in a multi-city holiday acoustic tour.\n\nThe story took a big jump when Radio Promotion legend, Bill Scull heard his song, \"Little Breakdown\" at an ASCAP demo review session. Scull, who has worked in the industry for years with Clive Davis, singled him out, signed Mark to his EO label, and sent him out to record his label\u2019s first CD.\n\nScull said, \u201cThe thing I learned from Clive is that the song is king\u2026and Lorenzo has those songs.\u201d\n\nHis talent also caught the attention of publisher Jan Seedman (who discovered Nickelback for Road Runner Records), \u201cMark knows how to come up with a melody... the songs just don\u2019t get tired - ever.\u201d\n\nThe new CD is really a great collection of Mark\u2019s favorite songs plus an unreleased Little Texas track.

The Prohibition Mob Band released its third CD, \"My Heart Belongs To Satchmo\" on Blujazz in 2018. This record is devoted to the early music of Louis Armstrong, continuing the band's tradition of resurrecting both well-known and obscure vintage music. Previously, the group released \"A Little Sugar\" (2012) and \"Bathtub Gin\" (2015) on Motema. \"A Little Sugar\" spent 9 weeks on the Jazz radio charts, and \"Bathtub Gin\" was named one of the Best Albums of 2015 by DownBeat Magazine.\n\nAward-winning singer and composer Roberta Donnay has been performing and recording for more than two decades.

All the while, the well-groomed, jazz-inclined Prohibition Mob Band motors along spiritedly.\n-DownBeat\n\nDonnay takes old school jazz, makes it new cool and most of all makes it fun.

One listen to his smoky, soulful croon and the breezy way his songs half-step and skip smoothly along the stage, and his hometown Chicago roots are obvious. It was there that Splithoff cut his teeth as a songwriter and performer, and he carried that warm, compositional adventurousness with him to his next and current stop in New York City. The urban soul of the Big Apple taught him to treat the swarms of people buzzing around him as an audience ripe for his evolving pop sound. As Splithoff has grown and moved across various gritty concrete landscapes, so too has his music, which deftly incorporates myriad elements from his surroundings and packages them into one unmistakable pop-soul-dance-urban experience. Splithoff\u2019s style is far from the kitchen-sink mentality permeating much of today\u2019s airwaves: one of his strongest skills may be his ability to draw from his deep bag of tricks\u2014piano, guitar, melody, rhythm\u2014 with precision and harnessed emotion.

On Thirties, acclaimed singer-songwriter, Jill Andrews gives these unsung moments the voice they have always deserved.\n\nFrom her days fronting lauded Americana group, the everbodyfields, to her successful solo career as a writer and performer, Andrews\u2019 music has taken her far from her East Tennessee home. She has collaborated and shared the stage with countless celebrated artists including the Avett Brothers, Langhorne Slim, Drew Holcomb & The Neighbors and the Secret Sisters, and her music has been featured on Grey\u2019s Anatomy, The Good Wife, Nashville, Wynonna Earp and American Idol. Featuring emotional melodies, intimate storytelling and vocals that soar even at a whisper, Thirties is a deviation, it resists contemplating the big, loud questions of the world, and rather, invites listeners to look inward, keeping us closer to home than ever before.\n\nTenderly, hauntingly and without fear, Thirties chronicles Andrews\u2019 journey through a decade rife with both beauty and brutality.

With Jazz as the anchoring foundation, P\u00e9rez\u2019s Global Jazz music is a blend of Panamanian roots, Latin American folk music, West African rhythms, European impressionism \u2013 promoting music as a borderless and multidimensional bridge between all people.\n\nBorn in Panama in 1965, P\u00e9rez started his musical studies when he was three years old with his father, a bandleader and singer. By age 10, he was studying the European classical piano repertoire at the National Conservatory in Panama. After receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics in Panama, he studied jazz composition at the prestigious Berklee College of Music. While still a student, he performed with Jon Hendricks, Terence Blanchard, Slide Hampton, Claudio Roditi and Paquito D\u2019Rivera. Quickly established as a young master, he soon toured and/or recorded with artists such as Dizzy Gillespie United Nations Orchestra from 1989-1992, Jack DeJohnette, Steve Lacy, Lee Konitz, Charlie Haden, Michael Brecker, Joe Lovano, Tito Puente, Wynton Marsalis, Tom Harrell, Gary Burton, and Roy Haynes.\n\nIn 1993, P\u00e9rez turned his focus to his own ensembles and recording projects, releasing several albums as a leader, earning Grammy\u00ae and Latin Grammy\u00ae nominations for Central Avenue (1998), Motherland (2000), Across The Crystal Sea (2008), and Providencia (2010). In 1996, he was signed by producer Tommy Lipuma to join the Impulse label and recorded Panamonk, a tribute to Thelonious Monk which according to DownBeat magazine is one of the most important piano albums in the history of jazz. P\u00e9rez\u2019s album Central Avenue, featured mejoranera music (a style of Panamanian folklore singing) and was chosen as one of the 10 best recordings across genres by TIME Magazine in 1998. A collaboration between P\u00e9rez and the prolific composer and arranger Claus Ogerman, 2008\u2019s Across The Crystal Sea was praised by The Guardian as, \u201cSo ultra-smooth it achieves something like a state of grace.\u201d Ogerman said, \u201cThis is a record I wanted to make before I leave the planet.\u201d P\u00e9rez made his Mack Avenue Records debut in 2010 with the release of Providencia. The album was nominated for a 2011 Grammy\u00ae Award in the category of Best Instrumental Jazz Album.\n\nP\u00e9rez joined the Wayne Shorter Quartet in 2010 with John Patitucci and Brian Blade. This latest iteration from Shorter has been known as a unique and predominant force in improvisational music both at their historic live performances and on several recordings. In 2018 Blue Note records released the highly anticipated EMANON from the Wayne Shorter Quartet which won a Grammy\u00ae in the category of Best Jazz Instrumental album in 2019.\n\nFor several years P\u00e9rez has also been touring with his trio \u2013 featuring Ben Street and Adam Cruz \u2013 and with Children of the Light, a collaboration with fellow Wayne Shorter Quartet members John Patitucci and Brian Blade. Mack Avenue released the Children of the Light album in 2015 to great critical acclaim. P\u00e9rez\u2019s current touring project, the Global Messengers, spreads the idea that music can serve as a natural remedy to unfortunate situations, providing an uplifting message, connection, and common ground. The ensemble features musicians from diverse cultural backgrounds, coming together to build community through music.\n\nAs a composer, P\u00e9rez has been commissioned by The Lincoln Center, Chicago Jazz Festival, and Imani Winds Quintet, among others. His octet for members of the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela was commissioned by Carnegie Hall. In 2014, the Banff Centre commissioned P\u00e9rez to write a piano quintet for the Cecilia String Quartet titled \"Camino de Cruces\" and he also composed the music for the Museum of Biodiversity in Panama, designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry. In 2015, P\u00e9rez premiered another two new compositions: \u201cExpeditions \u2013 Panamania 2015\u201d was premiered at the Panamerican games in Toronto and his \u201cDetroit World Suite \u2013 La Leyenda de Bayano\u201d was premiered at the Detroit Jazz Festival. P\u00e9rez returns to the Detroit Jazz Festival in Fall 2019 for the world premiere of a new piece written for his Global Messengers ensemble and co-commissioned by the Detroit Jazz Festival, London Jazz Festival, National Forum of Music Wroclaw, and Koerner Hall at Royal Academy of Music Toronto.\n\nP\u00e9rez, who served as Goodwill Ambassador to UNICEF, has received a variety of awards for his musical achievements, activism and social work efforts. He is a recipient of the United States Fellowship 2018, and the 2009 Smithsonian Legacy Award.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B.

Dedicating their 1996 debut 'Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi' to bossa nova pioneer Antonio Carlos Jobim, the Washington, D.C.-based duo have spent nearly two decades creating boundary-warping, complexly crafted electronic music partly inspired by bossa nova\u2019s intricate rhythms and lush textures. Now, with their seventh studio album 'Saudade,' Thievery Corporation present their first release devoted entirely to the Brazilian-born genre that first connected them. \u201cWe always try to progress into something different and stretch our musical chops, and taking a whole album to dive into this one sound seemed like a really great way to do that,\u201d says Hilton. Adds Garza: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a departure for us, but at the same time these are our roots, this is what brought us together. It\u2019s us coming full circle from electronic music back to something organic before we move on to our next chapter.\u201d\n\nReleased on their own label ESL Music, 'Saudade' borrows its title from a Portuguese word meaning \u201ca longing for something or someone that is lost, a contented melancholy, or, simply, the presence of absence.\u201d \u201cSaudade is the essence or feeling of true bossa nova,\u201d explains Hilton, who names \u201cthose warm, soulful, melancholic vocals\u201d as one of the elements of bossa nova that\u2019s most alluring to him. Drawing influence from classic Brazilian performers like Antonio Carlos Jobim, Gal Costa, and Luis Bonf\u00e1\u2014along with Serge Gainsbourg, Ennio Morricone, and more modern artists like electro-samba pioneer Isabelle Antena\u2014Saudade achieves its delicate yet deeply sensuous sound with the help of more than a dozen guest musicians. With each track sung by one of five female vocalists (including longtime Thievery cohort LouLou Ghelichkhani, newcomer Elin Melgarejo, Nouvelle Vague singer Karina Zeviani, Argentine chanteuse Natalia Clavier, and former Bitter:Sweet singer/songwriter Shana Halligan), the endlessly mesmerizing album also features such guests as U.N.K.L.E. drummer Michael Lowery, Argentine singer/songwriter Federico Aubele, and master Brazilian percussionist Roberto Santos.\n\nAlthough Thievery Corporation stay true to traditional bossa nova\u2019s elegant fusion of samba and jazz all throughout 'Saudade,' the album is rich with strange and wonderful flourishes that revel in the duo\u2019s hyper-inventive tendencies. Opening with the dusky \u201cD\u00e9collage,\u201d 'Saudade' glides from the smoldering and string-drenched \u201cQuem Me Leva\u201d to the hushed and mysterious \u201cSola In Citta\u201d (an Italian-sung nod to the legendary sound tracks of Ennio Morricone, featuring Wurlitzer electric piano by Enea Diotaiuti) to the sweetly ethereal \u201cNo More Disguise\u201d (a dream-like piece laced with orchestral strings and bolero rhythms). With the instrumental title track serving as its gently stunning centerpiece, 'Saudade' also offers the sultry and spacey\u201cClaridad\u201d (a swaying Latin number propelled by analog organ beats) and the French lullaby of \u201cLe Coeur\u201d (featuring the sublime saxophone work of Frank Mitchell, Jr.). And on the final track \u201cDepth of My Soul,\u201d Halligan delivers a haunting vocal performance that merges with the song\u2019s swirling symphonic soundscape to hypnotic effect.\n\nOver the years, Thievery Corporation have given nods to their bossa-nova influence on individual album tracks, slipping those quietly enchanting songs into recordings that reveal the duo\u2019s careful studying of everything from Jamaican dub reggae to punk to vintage film soundtracks to psychedelic space rock. After coming up with sketches for several bossa-nova-style numbers while recording their last studio album (2011\u2019s Culture of Fear), Garza and Hilton considered releasing an EP showcasing a handful of Brazilian-inspired songs. \u201cThe more we worked on those songs, the more we got into the vibe of that vintage, organic sound,\u201d recalls Hilton. \u201cMaking an album fully dedicated to that sound felt like a good idea, especially at a time when the electronic dance music world is so saturated and there\u2019s not much of a focus on musicianship.\u201d Rather than feeling hemmed in by the unfamiliar approach of creating music solely in one style, Thievery Corporation found a great deal of freedom in writing and recording the songs that make up 'Saudade.' \u201cIn a way it was really liberating to do something out of our wheelhouse, to put ourselves in a totally different mindset and immerse ourselves in this one particular genre,\u201d notes Garza.\n\nIntense musical exploration has always been essential to Thievery Corporation, a project hatched in 1995 when Hilton and Garza were introduced by a mutual friend at Washington, D.C.\u2019s Eighteenth Street Lounge\u2014a popular gathering spot for musicians that\u2019s co-owned by Hilton. Soon after making their 1996 debut with two underground hit vinyl singles(\u201cShaolin Satellite\u201d and \u201c2001 Spliff Odyssey\u201d) and 'Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi,' the duo became loosely associated with the trip-hop scene that had newly emerged in the UK. In 2000, they released 'Mirror Conspiracy,' which introduced live vocalists (including Bebel Gilberto and the late Pam Bricker) into the project\u2019s mix. Following 2002\u2019s 'The Richest Man in Babylon' and 2005\u2019s 'The Cosmic Game' (featured politically minded collaborations with Perry Farrell, Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne, and David Byrne), Thievery Corporation put out 2006\u2019s 'Versions' (a compilation of their remixes of songs by such artists as Sarah McLachlan, Astrud Gilberto, Anoushka Shankar, and The Doors). By then, Garza and Hilton were itching to evolve past their reputation as ambassadors of the downtempo scene, and began to conjure up more subversive recordings that reflected their passion for social activism, as heard on both 2008\u2019s 'Radio Retaliation' and 'Culture of Fear.'\n\nNow on 'Saudade,' Thievery Corporation are once again changing direction, trading the fiery energy of their last two albums for a wistful mood and summery spirit\u2014a shift that both members found highly refreshing. \u201cEven though we\u2019re very socially conscious, it\u2019s nice to take a break from the political theme and just concentrate creating some beautiful songs in the same vein as all these old records that we love,\u201d says Garza. And as one ofthe most influential and respected names on the electronic/dance music scene, Thievery Corporation also discovered their own breed of rebellion and innovation in committing themselves to a time-worn genre on 'Saudade.'\u201cWe\u2019re still chopping up beats, but this time we\u2019re making them sound warm and vintage\u2014which is not at all what\u2019s happening in electronic music right,\u201d says Hilton. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is pretty traditional and timeless-sounding, and in that it\u2019s completely contrarian.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join our global community for a special event class led by Janet Stone, with live music by Rob Garza of the legendary electronic duo Thievery Corporation.

He's showing. Appropriately titled, the song \"Country\" is as much positioning statement as introduction. In three minutes and 16 seconds, it is almost precisely who he is in word and deed. The vocal delivery, storytelling, musicianship and reflections of his outdoor lifestyle \u2013 as well as faith, family and patriotism \u2013 offer a spot-on portrayal. Joined by early fan favorites \"Clean Up On Aisle Five\" and \"Come Do A Little Life,\" the song carves an unmistakably country yet completely fresh groove for the genre. In short, it sounds like nothing else, but absolutely belongs.\n\nTo paraphrase the song, a life in music isn't a place on a map; it's a place in Mo Pitney's heart. \"I just love music,\" Pitney says, exhibiting atypical maturity for someone still in their early twenties. \"It has never been about praise. Playing the Grand Ole Opry was an amazing experience, but I have just as much fun sitting on my bed playing along to an old record. It's always been that way.\"\n\nThat music-centered outlook is already generating the unsought acclaim of which he speaks. Perhaps the best example is the aforementioned Opry performance. \"Everybody asked me if I was nervous, but I don\u2019t think I was,\" he says. \"I definitely thought about it a lot more than I normally do. My respect for that stage and the circle is great.\n\nFor his first song, he selected \"Clean Up On Aisle Five\" and eyed one goal: to sing his heart out. \"I didn't feel like anybody was sucked into the song at all, but when it was over I stepped back from the microphone and people erupted,\" he says. A standing ovation approaching a full minute ensued. \"After about 30 seconds, I stepped forward to say something because I thought I heard them dying down, but they just got louder. I lost it. It took me about a week to come off that feeling.\"\n\nThat pivotal moment capped a journey that started in the red brick town of Cherry Valley, IL, where Mo grew up loving the outdoors. \"Right out my back door was a lake about a mile away,\" he says. \"I'd ride my bike there with a fishing pole on each handlebar, like two tridents sticking out in front of me.\"\n\nMusic was a family affair, and Pitney picked up the drums at six and guitar at 12. \"I learned how to play with a cast on my arm by laying a rag over my dad's guitar so it wouldn't get scratched,\" he says. \"Johnny Cash At San Quentin was my introduction to playing music. I learned the whole album.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, he played two Cash songs at an open mic night \u2013 his first public performance. \"After I played, I saw a guy backstage playing a banjo, so I picked that up for a couple of years. By age 15, I grabbed the guitar again playing lead acoustic, my brother played bass and we had a friend who played mandolin.\" His affection for bluegrass led him to Keith Whitley. \"When I heard him sing it helped me bridge over into country music. I started hearing great country songs, songwriters and singers ... and I just fell in love.\"\n\nEncouraged to move to Nashville by a songwriting friend, Pitney was the uncommon arrival who receives early interest from record labels. He signed with Curb and began working on bringing his songs and sound into alignment with his musical vision. One of the lynchpins was connecting with his producer, Tony Brown (George Strait).\n\n\"Instead of trying to put some songs together to come out of my mouth and create an artist with my face, Tony said, 'I want to find out who you are, pull it out of you and put it on tape.' It wasn\u2019t just the way he said it, it was in everything he did. Realizing I can create a record the way I want to and use the musicians I want was an eye-opening experience. We recorded my vocals while I was sitting on a stool and playing guitar at the same time, so it\u2019s a live record in a lot of ways. My hands were untied.\"\n\nAs music lovers become exposed to his music, rousing receptions may be something he'll become accustomed to seeing. But they won't change Mo's core motivation. \"Even if this thing doesn\u2019t go huge, I believe that I can make a decent living playing music,\" he says. \"And I always knew that I could do that. When I was younger, my plan was bluegrass. I used to buy and sell cars, I did body work and I trained bird dogs. I figured I would just kind of piddle around, doing different things around the music.\n\n\"People who have done this for a long time think there's a place for my music, and I hope that's the case. My eyes are set on being successful, but success is not number one for me. If I can make a comfortable living and have a career making music and keep my head on straight, that\u2019s my goal. And I think that I have a great opportunity to do that if I don\u2019t get ahead of myself.\"\n\nAnd that kind of seasoned perspective isn't often heard from someone of his generation. \"I\u2019m a God-fearing man,\" he says. \"I love simple things. I love simplicity in songs because I love simplicity in life. But I\u2019m also very deep, which is weird. I\u2019m a thinker. And I go so deep, a lot of times I just confuse myself and get frustrated, but when I come home and my dog runs and jumps up on my lap, that does something to my spirit. I love to hunt and fish. I love the outdoors. I love my family. I try to live pretty morally square. Pretty clean guy. I\u2019ve got my problems, but I try to stay pretty straight.\"\n\nPerhaps the best expression of how Mo Pitney has created his own definition of country music success is found in \"Behind This Guitar,\" a song by Don Sampson and Phil O'Donnell that may not even make the album. \"People tell me I can\u2019t cut it because the chorus says, 'Behind this guitar there\u2019s just a boy who had a dream in his heart, behind this guitar there\u2019s just a guy that can\u2019t believe he got this far.' And they point out that I haven't gotten anywhere yet, so save it for the second album. But I remember sitting on my bed with the dream of just making music the rest of my life. It wasn\u2019t that I had to be on radio or even make a living doing it. I just loved music. Now I\u2019m on the Opry. I have a record deal. And I\u2019m loving the music that I\u2019m making. I can't believe I got this far!\n\n\"I\u2019m probably just going to cut the song.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Patitucci ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10388064.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born in 1959 in Brooklyn, New York, John Patitucci began playing the electric bass at age ten. John began composing and performing at age 12. At age 15, he began to play the acoustic bass and at age 16 began the piano. He quickly moved from playing soul and rock to blues, jazz and classical music. His eclectic tastes caused him to explore all types of music as a player and a composer. John studied classical bass at San Francisco State University and Long Beach State University. In 1980, he continued his career in Los Angeles as a studio musician and a jazz artist. MVP As a studio musician, John has played on countless albums with artists such as B.B. King, Bonnie Raitt, Chick Corea, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Michael Brecker, George Benson, Dizzy Gillespie, Was Not Was, Dave Grusin, Natalie Cole, Bon Jovi, Queen Latifah, Sting, and Carly Simon. In 1986, John was voted by his peers in the studios as the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences MVP (Most Valuable Player) on acoustic bass. As a performer, he has played throughout the world with his own band, and with jazz luminaries Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Stan Getz, Wynton Marsalis, Joshua Redman, Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Freddie Hubbard, Tony Williams, Hubert Laws, Mulgrew Miller, James Williams, and scores of others. Some of the many pop and Brazilian artists he has played with include Sting, Aaron Neville, Natalie Cole, Carole King, Milton Nascimiento, Astrud and Joao Gilberto, Airto and Flora Purim, Ivan Lins, Joao Bosco and Dori Caymmi. John has worked with film composers Jerry Goldsmith, Ry Cooder, James Newton Howard, Dave Grusin, Henry Mancini, John Williams, Mark Isham, Michel Columbier, Carter Burwell, and Howard Shore.

His many recordings with Chick Corea's Elektric Band and Akoustic Band, his six solo recordings for GRP Records and his subsequent recordings have brought him two Grammy Awards (one for playing and one for composing) and over fifteen Grammy nominations. In addition, his first solo recording, JOHN PATITUCCI, went to number one on the Billboard Jazz charts. He arranged and produced his own records as well as those of other artists. In1996, he signed with Concord Jazz and has released five records on their label: One More Angel, Now, Imprint, Communion and Songs, Stories and Spirituals. The two most recent recordings were nominated for Grammy Awards in the composition category. John has won many magazine polls for his electric and acoustic bass playing, including Best Jazz Bassist in Guitar Player Magazine's 1992, 1994 and 1995 Readers' Poll and Best Jazz Bassist in Bass Player Magazine's 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996 Readers' Poll. He has taught many seminars on playing and composing at prestigious music schools worldwide and was formerly the Artistic Director of the Bass Collective, a comprehensive school for bassists in New York City. John is also regularly involved with The Thelonius Monk Institute of Jazz and has taught at the Betty Carter Jazz Ahead program in Washington, D. C. in 2000. INTO XXI CENTURY In 2002, John began teaching at The City College of New York upon the retirement of Ron Carter from his teaching duties there. In 2003, John was appointed Associate Professor of Jazz Studies at City College. After exploring many different writing styles on his own records and those of Chick Corea's, John continues to compose for many mediums. In 1994 he was commissioned to write a piece for six-string electric bass and string orchestra for the Italian chamber orchestra Suono e Oltre in Pescara, Italy. With John as soloist, the piece was performed in March of 1995 in Italy and in August of 1995 with the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in Tokyo. John was also commissioned to write a piece for the Turtle Island String Quartet, a group fluent in both classical and jazz music. Since moving back to the New York area in 1996, John has continued to work with his own group, as well as many others. He has toured the world with his group, The John Patitucci Quartet. He was the featured Jazz Bassist at the 1999 International Society of Bassists convention. In 1998, John was a part of the Roy Haynes Trio, along with Danilo Perez on piano. This trio recorded a critically acclaimed album for Verve Records and has toured throughout the world. In the Fall of 2001, John toured the United States as member of an all-star quintet called Directions in Music led by Herbie Hancock and featuring Michael Brecker, Roy Hargrove and Brian Blade. Subsequently they released a live CD entitled Live at Massey Hall which became a Grammy Award winner. 2000-2004 In the year 2000, John had begun working again with the legendary Wayne Shorter, touring the world in a new quartet featuring Danilo Perez on piano and Brian Blade on drums.

Also in 2004, John recorded on Herbie Hancock's latest project (not yet released) and performed in concerts with The John Scofield Trio and Roy Haynes' Birds of a Feather group featuring Kenny Garrett and Nicholas Payton. 2005 In 2005, John has recorded and/or played with Jack DeJohnette, Danilo Perez, Kenny Barron, again with Hank Jones and Steve Khan. At this year's Chamber Music concert at Concordia College, John premiered a piece he wrote for his friend Larry Dutton for viola and piano entitled Gardens and Pools, which was a commission work inspired by the painting of artist Sedar Arat.

These would go on to deeply shape his tastes and style. Though Ben's family lived just outside of Nashville, much of his time growing up was spent on his grandparent's farm in the town in south Georgia of Cairo. Just as with hearing various styles of music, the experiences and lessons learned from this time influenced Ben's perspective on his music. From the time he was 4 years old, Ben constantly took part in youth church choirs, school talent shows and a few different bands as he discovered more and more about his own sound as an artist. By the time he was in high school, songwriting had become a major focus and goal for him alongside the performing that he had long been captivated with. After graduating from Centennial High School in Franklin, TN, Ben was accepted to Belmont University where he currently studies Music Business. During his first three years there, he has met a number of incredible people who have further influenced his direction as an artist and a writer and continually pushed him to be better.

She and Mutt Lange made big sounding albums\nwith memorable melodies, that stick in your head.\u201d\n\nLynae is doing the same with her two new latest cuts, \u201cWhole Lotta Nothin'\u201d and \u201cQuicksand.\u201d The\nformer is a clever, playful and catchy tune, which is the antidote to the unrelenting pace, which is the\nnorm in our society. Singer-songwriter Hannah Bethel hit Lynae and David Myhre (fellow co-writer) with a melody idea and the songsmiths were off and running.\n\n\u201cHannah came up with something that was so cool melodically,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cAnd then we started talking about how busy we are and how it\u2019s just non-stop. I said, \u2018wouldn\u2019t it be great to take a vacation\nand just hang out\u2019 and that set the mood of the song. What it comes down to is that if you can\u2019t take a vacation, then take a three-minute hiatus from your to-do list with this song.\u201d\n\nThe tune became a fan favorite and was included on Apple Music's \"Country A-List\" along with the likes of country superstars Miranda Lambert and Little Big Town.\n\nAnd then there is the gritty and powerful \u201cQuicksand,\u201d which is Lynae\u2019s latest single. The uber catchy tune was written by songwriter and Emerson Drive member Danick Dupelle, who came in and played a little groove on his guitar and Lynae said, \u2018that sounds like quicksand.\u2019 So along with songwriter Patricia Conroy, they played around with some 'oohs' for the melody, then focused on relationships that feel like you're stuck and sinking in quicksand.\n\n\"I think we all have stepped into 'quicksand' at one time or another when it comes to relationships, so we figured, why not try to save someone a little heartache,\" said Lynae.\n\nHowever, Lynae\u2019s career is in anything but quicksand. She is morphing at warped speed as a well-rounded force after recording her eponymous self-titled debut which dropped in April 2014. She has been touring across the country performing with some of country music's most celebrated artists including Keith Urban, The Band Perry, Maddie & Tae, Kelsea Ballerini and many more. She has also performed the National Anthem at several high profile Major League baseball games and ranked among the Top 25 artists spanning all music genres on Macy's iHeart Radio Rising Stars national campaign. Most recently, Lynae was included in CMT's Artist Discovery Campaign, which recognizes emerging artists they feel have promising futures ahead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m evolving,\u201d Lynae says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking bigger picture. For me I\u2019m not just concentrating on the songs. I\u2019m thinking about everything. I\u2019m involved with the production. I\u2019ve been co-producing with Jamie (O'Neal) and I\u2019m focusing on all things sonically. When I\u2019m writing I\u2019m thinking about everything from the background vocals to special effects to how the song will be arranged. I think about the solo parts on a track. I\u2019m learning how to be a well-rounded musician. What I want to make is ear candy without it sounding too busy kind of like how Shania and Mutt Lange did it.\u201d\n\nLynae can\u2019t help but hark back to when Shania ruled the pop and country chart. Lynae waxes about an era when love songs were in vogue, which is a stark contrast in this era, which toasts conspicuous consumption and frivolity.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re starting to miss the \u201890s and early 2000\u2019s,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cThat was when country music had so many stories that touched on deeper parts of life. However, the recent trend is party songs, which have their place. But there\u2019s something about love songs. That\u2019s what I love to write most. Love is something everyone can relate to. If you\u2019ve never been in love, you yearn for it. If you found love, it\u2019s the most amazing thing that has surpassed anything you\u2019ve ever experienced. Or you could have had love and been crushed beyond your wildest imagination. I think it\u2019s time for love songs to return and for ladies to be on top again.\u201d\n\nLynae will be blazing the way with her big black boots and empowering songs. Like her music, Lynae\u2019s fashion is a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll. \u201cThe way a performer dresses is another form of expression,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cI have that rocker thing going on but I still incorporate the country. I might wear my boots and then have some fringe to blend country and rock, like my sound.\u201d\n\nUnlike many 20-somethings, Lynae understands the art of live performance and delivers onstage like a grizzled veteran. Lynae engages the audience and is often at her best when living in the moment.\n\n\u201cThe more you prepare for a show, the more spontaneous you can be when you perform,\u201d the sage Lynae said. \u201cWhen you have it all down, you can step outside the box. During a recent show in Seattle a microphone literally fell apart. Instead of losing it up there, I just poked fun at the situation. Everyone laughed. I dealt with what happened and the audience left with a memorable concert moment.\u201d\n\nLynae, who has the composure of a Taylor Swift and the charm of the aforementioned Twain, naturally connects with her fans. \u201cI just love to talk with those who come out to see me,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me being me up there. I think if I\u2019m having fun, it gives the audience permission to have fun. The fun is infectious. For me, it\u2019s about getting real and personal. That way every show is different. I don\u2019t follow the same exact formula every time I get onstage. So, I just embrace the imperfections, love to joke around and do what I can to connect with everyone that comes through the door.\u201d\n\nThe fashionable Lynae is light years from the girl who grew up in Alaska. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a name brand was. I didn\u2019t get the concept of it. I was wearing sweat pants back then but Alaska definitely helped shape who I am. It\u2019s an incredibly creative, independent and wild state. Coming from there has had an impact on my music. I\u2019m all about taking chances and making the best music that I can. I\u2019m not the same person I was when I was growing up in Alaska or even when I made my first album. I\u2019m growing and evolving and so is my music.\u201d", "otherInfo": "I am beyond excited to invite you to my (Virtual) Album Release Party!!

HuDost\u2019s core musicians are Moksha Sommer and Jemal Wade Hines. Having toured the US, Canada, and Europe constantly since April 2006, HuDost has grown and expanded, travelled rocky and glorious terrain and marveled at all they can learn and explore. Moksha and Jemal Wade, in this time have grown as artists, as seekers, as a couple and as a family. In 2013 their amazing son was brought into the world. Since 2015 they have also been highly engaged activists, doing advocacy work as KY Congressional District Representatives for ONE (a non-profit organization working to end extreme poverty and, specifically, the sexism of poverty).\n\nHuDost is currently in the studio recording a new album with Vance Powell who is a top tier producer/mixer who\u2019s worked with artists such as Jack White (White Stripes), Chris Stapleton, Pearl Jam, Willie Nelson, Buddy Guy, Beyonce, Beck, Alicia Keys, Melissa Etheridge, Kings of Leon and a slew of others. And, to add to this excitement, Dan Haseltine from the Grammy winning band Jars of Clay has been on board to help with production! This album will be released in early 2019.\n\nHuDost functions as a duo (with the core musicians Moksha Sommer and Jemal Wade Hines) or as a band, including guest musicians of varying sensibilities and backgrounds, and often including dance in their shows. As a duo their instrumentation includes vocals, harmonium (Indian Pump-Organ), NORD Keys, guitars, Dulcinet, percussion, and a slew of sonic ambient effects. Their music is a rich, eclectic blending of Pop and Rock with traditional Sufi music, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian and Balkan folk music, Farsi, Turkish, Arabic, and Folk. Their sound crosses all borders and barriers, taking the listener on a journey they will never forget.\n\nHighlight Performances Include Bonnaroo, Resident band at FloydFest, BhaktiFest, World Caf\u00e9 Live, Blissfest, The ARK, Alex Grey\u2019s CoSM, the Salvador Dali Museum, Beloved Festival, headlining The Islands Folk Fest (Vancouver), The Levitt Pavilions, WoodSongs at the Kentucky Theater (on PBS), Nashville\u2019s Bluebird Caf\u00e9, Music City Roots, Tim Robbins\u2019 WTF?! Fest, The Montreal Folk Festival, Hillside Festival, The Stan Rogers Folk Festival, and many more\u2026\n\nHighlight Collaborations/ Opening for other artists Include Ani DiFranco, Philip Glass, Jon Anderson, Joan Osborne, Snatam Kaur, Steve Kilbey, Ramy Essam, California Guitar Trio, Bell Orchestre, Neko Case, Jim Lauderdale, Omar Faruk Tekbilek, Mercan Dede, and many more\u2026\n\nHuDost's music is a powerful expression of life's journey and discovery. In 2008, Moksha went through a painful process of brain surgery due to a tumor. The healing from this included re-learning language skills, losing and regaining proper sight, and experiencing seizures.

It is a pure country voice through and through. Blessed with a Johnny Cash baritone and the wit of Jerry Reed, Ray displays both over the 11 songs on his fourth album, the self-titled Ray Scott. A mix of roadhouse foot-stompers, stone-cold country ballads and the sing-speak songs for which he\u2019s become known, Ray Scott flashes with the energy and verve that defined Ray\u2019s earlier hits \u201cMy Kind of Music\u201d and \u201cThose Jeans.\u201d\nBut the album is also a reintroduction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reboot\u2014or a Ray-boot, if you will,\u201d quips Ray, who dubbed his last album Rayality. \u201cIt is an evolution, but I think people will hear it and know it\u2019s the same guy from \u2018My Kind of Music\u2019 and \u2018Those Jeans.\u2019 Lyrically, I tend to say things a certain way. You can always tell it\u2019s me.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s good reason for that, aside from that rumbling voice. Save for a few trusted cowriters here and there, like Mark Stephen Jones, Tony Mullins and Brandy Clark, Ray prefers to write solo. In this era of five-plus writers collaborating on a single song, Ray is a true lone wolf.\n\u201cCollaboration is fun and some of my favorite things have been written with other people, but at the same time, if you can write by yourself, you should,\u201d Ray says. \u201cThere was a time in Nashville when people wrote alone. Some of my favorite old writers, the people who got me interested in doing this in the first place\u2014Harlan Howard and Bob McDill\u2014wrote alone.\u201d\nThe results of such a writing style are pure, unfiltered songs, the undiluted vision of the artist.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always recorded my own material because it\u2019s almost impossible for me to sell a song that someone else wrote. I was more or less made to tell stories through my own window\u2014and the window\u2019s pretty smudged sometimes,\u201d Ray laughs. \u201cBut if I can entertain myself, I feel like other people might be entertained as well.\u201d\nThe tracks on Ray Scott are certainly entertaining. These are story songs that, instead of just repeating a catch phrase over and over, actually go somewhere. \u201cPapa n Mama,\u201d a loping blues number, is the tale of a son who stops his father\u2014 permanently\u2014from abusing his mother, landing himself in the pen. \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Gonna Be You\u201d is a defiant kiss-off to a cheating lover, promising she\u2019ll never break this guy\u2019s heart again. The cinematic \u201cLeave This World,\u201d however, is the polar opposite: a love song of devotion elevated by Ray\u2019s Male Vocalist of the Year-worthy performance, proof that Ray\u2019s bread and butter isn\u2019t just in the spoken word.\nStill, there is magic in those recitation numbers, especially in \u201cTijuana Buzzkill.\u201d A true tale of a disastrous, if humorous, south-of-the-border adventure that ended with Ray and his buddy in jail, the track exemplifies Ray\u2019s gift for wry storytelling.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just as much an art to recitation as there is singing. It\u2019s all in how you emote, your emphasis and how you tell a story,\u201d he says. And it helps if you have comic timing, which Ray does in spades. In songs like the hazy bonus track \u201cWhat Works for Willie\u201d and the take-one-for-the-team anthem \u201cThe Ugly One,\u201d he delivers the pay-off lines with the cadence of a comedian.\n\u201cThe songs end up being a little on the polarizing side,\u201d Ray admits. \u201cBut I love that. Everything I\u2019ve ever had any luck with was a song that made people turn their head and go, \u2018Well, that\u2019s different\u2019 or \u2018That pisses me off.\u2019\u201d\nProduced by Dave Brainard (Brandy Clark\u2019s 12 Stories, Jerrod Niemann\u2019s Free the Music), Ray Scott excels in the details\u2014the swampy harmonica of lead-off track \u201cCookin\u2019\u201d; the mariachi horns of \u201cTijuana Buzzkill\u201d; and the hypnotic rhythm of the white-trash nursery rhyme \u201cWheels on the House.\u201d In the end, no two songs sound alike, and Ray cements himself as a deft performer, able to toggle between those funny tunes and serious fare like the staggering \u201cI Miss the Days.\u201d\nA bittersweet ballad about being young, \u201cI Miss the Days\u201d is a slice of nostalgia, both in subject matter and production. Sonically, it recalls the 1970s and \u201980s sound of country music.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we were going for. If you listen to an old Waylon Jennings record or something from that time period, a lot of those songs had a \u2018Luckenbach\u2019 vibe to them,\u201d says Ray, who agrees that today\u2019s country music frequently borrows some of the bombast of late \u201980s hard rock. \u201cBut I\u2019m a little more Waylon and a little less Warrant.\u201d\nIn the end, Ray Scott furthers Ray\u2019s identity as a modern day outlaw, not in image, but in his approach to the music industry.\n\u201cAfter all these years in Nashville I\u2019ve never been willing to compromise my artistic vision as far as writing goes or the way things are recorded and produced. I don\u2019t chase trends, which is not necessarily your quickest road to riches by any means,\u201d he says.\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, I\u2019d like to walk outside my trailer, look up at the sun and say, \u2018I did it the way I wanted.\u2019\u201d Ray stops to laugh. \u201cWhen the cops come to serve the warrant, at least I\u2019ll have my integrity\u2014integrity and a beer.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Yall join us for another Man Cave Jam this Friday, May 22nd on the Official Ray Scott page at 7:30 cst!\n\nVirtual Tip Jars:\n\u2022Venmo: @ray-scott-music\n\u2022PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/rayscottmusic\n\u2022Official Site: http://www.rayscott.com/shop/10-virtual-tip-jar"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Spencer Ludwig ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9994334.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Indie Pop, Soulful Funky Pop, Indie Dance, Pop, Indie, Jazz, Alternative", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Since being the original trumpeter in the multi-platinum band Capital Cities (2012 \u2013 2015), the Los Angeles-born, half-Filipino vocalist-instrumentalist has gone rogue, adding a new dimension of possibility to not only his sonic weapon of choice, but also to pop music.

A prolific songwriter, he has a large and varied catalog of songs ranging from heart-wrenching acoustic ballads to heart-pounding heavier rock. His music is published by EMI Music Publishing Canada (2004-present). Lukas first ventured onto the music scene with two Canadian bands, Cleavage (1995-2005) and Rise Electric (2005-2006), which helped prepare him for what was to come. He entered and won the competition television show Rock Star: Supernova (2006) which earned him front man status with Tommy Lee (Motley Crue), Jason Newsted (Metallica), and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). Their band Rock Star Supernova completed an album and a world tour of the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Following the tour, Lukas returned to Los Angeles and began writing and recording new music. The Love and Lust EP (June 2007) was released and he completed the solo acoustic Love and Lust Tour, making over two dozen stops throughout the United States and Canada. The new material was well-received by fans, and the band Stars Down was born (2008-present). After touring with his new band, Lukas began playing local gigs at such southern California hot spots as The Roxy, The Key Club, The Mint, and Viper Room. The year 2010 kicked off with a mini East Coast tour and Lukas working on his first full length album. Hollywood was released (July 2010) and debuted live at West Hollywood\u2019s famous Viper Room. The all acoustic Hollywood Stripped followed (August 2010). After moving to Nashville, in addition to local and out-of-town gigs, he wrote, recorded, produced, and released six additional recordings. The first three were Seed EP (December 2010), Story Teller (January 2011), and Super, Sex, Magic (February 2011). He also co-wrote, provided vocals, and recorded several music videos for a side-project, Switchblade Glory (April 2011). Lukas released Prophecy (November 2011) and Christmas Collection (December 2011) to complete a very busy year. But he wasn\u2019t finished, releasing the album 8 Days (April 2012) soon after. Lukas has appeared on many media outlets, including performing live at the 2006 Gemini awards, the CBS television series Rock Star: Supernova (18 million viewers worldwide), Ellen, Regis & Kelly, The Jimmy Kimmel Show, Entertainment Tonight, The Howard Stern Show, and ET Canada.

In the past few years she has performed hundreds of shows including a tour with High School Nation and \u201cDrake and Josh\u201d star Drake Bell, Six Flags Over Texas, Rodeo Austin, Goorin SXSW, Grapefest, and Berges Fest among others. She has also appeared live on both Good Morning Texas and Good Day Austin in the past few months. In between shows and appearances, she is working towards her Bachelor\u2019s Degree from Berklee School of Music Online.\n\nCurrently, Bethany is nominated for three Josie Music Awards.\n\nBethany works hard to make her music relatable, not just to other 20-year-old girls but to people of all ages and all walks of life. In addition to being relatable, it\u2019s important to her that no parent ever feels like they have to cover their child\u2019s ears at one of her shows. She is happy and proud to say that her album is 100% clean and safe for people of all ages as well.\n\nShe is always singing, constantly writing, and she always has something new and positively entertaining around the corner.", "otherInfo": "Fridays are about to get more PANDATASTIC!

A Thousand Tiny Torches, the singer-songwriter\u2019s new Indie Folk Americana collection, is a testament to her renewal of inspiration, the rekindling of dreams, and the redemptive power and connective compassion that defines her artistry.\n\nHer rich, expressive alto voice frames expansive melodies that echo the American heartland. Now based in Los Angeles, Arielle knows this geography well. A performing itinerary transported her from Club Passim in her adopted hometown of Boston to venues including Eddie\u2019s Attic in Atlanta and Nashville\u2019s 12th & Porter, plus stops to the Southwest, as she steered a vegetable oil-fueled vehicle across Texas to Abilene, Odessa and Austin.\n\nTen years ago, with three well-received releases accompanied by national tours, she lost sight of her future as an artist. \u201cThough my heart still ached to write songs and sing, I found that I couldn't do it anymore,\u201d she recalls.\n\nArielle moved to the City of the Angels. She divorced and remarried, taught yoga philosophy, and worked behind the scenes in the music industry. She penned and published essays and poems, and was nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best New Poets. She baked innumerable pies. After being rejected for a PhD program, she constructed a blue \u201cshe shed\u201d in her backyard. And it was in this rustic space \u2013 surrounded by 47 volumes of her journals \u2013 that she rekindled her love for music and dedicated herself to writing one song per week.\n\nThe result is A Thousand Tiny Torches. Produced by Shane Alexander, the project is propelled by the masterful playing of a sterling cast of players with credits from Lady Gaga to KT Tunstall to Lukas Nelson: Denny Weston Jr., drums; Carl Byron, keyboards; Darby Orr, bass; Jesse Siebenberg, steel guitar; and Mike Mullins on mandolin. Michael Gehring tracked the project at Secret World Studios in Los Angeles in the famous Sound City Studios complex, and GRAMMY-winners Brian Yaskulka and Hans DeKline mixed and mastered, respectively. A loyal group of supporters funded the recording through a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nA consummate storyteller, Arielle\u2019s narratives crosscut exacting details with universal themes. On the lead single \u201cWhat Really Matters,\u201d she recalls a harrowing season in Southern California as gunshots ricocheted through a country bar and the surrounding hills ignited with apocalyptic wildfires.\n\nIn contrast are incandescent songs with characters and conversations etched in fine lines and deep empathy. Vivid imagery glows with headlights, porch lights, lighthouses, bolts of lightning, fireflies, and stars that have been shining for ten billion years.\n\nAfter launching her return with a holiday single, Arielle is now back onstage at house concerts and listening rooms, including the fabled Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Hollywood. Plans are underway for West Coast tours and upcoming dates in Boston. This time, she says, she is doing it for the right reasons. \u201cWhen I was younger I was performing,\u201d she confirms. \u201cNow, I\u2019m connecting.\"\n\nArielle Silver says that when she made her break with music, her ambition for everything stopped. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see the future. It was beautiful. I became so present in a way I never had been before, and the sense of being present lasted for a long time.\u201d Now, in themes that speak to losing and rediscovering the path, emerges a musical alchemy of renewal and rebirth: A loving light that is reflected from A Thousand Tiny Torches.", "otherInfo": "Join the livestream here: http://facebook.com/ariellesilvermusic\n\nWeekly acoustic happy hour with songs, stories... and now trivia.

MPress, distributed worldwide by Caroline/Universal via SRG-ILS Group, also releases albums by Rachael Sage, Seth Glier, and A Fragile Tomorrow.\n\nGrace Pettis is an award-winning songwriter from Austin, Texas who is a noted member of the South Austin scene. A little bit folk, a little bit country/Americana and with a whole lot of soul, Pettis has released two DIY albums and the Dallas Morning News has hailed her as \"one of the most talented young singer-songwriters in America\".\n\nPettis first came to the attention of MPress founder and President Rachael Sage at a SXSW party in Austin, where her voice and presence, even totally unplugged in a crowded room, commanded the spotlight. Sage gushes, \"Grace Pettis is one of the best singers I have ever had the pleasure to hear. And when I say 'best', I don't mean that in a showy way -\u2013 although her voice is both powerful and beautiful. I mean that she can tell a story with her voice in a way that cuts right to the heart of our collective humanity, whatever the topic may be. Her songwriting is nothing short of masterful, and to see these timeless qualities in someone so young feels like discovering something akin to the magic of Loretta Lynn, Johnny Cash or perhaps, Brandi Carlile. MPress Records is thrilled to be working with Grace!\"\n\nPettis, who is repped by Chas Management, will be touring the southeastern US and Europe in winter/spring 2020. Her first release on MPress is expected later on in the year. In the meantime, she is eager to have found such a supportive new team. \"Signing a record deal sounds pretty daunting\", Pettis admits. \"It's not a decision to take lightly. But from the first conversation with Rachael Sage and her wonderful team, I've felt like I've finally found my way home. After a decade of releasing my own music, I couldn't be more thrilled to announce that I'm partnering with MPress Records, a label that has built its unique reputation on championing and supporting artists and putting music with integrity out into the world. I'm so proud to be a part of the MPress family.\"\n\nAs a card-carrying member of the south Austin scene, Grace Pettis has amassed bragging rights to spare. She is the winner of many of the nation\u2019s most prestigious songwriting contests, including NPR's Mountain Stage NewSong Contest, and has received grants from the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation. Grace\u2019s songs have been recorded by other esteemed artists, including Sara Hickman and Ruthie Foster and she added to her songwriting accomplishments in 2019 by signing a publishing deal with BMG.

It is a pure country voice through and through. Blessed with a Johnny Cash baritone and the wit of Jerry Reed, Ray displays both over the 11 songs on his fourth album, the self-titled Ray Scott. A mix of roadhouse foot-stompers, stone-cold country ballads and the sing-speak songs for which he\u2019s become known, Ray Scott flashes with the energy and verve that defined Ray\u2019s earlier hits \u201cMy Kind of Music\u201d and \u201cThose Jeans.\u201d\nBut the album is also a reintroduction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reboot\u2014or a Ray-boot, if you will,\u201d quips Ray, who dubbed his last album Rayality. \u201cIt is an evolution, but I think people will hear it and know it\u2019s the same guy from \u2018My Kind of Music\u2019 and \u2018Those Jeans.\u2019 Lyrically, I tend to say things a certain way. You can always tell it\u2019s me.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s good reason for that, aside from that rumbling voice. Save for a few trusted cowriters here and there, like Mark Stephen Jones, Tony Mullins and Brandy Clark, Ray prefers to write solo. In this era of five-plus writers collaborating on a single song, Ray is a true lone wolf.\n\u201cCollaboration is fun and some of my favorite things have been written with other people, but at the same time, if you can write by yourself, you should,\u201d Ray says. \u201cThere was a time in Nashville when people wrote alone. Some of my favorite old writers, the people who got me interested in doing this in the first place\u2014Harlan Howard and Bob McDill\u2014wrote alone.\u201d\nThe results of such a writing style are pure, unfiltered songs, the undiluted vision of the artist.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always recorded my own material because it\u2019s almost impossible for me to sell a song that someone else wrote. I was more or less made to tell stories through my own window\u2014and the window\u2019s pretty smudged sometimes,\u201d Ray laughs. \u201cBut if I can entertain myself, I feel like other people might be entertained as well.\u201d\nThe tracks on Ray Scott are certainly entertaining. These are story songs that, instead of just repeating a catch phrase over and over, actually go somewhere. \u201cPapa n Mama,\u201d a loping blues number, is the tale of a son who stops his father\u2014 permanently\u2014from abusing his mother, landing himself in the pen. \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Gonna Be You\u201d is a defiant kiss-off to a cheating lover, promising she\u2019ll never break this guy\u2019s heart again. The cinematic \u201cLeave This World,\u201d however, is the polar opposite: a love song of devotion elevated by Ray\u2019s Male Vocalist of the Year-worthy performance, proof that Ray\u2019s bread and butter isn\u2019t just in the spoken word.\nStill, there is magic in those recitation numbers, especially in \u201cTijuana Buzzkill.\u201d A true tale of a disastrous, if humorous, south-of-the-border adventure that ended with Ray and his buddy in jail, the track exemplifies Ray\u2019s gift for wry storytelling.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just as much an art to recitation as there is singing. It\u2019s all in how you emote, your emphasis and how you tell a story,\u201d he says. And it helps if you have comic timing, which Ray does in spades. In songs like the hazy bonus track \u201cWhat Works for Willie\u201d and the take-one-for-the-team anthem \u201cThe Ugly One,\u201d he delivers the pay-off lines with the cadence of a comedian.\n\u201cThe songs end up being a little on the polarizing side,\u201d Ray admits. \u201cBut I love that. Everything I\u2019ve ever had any luck with was a song that made people turn their head and go, \u2018Well, that\u2019s different\u2019 or \u2018That pisses me off.\u2019\u201d\nProduced by Dave Brainard (Brandy Clark\u2019s 12 Stories, Jerrod Niemann\u2019s Free the Music), Ray Scott excels in the details\u2014the swampy harmonica of lead-off track \u201cCookin\u2019\u201d; the mariachi horns of \u201cTijuana Buzzkill\u201d; and the hypnotic rhythm of the white-trash nursery rhyme \u201cWheels on the House.\u201d In the end, no two songs sound alike, and Ray cements himself as a deft performer, able to toggle between those funny tunes and serious fare like the staggering \u201cI Miss the Days.\u201d\nA bittersweet ballad about being young, \u201cI Miss the Days\u201d is a slice of nostalgia, both in subject matter and production. Sonically, it recalls the 1970s and \u201980s sound of country music.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we were going for. If you listen to an old Waylon Jennings record or something from that time period, a lot of those songs had a \u2018Luckenbach\u2019 vibe to them,\u201d says Ray, who agrees that today\u2019s country music frequently borrows some of the bombast of late \u201980s hard rock. \u201cBut I\u2019m a little more Waylon and a little less Warrant.\u201d\nIn the end, Ray Scott furthers Ray\u2019s identity as a modern day outlaw, not in image, but in his approach to the music industry.\n\u201cAfter all these years in Nashville I\u2019ve never been willing to compromise my artistic vision as far as writing goes or the way things are recorded and produced. I don\u2019t chase trends, which is not necessarily your quickest road to riches by any means,\u201d he says.\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, I\u2019d like to walk outside my trailer, look up at the sun and say, \u2018I did it the way I wanted.\u2019\u201d Ray stops to laugh. \u201cWhen the cops come to serve the warrant, at least I\u2019ll have my integrity\u2014integrity and a beer.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Yall join us for another Man Cave Jam this Friday, May 22nd on the Official Ray Scott page at 7:30 cst!\n\nVirtual Tip Jars:\n\u2022Venmo: @ray-scott-music\n\u2022PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/rayscottmusic\n\u2022Official Site: http://www.rayscott.com/shop/10-virtual-tip-jar"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nicole & Scotty ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8956539.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Pop, Trip Hop, Electronic", "Time": "12:45 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Nicole & Scotty are a Pop/EDM sibling duo based in Southern California. The dynamic pair are recording/performing artists, songwriters, musicians, audio engineers and producers.\n\nTheir first single, (an out-and-proud Trip Hop style song titled \"#Queen\") has achieved over 50k streams on Spotify and over 25k views on the official music video via YouTube since it's release on October 5th, 2018. Their follow up single (a soft, House track titled \"Can Be Beautiful\") was released on December 21st, 2018, and has since been featured on Billboard Sound and AXS.\n\nStarting a YouTube channel in August of 2013 and making their debut as Elvis Presley's daughter (Lisa Marie Presley)'s supporting act that same year, together they have since begun to take the music world by storm.\n\nThe duo boast a long list of live touring accomplishments and come equipped with a catalog of over 200 original songs. Their outstanding, solid fan base is made up of an array of live audiences, the YouTube community, and social media; where their popularity is ever increasing. Posting covers of both popular and original songs, live performances, v-logs, and behind-the-scenes videos weekly, their YouTube channel has recently reached an impressive tally of over 3 quarter million views overall.\n\nThe sibling duo regularly perform and tour nationally and have frequented venues such as LA's El Rey Theatre, San Juan Capistrano's The Coach House, and (just recently) have played the House of Blues in Anaheim (twice just in 2018), Bar 20 at the Grafton Hotel in Beverly Hills, the Simi Valley fireworks celebration (with over 20,000 people in attendance), at the Gibson theater in Beverly Hills, at Pickwick's Pub in Woodland Hills, a headlining show at Monterey Court in Tucson, AZ, and much more. Nicole & Scotty are currently booking for 2019, and inquiries can be emailed to ulomag28@sbcglobal.net.\n\nThey continuously entertain radio and television appearances; a few of which have included Los Angeles' Hot 103.9 Move to the Music, KHTS 98.1 FM, New York station Gold Star Radio, Las Vegas' 702 ROX, and the TV Entertainment segment Michelle's Corner. Their music is played regularly on a rapidly growing list of stations world wide, proving that the duo are not only rapidly garnering global recognition, but are also vastly appreciated and loved by their fans from all over the world.\n\nThe siblings also dabble in acting; with Scotty having co-starred in an episode of HBO's popular comedy series \"Vice Principals\", which aired October 8th, 2017.\n\nNicole & Scotty have also been featured in several major entertainment publications; including the international music trade magazine, \"Music Connection\" and the entertainment review, \"What's REALLY Going ON\", (where Nicole occasionally writes her own column and where the sister/brother duo were featured front cover in April of 2015).\n\nFrom playing shows with touring musicians who've accompanied major bands and artists (such as The Four Seasons, Barry Manilow,or John Mayer), to garnering attention from well respected industry folks, (such as producer Teddy Riley), making connections and long lasting relationships in the industry are extremely important to Nicole & Scotty.\n\nPerforming for charities and worthy causes they strongly stand for is also a passion of theirs; the siblings having played shows to raise breast cancer awareness, raise funds for youth programs, and entertain schools in the past.\n\nWhen asked, the siblings cite their brand of Pop music as \"current, energetic and brutally honest\". Their sound is indeed uniquely sincere in a genre where it is crucial to uphold the integrity of new and innovative music. The duo delivers just that by stringing raw, personal lyrics through hypnotic hooks and synth layered foundations, accompanied by thrumming bass lines and drum patterns emulating the heartbeat of their own sound. Combining an assortment of authentic Pop arrangements and Trap influence with Electronic Dance beats and rhythms, the duo offer up a wide variety of innovative and well crafted songs that translate deep rooted emotions of every nature to their listeners. As if their artistic thumbprints aren't already present enough in their recordings, a melodic acoustic and the duo's signature ambient electric guitar can be heard flitting in and out of the tunes the pair proudly create and stand by.\n\nNicole, (21), and Scotty, (17), are two young and immensely talented musicians intent on continuing a journey full of song, and wish to share the melodies in their hearts with the world.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lola Parks ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:55 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Maria leon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8782767.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:59 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Mi vida es la m\u00fasica, soy repostera, bailarina, actriz y comediante de closet. \u00a1Quiero conocer el mundo y tener s\u00faperpoderes!\n\nInstagram: Sargentoleon", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Atlas Maior ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9082396.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "World Music, Progressive, Psychedelic Jazz, Experimental Jazz, Jazz", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Atlas Maior maps diverse musical traditions, placing Jazz, Middle Eastern, and Latin American musical idioms in dialogue with one another.

It\u2019s rock/pop sprinkled with a bit of folk/country/jazz and garnished with a pinch of reggae on the side and served with a smile on the seriously humorous side of town. With song topics ranging from politics and religion (\u201cgod\u201d) to life as a dog (\u201cRoxygrrl\u201d), Into The Blue covers a lot of ground. Life, death, love, politics and religion--it's all in there.\n\nA true independent musician, Jim released Into The Blue on his own label, Door To Door Music, as he did with his previous releases, All Dressed Up And All Stressed Out (1996), Knives & Bleeding (1999). and Hello Hello (2002). Each release features songwriting that bears the mark of a variety of influences such as Lennon & McCartney, Bob Marley, Elvis Costello, Squeeze, even Hank Williams. A fan on Jim\u2019s CDBaby page summed it up this way:\n\u201cJim plays because he loves music. He plays with the same passion whether he is playing for thousands or a few fans. It is clear in every track that Jim is playing for his love of music and not just for all the hoopla. It is for this reason that this CD is a must have.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Jim Pellinger's Quarantine Cafe streams live every Friday night at 8pm CDT, on Facebook and simul-streamed on jimpellinger.com."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "LP Giobbi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10388001.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Electro House, Disco, Dance Pop, House, Electro Pop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "LP Giobbi is rock \u2019n roll with a disco soul, born draped in sequins and cloaked in fog at a seance in the mountains of Oregon.\n\nShe was trained in jazz piano at UC Berkeley before becoming a synth warrior goddess in Los Angeles.

Zane began honing his chops in LA's vibrant music circuit on his 12th birthday and later refined his style at USC's prestigious Thornton School of Music, becoming one of the most in-demand guitarists on both coasts in the process. Possessing an exciting and extremely rare combination of creativity and virtuosity, along with an audiophile's ear for guitar tone and an extraordinary ability to sightread, Zane has been referred to as \"The best guitarist in NY and LA\" by Bono of U2. More recently, John Mayer handpicked Zane to play guitar on his current world tour and latest album, sans audition, after Mayer discovered Zane's fiery performances online. But with his newfound passion for writing and singing his own material, Zane is quickly gaining significant attention as a lead vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. While Zane's guitar playing has been described as daring, passionate, soulful, and jaw-dropping - tremendous labels for a young man many are proclaiming to be the next great guitar hero - Zane is now rapidly accumulating equally praiseworthy descriptions about his compositions and vocal abilities. As people witness Zane's evolution from gunslinging guitarist to full-fledged frontman, comparisons to the early days surrounding the release of John Mayer's debut EP \"Inside Wants Out\" have even been serendipitously drawn. Bob Lefsetz has raved about CARNEY - where Zane began his meteoric rise as a lead guitarist - likening the band's sound to \"a mysterious trip into the heart of darkness.\" But, Zane's original songs lean slightly away from the raw and brooding Rock and Roll that defined CARNEY as they gravitate towards his roots in Jazz, Blues and Pop. His songwriting style is grounded in visual storytelling, honesty, surrender and hope and his melodies, while imaginative and adventurous, are irresistibly catchy and instantly familiar. Zane's lyrics have been likened to those of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray LaMontagne, and his voice has been compared to singing icons Jeff Buckley, Damien Rice, and Jimmy Gnecco. This unique combination of masterful guitars, unforgettable hooks, and emotively provoking lyrics - all expressed with his profoundly moving and honest voice - is what makes Zane such a one-of-a-kind talent; one that seems poised to join not only the greats of his generation, but those who've come before him. Live performance is where Zane's most inherent gift shines; his undeniably infectious charisma - one that captivates the audience the instant he takes the stage.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album.

During this time, he has also managed to release 4 artist albums and some of the most iconic house music tracks of the last two decades.\n\nMost people know Claude VonStroke for his smiling DJ persona touring every major city, festival, and basement after-party around the world. But Claude has also influenced the very fabric of the dance community, A&Ring an impeccable roster of acts like Justin Martin, Fisher, Shiba San, Catz n Dogz, Riva Starr, Tim Green, Breach, Eats Everything, Walker & Royce, Shadow Child, and countless others. (And even naming a few of these artists.) Today, his Dirtybird label continues to surprise and innovate in the underground dance scene, releasing an enigmatic combination of house, funk, dirty bass, and electronica.\n\nVonStroke has released four original artist albums, a remix album, and a live album recorded when he closed the famed Movement Festival in his original hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Some other music highlights include working on records with Bootsy Collins, Rihanna, Disclosure and Kevin Saunderson, as well as a few #1 and #2 hits on Beatport. His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world. He continues to innovate and curate new events with a 2 additional multi-day festival mirroring his Birdhouse radio show in Chicago, and his record BBQ event series that has been going since 2003!\n\nVonStroke also loves art; most notably pop-surrealist artwork that he has commissioned for the last 7 years on Dirtybird for all of the releases. Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude. Claude does not scowl or look mean while he DJs. He does not pretend to know everything and he truly loves his fans.

This is due to his well-known ability to work with any genre of music, or combination of multiple genres at one time, to produce dynamic and high energy music sets. In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture. As the resident DJ since 2004 of some of Vegas\u2019 hottest clubs and lounges including Rum Jungle, Jet Nightclub & Koi Nightclub inside of the Planet Hollywood. Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip. Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cFRIDAY NIGHT HYPE\u201d EVERY FRIDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

But when the sun goes down, he straps on his signature Gretsch 6120, steps up to the mike and is transformed into REVEREND HORTON HEAT, a hellfire-spewing, rock and roll dare-demon.\n\nJim\u2019s tome is iconic: From recording with Lemmy Kilmister, being revered by country music legends like Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins, touring with Soundgarden, ZZ Top, The Cramps, Social Distortion, White Zombie and the Sex Pistols (a young Lydon was connected to Jim\u2019s original 1985 demo), to providing touring opps to upstarts Kyuss, Hank III, Marilyn Manson and countless others across decades on the road.\n\nHeath and longtime confidant and slap-bass general Jimbo Wallace have polished up their 12threlease, Whole New Life, which Heath calls \u201cthe most positive material I have ever written. It focuses heavily on rock and roll but there is a human interest parallel - songs about growing up poor, vices, marriage, having children and walking the rapturous streets of America.\u201d\n\nCall it a new twist on an old sound, Whole New Life was recorded between Fun Guy Studios and Modern Electric in the band\u2019s hometown of Dallas. The eleven track rumination features new sticksman Arjuna \u2018RJ\u2019 Contreras. The Texas based jazz pupil came to the bands attention from a friend\u2019s reference in the summer of 2017, and brought a whole new backbeat to the legendary rockabilly administration. After clicking with Contreras, Heath hired a new pianist in 2018, Matt Jordan, to flesh out the sound with the pomp and power of Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. \u201cI love playing with these guys, it truly is a whole new band, so the title fits perfectly.\u201d\n\nRecording the album, Heath recalled that \u201cBack in the 1950\u2019s, reverb chambers were really hip and I always loved their warmth. I\u2019m all about Sam Phillips and the things he did with tape machines and tape echo. I love that kind of production value, even if it is older than me! It really sent me to this whole other headspace where I worked with a lot of vintage gear on this album - some of which I built myself for a truly unique sound - ribbon, old tube microphones, pre-amps and stuff. Additionally, a year before I started piecing this together I worked especially hard on my singing voice. Whole New Life brought out something in me where I am screaming more and making more throaty sounds. It's got some Louisiana feel to it, a bit of gruff and some Roy Orbison style in it. We tested out new tracks on our most recent tour and they are working better with the audience than any new songs we premiered since the early days of the band.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis tour started around 1986,\u201d Heath chuckles dryly. REVEREND HORTON HEAT still performs nearly 200 shows annually, including their trademark Horton\u2019s Hayride Festival in Southern California, which has expanded to an end-of-the-year jamboree under the name Horton\u2019s Holiday Hayride. The band has also wowed sold-out crowds with their multi-city residencies across America, including performances at Coachella, Reading, Austin City Limits, Riot Fest and countless other festivals. The Texas troubadours also took a unique approach to the term \u2018Special Guests\u2019 on recent tours. Recalling the time the band opened for Jerry Lee Lewis, Heath had a vision, \u201cThe idea of playing in Jerry\u2019s backing band would have been pretty neat. So every once in a while we\u2019ll have a load of fun putting that aspect in our live set. In the middle of our set, we\u2019ll have a special guest come on stage for a mini-set where REVEREND HORTON HEAT is the backing band. The first time we did it was with Lemmy Kilmister. We stopped our set midway, the road crew dragged a Marshall amp on stage, wiped the Rickenbacker clean and out came Lem. He was adamant on playing deep cuts, but I fought tooth and nail with him to do \u2018Ace Of Spades.\u2019 I told him, \u2018Lemmy, we must do this song, we have to give the people want they want.\u2019 He took a drag of his smoke, looked me square in the eye, and said \u2018Never give them what they want, give them what they need!\u2019\u201d\n\nWith over 1 million albums sold and nearly 35 years in the game, Heath and company have been delivering blood-pressure inducing scriptures to millions of fans worldwide. Call it rock and roll, psychobilly or what have you, REVEREND HORTON HEAT is often considered an early architect of the latter genre (at least on this side of the Atlantic) and occupies a peculiar place in American musical terrain.\n\nWhole New Life was delivered November 30, 2018.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Big Blu Soul Revue ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9939353.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Funk, Jazz And Dance Music, Soul, Rhythm & Blues", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "BIG BLU SOUL REVUE bring the soul of San Francisco to their music and live shows.

He has played over 1500 shows in every continent across the globe and produced around 50 albums. He has released 13 albums with Stratovarius and 2 solo albums.\n\nTimo started playing guitar when he was 7 years old. His early influences were ABBA, The Beatles and The Shadows. Very quickly he progressed to the point where he wanted an electric guitar. After hearing \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d on the radio the rest was history. As a young teenager, Tolkki practically slept with his guitar and it was not uncommon for him to practice 8 hours a day. He was also playing in some local bands but in 1984 got a phonecall from the Stratovarius camp asking him to join the band. Stratovarius soared to great heights becoming the leading pioneers in progressive power metal. This monumental achievement included 7 world tours, 3 consecutive gold discs in Finland and selling almost 3 million records.\n\nThe recent break up of Stratovarius came about because Tolkki felt that the relationships in the band very very badly contaminated and also because everything that was to be said with that band with those members had already been said and to continue would be simply repeating the same form. He also wanted to be able to concentrate on other things, explaining that:\u201cThere\u2019s just a time for everything in life and Stratovarius came to the end of a road and there was nowhere to go anymore\u201d. During the composing process of his upcoming solo album \u201cSaana-Warrior of Light\u201d he found many new interests in the form of photography, graphics design and video editing. \u201cIt was like a new world to me and I knew I had found something that would determine the course of the rest of my life regarding my art. Now I have these amazing tools available to me to create things I did not know was possible. Lot of studying, but it\u2019s really a lot of fun, which brought me into many different areas in music. On the other hand I can do a production of a dance artist, or a metal artist. Or anyone who I think is real and has it. I rarely do productions outside of my own production company anymore. I am really into finding new talents and developing a project together with an artist, while using enough time for it. Because time is gold in music. I have everything I need here to create a perfect musical and visual experience. Music is the Universal language. Its primary function is to awaken emotions in us. We have no choice. If something doesn\u2019t move me, I know it is not for me\u201d.\n\nTimo is currently running his own Goldenworks production company and has established a comfortable working suite in Helsinki with the latest technology. He calls his place \u201cSanta\u2019s Workshop\u201d. Timo is actively looking for singers and artists who dare to explore the boundaries of themselves and take the step to the unknown.\n\nHe is ready to release his new solo album \u201cSaana-Warrior of Light Pt1\u201d. It is a groundbreaking release in many ways. It will only be available from the shop from his Official website http://www.timotolkki.com that is powered by TheGround.com so you will not find it in record stores. Tolkki is happy about these new opportunities to interact directly with his fans and to offer them products at a much better cost.\n\nSince Stratovarius break-up, he has formed a new Power Metal band that continues the legacy of Stratovarius. This band is called \u201cREVOLUTION RENAISSANCE\u201d and its debut album \u201cNew Era\u201d will be out on 6.6.2008 featuring Michael Kiske and Tobias Sammet on vocals.\n\nTimo Tolkki is looking forward to new musical endeavours and to the exciting new and fresh future in his art. 8.", "otherInfo": "Timo Tolkki Livestream Show.\nTimo Tolkki, ex-L\u00edder y Guitarrista de la Era Cl\u00e1sica de Stratovarius, tocar\u00e1 en vivo el pr\u00f3ximo viernes 22 de mayo a las 22:00 de Chile.Con su guitarra y voz, Timo Tolkki ofrecer\u00e1 un show de covers a Stratovarius y otros cl\u00e1sicos del Rock, como The Beatles y U2, entre varios otros.

He emerged at Papunya in 1980 as a founding member of the pioneering Warumpi Band, which over three albums (Big Name No Blankets, Go Bush and Too much Humbug) and twenty years of performing thrust contemporary indigenous music into mainstream Australia. Yielding such classic songs as My Island Home, Blackfella Whitefella, Fitzroy Crossing, Jailanguru Pakarnu, Stompin Ground, From The Bush and Waru.\n\nHe has since become one of Australia\u2019s finest singer/songwriters, enjoying a solo career since 1989. He has released a remarkable string of albums - the latest being Blood & Longing.\n\nHis song writing is diverse- from the rollicking Good Light in Broome, the prayerful Native Born, and healing Myall Creek, the roots groove of Long Grass Band and Eddie Mabo, the journeyman monologues of Lights of Hay and Where My People Go, the contemplation of place in Burrumbeep Hill and Whispering Casuarina to the recent Cry My Darling and Byjantic Man.\n\nCollectively, Neil's work has done much to deepen Australia\u2019s contemporary music heritage.\n\nIn 1995, Neil Murray was awarded the APRA song of the year for My Island Home - originally written for the Warumpi Band and re-recorded by Christine Anu. My Island Home featured in the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the opening ceremony of the recent 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth games.\n\nIn 2007, Jailanguru Pakarnu- (Out From Jail) a song he co-wrote with Warumpi Band guitarist Sammy Butcher in the indigenous Luritja language- was honoured by the National Film and Sound Archives, Sounds of Australia series, as a significant recording in Australia\u2019s heritage. Credited as the first commercially released pop rock single in an indigenous language. In 2016, My Island Home, as recorded by Christine Anu, received the same honour.\n\nIn recognition of his influence, Neil Murray was awarded the 2017 Port Fairy Folk Festival Artist of the Year.\n\nNeil Murray\u2019s songs have been recorded by Mary Black, Jimmy Little, Missy Higgins, Liz Stringer, Christine Anu, Peter Denahy, Carus, Adam Brand, Amy Saunders, Powderfinger, The Tiddas, Ursula Yovich, Peter Brandy, Emma Donovan and the Warumpi Band.\n\nIn 2019, he is performing nationally for his Blood & Longing tour.\n\nWhispering Casuarina video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/etiA4IsaAD0\nneilmurray.com.au\nyoutube/neilmurraymusic", "otherInfo": "Neil Murray Live Streamed as part of The Saltwater Music Festival.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thesaltystage\n\nPLEASE NOTE THE TIME DIFFERENCE!\n2pm for WA, 4pm for Eastern states and 3.30pm for Central states!\n\nPAY WHAT YOU CAN - https://www.paypal.me/bulukbaraman"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Powderfinger ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/183851.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "9:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Powderfinger are one of the most successful Australian rock bands of the past decade.

Her intelligence and brilliant musical feeling allow her to play a repertory of 61 piano concertos.\n\nIn 1990 she took up composing again, producing brilliant and at times mischievous cadenzas for her concertos. In 1994-95 she wrote her 15 Momentos Musicais and composed the Sonate Oubli\u00e9e with themes from her childhood. Her characteristics have remained unchanged: simplicity and spontaneity, feeling and imagination, technique, perfection without affectation, a delight for the eye and ear.\n\nIn February 1998 Rodrigues' Bach-CD was recorded. The critics describe her improvisations and paraphrases on works for the organ as: \"The sonorities go back to the scale of more than 3 centuries of piano literature and link perfectly well up with the richness in colour of an independent way of pianistic thinking, they have their own new life, a fascinating transfiguration, full of phantasy.\"\n\nAstonishment, admiration and even incredibility caused her Suite n.1 \"Rio de Janeiro\" for piano and orchestra, that was first performed on 9 August 2000.

He emerged at Papunya in 1980 as a founding member of the pioneering Warumpi Band, which over three albums (Big Name No Blankets, Go Bush and Too much Humbug) and twenty years of performing thrust contemporary indigenous music into mainstream Australia. Yielding such classic songs as My Island Home, Blackfella Whitefella, Fitzroy Crossing, Jailanguru Pakarnu, Stompin Ground, From The Bush and Waru.\n\nHe has since become one of Australia\u2019s finest singer/songwriters, enjoying a solo career since 1989. He has released a remarkable string of albums - the latest being Blood & Longing.\n\nHis song writing is diverse- from the rollicking Good Light in Broome, the prayerful Native Born, and healing Myall Creek, the roots groove of Long Grass Band and Eddie Mabo, the journeyman monologues of Lights of Hay and Where My People Go, the contemplation of place in Burrumbeep Hill and Whispering Casuarina to the recent Cry My Darling and Byjantic Man.\n\nCollectively, Neil's work has done much to deepen Australia\u2019s contemporary music heritage.\n\nIn 1995, Neil Murray was awarded the APRA song of the year for My Island Home - originally written for the Warumpi Band and re-recorded by Christine Anu. My Island Home featured in the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the opening ceremony of the recent 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth games.\n\nIn 2007, Jailanguru Pakarnu- (Out From Jail) a song he co-wrote with Warumpi Band guitarist Sammy Butcher in the indigenous Luritja language- was honoured by the National Film and Sound Archives, Sounds of Australia series, as a significant recording in Australia\u2019s heritage. Credited as the first commercially released pop rock single in an indigenous language. In 2016, My Island Home, as recorded by Christine Anu, received the same honour.\n\nIn recognition of his influence, Neil Murray was awarded the 2017 Port Fairy Folk Festival Artist of the Year.\n\nNeil Murray\u2019s songs have been recorded by Mary Black, Jimmy Little, Missy Higgins, Liz Stringer, Christine Anu, Peter Denahy, Carus, Adam Brand, Amy Saunders, Powderfinger, The Tiddas, Ursula Yovich, Peter Brandy, Emma Donovan and the Warumpi Band.\n\nIn 2019, he is performing nationally for his Blood & Longing tour.\n\nWhispering Casuarina video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/etiA4IsaAD0\nneilmurray.com.au\nyoutube/neilmurraymusic", "otherInfo": "Neil Murray Live Streamed as part of The Saltwater Music Festival.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thesaltystage\n\nPLEASE NOTE THE TIME DIFFERENCE!\n2pm for WA, 4pm for Eastern states and 3.30pm for Central states!\n\nPAY WHAT YOU CAN - https://www.paypal.me/bulukbaraman"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Powderfinger ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/183851.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "9:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Powderfinger are one of the most successful Australian rock bands of the past decade. Formed in 1989 in Brisbane, Australia, the band has managed to keep the same lineup since they hit the big time, Bernard Fanning (Vocals, guitars), Darren Middleton (guitars), Ian Haug (guitars), John Collins (Bass) and Jon Coghill (drums). Powderfinger are winners of nearly every major award in Australia \u2013 including the ARIA (Australian Record Industry Awards) for Album of the Year, Best Rock Album and Song of the Year.\n\nTheir musical style would simply fall into the Rock catagory, guitar driven rock featuring radio friendly hooks and enigmatic vocals. The band has featured prominently in Australian premier youth station, Triple J, winning the most popular song of the year on a number of occasions.\n\nThe band has released six studio albums and a \"best of\" collection, despite being a still functioning band, having released their most recent album \"Dream Days at the Hotel Existence\" in 2007. They are set to release another album in 2009. Despite their overwhelming popularity in native country Australia, Powderfinger have yet to take the world by storm. Frequent tours across Australia are sold out rapidly and live shows do not disappoint the large number of fans who share the passions of a passionate group.\n\nThey toured with Silverchair on the \"Across the Great Divide\" Concert, from August to October 2007, raising awareness for the indigenous people of Australia.\n\nTheir official website is www.powderfinger.net.", "otherInfo": "POWDERFINGER\nREGROUPS FOR \u2018ONE NIGHT LONELY\u2019\n7.00pm AEST, Saturday 23 May\nexclusively on Powderfinger\u2019s YouTube channel\n\nAfter a decade long hiatus, iconic Australian band Powderfinger is tuning up and preparing to bring a little happiness to fans during these challenging days.\n\nPowderfinger will reform for one night only on Saturday 23rd of May with an exclusive performance from their respective home studios, titled One Night Lonely.\n\nThe title signifies the one off nature of this event and points towards the very important charities the band are supporting, Beyond Blue and Support Act.\n\nStreaming exclusively on the band\u2019s YouTube channel from 7.00pm AEST, the set will feature a medley of their biggest hits.\n\n\u201cThe five of us have been meeting regularly over the past few months to organise some Odyssey Number 5 anniversary releases. The idea came up of playing together again in this unusual format which we all thought would be fun. The past few months has been a very strange time for us all and difficult days for many. We really just want to bring a smile to some people\u2019s faces and along the way raise some funds to help our music industry mates and people who are currently experiencing mental health issues,\u201d said the band.\n\nSupport Act provides crisis relief, mental health and wellbeing services to Australia\u2019s music industry community and has been inundated with requests recently from artists, crew and music workers who have been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBeyond Blue provides information and support to help Australians achieve their best possible mental health, whatever their age and wherever they live. In the past four weeks, Beyond Blue has experienced a 59 per cent increase in the number of people contacting its support services compared to the same period last year.\n\nRuuben van den Heuvel, Head of Music Content Partnerships (South East Asia, AU/NZ), YouTube said, \u201cAt YouTube, we believe great music, combined with the reach and scale of the internet, makes the world a better place. And this has never been more true than during these days. We\u2019re pumped to be able to help bring the highly anticipated 'One Night Lonely' reunion of Powderfinger into Aussies\u2019 homes and support some amazing charities at the same time.\u201d\n\nPowderfinger\u2019s seven studio albums produced songs that have become ingrained in the Australian psyche. Tracks like My Happiness, These Days, Sunsets, On My Mind, Burn Your Name and Pick You Up became the soundtrack for a generation.\n\nIt\u2019s rare for a band\u2019s career to hold an upward trajectory for 20 years, but that\u2019s exactly what Bernard Fanning, Darren Middleton, Ian Haug, Jon Coghill and John \u2018JC\u2019 Collins achieved with Powderfinger.\n\nTheir trophy cabinet holds five number 1 albums, 18 ARIA Awards and 3 APRA Awards to name a few. They appeared in triple j\u2019s Hottest 100 an incredible 22 times including two #1 spots for These Days (1999) and My Happiness (2000).\n\nWith millions of album sales in Australia alone, Powderfinger continue to captivate millions of listeners every month across streaming services and radio.\n\nA formidable live act that built their enormous fan base off the back of relentless touring, Powderfinger played countless sold out shows across Australia and abroad. They graced the stages of every major Australian festival of the time including Splendour in the Grass, Big Day Out, Homebake, Livid Festival and many more.\n\nIn April 2010 Powderfinger announced they were calling it a day. The band embarked on their Sunsets Farewell Tour, playing to over 300 000 people along the way, and on 13 November 2010 they played their last gig, until now\u2026\n\nOne Night Lonely is presented by Secret Sounds, Universal Music Australia, YouTube and supports Beyond Blue and Support Act.\n\n\n\nPOWDERFINGER\nONE NIGHT LONELY\nSaturday 23 May, 7.00pm AEST\n\nHOW TO WATCH IT ON YOUTUBE\nWatch online or through the YouTube app on any smart TV\nSign up to get access to One Night Lonely at powderfinger.com\n\nDONATE HERE\nAll donations will be split evenly between Beyond Blue and Support Act\n\nBEYOND BLUE\nCoronavirus Mental Wellbeing Support Service - 1800 512 348 or visit coronavirus.beyondblue.org.au\n\nSUPPORT ACT\nSupport Act Wellbeing Helpline - for artists, crew and music workers -\n#1800 959 500.

They were later joined by Tony to become Above & Beyond.\n\nAnjunabeats was formed when Jono Grant and Paavo Siljamaki met at Westminster University and discovered a mutual love of electronic music. The pair kicked off the label in 2000 with \u2018Anjunabeats Volume 1\u2019, a massive club success which instantly ear-pricked the likes of Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold and Paul van Dyk. The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label. It provided the perfect outlet for their numerous production projects \u2013 Oceanlab, Aalto, Freestate, Nitromethane, POS, Rollerball and Tranquillity Base \u2013 and every release was warmly received by elite DJ\u2019s and club-goers across the globe.\n\nIn late 2002 James Grant joined the Anjunabeats management team and the label began to expand its output, signing a series of fresh artists. The first external track to be released was Rusch and Murray\u2019s much talked about \u2018Epic\u2019 \u2013 a track made entirely across Internet forums by two producers who\u2019ve never met \u2013, with subsequent signings including Finnish trance maestro Super8 (who later joined forces with DJ Tab), talented UK duo Smith & Pledger and Dutch Deep Tech Genius, Stephen J.Kroos.\n\nSince then, the roster has expanded to over 30 artists and Anjunabeats has earned a reputation as one the most consistent dance labels in the world, with its releases proving to be essential tools for many of the world's top DJs. In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

They also curate music for their brand-new label, Rave Culture, which includes hosting their own bi-weekly radio show on Dutch broadcasting station SLAM!, which has gained them over 300,000 listeners per show plus coverage across North America via SiriusXM.\n\nNow shifting into a new phase with a tidal wave of new productions and incinerating live sets, the rise of their new Rave Culture label and the impact of their NWYR alias, W&W are cementing their place amongst dance music\u2019s top acts in signature style: transcending boundaries and never looking back.", "otherInfo": "We're working on a special XR Livestream from the Rave Culture City.

The band's moniker is a twist on the name of a second cousin of singer and guitarist Brendan Bayliss named Humphrey McGee.\n\nIn late 2004, the band was declared by Rolling Stone Magazine to be the successors to the jam band throne previously held by Phish.\n\nThey are much more influenced musically by progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, Yes, Dream Theater, and Genesis, as well as heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden. The band also \"identifies The Police, The Beatles, The Monkees, Nick D'Virgilio, and Led Zeppelin as primary influences with a reverence the members describe as 'Biblical.'\" [2] However, there really isn't a style of popular music that Umphrey's does not cover. Artists covered in concert by Umphrey's range from Lionel Richie to Metallica to Toto to Snoop Dogg to James Taylor.\n\nFormed at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two popular Notre Dame rock bands. Early concerts consisted of both originals and cover songs, including Guns N' Roses's \"Patience\" and Vince Guaraldi's Peanuts theme \"Linus and Lucy.\"\n\nIn mid-1998, after only 8 months together, the band released their debut album complete with a tongue-in-cheek title, Greatest Hits Vol. III. The group decided to record an album immediately because it was easier to get live gigs with an official CD. Long out of print, the album contains many of Umphrey's future concert warhorses, such as \"Divisions\" and \"All in Time.\"\n\nShortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. By 1999, the band had gained notoriety outside of Indiana, especially with the release of the live album Songs for Older Women, which featured live tracks recorded over a two-night stand in November 1998.\n\nThe addition of Jake Cinninger in September 2000 helped bring the band's musical dynamic to a new level. Cinninger, an accomplished guitarist, brought a distinct heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar).\n\nThe band released another live album, One Fat Sucka, which contained live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.\n\nAround 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive jam sessions took place in a hotel in the \"Jimmy Stewart Ballroom\" during the wedding of fan/website designer Jeremy Welsh. Therefore, the band began to call their onstage improvisational excursions \"Jimmy Stewart.\" This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers and has been extensively outlined by \"McL\" in the \"Jimmy Stewart writeup\" on the fan message board known as \"The Bort\" at www.umphreaks.com.\n\n2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK. That summer, the first annual Bonnaroo Festival took place in rural Manchester, TN, and featured over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people. Umphrey's played to their largest audience to date. They would go on to play Bonnaroo in 2004 and again in 2006.\n\nThe band almost ended in late 2002 when drummer Mike Mirro announced he was leaving the band to attend medical school. After hundreds of tapes were reviewed by percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers, who has a masters degree in jazz drumming from DePaul University.\n\nIn 2004, the band released the critically acclaimed Anchor Drops, and released Safety in Numbers two years later in April 2006.\n\nIn April, 2007, Umphrey's released their fifth studio effort, The Bottom Half, an album of leftover tracks from the Safety in Numbers sessions. The album was supported with tours of the USA, Europe, and Japan.\n\nBrendan Bayliss is also working on a studio album with Jeff Austin of Yonder Mountain String Band.", "otherInfo": "We're teaming up with Live From Out There to bring you Summer Camp Virtual Festival: A 20 Year Retrospective featuring live music, throwback performances, interviews, unique moments, giveaways, and a virtual gathering you won't soon forget...

Inspired by such visceral singers as Janis Joplin and Tina Turner, she left school at sixteen to follow her own dreams. Dilana soon found herself with a promising music career in Holland, becoming one of the country's most coveted live acts. Recording and releasing the album Wonderfool in 2000 yielded five singles, four videos and a string of touring and festival gigs throughout the region, celebrating her natural talents as a songwriter and performer.\n\nBy way of Houston, Dilana arrived in L.A. and auditioned to compete on TV's \"Rock Star Supernova.\" Quoted in the Hollywood Press, \"The moment she stepped on the Mayan Theatre stage for Episode 1 and performed 'Lithium,' Dilana instantly became the show's frontrunner.\" Her powerful vocals and commanding stage presence amassed legions of new fans from around the world. That acclaim inspired Dilana to further pursue her musical passions with characteristic tenacity.\n\nDilana has performed with rock's biggest legends including Tommy Lee and Mick Mars (M\u00f6tley Crue), Dave Navarro (Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). In 2007, she won over the masses with opening slot performances for Aerosmith and Beth Hart. She launched two solo tours spanning North America and Western Europe that both consistently sold out and earned stellar reviews in the press and in 2009, Dilana ended a third successful year performing by touring her native South Africa.\n\n\nFollowing the release of seven singles, Dilana spent much of 2008 in the studio. In November 2009, she unleashed the album Inside Out, featuring 12 original tracks and her first full-length album in nine years. As new opportunities presented themselves, Dilana jumped at the chance to venture into film acting. The singer/songwriter won the BEST ACTRESS award at the Action On Film International Film Festival as well as winning both the BEST ACTRESS award and the BEST MUSIC award at the American International Film Festival for the 9 songs she wrote and performed in the rock drama: Angel Camouflaged.\n\nDuring her extensive world touring, Dilana performed in Afghanistan for the troops in 2009 and 2010. She was a part of the Go Army Concert Series tour in August 2011, sharing the stage with Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Doobie Brothers as well as touring Holland, South Africa, and across the USA.\n\n2012/2013 brought fans news that Dilana would be welcoming two new creations to the world. One, the studio release of her studio album titled Beautiful Monster, in which she went on tour where she opened for Puddle of Mudd and also for Saliva, and the other, Dilana's best creation EVER - a beautiful daughter named River. Both officially released in 2013.\n\nIn 2016 her fifth album was released, called Dilana / Angel Camouflaged, the soundtrack of the movie with the same name.\nIn the same year her first live (acoustic) DVD was also released.\nIn 2016 Dilana was invited to be part of The Voice of Holland...", "otherInfo": "Dilana and NIHZ.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989.

Buy LP/CD from http://www.juliajacklin.com or stream online.\n\nThe second full-length album from Australian singer/songwriter Julia Jacklin, Crushing embodies every possible meaning of its title word. It\u2019s an album formed from sheer intensity of feeling, an in-the-moment narrative of heartbreak and infatuation. And with her storytelling centered on bodies and crossed boundaries and smothering closeness, Crushing reveals how our physical experience of the world shapes and sometimes distorts our inner lives.\n\n\u201cThis album came from spending two years touring and being in a relationship, and feeling like I never had any space of my own,\u201d says the Melbourne-based artist. \u201cFor a long time I felt like my head was full of fear and my body was just this functional thing that carried me from point A to B, and writing these songs was like rejoining the two.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to her 2016 debut Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win, Crushing finds Jacklin continually acknowledging what\u2019s expected of her, then gracefully rejecting those expectations. As a result, the album invites self-examination and a possible shift in the listener\u2019s way of getting around the world\u2014an effect that has everything to do with Jacklin\u2019s openness about her own experience.\n\n\u201cI used to be so worried about seeming demanding that I\u2019d put up with anything, which I think is common\u2014you want to be chill and cool, but it ends up taking so much of your emotional energy,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cNow I\u2019ve gotten used to calling out things I\u2019m not okay with, instead of just burying my feelings to make it easier on everyone. I\u2019ve realized that in order to keep the peace, you have to speak up for yourself and say what you really want.\u201d\n\nProduced by Burke Reid (Courtney Barnett, The Drones) and recorded at The Grove Studios (a bushland hideaway built by INXS\u2019 Garry Gary Beers), Crushing sets Jacklin\u2019s understated defiance against a raw yet luminous sonic backdrop. \u201cIn all the songs, you can hear every sound from every instrument; you can hear my throat and hear me breathing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really important to me that you can hear everything for the whole record, without any studio tricks getting in the way.\u201d\n\nOn the album-opening lead single \u201cBody,\u201d Jacklin proves the power of that approach, turning out a mesmerizing vocal performance even as she slips into the slightest murmur. A starkly composed portrait of a breakup, the song bears an often-bracing intimacy, a sense that you\u2019re right in the room with Jacklin as she lays her heart out. And as \u201cBody\u201d wanders and drifts, Jacklin establishes Crushing as an album that exists entirely on its own time, a work that\u2019s willfully unhurried.\n\nFrom there, Crushing shifts into the slow-building urgency of \u201cHead Alone,\u201d a pointed and electrifying anthem of refusal (sample lyric: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be touched all the time/I raised my body up to be mine\u201d). \u201cAs a woman, in my case as a touring musician, the way you\u2019re touched is different from your male bandmates\u2014by strangers and by those close to you,\u201d notes Jacklin. On the full-tilt, harmony-spiked \u201cPressure to Party,\u201d she pushes toward another form of emotional freedom. \u201cWhen you come out of a relationship, there\u2019s so much pressure to act a certain way,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cFirst it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve gotta take some time for yourself\u2019\u2026but then if you take too much time it\u2019s, \u2018You\u2019ve gotta get back out there!\u2019 That song is just my three-minute scream, saying I\u2019m going to do what I need to do, when I need to do it.\u201d Crushing also shows Jacklin\u2019s autonomy on songs like \u201cConvention,\u201d an eye-rolling dismissal of unsolicited advice, presented in elegantly sardonic lyrics (\u201cI can tell you won\u2019t sleep well, if you don\u2019t teach me how to do it right\u201d).\n\nElsewhere on Crushing, Jacklin brings her exacting reflection to songs on loss. With its transportive harmonies and slow-burning guitar solo, \u201cDon\u2019t Know How to Keep Loving You\u201d ponders the heartache in fading affection (\u201cI want your mother to stay friends with mine/I want this feeling to pass in time\u201d). Meanwhile, on \u201cTurn Me Down\u201d\u2014an idiosyncratically arranged track embedded with hypnotic guitar tones\u2014Jacklin gives an exquisitely painful glimpse at unrequited devotion (\u201cHe took my hand, said I see a bright future/I\u2019m just not sure that you\u2019re in it\u201d). \u201cThat song destroyed me in the studio,\u201d says Jacklin of \u201cTurn Me Down,\u201d whose middle section contains a particularly devastating vocal performance. \u201cI remember lying on the floor in a total state between what felt like endless takes, and if you listen it kind of sounds like I\u2019m losing my mind.\u201d And on \u201cWhen the Family Flies In,\u201d Jacklin shares her first ever piano-driven piece, a beautifully muted elegy for the same friend to whom she dedicated Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win. \u201cThere are really no words to do justice to what it feels like to lose a friend,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cIt felt a bit cheap to even try to write a song about it, but this one came out on tour and it finally felt okay to record.\n\nDespite its complexity, Crushing unfolds with an ease that echoes Jacklin\u2019s newfound self-reliance as an artist. Originally from the Blue Mountains, she grew up on her parents\u2019 Billy Bragg and Doris Day records and sang in musicals as a child, then started writing her own songs in her early 20s. \u201cWith the first album I was so nervous and didn\u2019t quite see myself as a musician yet, but after touring for two years, I\u2019ve come to feel like I deserve to be in that space,\u201d she says.\n\nThroughout Crushing, that sense of confidence manifests in one of the most essential elements of the album: the captivating strength of Jacklin\u2019s lyrics. Not only proof of her ingenuity and artistic generosity, Jacklin\u2019s uncompromising specificity and infinitely unpredictable turns of phrase ultimately spring from a certain self-possession in the songwriting process.\n\n\u201cAs I was making this album there was sort of a slow loosening of pressure on myself,\u201d Jacklin says. \u201cThere\u2019ve been some big life changes for me over the last few years, and I just found it too tiring to try to cover things up with a lot of metaphors and word trickery. I just wanted to lay it all out there and trust that, especially at such a tense moment in time, other people might want to hear a little vulnerability.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Allan Harris ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10342746.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Americana, Blues, Jazz, Folk, Soul, R&b/soul, Rnb-soul", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Allan Harris\n\"a protean talent\" (NY Times)\nEver since he burst on the jazz scene in the latter part of the twentieth century, The Brooklyn-born, Harlem-based vocalist/guitarist/bandleader/composer Allan Harris has reigned supreme as one of the most accomplished and exceptional singers of his generation. Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Andre Rizo official ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10310815.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Deep House, Tech House, House", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "'Be magical every fucking time no matter what if it depend of you!

As a producer, he has found plenty of ways to express himself musically.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about mood and a housy, hypnotic groove [\u2026] playing those tracks that get you tapping your feet and nodding your head without you realizing it, regardless of tempo, style, or release date. \u201c\n\n2017 / 2018, became one of the most airplayed dj/producer on Dance FM radio with 7 tracks, encouraging him to release the nine EP called \"Going Forward\".\n\n2020 is a year for new challenges.

This is his official website\n\nFink's recording career began with Ninja Tune's release of his debut album Fresh Produce in 2001, a well received chill-out set that fitted neatly with the output of the label. However, it was his second release, 2006's Biscuits For Breakfast, that defined his style and began to bring his name to a wider audience.\n\nBuilt around his bluesy voice, finger-picking acoustic guitar and the stripped-back live rhythm section, Biscuits boasted a fledgling pop sensibility while retaining the signature Ninja Tune vibe - a fact not lost on a swelling crowd of industry luminaries, notably Zero 7, who promptly invited Fink to support them on their UK tour, and Nitin Sawhney, with whom Fink guested at the 2006 Electric Proms.A follow-up is currently being recorded for early 2007 release.\n\nDiscography (electronic/acoustic)\n\nDistance and Time - Released: 01/10/07\nBiscuits For Breakfast - Released: 24/04/06\nSo Long - Released: 03/04/06\nPretty Little Thing - Released: 06/02/06\nFresh Produce - Released: 01/06/00\nEver Since I Was A Kid - Released: 01/04/00\nFront Side EP - Released: 01/03/99\nFink Funk EP - Released: 01/07/97\n\nWebsite: Fink World\n\n----------\n\nb) Fink were a German indie-country band from hamburg, led by Nils Koppruch and Andreas Voss (also in band Halma).

His debut solo album \"I Didn't Get Where I Am...\" was released in 2002.

Something he knew a little about! Image hosting by Photobucket Back in 1984, Chris, with his songwriting partner Glenn Tilbrook, wrote a musical called Labelled with Love. It ran for three months in London and this remains one of his fondest memories of working with Glenn. Most recently, Chris has been writing with Wet Wet Wet singer Marti Pellow for his 2nd solo album. This two-year project has given Chris the chance to bring together some of the finest writers, as he did on Marti's Martis first album, Smile. Together, Chris and Marti have composed over 150 new songs with people like Steve Booker, Adam Levy (Norah Jones' guitarist), Amy Wadge, Jim Watson and many more. Chris is working on various projects at the moment: a musical with Guy Barker - Jazz Trumpeter supreme and a record with his friend Matt Deighton from Mother Earth fame.\n\nIn August 2006 Chris released South East Side Story, an acoustic album and DVD that features reworked versions of classic Squeeze songs, and a live performance at the Albany Theatre.

The album is co-produced by Block and her husband Rob Davis.\nHeralded as \u201ca living landmark\u201d (Berkeley Express), \u201ca national treasure\u201d (Guitar Extra), and \u201cone of the greatest living acoustic blues artists\u201d (Blues Revue), Rory Block has committed her life and her career to preserving the Delta blues tradition and bringing it to life for 21st century audiences around the world. A traditionalist and an innovator at the same time, she wields a fiery and haunting guitar and vocal style that redefines the boundaries of acoustic blues and folk. The New York Times declared: \u201cHer playing is perfect, her singing otherworldly as she wrestles with ghosts, shadows and legends.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Girlschool ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8174942.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Denise Dufort / Drums, Jackie Chambers: Lead Guitar / Backing Vocals, Tracey Lamb: Bass Guitar / Backing Vocals, Kim McAuliffe: Rythm Guitar / Lead Vocal", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "See short Biog above...", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Emily Barker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8193747.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Americana, Soul, Folk, Blues, Country", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Emily Barker is best known as the writer and performer of the award-winning theme to the hit PBS Masterpiece drama Wallander starring Kenneth Branagh.

Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week.

The band\u2019s seventh album, Wildness, their first in seven years, entered the UK charts at Number Two, went gold, and kept them on tour around the world for the best part of 18 months.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gigging time, but also a lot of thinking time.\n\n\u201cWhere did it all go right?\u201d echoes Lighbtody. \u201cNo idea!\u201d the singer and songwriter laughs. \u201cAfter 10 years of no success, no one \u2013 least of all us \u2013 expected us these last 15 years to sell 17 million albums, headline festivals and play to thousands of people all over the world.\u201d\nAdd to that: one billion global track streams, five UK platinum albums, an Ivor Novello award and Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominations. And, in the shape of Chasing Cars, a modern classic recently anointed by the PPL as the most played song on UK radio of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWhen we released Final Straw in 2003, I think there was general goodwill around us from the media,\u201d continues Lightbody, \u201cas people knew the story of the previous 10 years and were kinda glad for us to get a shot on a major label,\" he notes of their move from indie Jeepster (also original home of Belle and Sebastian) to discerning Polydor imprint Fiction. That \u201csea-change\u201d set in motion the next phase of the band\u2019s existence. Still, in music, as in life, nothing is a given. \u201cOf course the good grace of the press is hard won and easy lost, but radio kept on playing us. That\u2019s been the real key to our success, I firmly believe. Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. On those shows we did some of the songs close to how they sound on the Reworked album \u2013 for example, the new version of You\u2019re All I Have came directly out of playing those acoustic shows.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re All I Have is the opening track from 2006\u2019s Eyes Open, the album that also featured Chasing Cars. On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain. Iain came up with the beautiful, John Martyn-style guitar, and his version floored me when I heard it the first time. Iain\u2019s guitar playing has always been a joy to listen to and to have it feature so prominently on this album is just amazing.\"\n\nAlso presented in simple acoustic simplicity is Chocolate, the third single from Final Straw, and produced here in classy, \u201ctime-stopping\u201d style by McDaid. \u201cChocolate has been a live favourite since we released it. It\u2019s a song all Snow Patrol fans know \u2013 I can\u2019t attest that they all love it but they know it!\u201d its co-author laughs. \u201cAnd we wanted to rework the songs that the fans are the most familiar with. There's not much point in reworking songs people don\u2019t really know as there's not really a stark contrast.\u201d\nThat said, \u201cwe will be doing something with the first two albums before the release of Reworked as those two albums do not feature for that same reason,\u201d Lightbody teases.\nWhat of the recent Twitter \u201caccusation\u201d that SP have \u201cdisowned\u201d those albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It\u2019s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2001), because they don\u2019t play the songs live?\n\u201cNot true at all,\u201d he replies with a shake of the head. \u201cWe are very proud of them. It\u2019s just that when we play those songs live they negatively affect the atmosphere of the gig. And as Star Trek taught us: \u2018The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat need to entertain and surprise also informed the approach taken to Called Out In The Dark. The curtain-raiser from 2011's Fallen Empires now comes with an inventive synth throb that echoes the original.\n\u201cI had worried a little that the whole record was getting very downtempo,\u201d admits Lightbody. \u201cThe nature of recording in hotel rooms and dressing rooms is that things will invariably be low-key. Hard to rock out with a family of four in the next hotel room trying to sleep!\n\u201cSo when it came to some of the songs we recorded towards the end of the new album, we wanted to explore a slightly higher tempo \u2013 without, of course, leaning too heavy into the original version. Called Out\u2026 is certainly the closest to the original version of any song on Reworked, but I think distinct enough to warrant its place. It has an electro bent like the original but steers clear of any of its predecessor\u2019s tropes. I asked Iain to lift it up and he sure did.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the three new songs. First up, the lovely, heart-stopping Time Won\u2019t Go Slowly.\n\u201cJohnny and I wrote this in his house in LA. We\u2019re both massive fans of Frank Ocean, so we wanted it to sound like Frank Ocean crossed with Frank Sinatra. All the Franks! It\u2019s a classic crooner track. We just wanted to try something starkly different from anything we have done before.\n\"As for the lyrics, I guess I\u2019ve not written about love for a while and needed a fix,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI like the idea of the inherent tragedy woven into the fabric of time: time speeds up when we're having a great time and slows down when we're miserable. Although it\u2019s all perception, of course, not reality. And I like that, too. That distortion. Our minds are powerful and sometimes terrible things. I guess the song tries to wrap its head around that great cosmic joke. Also it\u2019s just a love song.\"\nThen there\u2019s I Think of Home, a folk-flavoured piano ballad with vivid, evocative and deeply personal lyrics. Lightbody wrote it in 2014, as part of a five-song contribution \u201cto a night dedicated to my greatest literary hero Seamus Heaney when he opened the Seamus Heaney Home Place in Magherafelt. They wanted me to play a few songs at the opening night.\n\u201cI set my own rules for the songs\u2019 content,\" he expands. \"They had to be inspired by what Heaney had been inspired by: home, family, Ireland, The Troubles, hope, the soil\u2026\u201d\nI Think of Home was later considered for inclusion on Wildness, but none of the versions the band tried out in the studio fitted.\n\u201cBut then we went on tour with Wildness and at shows in Ireland and Irish strongholds like Boston, New York, Sydney and Melbourne, I would play I Think Of Home acoustically on my own in the middle of gigs. It would always go down well.\n\u201cSo when it came to Reworked we had lived with the song enough to feel like we could do a great version of it. And Johnny produced a stunning version of it. I had been playing it a certain way for so long it was hard for me to hear it any other way. That can be dangerous \u2013 stagnation can set in. So when that happens you have to let someone you trust take it from you and remake it. So, in the spirit of what we were doing, it was great to get a reworked version of a song that had never even been released.\"\nThe third new song is Made Of Something Different Now, which is quietly sweeping, quietly epic and wholly devastating.\n\u201cOne of my favourite tracks we have done in ages,\" nods Lightbody. \"In keeping with the Reworked attitude of trying new things, it\u2019s unlike much of what we\u2019ve done before. Lyrically, it\u2019s the story of a dear friend\u2019s heartbreak. My own heart, having not been in a relationship in ten years, is unrisked so unbroken. A damning self-portrait if ever there was one! Writing this song \u2013 with Johnny \u2013 made me realise my own lack of bravery in that department. Hasn\u2019t effected any change yet, mind you, but it did start me thinking at least\u2026 Anyway, as us Celts say, it\u2019s a belter,\u201d he grins.\n\nThe final word should go to Take Back The City. Gary Lightbody\u2019s hymn to Belfast is the song that opens Reworked and is sure to be an emotive live highlight when Snow Patrol take Reworked on the road later this year. As he reflects on 25 years of Snow Patrol, how have his feelings about the city changed in the 11 years since the song was released?\n\u201cWell, as the song says, I love Belfast tonight and always. There are still things that drive me crazy about the place. But I think that's the same for everyone\u2019s home city \u2013 although my home town, of course, is Bangor.\n\u201cMy love has deepened though not waned. I see the conflict that still goes on in people\u2019s hearts, my own included, and yet there is this drive in most people \u2013 most people \u2013 to put the past behind us and move on. To lift each other up.\n\u201cWe need that now more than ever with the looming clusterfuck that is Brexit and the devastation it has the potential to bring to the whole of UK, but to Northern Ireland more than anywhere else. We need that will to put the past behind us and lift each other.\u201d\n\nHear, hear. Equally, with these 16 inspiring, enveloping tracks, this is also moment to embrace the past \u2013 and, like the man said, to use it to lift each other. This is Reworked. This is Snow Patrol\u2019s history, and their legacy. And it\u2019s their inspired next step.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kevin Gordon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8895910.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Americana, Blues, Indie Swamp", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Louisiana native, now 20-year East Nashville resident, Kevin Gordon is a touring recording artist and songwriter whose latest release, Tilt & Shine, was ranked #2 in Paste's Best Roots & Blues Albums of 2018.

From ups to downs (and the unthinkable in between), the Tampa, FL alternative rock outfit has weathered last-minute label shifts, lineup changes, and everything else that the industry can possibly throw at a diligent, dynamic, and dedicated group of musicians. In over a decade on the scene, they\u2019ve delivered five full-length albums to a diehard fan base, culminating on 2012\u2019s 15th & Hope--the last record to be produced by the legendary Phil Ramone--enjoyed multiple television and film syncs, performed on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d and played alongside everybody from Maroon 5 and Scott Weiland to Plain White T\u2019s. However, in 2014, vocalist and guitarist Don Miggs experienced something of a personal revelation that would inform his next musical step.\n\n\u201cI realized that, in some ways, I was making music to fill a hole so people could tell me I\u2019m great or chase some sort of mythical thing that somebody else deems a hit,\u201d he admits. \u201cI decided I was done doing that. You can\u2019t guarantee making anybody else happy, so you might as well make yourself happy. So, I started writing songs, and I didn\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\nWorking with collaborator Charlie Midnight and his MIGGS band mates Michael Lombardo [bass/vocals], John Luzzi [guitar/vocals], and Walker Adams [drums/vocals], Don churned out thirty songs in record time.\nRemarkably, this marks the first time the band has followed up an album with the same lineup, and it speaks to their chemistry and unity.\n\n\u201cWe have four completely different perspectives,\u201d John declares. \u201cWith four completely different musical tastes, I feel like we\u2019re just beginning to really mesh in the studio and live. It\u2019s exciting to be part of.\u201d\n\nOutside of MIGGS, Don stands out as an in-demand producer in his own right. He runs a studio out of Tampa, hosts his own radio show The Miggs & Swig Show on iheart radio, and will be a vintage guitar collector and aficionado forever. However, he\u2019s bringing out his most powerful statement yet in 2015 with MIGGS.\n\n\u201cDammit, I care a lot,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cI want people to listen and feel like there\u2019s a melody, and it matters. Like somehow I gave them a piece of themselves. I told a story that makes them get lost in their moment. If I can do that, on even just one of these songs, I win.

The music achieved critical acclaim and airplay across the country and into the US and even Europe. The first single from that album, \u2018Come Right Back To You\u2019 debuted on the iTunes Canada Top 200 RnB/Soul song chart at #23, while the album itself debuted at #11 on the Canadian iTunes Top 200 RnB/Soul chart.\n\nThe success of \u2018My Heart Away\u2019 led to the interest and attention of one of House music\u2019s hardest working artists from Sweden, StoneBridge. The Grammy award-nominated artist, Producer, and DJ has shared his talent on Billboard #1 hits for major artists like Ariana Grande, P!nk, Haley Joelle, Nelly Furtado & many others. One particular song from Avery\u2019s album, \u2018Pieces\u2019, captured the dynamic producer\u2019s imagination and \u2018Pieces \u2013 The Remixes\u2019, released in January 2020, with its already infectious melody and catchy hook, is being played in dance clubs and on dance radio all around the world. In fact, the song debuted on the Billboard Dance Club Song Chart at 50* and has quickly moved within the top 40, widening the appeal of this independent Canadian artist.\n\nThat achievement is merely one of many successes from this teenaged Contemporary Soul/Pop phenomenon. In fact, Canadian, recording artist Avery Raquel, started in the entertainment industry at a very young age. From television, for the likes of DreamWorks, to animation for Disney, voice-over work, commercials and radio, as well as a number of professional stage productions across Canada, Avery\u2019s passion for performing grew. All the while, Avery kept honing her craft as a vocalist of rare talent, which has led to an impressive list of career-accomplishments on her musical resume.\n\nThat talent caught the ears of award-winning Canadian producer/songwriter/musician Greg Kavanagh, in 2017, and their eventual collaboration of work has led to outstanding original songs that not only were featured on \u2018My Heart Away\u2019, but also on her second solo album, \u2018Without A Little Rain\u2019. That album debuted on the iTunes Canada Top 200 RnB/Soul album chart at #31.\n\nBeyond acquiring media attention, Avery\u2019s music consistently receives glowing reviews and continued airplay across Canada, and into the United States, affording her opportunities to perform her music across North America. From New York to Newport to Toronto and beyond, including venues and renowned music festivals, Avery continues to wow audiences with her fresh style and powerful vocal performances.\n\nAvery is compassionate as well, volunteering her time to regularly perform at sports, government, and charity events, donating her talents. She\u2019s even sung the anthem in front of 43,000 people at a Toronto Blue Jays Baseball game.\n\nOf course, she also has a passion for supporting causes close to her heart such as anti-bullying (going into schools talking and performing for students), and music education. To that extent, Heart of Indie Radio in the US, has named a scholarship in her honour. That scholarship, every year for the next 10 years, awards an individual in Canada, and one in the United States, with $500 USD towards their arts or music education.\n\nAvery continues to compose new music, challenging herself to appeal to multiple genres and audiences, and constantly performing and improving her craft. She also co-hosts an online radio show on heartofindieradio.com, talking about and playing music she loves from an era that still influences so many artists today.\n\nWhile constantly performing, and with new music always in production, especially with the support of successful artist-producers like Stonebridge and Greg Kavanagh, Avery is poised to be the breakout artist she is destined to become!", "otherInfo": "Join me this Saturday for another episode of Quarantini Cocktail Hour.

Her work is at once deeply personal and socially conscious, seriously funny and derisively tragic. Over five albums and a decade of recording, the Denver-born songwriter/guitarist/singer has tackled such topics as the death penalty, anorexia, shoplifting, reproduction, the French resistance movement, adolescence, and the Christian right. Did we mention love? Love found, love lost, love wished for and love taken away.\n\nWhile her songs cover a huge amount of ground, they all have benefit greatly from Jill's subtle intelligence and skillful light-handedness. No sloganeering flag-and-fist waving here, but rather story songs about human beings, real and imagined, which allow us to step back from the issue, be it personal or social, and relate to it as we would a close friend.\n\nTo see Jill live and in concert is a rare treat. It is on stage that she is most comfortable, most powerful, and where the delicacy and range of her work can be best appreciated. She entertains, amuses, provokes, and more often then not, takes her audiences on an emotional roller coaster, from comedy to pathos in a few bars of music.\n\nJill began playing guitar when she joined the Junior High School band. She never learned to read music, though, and faked her way through rehearsals and performances by playing by ear. As she began writing songs, it was very clear to Jill this was becoming more than a teenage hobby. Music was serious stuff. She played in a variety of funk and rock bands in Colorado, and eventually made her first, Todd Rundgren-produced, album for MCA, Things Here Are Different.\n\nBut success did not knock on her door until three years later, when Atlantic Records released her MTV staple and national top 20 hit, I Kissed A Girl. \"That song was a double-edged sword for me,\" Jill Says. \"It was perceived as a novelty hit, but on the other hand it was the first song with an overtly gay topic to be aired on Top 40 radio. I am quite proud of that.\" The self-titled album also yielded another hit song, Supermodel, included in the Clueless soundtrack.\n\nThe song also jumpstarted her live music career in a big way, and since then she's had the honor to induct Neil Diamond in the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, to share the stage with the likes of Neil Young (at his yearly Bridge School benefit concerts), fellow activists Billy Bragg & Steve Earle, and Waren Zevon. Quite the serious guitar player, she even toured the world as lead guitarist in Lloyd Cole's band a few years back.\n\nSince then, she has made four more critically acclaimed albums, Happy Town, Pink Pearl, Underdog Victorious, and 2009's California Years, which Jill released on her own record label, Pinko Records, after collecting over $85,000 from fans who funded the project.\n\nA veritable gypsy, Jill divides her time between a busy touring schedule and a variety of other projects. She has played the role of political troubadour for NPR stations across the country and for Air America Radio. She also served as songwriter/composer for the hit Nickelodeon network show Unfabulous during that show's three-season run. She composed the music for the off-Broadway show Prozak and the Platypus and co-starred in the Eric Schaeffer film Mind the Gap.\n\nIn the words of New York Times pop music critic Jon Pareles, \"Jill Sobule can claim her place among the stellar New York singer-songwriters of the last decade.

The music achieved critical acclaim and airplay across the country and into the US and even Europe. The first single from that album, \u2018Come Right Back To You\u2019 debuted on the iTunes Canada Top 200 RnB/Soul song chart at #23, while the album itself debuted at #11 on the Canadian iTunes Top 200 RnB/Soul chart.\n\nThe success of \u2018My Heart Away\u2019 led to the interest and attention of one of House music\u2019s hardest working artists from Sweden, StoneBridge. The Grammy award-nominated artist, Producer, and DJ has shared his talent on Billboard #1 hits for major artists like Ariana Grande, P!nk, Haley Joelle, Nelly Furtado & many others. One particular song from Avery\u2019s album, \u2018Pieces\u2019, captured the dynamic producer\u2019s imagination and \u2018Pieces \u2013 The Remixes\u2019, released in January 2020, with its already infectious melody and catchy hook, is being played in dance clubs and on dance radio all around the world. In fact, the song debuted on the Billboard Dance Club Song Chart at 50* and has quickly moved within the top 40, widening the appeal of this independent Canadian artist.\n\nThat achievement is merely one of many successes from this teenaged Contemporary Soul/Pop phenomenon. In fact, Canadian, recording artist Avery Raquel, started in the entertainment industry at a very young age. From television, for the likes of DreamWorks, to animation for Disney, voice-over work, commercials and radio, as well as a number of professional stage productions across Canada, Avery\u2019s passion for performing grew. All the while, Avery kept honing her craft as a vocalist of rare talent, which has led to an impressive list of career-accomplishments on her musical resume.\n\nThat talent caught the ears of award-winning Canadian producer/songwriter/musician Greg Kavanagh, in 2017, and their eventual collaboration of work has led to outstanding original songs that not only were featured on \u2018My Heart Away\u2019, but also on her second solo album, \u2018Without A Little Rain\u2019. That album debuted on the iTunes Canada Top 200 RnB/Soul album chart at #31.\n\nBeyond acquiring media attention, Avery\u2019s music consistently receives glowing reviews and continued airplay across Canada, and into the United States, affording her opportunities to perform her music across North America. From New York to Newport to Toronto and beyond, including venues and renowned music festivals, Avery continues to wow audiences with her fresh style and powerful vocal performances.\n\nAvery is compassionate as well, volunteering her time to regularly perform at sports, government, and charity events, donating her talents. She\u2019s even sung the anthem in front of 43,000 people at a Toronto Blue Jays Baseball game.\n\nOf course, she also has a passion for supporting causes close to her heart such as anti-bullying (going into schools talking and performing for students), and music education. To that extent, Heart of Indie Radio in the US, has named a scholarship in her honour. That scholarship, every year for the next 10 years, awards an individual in Canada, and one in the United States, with $500 USD towards their arts or music education.\n\nAvery continues to compose new music, challenging herself to appeal to multiple genres and audiences, and constantly performing and improving her craft. She also co-hosts an online radio show on heartofindieradio.com, talking about and playing music she loves from an era that still influences so many artists today.\n\nWhile constantly performing, and with new music always in production, especially with the support of successful artist-producers like Stonebridge and Greg Kavanagh, Avery is poised to be the breakout artist she is destined to become!", "otherInfo": "Join me this Saturday for another episode of Quarantini Cocktail Hour.

From The Wreckage glowed with a rootsy golden tone that encompassed everything from indie-folk, to alt-country to blues-rock to Southern psychedelia. Its creators, touring musician turned songwriter and producer Dwight Baker and singer-songwriter Patty Lynn, began making music together on a lark, never dreaming anything would come of it. Baker describes it as \u201ckind of like what happens when two friends hold hands and jump in a freezing lake just to see what it feels like.\u201d Thanks to the undeniable chemistry between the pair, the music took on a life of its own and The Wind and The Wave soon found themselves with a major-label record deal, embarking on U.S. headlining tours, having their songs appear in such TV shows as Grey\u2019s Anatomy, and racking up millions of plays on Spotify and Apple Music. The band also earned itself a rabid following, with fans especially enamored of Lynn\u2019s feisty vocals and brutally personal lyrics about challenging relationships with lovers and family members as well as her relationship with herself. \u201cPeople really treasure that album,\u201d Baker says. \u201cWe got tons of letters from people saying it saved their life. They\u2019re people who are conflicted and searching and they connect with Patty\u2019s lyrics more than anything.\u201d\n\nWhen it came time for The Wind and The Wave to make their second album, Baker says he and Lynn felt \u201csome bit of an obligation to deliver that again.\u201d The band definitely delivered on their sophomore album, Happiness Is Not A Place, and the result is the sound of a band that has stretched itself and grown. Lynn managed to dig a little deeper with her lyrics, exploring her difficult feelings on commitment, and family, while acknowledging her own frantic mind. And the band\u2019s sonic palette is nervier, thanks to the album being recorded live by producer Butch Walker. \u201cTo me, it sounds reckless with a rock and roll spirit and attitude, an \u2018I don\u2019t give a fuckedness,\u2019 if you will. I wanted it to make sense to our fans, but to feel like a step forward musically. And I think we accomplished that. It\u2019s really rough around the edges, and there\u2019s a lot of urgency and pent-up stuff that probably came from both Patty and my nervousness about making a record with an outside producer.\u201d\n\nAfter being dropped by two major labels, all expectations and second guesses went flying out the window. The band\u2019s third full length album, Human Beings Let You Down, was a record made in hotels and backstage dressing rooms across the US. \u201cGetting married was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d says Lynn, \u201cBut it also brought out a lot, good and bad, and therapy helped me work through it. That\u2019s what the song Neon Prayer Flags is all about.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotta tough to be Patty, or anyone in her life, because if something\u2019s amiss, she\u2019s going to write about it. And you\u2019re going to know it\u2019s about you, and you\u2019re going to feel weird about it,\u201d Baker says with a chuckle. \u201cEveryone\u2019s in the line of fire. Patty and I are two people who, while we strive to be joyful and positive, can be very much morose and negative, and that definitely comes out in the songs.\u201d\n\nThe band is currently working on their fourth album, and will embark on a series of acoustic mini tours in 2020, called The Feelings Club.", "otherInfo": "Hey friends and fam!

In the club he mixes up the likes of new stars Dusky and Huxley with the next level, underground gems he sources from labels and producers across the world, crafted with the kind of experience that only comes from two decades of DJing. The same fervent, crate-digging attitude he\u2019s always been known for can also be found on his radio show, where he champions new talent and obscure tracks he picks up on his travels, having first roadtested them in the booth.\n\nHis label, UNDR THE RADR, launched in 2014 with his own \u2018Dangerous Thoughts\u2019 track (under his S-Man guise), also saw the collaboration \u2018Drop The Needle\u2019 with Man Without A Clue & Kevin Knapp. The collaborations with Huxley (\u2018The Calling\u2019) and Tough Love (\u2018In The Name Of Love\u2019) followed suit, continuing the theme of exploring new ground that was shown with his \u2018Amour\u2019 single for Riva Starr\u2019s Snatch label.\n\nFrom a humble beginning in NYC to multi-year residencies in Ibiza; from digging in dusty crates to headlining festival main-stages around the world, Roger is truly a self-made man and and dance music star. The crafting of Roger Sanchez, the DJ, started in the late 80s in Corona, Queens, where as a young man he was enticed by the early roots of hip-hop sprouting all over New York. Attending parties by the Bronx River and other jams as a break-dancer and graffiti artist, Sanchez was introduced to DJ\u2019ing through friends, trying his hand in an organic environment where his creativity behind the decks flourished from a few singles into an ambitious catalogue of over two thousand original productions and remixes.\n\nThese tracks have not always been under his own name, though. Roger has released music under a slew of monikers, including S-Man, Roger S., The Nu-Solution, Underground Solution, DV8, Ego Trip, El Mariachi, The Funkjunkeez, Tribal Infusion, Twilight, and Transatlantic Soul amongst others. Each new name has allowed him to push his music in unique yet blended directions, allowing him to carve parallel and weaving paths through the tastes of the times while enjoying opportunities to break out of the known.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s DJ\u2019d knows that you have to put in work, both to sharpen your skills and to find those unique cuts that no one else has. Early on, Roger became a dedicated crate digger, searching for obscure samples and break beats in influential NYC record stores like Rock & Soul and Vinylmania.\n\nFormerly a talented student of the arts who attended the Pratt Institute\u2019s School of Architecture, music culture grew to encompass Roger\u2019s life as he began to sell his own mixtapes on the sidewalks of Broadway in order to finance his earliest gigs. With encouragement from his father, an engineer, Roger put his thoughts about a career in architecture on hold and launched himself into music full-time. His first 12-inch, \u201cDreamworld\u201d, came out on the Outer Limits imprint in 1990 under the name Egotrip. It was around this time, that Sanchez began to take producing seriously as a compliment to his DJ\u2019ing. He soon released \u201cLuv Dancin\u201d for Gladys Pizarro on the iconic Strictly Rhythm records under the name Underground Solution, which led to his first tour.\n\nRoger hasn\u2019t stopped grinding since, using his decades of experience to build enticing remixes for a wide range of artists such as Michael Jackson, The Police, Diana Ross, Jamiroquai, Maroon 5 and even the So-Cal punk-pop outfit, No Doubt, for which he won a Grammy in 2003 for Best Remixed Recording with the song \u201cHella Good\u201d.\n\nAn early pioneer of podcasting, Roger was awarded the first-ever Best Podcast Award at the International Dance Music Awards in 2007. In addition to his bi-weekly podcast, he also hosts a weekly terrestrial and online radio show, which attracts over 10 million listeners across a worldwide audience. The Release Yourself Radio Show is broadcasted in 30 markets on every continent, including countries as diverse as Brazil, Russia, Mexico, the UK, Germany and Australia. In addition to broadcasting, he creates podcasts and mixes from the road, dominating a tour schedule that would exhaust even the most hardened of festival warriors. This man is on a mission to spread the musical word to every corner of the globe. In addition to his tireless touring, broadcasting and producing schedule, Roger has held prominent residencies on the island of Ibiza since the year 2000 at some of the biggest superclubs on The White Isle, including Pacha, Space and Amnesia; after taking a break in 2015 he\u2019ll return there in 2016. With a true international appeal, real fans look to house music leaders like Sanchez to keep music\u2019s honesty at the forefront of their vision. Furthermore, he has carefully assembled celebrated compilation albums under the Release Yourself title every year since 2002, showcasing his own work alongside tunes from both established and new talents.\n\nEver evolving on his hustle, always pushing himself, and others, to do better, the S-Man sums it up perfectly when he states: \u201cI\u2019m always moving forward, but never losing sight of where I\u2019ve been.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Walter Sickert & The Army of Broken Toys ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10388096.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Steamcrunk", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Boston-based phenomenon Walter Sickert & The Army of Broken Toys are dada darlings of the steampunk world, sharing music for anyone who has ever been broken (-NPR).

The Toys have successfully funded two Kickstarter campaigns, and produced a 40+ show run of their original 'steampunk musical for people who hate musicals,' \"28 Seeds\" a cautionary tale for our time writ by the band's resident playwright/mustache, Meff and produced by Liars and Believers. The play originated from the \"last radio show\" RPM '10 project.\n\nThe \u201crollicking, raunchy sideshow of jolly, wheezing menace and delight\u201d live experience of Walter Sickert & The Army of Broken Toys have taken the band across the US and beyond, playing such revered venues as the Hynes Convention Center for First Night for four years, The Boston Center for The Arts, Boston Symphony Hall, 930 Club in DC, Webster Hall in NYC, Royce Hall in LA, Mod Club in Toronto, the Stone Pony in NJ, and the Melkweg in Amsterdam etc. Their live antics have earned them a Boston Music Award nomination for Best Live Act and headlining spots at Steampunk World\u2019s Faire. They have garnered opening spots alongside international contemporaries the Tiger Lillies, Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys, The Humans (featuring Toyah Wilcox, Bill Rieflin and Chris Wong), The Dresden Dolls, Amanda Palmer (solo), Chester French, etc. at several venues.\n\nWith their newest album, Soft Time Traveler and tour plans in the US and Europe, there is so much more to come from the BRoken TOys!\n\n\n(((((((((THE PRESS MONSTER))))))))))))\n\n\u201cThrough it all, Walter Sickert anchors the performance pounding out strong melodies and baying these fierce, fuming lyrics and damn if it doesn\u2019t come off as revelry...

The songs started (mostly) as much of his early, unrecorded work from over a decade and a half ago, that were never properly released.

It was a bit of good luck.\u201d\n\nThese grainy, absorbing images play over the exhilarating whirl of \u201cDivebomber\u201d, a song inspired by the World War II film of the same name, and one of several on his new album that evoke a sensation of sharp ascent, of giddy height, the free-fall thrill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rush, if you fly fast enough. With a rush of blood, you can bet you forget everyone.\u201d\n\nFinn did not set out on his third solo album with a theme in mind. But by the time he came to call it after another track on the record, \u201cDizzy Heights\u201d, it had become inescapable. \u201cIt crept up on me. I started noticing it in lots of places.\n\n\u201cYou start off with a number of different threads and angles and demos, and they dictate the terms of the record. It\u2019s only in the course of the process that you maybe get a feeling there\u2019s a type of song emerging, or an atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe cloud jumpers epitomise, too, the Finn creative process: an attachment to a work-ethic and prosaic rigour - \u201ca willingness to be disciplined, punctual and focused\u201d \u2013 but designed for the arrival of something more, \u201cto capture the little flashes of complete happenstance or good fortune that come your way \u2013 often from a mistake\u201d.\n\nAn indirect inspiration for the height motif is mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1953, five years before Neil was born. \u201cHilary had a huge impact on my generation of New Zealanders,\u201d says Finn. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the New Zealand DNA about trying to scale impossible heights. It\u2019s something that can be very positive, but also has its downside.\u201d\n\nAmid its vertiginous, richly melodic swirl, Dizzy Heights contemplates love (\u201cBetter than TV\u201d), loss (\u201cFlying in the Face of Love\u201d), ageing (\u201cRecluse\u201d) and allure (\u201cLights of New York\u201d). It peeks, too - in \u201cIn My Blood\u201d, for example - into the abyss.\n\nNeil Finn was 18 when he was invited by his older brother Tim to join the trailblazing art rock band Split Enz. His career since might be measured as a series of bounds, the best-known being Crowded House, which he founded with Paul Hester and Nick Seymour after the breakup of Split Enz in 1984. Four albums, among them Crowded House and Together Alone, brought the group popular and critical acclaim around the world.\n\nAlong the way, there have been a host of collaborations, including with brother Tim and wife Sharon, and an array of names from Johnny Marr, Ed O\u2019Brien, Eddie Vedder and most of Wilco. There have been two solo records, Try Whistling This and One Nil (or One All). And yet Dizzy Heights unmistakably marks a fresh leap.\n\nWith wife Sharon (bass) and sons Liam (guitar) and Elroy (drums), Finn travelled in two bursts to producer Dave Fridmann\u2019s Tarbox Road studio in upstate New York, to record songs composed at his Auckland studio, Roundhead. With Fridmann (Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips), and in collaborations with young New Zealand musicians Connan Mockasin and SJD, Finn has assembled a textured, heady sound, furnished and elevated by woozy strings and soaring vocals.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it a solo record in a stripped back singer-songwriter sort of way,\u201d says Finn. \u201cI had a feeling Dave would be good at adding some odd shapes to the music. Which I always welcome \u2013 making things a little more expansive ... He is good at subverting things, and making things sound a bit messed up and not as obvious, rather than being too tasteful, which is always a temptation.\u201d\n\nFinn remembers an important English teacher, from four decades ago at his high school in Te Awamutu, a small rural town in New Zealand\u2019s north island. His name was Ron Martin, and he raced them through the School Certificate syllabus in a matter of weeks, to clear space for reading, writing, arguing, making films (\u201cHe [later] gave me a Super-8 movie I\u2019d made in his class, and I\u2019d done a kind of dramatised version of the song \u2018Aqualung\u2019 by Jethro Tull ... I was dressed as a tramp with an old coat\u201d).\n\nSays Finn: \u201cWe had a very spirited debate one day in class about whether having big aspirations, big dreams, was a good idea given it can ultimately lead to disillusionment and isolation and at worst bitterness. There was quite a lot of variance of opinion, and I definitely came out for the, yeah, you\u2019ve got to have the big dreams and big aspirations and it doesn\u2019t matter, what the hell.\n\n\u201cI think of that sometimes when ambition, or having big dreams, seems slightly shallow and vain. Because the motivations they shift \u2013 imperceptibly sometimes ...\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like those boys, jumping off that cliff. I keep thinking back to the one who runs to the edge and stops twice, before leaping off. Life carries on being like that.\u201d\n\n- TOBY MANHIRE", "otherInfo": "Neil Finn is back for more Fangradio live audio streams on Mixlr, Tuesdays and Saturdays at 3pm PT.\n\n\"Tuesday will be broadcast from my place, more or less solo.

Claude VonStroke's 'Who's Afraid of Detroit?' was one of the biggest tracks of 2006 and the label it came out on is Dirtybird Records, the Bay Area brainchild of VonStroke and DJ/producer Justin Martin. VonStroke and Martin have been injecting avarian squelch, funk and swagger into the tech house template for just over a year now, but while VonStroke was 2006's unofficial best newcomer, don't be surprised if Martin doesn't fly the coop soon too.\n\nIt might be a fresh sound, but Martin is not exactly a spring chicken. He's actually been releasing records since 2003 \u2013 his first single was 'The Sad Piano' issued on Ben Watt's London label Buzzin' Fly. Its simplicity and groove made it a favourite of DJs along the lines of Derrick Carter, Pete Tong and Mark Farina, while Charles Webster\u2019s classic remix of the cut even found favour with the Germans, popping up on Steve Bug's 'Bugnology'. Since then Martin has racked up two more twelves on Buzzin' Fly and a couple of jacking house tracks and remixes on labels such as Classic and Freerange. He also promises an artist album in 2007.\n\nWhile San Francisco might not thought be thought of as a dance hotbed, there's always been enough going on to turn the most curious heads onto the culture. The early drum n bass scene turned Martin away from jazz and hip hop and onto the rave culture of the nineties, a short sharp shock which inspired him to take up DJing and producing. But the truth is Martin had always been musical \u2013 as a child he studied the saxophone and classical piano, a musicality which shows in both his productions and DJ sets. \"Justin started playing the pots and pans at the age of 2,\" his MySpace puts it. \"Now he is a DJ.\"\n\nMartin's rise has been prominent enough to even make an older tradition of West Coast house take notice. He's also a new face on Om Records, home to big West Coast househeads such as Miguel Migs, Andy Caldwell and Fred Everything. Martin\u2019s remix of Iz & Diz's 'Magnificent' is pretty slamming, and the label has also chosen him to mix a volume in their latest compilation series 'Om: Winter Sessions', on which he spins tracks and remixes from Switch, Jesse Rose, and Phonique. Not exactly a typical Om sound, but it\u2019s nice to see San Francisco moving forward.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Wsabi Fox ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8694135.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Art Rock, Art Prog, Prog-rock", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "WSABI (Warped Sangot And Boss Interior) Fox is performative art-prog by Pinay Brooklyn-based artist, Jennae Santos.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mr. V ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10337244.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Electronic, House Music, Edm", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Experiencing Mr. V\u2019s DJ sets, original productions, or remixes is like taking a trip back in time to dance music\u2019s golden age.

Yet the common thread that runs through Craig\u2019s broad musical canon and creative projects is a resounding fascination with futurism. Carl Craig has cultivated a unique path as an artist, entrepreneur and civic leader, guided by his tendency toward forward\nthinking.\n\nCraig released his first track in 1989. One of his earliest mentors and first collaborator was Derrick May, whose imprint Craig also released some of his early music on.\n\nIn 1991, wanting pure artistic freedom, Craig set up his own label Planet-E and released \u20184 Jazz Funk Classics\u2019, under the moniker 69, as the label\u2019s first release. From here his wild exploration of sound intensified\u2026\n\nA Gemini true to form, with a mind that never sits still, Craig has released a diverse range of experimental and groundbreaking music under a plethora of aliases including 69, BFC, C2, Innerzone Orchestra (\u2018Bug in the Bassbin\u2019 was credited as the spark that inspired the evolution of drum\u2018n\u2019bass), No Boundaries, Psyche, Paperclip People, Tres Demented, Urban Tribe and many more. He has also produced albums for the legendary Detroit Jazz collective Tribe as well as orchestrator / pianist Francesco Tristano and French producer Agoria.\n\nLive he has collaborated with Les si\u00e8cles orchestra at Cit\u00e9 de la Musique in Paris. A meeting of techno and classical music, the concert was described as \u201chistorical\u201d, Craig went on to repeat the formula in Milan and Germany. He regularly performs live as experimental outfit Trio with Moritz Von Oswald and Francesco Tristano, sometimes as Narod Niki alongside Villalobos, Luciano, Richie Hawtin, Zip and others, and regularly does part live and part DJ with Luciano. Additionally he\u2019s\ntaken to occasionally bringing keyboardists like Mike Banks (UR), Amp Fiddler and Tristano into the DJ booth with him for special one-off gigs. He also improvised live to an Andy Warhol film at the Unsound Festival in New York. In 2011, Craig went live as 69 for the first time ever, fusing masks, darkness and the music of 69, Craig created 69\u2019s own entity and previewed the show to a few select festivals and clubs around the world.\n\nHis remixes discography boasts some of the most desirable names in music \u2013 LCD Soundsystem, Hot Chip, Junior Boys (nominated for a Grammy Award), Gavin Russom & Delia Gonzalez, Theo Parrish, Tori Amos, Can, Goldfrapp, Friendly Fires, Caribou, Tiga, Unkle, Yello and more.\n\nAs well as an outlet for his own productions, his Planet-E imprint has given a home to a wide range of Detroit-based artists including Francesco Mora Catlett, Naomi Daniel, Flexitone, Jason Hogans, Kenny Larkin, Monty Luke, Moodyman, Mike Agent X, Oliverwho Factory, Ezana Harris, Recloose, Reference, Kevin Saunderson, Big Tone, Tribe, Urban Tribe, and Chaz Vincent.\n\nStaying strong to his Detroit roots, where he still lives today, Craig helped launched the Detroit Electronic music Festival in 2000 and remains a strong force at the festival today. He has also created and launched his non-profit 501-C3 Carl Craig Foundation: \u201cThe concept is to find ways to re-educate kids about what\u2019s interesting musically that you can\u2019t get on the radio\u2026 To develop a new music scene that follows the legacy of Detroit music being diverse and interesting, to spot out the most talented young musicians coming out of high school and lend small financial grants to encourage music education at a higher level.\u201d\n\nWhen Craig explains his philosophy, his wry sense of humor seeps into his explanations of far-reaching concepts that merge worlds together. \u201cI have a very special career. When I feel that I\u2019m tired of going on the road I can go in the studio. When I\u2019m tired of concentrating on the studio I can go on the road. I can work with concert pianists, jazz musicians or rock guys. Very few people\nhave that range of interests.

In all he does so with restraint, whether on country tinged acoustic ballads (the excellent \"Amen\") or aching confession-drenched numbers\"[1] \"Battered Wooden Body\" was recorded in Oxford, Mississippi at Tweed Recording Studio and was engineered by Andrew Ratcliffe whose discography includes (The Black Crows, The Damnwells, American Aquarium)\n\nIn 2012, Shallow left A Few Good Liars and started writing and recording songs that would later be released as his first solo self-titled album, Travis Shallow, to regional critical acclaim in the southeastern United States.\n\nShallow went back to Tweed Recording Studio with Andrew Ratcliffe engineering to record his solo debut album. This solo album was acoustically driven with an accompanying band to highlight the songwriting and lyrical prowess. \"Shallow is a singer whose vocal personality is ultimately a category unto itself, like a Willie Nelson, an Otis Redding. He could sing anything and make it sound great, make it well worth listening to. His self-titled album has seven songs like that.\"[2] Shallow's solo album has a maturity to it that catapulted Shallow into being a weathered musician's musician.\n\nAfter the release of his self-titled album in March 2016, Shallow took the show to the people performing intimate shows, stripped down with him and an acoustic guitar. Shallow also landed himself some national opening spots after releasing his debut solo album with legend Gregg Allman from The Allman Brothers, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real (son of legend Willie Nelson), Jerry Joseph, Todd Snider, and fellow native North Carolina band, American Aquarium.\n\n\"One look at Travis Shallow and you could be deceived. Long hair, blue jeans, worn cowboy boots and sunglasses, toting a guitar case, it makes you think he\u2019s always wanted to be a musician, swagger and all.\"[3]\nShallow is now writing for and fronting a new line-up, Travis Shallow & The Deep End, with a studio album titled, The Great Divide, released on October 31, 2017. This 8-song album is a mix of Americana, soul, and rock and roll, recorded analog to two-inch tape at Overdub Lane in Durham, North Carolina with Jason Merritt engineering.\n\nThe Great Divide was featured in Relix Magazine upon release. \"Emerging from NC- Travis Shallow & The Deep End dive into The Great Divide with their eyes wide open.

Now, on their fourth studio album Crush, drummer Adam Deitch, guitarists Adam Smirnoff and Eric Krasno, bassist Erick \u201cJesus\u201d Coomes, keyboardist Neal Evans, saxophonist Ryan Zoidis, and trumpet players Eric Bloom and Rashawn Ross deepen that sound by channeling the sonic freedom and infectious energy oftheir incendiary live show.\n\nProduced by Lettuce and Co-Produced recorded/mixed by Joel Hamilton at Brooklyn\u2019s Studio G, Crush first came to life on the road, with the band developing new material and testing it out live as they toured. \u201cWe\u2019ve all noticed that our music goes into a lot of different directions onstage, and we wanted to capture that in a way that we never really have before,\u201d says Coomes, who names classic psychedelia and \u201890s hip-hop among Lettuce\u2019s key inspirations on\nCrush. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more wide-open in terms\nstyle, but it still stays true to the funk.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to 2012\u2019s Fly, Crush finds Lettuce brilliantly infusing their psychedelic and hip-hop sensibilities into bass-heavy funk. With its spidery guitar work and hypnotic beats, \u201cPhyllis\u201d is a delicately sprawling epic that embodies what Deitch refers to as \u201ca chill-hop vibe that\u2019s kind of the flip-side of all that powerful uptempo funk that people might expect from us.\u201d On \u201cGet Greasy,\u201d Lettuce give a nod to the\ngroove-fueled EDM subgenre known as future funk, building off its highly danceable rhythm with a blissfully loose and horn-laced arrangement. And on \u201cHe Made a Woman Out of Me,\u201d guest vocalist Alecia Chakour lends her bluesy growl to a scorching take on Bobbie Gentry\u2019s 1970 country-soul classic.\n\nWhether paying homage to Led Zeppelin on the fiery and guitar-driven \u201cSilverdome\u201d or delivering a deeply riveting and richly textured hip-hop medley with \u201cOresteia,\u201d Lettuce maneuver through Crush\u2019s kaleidoscopic sound with sophisticated ease and powerful synergy. \u201cMore so than any of the records we\u2019ve done before, this album is very much about the improvised grooves and improvised solos,\u201d says Krasno. \u201cInstead of going at it like, \u2018Here\u2019s a melody, now here\u2019s a guitar solo, here\u2019s another\nmelody, here\u2019s a sax solo,\u2019 everyone\u2019s leaning on each other in a way that\u2019s completely unspoken. It\u2019s all of us moving as one unit and creating this new sound together.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lettuce, that sense of unity and togetherness has much to do with a camaraderie that\u2019s only intensified over the lifespan of the band. Formed in 1992, when several band members attended a summer program at Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music as teenagers, Lettuce was founded on a shared love of legendary funk artists like Earth, Wind & Fire and Tower of Power. After returning to Berklee\nas undergrads in 1994, Lettuce started playing in local clubs and steadily built up a following that soon extended to cities across the country and then throughout the world. Releasing their studio debut Outta Here in 2002 and its follow-up album Rage!in 2009, the band dedicated the coming years to balancing their frequent touring with involvement in a host of other musical endeavors (including Evans and Krasno\u2019s role as founding members of acclaimed soul/jazz trio Soulive).\n\nIn recent years, Lettuce have watched their fanbase expand as they\u2019ve hit bigger and bigger stages and earned their name as a can\u2019t-miss festival act. And in making Crush, the band had no trouble harnessing the spirit of their explosive live show. \u201cSome of these shows we\u2019ve played over the past couple years have been so amazing, it\u2019s like you go home a different person,\u201d says Coomes. \u201cI\u2019m sure\nremembering those moments in our minds and our hearts helped bring out something special when we were recording these new songs.\u201d\n\nSo while Crush offers everything from all-out party jams to headphone-ready journeys into space funk, each track was born from an unabashed joy and love of live performance. \u201cThat energy we get when it\u2019s prime time and we\u2019re about to go onstage and we\u2019re just excited beyond belief\u2014that all came out on this new album,\u201d says Deitch. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that the band is rising, and it\u2019s a really beautiful thing.", "otherInfo": "1/24/2020 Replay Livestream: https://nugs.tv/default.aspx"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dirtwire ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10066863.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "World Fusion, Blues-rock, Electronica", "Time": "10:22 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dirtwire sits on the front porch of Americana\u2019s future, conjuring up a whirlwind of sound using traditional instrumentation, world percussion, soundscapes, and electronic beats.
