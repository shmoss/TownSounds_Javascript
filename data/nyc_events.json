Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "RAC LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10335778.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Indie Dance, Electronic", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Grammy award winning recording artist based in Portland, OR.", "otherInfo": "I'll be hanging out playing music, talking to the chat, etc."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "eric pasley ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.instagram.com/officialcmhof"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Trixie Mattel ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9618289.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10350740.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Americana, Rock, Alt-country, Southwest Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "In 1999, Roger Clyne and PH Naffah found themselves at a career crossroads.\n\nTheir band, The Refreshments, that had found success on college and alternative rock radio as well as MTV and even late night TV, was no more. The deep pockets and far reaching influence of a major record label were gone. And for the first time in many years, the duo found themselves looking at the real possibility of having to get \u201cday jobs.\u201d\n\nInstead, Clyne and Naffah regrouped - both metaphorically and literally - and started down their own path of independence. In 2019, that trek finds Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers celebrating 20 years of chart topping albums and sold out shows across the nation and around the globe. That\u2019s in addition to the band\u2019s annual four-day music festival in Mexico also celebrating its 20th year, and Roger\u2019s own award-winning, ultra-premium top-shelf tequila called Mexican Moonshine. All with 20 years of independence.\n\nIn 1999, singer/songwriter Clyne and drummer Naffah began assembling what wold become RCPM\u2019s debut album, Honky Tonk Union. In the beginning, it was just a couple of musicians with a story to tell. But the duo didn\u2019t want to wait around for another label to judge their music or tell them to \u201cdumb it down\u201d or dismiss them because \u201cwe just aren\u2019t sure what genre you fit in.\u201d Roger and PH simply wanted to keep delivering the music straight to the fans. Out on their own, the road was daunting and passed through what seemed like every small, dark club across the country. But the music of Honky Tonk Union found the people who understood that great songs weren\u2019t only what was being played on the radio.\n\nWith every tour stop the crowds grew a bit bigger, the buzz a little louder. More importantly, the relentless support of the fans enabled Honky Tonk Union to debut at #1 on Billboard\u2019s Internet Sales Chart \u2013 something even The Refreshments never obtained. The success had Billboard executives calling Clyne in bewilderment asking, \u201cWho ARE you guys?!\u201d Honky Tonk Union hollered at \u201cthe industry\u201d that a band could make music on its own terms \u2013 and still matter.\n\nFrom the opening riffs of \u201cBeautiful Disaster\u201d with its nod to Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn to Run,\u201d to the band\u2019s signature song, \u201cGreen & Dumb,\u201d Honky Tonk Union is bound in the tradition of story songs that one can immediately identify with. Rather than a big city recording studio, Clyne & Naffah found inspiration in the high-plains grasslands at the Clyne ranch owned by his grandmother, in Southeastern Arizona.\n\n\u201cGreen & Dumb\u201d was written on the day that one of the Clyne\u2019s top cattle-cuttin\u2019 horses broke his leg and had to be put down. As the tequila was passed around probably too many times, a surly Roger was rebuked from the dinner table to wander around the barnyard looking into the little adobe house through the window, ultimately spurring the story. He nostalgically remembers it as \u201dWrite drunk, edit sober. I followed half this advice while composing this song, aching and pining. Why am I always looking in? Why is there always a window in the way? Why is it when the moment passes, I know the right thing to say?\u201d\n\nAfter Honky Tonk Union, the band\u2019s success only grew.\n\nTheir second album, Sonoran Hope and Madness, debuted at #3 on Billboard\u2019s Internet Sales Charts. Their third album, \u00a1Americano!, found RCPM again reaching #1 on Billboard\u2019s Internet Sales Chart. In fact, since the release of Honky Tonk Union, Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers are the only act to release eight consecutive studio albums landing on the top 10 of Billboard\u2019s Internet Sales Chart. And all on a 100% independent label, EmmaJava Records.\n\nDubbed the \u201cSpringsteen of the Southwest\u201d by the Asbury Park Press, Clyne and his guitar have toured around the world, his career now nearly reaching a quarter-century, starting with The Refreshments. The seminal Tempe, Arizona band made big waves in the \u201990s with the songs \u201cBanditos\u201d (and its infamous chorus, \u201cEverybody knows that the world is full of stupid people\u201d) and \u201cDown Together\u201d as well as writing the theme for TV\u2019s \u201cKing of the Hill.\u201d\n\nToday, Clyne and Naffah, along with bassist Nick Scropos and lead guitarist Jim Dalton, keep the songs of The Refreshments alive, while adding to their own ever growing musical legacy. The band\u2019s annual music festival in Rocky Point, Mexico, called Circus Mexicus, is a testament to their loyal fan base. What began as a rooftop show thrown together with extension cords and wooden pallets 20 years ago has blossomed into a pilgrimage that draws thousands of fans to the once sleepy fishing village. On June 6-9th 2019, Circus Mexicus celebrates 20 years with fellow Americana bands, American Aquarium, Miles Nielsen & The Rusted Hearts as well as self-described psychedelic garage folk artist Drew Hagar (son of Sammy) and a dozen more filling multiple stages in the little beach town of Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, MX.\n\nClyne not only sings about life in the border-lands, he also produces his own private label top shelf tequila called Mexican Moonshine. From gold medals in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition to gold ribbons from Tequila Aficionado\u2019s Brands of Promise, accolades have been rolling in. A bottle of Mexican Moonshine Tequila even made a well received \u201cguest appearance\u201d on the Rachel Ray Show.\n\nAnd it all started with the road to independence 20 years ago.\n\nTo celebrate this milestone, a double record of Honky Tonk Union and its live counterpart, Real to Reel, will be pressed in green and orange vinyl. A digital download companion with previously unreleased material from the Real to Reel live recordings will be included along with some stories and never before seen photos from the early days of Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers.\n\nIn the spirit of the band\u2019s support of environmental conservation, this double-album will be packaged in a gatefold jacket using 100% recycled paperboard, and will be released the week of Earth Day.\n\nRoger Clyne & The Peacemakers are still blistering through every corner of the U.S. with hundreds of tour dates annually and incendiary performances that last hours. The revolution that Honky Tonk Union sparked endures. Their independence endures.", "otherInfo": "Tickets on sale now\" https://rogerclyneandthepeacemakerslive.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "JoJo Scott ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10365031.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "JoJo Scott\u2019s smooth sound and 70\u2019s persona stands out amongst the crowd.

The two were also romantically involved.

On his full-length solo effort Florida, however, his sound is closer to sample-based cinematic instrumental hip hop, not unlike the work of DJ Shadow.\n\nBorn in Mississippi and raised across the southern United States, Diplo picked up much of the local culture while growing up there.

Sinclar started DJing in 1986, when he was just 18 years old, specializing in funk and hip-hop music, with the name Chris The French Kiss. His first club hit was Gym & Tonic, a track produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, featuring vocals illegally taken from a Jane Fonda fitness tape. The Bob Sinclar persona was based on a character from Philippe de Broca's film Le Magnifique.\n\nSinclar is famous for popularizing the \"french touch\" of house music, with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. His track \"Feel for You\", a tribute to french musician Cerrone, from his second album Champs Elys\u00e9es, hit #9 in the UK Top 40. On track \"Darlin'\", he worked with vocalist James \"D-Train\" Williams.\n\nSinclar has also worked under other pseudonyms. Under the aliases The Mighty Bop and Reminiscence Quartet, he has dabbled in hip-hop and acid jazz. He also created the Africanism project, where an ensemble of artists produce house music with a combination of latin, jazz, african and tribal flavors. In 2005 he scored a hit with his single \"Love Generation\", that reached #1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts and the German Media Control Single Charts in 2006. The song was a huge success throughout Europe, also peaking at no. 2 in the Dutch Top 40. The followup hit was \"World, Hold On\", that features Steve Edwards and also managed to chart in the top ten in most of the European countries. \"Rock this Party (Everybody Dance Now)\" followed on August 22, 2006.\n\nThe remix of \"World, Hold on\" by E-Smoove is nominated for a Grammy 2007 in the category \"Remixed Recording\". Also, \"World Hold on\" was chosen by Billboard Magazine as the number one Hot Dance Club Play Single of 2006, beating Madonna and Christina Aguilera.\n\nThe fourth single of the album 'Western Dream' called 'Tennessee' was supposed to be released in April 2007, but has been cancelled due to the rumour of a new album being released.\n\nThis album is Soundz Of Freedom. It came out in France on May 21st. It has not yet come out in the United States.\n\nTaken from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Sinclar)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Katie Grace Harris ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9081910.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Acoustic, British, Folk", "Time": "12:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Katie Grace Harris had her debut performance at an early age singing in a rusty Triumph Toledo accompanied only by her Dad.

Sinclar started DJing in 1986, when he was just 18 years old, specializing in funk and hip-hop music, with the name Chris The French Kiss. His first club hit was Gym & Tonic, a track produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, featuring vocals illegally taken from a Jane Fonda fitness tape. The Bob Sinclar persona was based on a character from Philippe de Broca's film Le Magnifique.\n\nSinclar is famous for popularizing the \"french touch\" of house music, with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. His track \"Feel for You\", a tribute to french musician Cerrone, from his second album Champs Elys\u00e9es, hit #9 in the UK Top 40. On track \"Darlin'\", he worked with vocalist James \"D-Train\" Williams.\n\nSinclar has also worked under other pseudonyms. Under the aliases The Mighty Bop and Reminiscence Quartet, he has dabbled in hip-hop and acid jazz. He also created the Africanism project, where an ensemble of artists produce house music with a combination of latin, jazz, african and tribal flavors. In 2005 he scored a hit with his single \"Love Generation\", that reached #1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts and the German Media Control Single Charts in 2006. The song was a huge success throughout Europe, also peaking at no. 2 in the Dutch Top 40. The followup hit was \"World, Hold On\", that features Steve Edwards and also managed to chart in the top ten in most of the European countries. \"Rock this Party (Everybody Dance Now)\" followed on August 22, 2006.\n\nThe remix of \"World, Hold on\" by E-Smoove is nominated for a Grammy 2007 in the category \"Remixed Recording\". Also, \"World Hold on\" was chosen by Billboard Magazine as the number one Hot Dance Club Play Single of 2006, beating Madonna and Christina Aguilera.\n\nThe fourth single of the album 'Western Dream' called 'Tennessee' was supposed to be released in April 2007, but has been cancelled due to the rumour of a new album being released.\n\nThis album is Soundz Of Freedom. It came out in France on May 21st.

It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label.

His father would play everything from Glenn Miller to Alice Cooper, Jerry Jeff Walker to The Doors and ZZ Top while his grandfather\u2019s love of classic Hank Williams and Bob Wills tunes or his grandmother\u2019s voice all worked together to soundtrack Medulla\u2019s early life with color, style, soul and grit.\nWith such a variety of musical influences informing his work, Medulla is an artist rooted in tradition with a sound and style defying simple categorization.\nCutting his teeth in the musically fertile dust of Lubbock, Texas, Medulla began his music career after being urged on stage by friends at an open mic night. In those earliest days of artistic discovery, Medulla stuck to what he knew firsthand, but as is the case with great artists, his music has evolved with the times and as what his real life has looked like from one year to the next.\n\u201cWhen I first started gigging, I was partying hard, trying to cowboy, and living in honky-tonks at least 5 days out of the week.\u201d he says about his beginnings. \u201cIt seems like all of my songs at that time were a direct reflection of a crazy lifestyle I loved. But environments change. The older you get, the more losses you have, the more life you start experiencing, the more love you see. When you grow a family, you start seeing life in a whole new light. It wasn\u2019t until I had kids that I realized I really have no clue about anything.\u201d\nAfter plugging away in Lubbock and eventually landing in Dallas, Medulla found himself sharing the same stage with many of the iconic artists he\u2019d grown up listening to, including Jerry Jeff Walker, Merle Haggard, Leon Russel, Kris Kristofferson, Dwight Yoakam and Robert Earl Keen. Along with making his name known on the stage, Medulla began to grow in the studio as well. His 2004 debut LP, From Heartaches to Hangovers, and the 2009 follow-up, This Time Ago, produced by revered songwriter/producer Walt Wilkins, were filled with his own unique methods and imagination, but it was Medulla\u2019s next album that truly gave him a chance to do what he does best\u2014something different.\n\u201cIt can be a scary thing to be unique, to stand out,\u201d Medulla admits. \u201cSo when you work up the courage to do something different, especially in public, you can\u2019t just do it once. \u201cThe real question is can you stay unique, can you stay truthful with yourself and completely believe that regardless what happens, it\u2019s all worthwhile.\u201d\nMuch of the material from Medulla\u2019s earliest days featured inventive uses of fiddle, mandolin and steel guitar, but Medulla\u2019s 2012 album Speak Easy introduced a new sonic phase to his catalog that was both unpredictable yet sleek and accessible. One of the singles from that record, \u201cStay the Night,\u201d reached the Top 10 on the Texas Regional Radio Chart, as has several of his other singles, including a cover of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m On Fire.\u201d Speak Easy also featured \u201cHow Bad,\u201d a sultry duet with award-winning Americana artist Lindi Ortega.\nIn 2013, Medulla\u2019s music caught the legendary ear of one of music\u2019s all-time great managers and producers, Bill Ham. Responsible for helping Hall of Fame artists ZZ Top and Clint Black find their signature sounds and global audiences, Ham believed in Medulla\u2019s \u201cinnovative sound\u201d enough to work together on not only recording some new songs, but to become a mentor more than a mere industry acquaintance. Ham encouraged Medulla to not only set high professional expectations for himself, but worked with him to exceed those lofty goals. In 2015, before Ham\u2019s sad, sudden passing in 2016, the so-called \u201cFourth member of ZZ Top,\u201d helped produce an industry showcase performance for Medulla, where influencers from across the country had the chance to hear what Ham had been excitedly telling them all about for a couple of years.\nSome of the songs Medulla wrote under Ham\u2019s watchful eye ended up on his 2017 album Suits Me. That record featured another appearance from a country legend via the single \u201cUnbroken Horses,\u201d a song penned by legendary songwriter Dean Dillon (\u201cTennessee Whiskey\u201d). Smoky and atmospheric, the song provided Medulla with his first Number One radio hit. Unlike most of the time when a singer cuts a song from a well-known writer without crossing paths, Medulla and Dillon kept in touch in order for Medulla to gain Dillon\u2019s stamp of approval when the song was recorded.\nJust as was the case with Speak Easy, Suits Me is produced by respected music industry veterans Chuck Allen Floyd and Matt Nolen, and offers surprising instrumental combinations and arrangements, with the sorts of provocative lyrics not found in formulaic song craft. With his sights set on something daring for the video for \u201cWolf Howl\u201d Medulla enlisted the help of television art director Bryan \u201cWally\u201d Walior (Queen of the South). Walior enlisted the aid of an accomplished wardrobe stylist whose worked with pop adventurer Lady Gaga in order to achieve a theatrical, highly stylized set of visuals unlike anything pretty much anything else released that year, especially in Texas.\nWith an exciting, evolving style that has been called \u201cTexas roots in a pinstripe suit,\u201d Jerrod Medulla\u2019s multi-layered, textural music is steeped in tradition, and offered with a modern edge only he can provide in his signature way.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be the best me and honest me that I can,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019m a product of everything I\u2019ve lived through. I try to be the truest version of myself that I can be.\u201d", "otherInfo": "95.9 The Ranch is working on keeping live music going.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Charli XCX ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8363770.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Experimental, Other, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Shaka Loves You ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10004374.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Funk, Soul, Electronic, Disco, Hip Hop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cONES TO WATCH\u201d AND \u201cDANCEFLOOR-FRIENDLY PARTY ROCKERS\u201d ARE JUST TWO OF THE CREDITS AWARDED TO GLASGOW DUO SHAKA LOVES YOU.\nORIGINALLY HAILING FROM THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND, JAMIE & MARTY MET IN 2011 WHILE WORKING AS SKI & SNOWBOARD INSTRUCTORS.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Norman Brannon ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pete Yorn ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9402249.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Folk, Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Pete Yorn is an American singer, songwriter, and musician.

On the musician\u2019s second solo album, Devour, Hause scours the foundation of that crumbled dream in an attempt to discover how everything we believed growing up could have turned out so differently. The album, initially written to become the third record from Hause\u2019s rock band The Loved Ones, follows his 2011 solo debut Resolutions, a disc that allowed the musician to understand his potential as his own artist.\n\nAs Hause, a Philadelphia native, began penning new music for a new album from The Loved Ones, it became clear that the group, who had taken a break after their second album, had stalled. These songs, however, which showcased a clear thematic journey, were meant to be vocalized by Hause and over the past few years he transformed them into Devour. Hause solidified the album\u2019s sequence before even going into the studio, aiming to craft a narrative arc that drove the album from its dark, heavy first half into a lighter, more hopeful tone. A thematic line of melody runs through the songs, reflecting the overarching ideas in the music itself. The disc explores the heartbreak of shattered childhood promises of a better world and concludes with optimistic hope.\n\n\u201cDevour is about that inherent American appetite,\u201d Hause says. \u201cIt\u2019s in all the songs in some degree. There\u2019s a reason why Tony Soprano became such a huge American icon \u2013 he\u2019s this guy with this insane appetite for women and food and power. I think for the American public to latch onto a figure like that says something. Some of the positive things about America come from that as well, but there\u2019s a real sense of reckoning that comes from devouring everything in front of you. Is it ever enough?\u201d\n\nThe rock songs, tinged with folk and punk tones, are firmly rooted in Hause\u2019s own upbringing and the sensibility that comes from growing up in a blue collar neighborhood driven by the lingering anticipation of upward mobility. In the lyrics, the fulcrum around which the album revolves, Hause grapples with this working class ideal and the fact that America\u2019s recent shifts have caused it to no longer fit. From \u201cThe Great Depression,\u201d which centers on the unfulfilled promises laid out in the Reagan-era \u201880s, to the more specific-minded relationships of \u201cFather\u2019s Son,\u201d Devour comes to terms with the loss of youthful innocence in a rapidly evolving world.\n\n\u201cI wanted to shine a light back on what was going on,\u201d Hause says. \u201cIt was a topic that was close to me and I wanted to write about it. In the end, it leaves you with the idea that if you have music and love you may be able to save yourself. It\u2019s going to be alright. That simple John Lennon concept of all you need is love. That\u2019s how I wrote myself out of the dark and the music begs the listener to come take that risk as well.\u201d\n\nOnce Hause had the track sequence and overall narrative in place he enlisted producer Andrew Alekel along with musician and co-producer Mitchell Townsend. The producers helped Hause collect the right musicians to build the songs in the best way possible, including My Morning Jacket keyboardist Bo Koster, Social Distortion drummer David Hidalgo Jr. and bassist Bob Thomson. Frightened Rabbit\u2019s Scott Hutchison, Alkaline Trio\u2019s Matt Skiba and The Watson Twins also appear on several tracks. Hause and his crew recorded the album over several weeks from mid-February to mid-March at Grandmaster Recorders LTD. in Hollywood, CA, focusing on giving each song the right tone while maintaining an overall musical aesthetic that helps tie the lyrical themes together.\n\n\u201cIt was this group effort,\u201d Hause says. \u201cA lot of trust went into letting Andrew and Mitch be the architects of the record. I trusted that we would get in there and they would know who was right for the music. They wanted to bring these people together in this great studio to get a record that was greater than the sum of its parts. I\u2019m glad I trusted them because it was great to work with everyone there.\u201d\n\nFor the musician, who has toured with Social Distortion, The Gaslight Anthem, Bouncing Souls and Chuck Ragan since launching his solo career, Devour is a cathartic release, both sonically and lyrically. Hause recently relocated to California and is committed to pursing the music he feels best reflects him individually. The journey on the album, the search for the light at the end of the tunnel, mirrors his own trek. The record closes with the delicate introspection of \u201cBenediction,\u201d a song that pulls lyrical lines from all the tracks that precede it. After all the ruined promises and the culminating disappointments of the world, Hause ends the album with the sentiment of possibility. \u201cIt's love my friend in the end that can save us tonight,\u201d he sings. \u201cSo are you in?\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sonia Stein ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7179802.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "http://soniastein.com\nhttp://smarturl.it/SoniaSteinFB\nhttp://smarturl.it/SoniaSteinIn\nhttp://smarturl.it/SoniaSteinTw\nhttp://smarturl.it/SoniaSteinTu\nhttp://smarturl.it/SoniaSteinSc", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Stephanie Quayle ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9631287.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Biography\n\nAs a member of CMT's Next Women of Country, Stephanie Quayle is an undeniable force on the country music scene.\n\nThe Rebel Engine Entertainment recording artist is one of the most active female artists with a consistent presence on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, and ranks in the Top 10 of Current Female Airplay over the last two years (Mediabase).\n\nThe singer-songwriter is turning heads as an independent artist with repeat performances on the Grand Ole Opry and historic Ryman Auditorium stages, along with hosting for Wrangler Network on the ACM Awards red carpet, as well as hosting for Sounds Like Nashville on the CMT Awards and CMA Awards red carpets.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Entry is a choose-your-own-donation basis between $1-100.

Over the past year, the L.A.-based artist continued to captivate with her sophomore effort Hiding Place: a passion project whose R&B-tinged take on classic gospel won Best Gospel Album at the 2019 Grammy Awards (with the chart-topping single \u201cNever Alone\u201d taking the Best Gospel Performance/Song prize). And though Hiding Place marks a stylistic departure from Kelly\u2019s work in the pop world, each song shows the steadfast commitment to uncompromising artistry that carries through all her music.\n\nTo kick off 2019, Kelly is offering up a soulful new single called \u201cChange Your Mind.\u201d A pleading confession of an undeniable love, \u201cChange Your Mind\u201d finds Kelly\u2019s voice shifting from tender to soaring to thrillingly gritty, each line delivered with pure, unbridled emotion. It\u2019s exactly that blend of raw feeling and elegant vocal command that made Kelly a 2016 Grammy Award nominee for Best New Artist, and saw her recognized as a breakthrough artist at Billboard\u2019s 2015 Women in Music ceremony.\n\nProduced by 12-time Grammy Award-winning gospel artist Kirk Franklin, Hiding Place debuted at No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Top Gospel Albums chart, amassing more first-week streams than any other gospel album in history. With \u201cNever Alone\u201d shooting to No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot Gospel Songs chart in early January, Kelly is now following her fall 2018 Hiding Place tour with The Acoustic Sessions\u2014a 26-date North American run featuring stripped-back renditions of treasured songs throughout her catalog.

'Deleter' is the new track from Grouplove and it is an emergency opener. It's fueled by pounding keys, squalling guitar lines, and lightning drumming before the voice of Christian Zucconi questions everything around him: faith systems, his sense of belonging, communities, his own psyche. \u201cAll this time I thought you were a leader/It turns out you're only a deleter.\u201dIt could be interpreted as a political statement, but it's also highly personal. \u201cAll this time been burning with a fever / It turns out I've always been my healer,\u201dis also switched in as a rhyming line, and in the end sees Zucconi and his collaborator, wife and frontwoman Hannah Hooper realizing that amid every progression and every regression you always come back to yourself for the answers. They're already within you.\n\nToday in a cafe in their LA neighborhood of Silver Lake,the pair sit down as two people who have experienced and borne witness to a great deal of change, trauma and growth in the past three years. You may associate the band as a beacon for positivity and optimism. They're still a five-piece \u2013albeit with a new drummer in Ben Homola \u2013and at their core, remain a vessel for looking at the glass half full. Hence their opening sentiment: a rallying cry for tearing down false idols and building anew.\n\nAfter the band completed touring their 2016 album Big Mess, it all got tumultuous. Back in LA, Hannah had committed to taking some personal time to pursue an art show of her paintings. Just before theshow and before the band started writing again, they lost a dear friend. As Hannah painted,she felt connected to him, and was consumed by thoughts of death and the afterlife. All the while the left side of her body had started to feel out of her possession. \u201cIt felt like I was having a slow stroke,\u201d she recalls. She got an MRI to be safe. The day she finished painting the show, the results came through. The news was bad \u2013she needed brain surgery. \u201cWhat the fuck?! I just went white.\u201d\n\nWith Hannah's shocking news and the world outside feeling like it was in constant crisis, making music became the greatest remedy for the band and they started to write. They wrote more than they've ever written. Decamping to Northern California they worked in a way they never had before, experiencing a collective catharsis.\n\nThey made very aggressive grunge. \u201cIt felt good to scream,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cWe write music as a way to deal with good times or bad.\u201d The shows, the songsandthe writing took Hannah out of a state of constant freak-out. It didn\u2019t only help heal Hannah, but also helped heal Christian, who wasn't just a Buddha-like figure for Hannah and their young daughter but,was helping keep the band in productive spirits too.\n\nIn October 2018, the band \u2013 including Homola, guitarist Andrew Wessen and bassist Daniel Gleason \u2013 traveled to El Paso, Texas with esteemed producer Dave Sitek [of TV On The Radio] for a month. This was a shift for the band, who had previously worked almost entirely in house with founding member and former drummer/producer Ryan Rabin. Rabin left amicably prior to the band beginning work on this album. Sitek had heard 'Deleter' and loved it but he wanted to work with the band to veer away from their previous grunge-leanings. He wanted to take them outside the box and stretch them beyond what they had ever had to deal with. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cIt's like playing a sport with a new teammate. We just became better.\u201d\n\nWorking in Texas was a headtrip. \u201cWe had never recorded in a place where time did not exist, because it doesn\u2019t exist at Sonic Ranch if you don\u2019t want it to. We watched the sun rise every singleday, I had lost the concept of time,\u201d Andrewadds. Ben felt the same and helped set the scene in Texas: \u201cWe never missed a sunrise, listening back with the studio doors wide open, sitting around a tired fire surrounded by miles and miles of pecan trees. Hannah and I laughed uncontrollably, couldn\u2019t even produce words, couldn\u2019t stop crying -Were we happy or losing our minds? Haha I\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\nNot only did they learn new tricks, but Sitek encouraged them both to simplify their sound and to extend it. The songs they made during this period are so ambitious, that it pushed them to become a seven-piece band ontour. The limitations were gone. They were away from the world, immersed and unplugged in the middle of nowhere. They were also half a mile from the border and during the height of Trump's family separations crisis.\n\nBeing close to that inspired the song 'Promises.' \u201cNothing disappoints me like the news,\u201dsings Christian, taking into consideration his own experience as a father. \u201cYou're just following orders, closing your eyes and telling lies while they're taking our daughters.\u201d The track sounds like a paranoid futuristic Western.\n\n\u2018Youth\u2019 is an anthem reminding people never to forget their inner child. \u201cWhen we finished Youth a group of us drove to El Paso and went grocery shopping, bought fireworks, went to a guitar shop and stopped at a food stand. We had been up for 2 days. We looked insane, we felt insane & and it was insane. But I\u2019ll never forget how the song felt as we sped down the highway, Dave driving 150 mph, all of us just crammed in. I can literally picture it perfectly because I was so fucking proud of the song and couldn\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t exist 1/2 day before,\u201d Andrew recalls.\n\nSongs like \u2018Expectations\u2019 and \u2018Places\u2019speak to the more internal and personal friction many of us feel these days. \u2018Places\u2019line, \u201cthere\u2019s a place we\u2019re all running from, and we don\u2019t know how to get there,\u201d is Christian examining his experience in a constantly evolving world.\n\nWhen the band got back to LA, they got in the studio with a second producer \u2013Malay, famed for working with Frank Ocean and Lorde. They found themselves more prolific than ever, in an easier mode of creativity. Songs like \u2018Inside Out\u2019 were written and recorded in just a couple of days. Hannah remarks that the song reminds us that life is more beautiful the more honestlywe live it.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to collaborate with brilliant musical minds whose only agenda was to make honest and exciting music. It\u2019s what you hope for. Malay is the perfect example of someone who creates from his inner music fan,\u201d Dan recalls.\n\nHannah has always been the visual force for all of Grouplove\u2019s art, and in June 2019, she was given the opportunity to showcase her own paintings at the legendary artist Shepard Fairey\u2019s gallery. Now, post-surgery, she\u2019s still recovering. Butshe sees it as a gift; a way to connect with others.\n\nIt's been almost ten years since Grouplove met on a commune in Greece and brought the idea of themselves being a band back to California. They'd never have anticipated making it this far. Healer represents a re-birth and one that almost comes full circle to their initial idealism. \u201cWhen we all met in Greece, Christian and I were leaving New York at an all-time low. We just wanted to have a fun summer. We wanted to make art. And we're still doing that. We found that feeling again on this album, of hopelessness put into a medium of expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis album is us fighting for that feeling,\u201d says Hannah.\u201cThere's a darkness that's real and everyone deals with it at a certain point in their life. We\u2019re addressing that life is hard.We understand and we are going through it with you.\u201d\n\nGrouplove is: Hannah Hooper, Christian Zucconi, Andrew Wessen, Daniel Gleason, Benjamin Homola", "otherInfo": "Instagram Live & Chat"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Josh David ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10365744.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Country Blues, Country", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Josh David has performed across North America.

They were later joined by Tony to become Above & Beyond.\n\nAnjunabeats was formed when Jono Grant and Paavo Siljamaki met at Westminster University and discovered a mutual love of electronic music. The pair kicked off the label in 2000 with \u2018Anjunabeats Volume 1\u2019, a massive club success which instantly ear-pricked the likes of Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold and Paul van Dyk. The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label.

In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

And yet, until just two short years ago, McBean had lived his entire adolescence and adult life without a proper driver\u2019s license, that first and most coveted ticket to personal independence. When he did finally take the wheel in 2017, he essentially became a Sixteen Year Old for the first time, blowing out the doors off the DMV like a pyrotechnics display at a W.A.S.P. gig. Black Mountain\u2019s new album, Destroyer, named after the discontinued single-run 1985 Dodge Destroyer muscle car, is imbued with all that wild-ass freedom and newfound agency (and anxiety and fear) that comes with one's first time behind the wheel. McBean, welding mask pulled over his Alan Watts beard, has even been rebuilding a 1985 Destroyer in his step-dad\u2019s garage all spring \u2014 building it from its frame, putting in weekends of work to have this beast ready for sunnier days. And wouldn\u2019t you know it: when the Destoyer's engine gives its deep snarl and the stereo rattles with Metallica's $5.98 EP, McBean is fully in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nDestroyer is structured around that first time behind the wheel of a hot rod. The fat, charging \u201cLiving After Midnight\u201d riffs of opener \u201cFuture Shade\u201d is, according to McBean, \u201cStraight outta the gates. FM radio cranked.\u201d He ain\u2019t kidding. The song, and all of Destroyer for that matter, seems to exist at that crucial nexus of the early-to-mid 80s Los Angeles when a war between punk and hair metal was waged. Black Flag\u2019s My War tried and failed to keep the peace. But in the trenches, some hybrid ghoul was beginning to form in bands like Jane\u2019s Addiction and White Zombie. The heavy extended player \u201cHorns Arising,\u201d with its Night Rider vocals and golden, climbing Blade Runner synths, is a fill-up at a desert gas station just in time to see a UFO hovering near a mesa. . And other songs, like The serpentine \u201cBoogie Lover\u201d is a cruise down the Sunset Strip. You pull into The Rainbow Bar & Grill to take the edge off. Doesn\u2019t matter what year it is, Lemmy\u2019s there in flesh or spirit. To continue the teenage theme, there\u2019s also a sense of to these cuts \u2014 \u201cHigh Rise\u201d is a foray into Japanese psych, rounding the bend to a careening, youthful sense of discovery, while \u201cCloser to the Edge\u201d feeling like falling in love with Yes (Remember how good they were for a minute there in your youth?). \u201cLicensed to Drive\u201d would easily be the most exhilarating and dangerous ripper on a titular film\u2019s soundtrack, a dose of heavy right before the muscle car\u2019s wheels fly off going 100 mph on the freeway.\n\nShacked up in his rehearsal space, McBean found an old chair in an alley, spray painted Producer on the back and pressed record. Friends from the endless rock\u2019n\u2019roll highway were invited over and 22 songs were brought to life. And while some were laid back into shallow graves to dig up once again at a later date, the remaining skeletons were left above ground \u2014 given organs, skin, eyes, and the opportunity to grow their hair real long and greasy. Some of these zombie hesher jams were sent on a journey to Canada where longtime band member Jeremy Schmidt, slipping on the Official Collaborator satin jacket, had at them with his legendary synth arsenal. As he added long flowing robes, sunglasses, driving gloves and medallions, the undead songs began to transform into the new breathing creatures that make up Destroyer. Schmidt\u2019s work with these songs was the needed transformative glue for this new era of Black Mountain.\n\nComing off his newfound automotive freedom, McBean also saw some personnel shuffling within Black Mountain. Both Joshua Wells and Amber Webber have retired their Black Mountain Army uniforms while Arjan Miranda paid his outstanding membership dues and rejoined. New members include Rachel Fannan (Sleepy Sun) and Adam Bulgasem (Dommengang & Soft Kill) plus other familiar names like Kliph Scurlock (Flaming Lips), Kid Millions (Oneida), and John Congleton (St Vincent, Swans) take a turn in the shotgun seat.

Imbued with revitalized ambition and confidence, DEAR LIFE is Brendan Benson at his very best.\n\nBeginning with his now-classic 1996 major label debut, ONE MISSISSIPPI \u2013 recently reissued by Third Man in its first-ever vinyl pressing \u2013 and its masterful 2002 follow-up, LAPALCO, Benson has always infused classic craftsmanship with contemporary invention. Along with his own critically acclaimed canon, Benson is of course co-founder \u2013 with Jack White, Jack Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler \u2013 of The Raconteurs. The band first convened in 2006, winning worldwide acclaim, GRAMMY\u00ae Award nominations, and a chart-topping smash single in \u201cSteady As She Goes,\u201d with their now-classic debut album, BROKEN BOY SOLDIERS. The Raconteurs returned two short years later with 2008\u2019s CONSOLERS OF THE LONELY. Like its predecessor, the LP proved a popular and critical phenomenon, earning the GRAMMY\u00ae Award for \u201cBest Engineered Non-Classical Album\u201d as well as a nomination as \u201cBest Rock Album.\u201d\n\nDEAR LIFE came about gradually and organically after a self-imposed creative hiatus rooted in the happy arrival of his son and later, a daughter. Having spent the majority of his adult life on the road, Benson decided he\u2019d prefer to stay home for a change and just be a dad.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so enamored with my kids, I just sort of lost touch with my career. I just didn\u2019t want to go back to work.\u201d\n\nInstead, Benson directed his musical energies elsewhere and fast proved an in-demand producer/engineer (Robyn Hitchcock, Young The Giant, Trapper Schoepp, The Greenhornes) and collaborative songwriter, with a CV that includes partnerships with Jake Bugg, Iain Archer (Snow Patrol), and The Kooks\u2019 Luke Pritchard, among others. Despite his successes, after a few years in this voluntary wilderness, Benson surprised himself in 2017 by writing and recording the rocker \u201cHalf A Boy (And Half A Man).\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just felt really good,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like I was like born again. Seriously, it was almost a religious experience, like, oh my God, I love making music. I had forgotten. That\u2019s how it started. It was kind of a spark. A re-ignition.\u201d\n\nThough Benson wasn\u2019t \u201cconsciously making a record,\u201d the songs kept coming. Rather than overthink every move, he simply let go. He got stoned in his studio and worked on music simply because it made him happy.\n\n\u201cI started dreaming again,\u201d Benson says. \u201cGetting lost in the music and just letting it take me. Not being so serious, not thinking I was some sort of great writer or producer. I just enjoyed myself. I wasn\u2019t racking my brain on how to from one chord to the next. I wasn\u2019t trying to come up with the best lyrics ever. I was just having fun.\u201d\n\nBenson worked with surprising intensity, most days skipping meals until long after dark. Determined to keep moving forward, he opted to play virtually every instrument on his own. Though a skilled drummer in his own right, Benson began working with Pro Tools and an array of other drum programming software.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a self-taught only child,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go elsewhere for things. If I want drums, I think, OK, how do I create drums? Well, I\u2019ve got to play them or I\u2019ve got to program them. It\u2019s all happening really quickly. I don\u2019t have time to wait for some guy to come over and learn the song, all that crap.\u201d\n\nWorking with programming helped free Benson from his previous creative habits, opening up uncharted paths and new approaches towards making his music.\n\n\u201cI may never go back to playing the drums,\u201d Benson says. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true, but it is a lot of fun. It\u2019s a different discipline entirely. On the drum kit, you feel it out, see what feels good or whatever. But with software drums, you\u2019re constructing beats with your hands, with a mouse, and with a keyboard. It\u2019s really weird. So of course you do things that you wouldn\u2019t do on a drum kit. It\u2019s like, wow, I never would have played that beat. And then the options are limitless. Everything is right at your fingertips.\u201d\n\nUnrestrained by anything other than his own imagination, Benson drew less from genre and more from his own instincts, melding jangle and crunch, hook and riff, pomp and subtlety, into something original and his own. Sonic motivation came from a range of unexpected sources, spanning hip-hop icons like Vince Staples and Kendrick Lamar to the top 40 hits his kids played around the house.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always kind of battling cynicism,\u201d he adds, \u201cbeing a cynic about music. So listening to what my kids listen to, it helps me break down the barriers in myself. The kids put on Justin Bieber and my knee jerk reaction is to turn it off. But I don\u2019t. I\u2019m forced to listen in and by God, I start liking it. I find something good in it and then that maybe pops up in my music.\u201d\n\nWith the aesthetic doors blown open, Benson saw his songs grow more complex, multi-tiered, and rhapsodic. From the future funk-fueled \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d through \u201cGood To Be Alive\u201d and the madcap \u201cFreak Out,\u201d to the elegiac finale, \u201cWho\u2019s Gonna Love You,\u201d his long vaunted knack for pure pop craftsmanship is paired with a progressive, left-of-center dynamism unlike anything in his body of work.\n\nWhile tracks like \u201cDear Life\u201d and the ecstatic \u201cRichest Man Alive\u201d are undeniably animated and even joyful, Benson is quick to note that there\u2019s more going on than necessarily meets the ear. The buoyant melodies and irrepressible hooks are tinted with self-doubt and instinctive irony, their affirmative messages colored by encroaching middle age and the songwriter\u2019s own mortality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just singing about me,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI\u2019m almost 50 and it\u2019s freaking me out so that\u2019s kind of coming up in the songs.\u201d\n\nAfter almost two years, DEAR LIFE was finally approaching completion. Benson signed on with new management and began talking with labels, ready at last to return to the fray. And then Jack called.\n\n\u201cMy wife was like, OK, off you go,\u201d he says. \u201cSeriously, I was stoked. That band is fun. I get to be in a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band, that\u2019s my dream. And I get to share it all with a bunch of guys that I love and respect.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a decade, The Raconteurs finally returned to action in 2019 with their critically acclaimed, chart-topping third LP, HELP US STRANGER, highlighted in part by a couple of songs Benson had been kicking around for his own LP, \u201cOnly Child\u201d and \u201cSomedays (I Don\u2019t Feel Like Trying).\u201d The Raconteurs\u2019 epic 2019 world tour proved equally successful, playing to ecstatic sold-out houses from Nashville to New Zealand and all points in-between. Still buzzing with big rock energy, Benson returned home and recorded two more for DEAR LIFE: the short, sharp \u201cI\u2019m In Love\u201d and the persistent slacker anthem, \u201cI Quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Raconteurs helped me get off my ass and get back into the swing of things,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI got to exercise that muscle again. I came home really excited just to get back to my thing. Whereas before, I think I was a little overwhelmed. It\u2019s daunting to make a record and get a band together and tour an album. But now I\u2019m really ready. It\u2019s not so daunting.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Benson is currently considering how to bring DEAR LIFE to life. Having made a record he can take unabashed pride in, he is determined to continue defying expectations and resisting easy pigeonholes. DEAR LIFE marks a milestone on what has already been an atypical artistic journey as well as a bold signpost towards future triumphs, a showcase for Benson\u2019s matchless gifts for wry introspection, insightful wordplay, and powerhouse melody, once again affirming his place among the finest singer-songwriters of this or any era.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Downtown Boys ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7834450.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Dance, Electronic", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Americas booking: alisa@groundcontroltouring.com UK + Europe: matthew.cooper@13artists.com Press: press@subpop.com don't send us fb messages. http://twitter.com/#!/downtownboys http://downtownboys.bandcamp.com", "otherInfo": "Live on Instagram"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Melissa Etheridge ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10282232.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Country, Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Join the Official Melissa Etheridge Fan Club: https://melissaetheridge.com/store", "otherInfo": "#ConcertsFromHome"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nick Perri & The Underground Thieves ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10354315.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Americana, American Rock, Alternative, Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Nick Perri is an American guitarist, singer/songwriter, and producer.

If that's so, then you'd be hard pressed to find a more convincing example of innate talent and desire than Chuck Courtenay. Born in the fabled, swampy, Deep South coastal community of Savannah, Georgia, Chuck witnessed firsthand the mesmerizing spell live musicians can weave on an audience, as he grew up watching his father travel the country as a keyboard-playing frontman, living the hardscrabble life of a touring entertainer. \u201cSome of my very best memories are of the times I spent with my dad over summer vacations,\u201d he now recalls. \u201cI got to go to his gigs, and he'd get me up sometimes to sing Elvis Presley songs. Those were my earliest performances.\u201d Equally formative in young Chuck's musical education were the years spent as a child with his mother and stepfather on a cattle ranch in Central Florida. It was there that the future singer, guitarist and bandleader first became exposed to such Golden Age country and western greats as Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Vern Gosdin and Conway Twitty. These and other timeless artists would ultimately reveal themselves as Chuck's seminal musical influences. Their singles, albums and TV appearances (all of which he soaked up as a child) inform Chuck's own sense of what constitutes a good song, a great vocal and a killer arrangement. However, it was years before he even considered making a living as a musician. In fact, it was only after graduating high school that he even picked up the guitar -- yet, he took to it immediately, and quickly went from learning basic chords to entertaining friends and family to being the featured attraction at nightclubs and restaurants in the greater Savannah area. The day Chuck won the Jimmy Dean True Value Country Showdown, he knew the die was cast: his calling was to be a professional performer. Soon thereafter, he and his brother Jason --a gifted guitarist and singer in his own right-- formed an acoustic duo. Billing themselves as The Courtenay Brothers and boasting impressive \u201cbrother harmonies\u201d and a setlist of well-known cover tunes ranging from classic and modern country and western to '70s soft rock and pop hits, they became an in-demand act in Southeastern Georgia, and could be found gigging several times a week at all manner of venues -- from bars and eateries to outdoor festivals and private engagements. Almost immediately, the duo began racking up local awards. Being named Savannah's Best Country Act in a respected local newspaper poll three years in a row made a real impression on promoters, and that led to high profile opening slots for major modern day country and western stars and icons like Mark Chesnutt, Chely Wright, Blake Shelton, Joe Nichols, Craig Morgan and Lee Greenwood. But all the while, fate was slowly and methodically leading Chuck to a slightly different destination. \u201cBack then, I was juggling my artistic ambitions with a job selling newspaper advertising,\u201d he reflects. \u201cBut in the last five years, I've really made a push to make a name for myself with my music. I realized I had a lot of support and that people were really behind me, digging what I was doing. Now it's full speed ahead.\u201d Since that change of heart, Chuck's certainly put the hammer down on his music career. He quickly formed the popular, hard-rocking, electric group that bears his own name. Made up of veteran players with several decades of combined experience as professional musicians (touring and/or recording with several major country stars), The Chuck Courtenay Band has emerged as one of the tightest and most versatile outfits of its kind, and their lengthy, memorable shows at honky-tonks, country dance clubs, bars and festivals nationwide have cemented their position as one of the most promising acts on today's club circuit. They now play over two dozen shows a month (mostly one-nighters or two-night stands) in an ever-widening radius and travel in their own customized tour bus \u2013 just like the big boys. \"Being on the road so much is very hard and definitely takes a toll,\u201d Chuck admits. \u201cBut I have a very patient wife who really believes in me and what I am doing, so that makes it a little easier.\" The group's high-energy setlist straddles the line between classic country and twangy, roadhouse rock and roll -- an intentional blend that's a source of great pride for Chuck himself, who's no fan of the bland, overproduced pop which is far too often marketed as \u201ccountry music\u201d these days. \"I try and stay away from trendy, lightweight songs I think are gonna be here for a short time,\u201d he says candidly. However, holding fast to such stylistic boundaries can be a difficult task when playing for large crowds accustomed to hearing bar bands offer their own renditions of tunes from the top of that week's charts \u2013 as Chuck himself is quick to acknowledge. \u201cIt's really hard sometimes, because in addition to my own material, we still have to play a lot of covers at some of our smaller shows. Now, if it was up to me, I'd do a whole night of Billy Jo Shaver, Waylon, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson songs. But I want to work, and in these honky-tonks you gotta play some current material. Luckily, if you pick carefully, there's still a lot of good stuff to choose from! \u201cFor example, we do an early Rodney Crowell number called \u201cAin't Living Long Like This,\" and the crowd always loves it. Now, it's just a good ol' hard rockin' song, but we've got a steel guitar and a Telecaster, so we can come pretty darn close to Waylon Jennings' version. Stuff by Gary Allan goes over well, and just about anything from our buddy Billy Currington is always a surefire winner.\u201d Just don't expect Chuck to give up his principles or change his sound too much for the sake of fame. \u201cPeople keep trying to get me to change my sound to be more mainstream, but moving too far in that pop-country direction just doesn't fit me,\u201d he explains with a smile. \u201cListen, I enjoy a great pop song as much as the next guy. But, at the end of the day, I play and sing country music, you know what I mean?\u201d One thing about modern, radio-friendly country he is comfortable with is the top-notch recording quality found on today's major label albums \u2013 and that's something he's finally achieved on his own. Chuck's first CD release was expertly co-produced by his longtime pedal steel man Tommy Butler and tracked in Nashville with some of Music City's finer players. It was an impressive debut all around, and was released to positive reviews on a small, independent, Nashville label. Yet, as strong as that disc was, the difference between that record and GOOD SIDE OF THIS BAR (his brand-new four-song EP) is evident from the first note. Credit that \u201cmillion dollar shine\u201d to Dave McAfee, who for the past 13 years has played drums both on records and stages around the world for Toby Keith, and who co-produced and drummed on Jamey Johnson's massive hit album THAT LONESOME SONG (which was nominated for three Grammys and five American Country Music Awards, and which also contained the Song of The Year \u201cIn Color\u201d). McAfee was introduced to Chuck by established Nashville songwriter Rick Tiger (whose tunes have been recorded by everyone from Del McCoury and Montgomery Gentry to Gene Watson and Joe Nichols). Rick caught Chuck's solo show, felt he'd stumbled upon a major undiscovered talent and alerted McAfee. Dave liked what he saw in Chuck and took him under his wing, both producing and playing drums on GOOD SIDE OF THIS BAR, as well as bringing in a handful of his A-List Nashville musician buddies to help round out the studio band for these sessions. The result is a stunningly well-crafted collection of potential singles that easily rivals most anything you'll hear on Top 40 country radio today. Filled with instantly catchy tunes boasting instantly hummable melodies (such as a delightfully tongue-in-cheek ode to country music legend --and legendary ladies' man-- Conway Twitty, as well as the jangly, danceable love song \u201cFalling\u201d), world-class musical performances and the kind of polished, nuanced production flourishes only found on big-name albums by established stars, the fact that GOOD SIDE OF THIS BAR was made completely independently is somewhat astonishing. Yet it's not altogether surprising. Chuck's vocal prowess and dedication to the old-school values that made country music great the first time around have caught the attention of some of Nashville's best and brightest. The fact that he's come this far without the backing of a large record company --or even a manager-- speaks volumes for the loyal support he earns from his devoted fans. In this day and age, that connection to one's audience counts as much if not more than glitz and glamor -- which is why Music City heavyweights like Dave McAfee are now part of Chuck Courtenay's team. They see in him a sense of respect and reverence for the traditions of country music, and the talent and drive to bring those values of sincerity and substance back to the forefront. Those who have heard Chuck's new material are thrilled with its promise, and all involved hope these first four tracks will generate enough interest to allow the same team to head back in the studio and cut enough additional songs to fill an entire album. In the meantime, Chuck Courtenay will continue to do what he does best \u2013 play live shows whenever and wherever he can, either with his full electric band, or in a solo acoustic setting. \u201cAs of now it works out really well doing both types of gigs,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I'm performing solo it's totally different from my band shows. I can try out new material and play my favorite songs -- many of which I don't do with the band.\u201d He's also focusing increasingly on becoming a better songwriter himself. \u201cI'm writing more and more and want my next album to feature a lot of my own material. Life experiences make the most believable type of songs because they're all yours and they're based in truth! As a rule, I always try to pick and sing songs I know I can deliver sincerely.\" Chuck says the fact that he hails from a very unique and recognizable Southern city has only helped his career, and he's always proud to let folks know he's from Savannah, Georgia. \"Aw, man, they love that I'm from Savannah!\u201d he offers. \u201cThis is a very special town and people really like the charm associated with it. Of course they all ask if I know Paula Deen. (laughs) Which of course I do! I gave her my last CD and hopefully I may be able to write something for her show in the new year.\" And, despite the music business' longstanding infatuation with youth, Chuck refuses to view the fact that he's getting a slightly later start on his career than most aspiring artists as any sort of a hindrance. \u201cI know I have some ground to make up because, well, I'm not 24 anymore,\u201d he reflects with a grin. \u201cBut then again, country music fans are really loyal and will stand by an artist they like.\" \"A rising regional star with a top-notch backing band.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/682379228998614/?active_tab=about"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jane Kramer ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/682379228998614/?active_tab=about"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "When Particles Collide ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9454804.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 6 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-06", "Genre": "Female Fronted, 90s, Duo Rock, Indie, Indie Rock, Female Fronted Rock, Duo", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "2014 New Artist of the Year - Boston Music Awards\n\nSasha and Chris met in Bangor Maine during a 2010 local production of Hedwig and the Angry Inch.

His new single \u201cBeautiful Life\u201d is captivating audiences.\n\nWhile many artists spend a lifetime chasing \u201cinternational status,\u201d 24-year-old classically trained singer-songwriter-musician Sebastian Mikael is already starting his career where others can only hope to finish. Born in Sweden to a Swedish father and Ethiopian mother, Sebastian Mikael\u2014formerly known as De-Lor (which is French for \u201cof gold\u201d)\u2014was raised in a diverse household that was enriched by music. While no one in his family ever made music professionally, Sebastian Mikael inherited his passion for music from his father and the sounds he grew up listening to inspired him to find out what was going on behind the music.\n\nWhat started off as a childhood hobby soon snowballed into an adolescent obsession that led to him picking up the guitar and mimicking the sounds he heard on the radio. \u201cI became interested in knowing exactly what the musicians were doing and how they got their sounds,\u201d says Sebastian Mikael, who started off playing his favorite songs by Marvin Gaye, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Wyclef Jean, Akon and Usher.\n\nBefore long, Sebastian Mikael\u2019s newfound passion led him to clocking long hours at Swedish recording studios, singing hooks for rappers and teaming up with a local producer to form a production team. But while the duo\u2019s initial recordings generated a lot of online buzz, Sebastian Mikael was eager to strike out on his own. \u201cI saw the initial potential of the work we were doing,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t getting a shot at doing my own songs. Plus, they are not as open-minded about music in Sweden as they are in the U.S.\u201d\n\nFeeling a glass ceiling approaching in Sweden, Sebastian Mikael set his sights on America and enrolled at California\u2019s Musicians Institute to study audio engineering in 2008. After living in California for two years, he relocated to Boston in 2010 to attend Berklee College of Music. While a student at Berklee, Sebastian was signed by Slip-N-Slide Records CEO Ted Lucas and in late 2011 he released his first mixtape, J\u2019Adore, which received rave reviews from his steadily growing fan base. His breakthrough video single, \u201cBeautiful Life,\u201d in which he sings an inspirational message about appreciating life, captures the essence of Sebastian Mikael\u2019s music as a whole. \u201cMy lyrical content is not always about love, but what we go through and feel in life,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to put hope in my music\u2014stuff that makes you feel good musically and lyrically.\u201d\n\nNow in the studio working on his hotly anticipated forthcoming full-length debut album due out in 2013, Sebastian Mikael has been busy collaborating with some of the finest producers and songwriters in the business, including Jim Jonsin and Rico Love.\n\nWith just a handful of years experience as a musician, Sebastian Mikael is already skilled at meshing elements of rock, R&B, pop and electronic music into one cohesive package, held together by his unique acoustic guitar playing. \u201cI feel like my music truly has something to say,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen people hear my music, I want them to relate.

He developed interest in songwriting and, before long, was looking to put together a band and hosting try-outs for singers. It wasn't until friends told Adam that his voice didn't sound half-bad that he put any thought into singing.\n\n\n\nThroughout the years since, Adam's been involved in several projects - most notably his original band Black Magnolia. The band\u2019s debut album, \u201cFields Are Burning,\" was released in 2012 and featured Randy Jackson of Zebra, who played a guest guitar solo on the song \u201cApocalypse.\u201d He's opened for several major bands in his day including Zebra, 12 Stones, Filter, Puddle of Mudd, and Louisiana Leroux. He\u2019s also played major festivals throughout the South who's had headliners such as Foreigner, Kiss, Doobie Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Temptations, Sublime with Rome, Dee Snider, and Cowboy Mouth.\n\n\n\nAdam's success grew substantially following his appearance on NBC's \"The Voice\". He chose Adam Levine as his coach and made it to the Top 20 on Season 13 (as the \"comeback kid\" from Season 12). Shortly afterwards, Adam Levine invited him to sing for the Maroon 5 Annual Halloween party in 2017. That night they covered only AC/DC songs with Adam Pearce singing, Adam Levine on drums, James Valentine and Andrew Watt on guitar, and Milo Decruz on bass. The night became extra memorable when Sammy Hagar jumped on stage to join Adam Pearce singing \"Highway to Hell.\" The night before, they also surprised guests and performed for the Casamigos Annual Halloween Party.\n\n\n\nIn Decemeber 2017, thanks to the support of his amazing Backers, Adam launched a very successful Kickstarter Campaign which allowed him to bring his newest songs to life with a new album. This new album was recently released October 31, 2018 as Adam Pearce: WARBIRD, featuring Kyle Thomas of Exhorder, Terry McDermott of Lotus Crush, and Paul Mirkovich who's plays keys for and sings duets with Cher.\n\n\n\nAdam can currently be found performing his solo acoustic gigs as well as playing with his full band, Adam Pearce & The Warbirds, all over the state and across the south.

Touring the US and 11 other countries both as a headliner, and supporting acts such as Bon Iver, Jewel, John Hiatt, Suzanne Vega, Seal Styx and Yes, the fiercely independent and hardworking artist has developed a loyal international fan base, has had his work appear in over 100 television shows and films, and recently had a solo acoustic track, \u201cSkyway Drive-In\u201d (from 2013\u2019s Ladera) cross over 6.5 million streams on Spotify.\n\nSince his debut, Alexander\u2019s last 4 records were produced with Billy Mohler (Grammy Nominated writer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist). Bliss, his 6th full-length studio record, and first self-production, was recroded at his new Buddhaland Studios located in Ventura County, CA. \u201cIt was an amazing experience to be at the helm in my own studio, at long last,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cthere are many first takes on this record, which led to the songs feeling organic and honest.\u201d\n\nBliss is a timeless tribute to both the artist's classic rock influences and more recent contemporaries such as Jonathan Wilson, Ryan Adams and Conor Oberst. Alexander\u2019s crystalline tenor and deft acoustic guitar are at the heart of all the tracks. The folk-light opener 'Evergreen' blends Paul Simon and Ram-era McCartney in its fingerpicked cadence and vivid lyrical imagery. \"Something Real Never Dies\" which calls to mind 80's bands like The Church and The Cure, is a dreamy pop rocker about lost loves that 'circle around you again and again.' The ultra-dark \"I Will Die Alone\" sounds like a forgotten gem, unearthed in a time capsule from the early 60's, with a Ricky Nelson-meets-Morricone vibe that you'll just want to put on repeat. \"Heart of California\" is a sun-soaked ode to all things west coast, with its driving Wilco/Petty energy, and the gorgeous lapsteel, courtesy of Ojai mainstay Jesse Siebenberg, who was also featured on Ladera, as well as many tracks on the new album.\n\nAlso returning from Ladera, is keyboardist Peter Adams, whose sonic explorations have graced records for Josh Groban, Tears for Fears, Ricki Lee Jones, Macy Gray and countless others. Bassist Vic Ruiz and drummer Josh Grolemund, also from Alexander's live band appear, as well as vocalists Justine Bennett, Jamie Drake and Sarah Pigion whose lush harmony vocals on \u2018Heart of California\u2019, \u2018Hold Me Helpess\u2019 and the title track add to the 70\u2019s palette considerably. Aaron Sterling (John Mayer, The Civil Wars, Taylor Swift) returning from 2010\u2019s Mono Solo, also provides drums and percussion to three tracks on Bliss.\n\nFor all of the heartache and lessons learned on the album, the closing title track leaves the listener on a sublime note of peace and forgiveness, one that is mirrored in the cover image, hand-drawn by veteran rock and roll artist Alan Forbes.\n\nFollowing the release of Bliss, Shane Alexander will tour the United States in summer and return to Europe in late fall 2016.\n\nThe Freedom Machine, the politically-charged new musical, written and directed by Emmy-winner Larry Carpenter, featuring songs written by Shane Alexander, is currently in pre-production in Los Angeles.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jess Kellie Adams ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8505770.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Texas-born, Ohio-raised and Nashville-living, Jess Kellie Adams is an artist/songwriter whose mission is to share her life and learnings through honest story telling.

His music has taken him around the world, allowing him to work with diverse, respected artists and to connect with people everywhere\u2014from his albums released on Brushfire Records to recording with Belle and Sebastian in Glasgow, to penning film scores and releasing a variety of genre-bending EP\u2019s, and to finally coming home to Los Angeles\u2019s Dangerbird Records for his first new proper full-length release in nearly five years. A rebirth in a sense, through his keen pop sensibility, studious songwriting, technical mastery, and a modern-meets-vintage sound bursting with bite, Costa has recorded the album of his career, one sure to reach new shores and sailors alike.\n\n\u201cIn the past 15 years of my career, I feel I\u2019ve continually been breaking through, speaking out, and reaching different people,\u201d Costa says. \u201cIf one of my songs connects now to someone who didn\u2019t connect before, then we have a dialogue together. That\u2019s the point of music, to have that dialogue and tell a story, and to entertain with a sound that has depth.\u201d\n\nHe began the recording of Santa Rosa Fangs over a year and a half ago, though some songs here predate that mark. Over the past few years, Costa had challenged himself to explore new terrain, from the acoustic-fingerpicking/lo-fi garage/experimental sounds of 2015\u2019s EP\u2019s to the acid-washed and reverb-laden soundtrack to the film Orange Sunshine to another complete album that never saw the light of day. Realizing he sought a collection of dyed-in-the-wool songs rather than sonic experiments, in July of 2017 he and producers Peter Matthew Bauer (The Walkmen) and Nick Stumpf (French Kicks) entered a studio to begin work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference when I sit down to write sonic textures and when I sit with a guitar or piano and write a song,\u201d he says. \u201cThese new songs went back to a traditional sense, and when stripped back to their purest form, they still work. They tell a story, the melodies aren\u2019t leaning on anything, and they make instrumentation around them come to life in a new way, but their core is strong. My goal for the EP\u2019s was to develop conceptual ideas, making each one in a short period and with their own concepts; Orange Sunshine was a bigger exercise in that. Now, this record is all of those things I was exercising come into their own. It\u2019s more of a visualized record that takes you into the world of the Santa Rosa fangs.\u201d\n\nThe tale of Santa Rosa Fangs centers around a young woman named Sharon, her two brothers Ritchie and Tony, and their story of love, loss, and coming of age in a timeless yet contemporary California. It is replete with long distance love affairs and nostalgic romances woven through the loom of tragedy and time. Interestingly, rather than setting out to create a specific narrative, Costa began noticing a theme in the new songs as he wrote them: an unconscious embodiment of the surroundings in which he himself had grown up. According to Costa, the titular teeth refer to that inescapable feeling of a romantic, tragic, and eternal bite that certain places and events will always hold on us.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve interwoven my own stories into a fictional idea of what \u2018Santa Rosa Fangs\u2019 is, from my own time spent living in Northern and Southern California and years driving up and down the coast, seeing the landscape and where life can pull you within one state,\u201d Costa says. \u201cIt is all these things\u2014the \u2018bite that is eternal, the smile in the neon\u2019\u2014and it has fangs. They stick with you: the romantic, the tragic, all that. It\u2019s the characters\u2019 story and my story, too, contemporary but still tortured by the past. It\u2019s a window into a time period but spoken as if it\u2019s the present. The beauty of love and loss doesn\u2019t have a date on it; it\u2019s timeless.\u201d\n\nThe album follows the siblings as they search for love and meaning in their lives, which are ultimately cut short by the passing of both brothers in unrelated accidents. Sharon, left battling with her own mortality and forced to see through a shattered lens, becomes the story\u2019s grieving, guarded hero and, as Costa says, is \u201ca little bit me, and a little bit everyone.\u201d Similarly, the origin of the characters has one foot in reality and one in the ether. The song \u201cRitchie\u201d is based on a true family saga, as two of Costa\u2019s cousins were twin brothers who died within a year of each other in motorcycle and car accidents in the early 1980s. Likewise, \u201cPhosphorescent Letter\u201d is the story of a local friend\u2019s daughter who endured a long-distance, online relationship with a boyfriend in Australia; in that dramatic situation Costa saw a through-line for Sharon\u2019s tale. \u201cBecause she is so tortured by loss she\u2019s afraid of love, so she sets herself up for a distant relationship, illuminated on her phone,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a real-love thing that happens frequently these days.\u201d\n\nOther concrete inspirations found their way into Santa Rosa Fangs as well. Costa imagined his creations in a setting similar to that of a Jim Jarmusch film, with dramatic events unfolding around them as they attempt to go about their daily lives as earnestly as possible. He also cites Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Nebraska as an influence for its songs and characters as well as its moments of sparseness. Like that iconic record, the cover of Santa Rosa Fangs is a stark black-and-white photograph tinged with deep red text, featuring three youths running along a freeway overpass. It\u2019s not clear whether the trio\u2014Costa\u2019s real-life Orange County neighbors\u2014are sprinting for joy or to escape some unknown entity; Costa hints that to him they are running away from the grabbing hands of time. \u201cThe song \u2018Time Tricks\u2019 is about that, too: it\u2019s inevitable and coming for you.\u201d\n\nCosta also found inspiration in working with Bauer and Stumpf, whom he had previously admired from a distance and whose music resumes he respects greatly. \u201cI really connected with Pete and Nick and took their lead on several ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why you partner with someone\u2014you want their input. I shaped things a little differently by listening through their ears than I would have otherwise.\u201d Costa cites \u201cReal Love,\u201d an upbeat, heavy tune written in 5/4 time, as such a moment of collaboration. Originally intended as an acoustic song, he was encouraged by his producers to approach it from a fresh direction. \u201cI had done that sort of thing before, a Nick Drake, fingerpicking type thing,\u201d he says. \u201cPete and Nick inspired me to take it to a new place. To write a driving rock song in 5/4 is a real challenge, but I had the basis in my pattern and we all drove it home with a really strong beat. On my own I might have stuck with a simpler take, but it felt good to tackle some new ground.\u201d\n\nIn another circumstance, Costa again came up with two variations of the same song, but rather than being forced to choose between the two, he simply used both. As a result, \u201cI Remember It Well\u201d bookends the album, first as a rollicking, piano-driven number that sets the record\u2019s tone and pace, and second as a sparser, quiet version to end it. The latter was the initial version and was also the first song written for the album some four years ago. \u201cThat song is both the entrance and exit to this world, and also shows the process of how you can take a song, do it two ways, and both can be impactful and give you different feelings.\u201d\n\nNo matter how his process or approach may change\u2014in the present moment or in any era of coming-of-age throughout his decade-and-a-half-long career\u2014Costa recognizes that one unique thing in his work will always stay the same: his perspective. \u201cEssentially, what it comes down to is this: I sit down with a guitar, and these are songs,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard to understand how to produce them in certain ways. You can try to dress up a song and put a different sound to it, but if the song isn\u2019t that kind of song then it\u2019s not going to work. I\u2019ve had to exercise both of those qualities equally\u2014to know how to develop these sounds sonically, and then when I know sonically where I want it to go, I have to write to that. I guess that knowledge comes with 15 years of songwriting experience. I couldn\u2019t have made this record any other time than now.\u201d\n\nFor Matt Costa, the world of Santa Rosa Fangs is the past, present, and future of his life all rolled up into one long stretch of sunlit California coastline.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "ELIOT BRONSON ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8938769.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Picture a street in working-class Baltimore some 30 years ago. Kids play in the shadows of the row houses that line the sidewalks. Their parents sit on the stoops leading up to front doors. It all seems normal at first glance.\n\n\n\nBut zoom in on one of these homes \u2014 that old duplex built back when this part of town was still mainly open fields. Inside is a completely different community, where fundamentalism, hippie values and volatile, unpredictable emotions coexist and collide. Escape is difficult: the only way out is to pass through the bedrooms of people you might be trying to get away from.\n\n\n\nThis is where Eliot Bronson grew up. Yeah, he often wanted to slip away from there, but the first thing he saw once he exited was the Pentecostal Church across the street where his father and grandfather had preached and where congregants spoke in tongues.\n\n\n\nSo Eliot looked inward instead.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor better or worse, I\u2019ve always been a weirdo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI was reading about Zen Buddhism when all my friends were getting high and drunk in high school.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he adds, \u201cI did all that stuff later.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also observed. In this kaleidoscopic family, where glossolalia and, on occasion, alcohol-fueled ravings, sometimes bled into each other, Bronson found shelter in music. At age 15, he got his first guitar and started teaching himself to play. \u201cRight away, I wanted to write my own songs,\u201d he says. \u201cMy house was pretty chaotic so I took to music like it was a life raft. It was something I could do to keep myself alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nPunk rock was his shelter at first. Then one day his dad put on a few of his favorite LPs \u2014 Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019, something by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. Eliot had heard these albums a thousand times before. This time, though\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 it resonated with me,\u201d Eliot says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just in the background. I tuned into it for the first time. There was a magic and a power there. It didn\u2019t talk down to the listener but it was also high art. It asked you to be smart and to become a better version of yourself. For me, this was a moment when it became my music, not just my parents\u2019 music.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom local coffee houses and venues beyond Baltimore, Bronson sharpened his writing and performance. He cultivated a working approach that involved singing to himself as ideas came to him and never jotting down chord changes or lyrics once he had committed the finished version to memory. A local following grew. Astute observers saw something different in the young artist\u2019s work. The Baltimore Sun even anointed him \u201ca folk singing wunderkind.\u201d\n\n\n\nExpanding his range, Bronson toured as one-half of a duo. They moved to Atlanta and picked up a gig in a room frequented by The Indigo Girls, John Mayer, Shawn Mullins and other discerning clientele. When his partner quit to take a sensible non-musical job, Bronson persisted on his own. His songs won first-place honors at MerleFest\u2019s Chris Austin Songwriting Contest and Eddie Owens Presents \u201cSongwriter Shootout.\u201d He issued several solo albums, including a self-titled release in 2014 that prompted Glide Magazine to describe him as \u201ca gorgeous, magnificent hybrid of (Ryan) Adams, Jason Isbell and Jim James.\u201d Bop n Jazz upped that ante by heralding him as \u201cmaybe the best singer/songwriter since Dylan.\u201d\n\n\n\nWriters may have trouble topping these accolades, though that\u2019s what Bronson\u2019s latest album merits. Scheduled to release Aug. 25 on Rock Ridge Music, James offers songs that are more like pictures than movies, capturing moments and digging deeply into their meanings. A stomping beat, raw harmonica and searing electric slide drives the opening track, \u201cBreakdown In G Major,\u201d followed by a selection of songs that only confirm Bronson\u2019s restless, escalating excellence.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood Enough,\u201d for example, captures a relationship in its final stage \u2014 a stage that may end tomorrow or stretch on for years. Bronson sings it sorrowfully, asking the rhetorical question of whether \u201c\u2018good enough\u2019 is good enough for you\u201d from this point. \u201cWhen I stumbled onto that line, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll probably stick,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think the song really came from the first line, \u2018Were we really that young?\u2019 Sometimes it takes just one line to resonate with me and get me to start writing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Mountain,\u201d whose elusive grandeur delivers a powerful message but leaves it to the listener to parse its meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s a very literalist current in writing and music right now,\u201d Bronson observes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of layers to lyrics these days. It\u2019s just what you see on the page. So when you don\u2019t write that way, you get, \u2018What are you hiding?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughs and then concludes, \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way. For me, it\u2019s more about how you feel when you hear it. What does it do for you? That\u2019s the message!\u201d\n\n\n\nOne more, \u201cRough Ride,\u201d is a departure for Bronson. Here, the meaning is clear: When 25-year-old Freddie Gray fell unaccountably into a coma in the back of a Baltimore police van, much of America expressed shock and outrage. So did Bronson, but he channeled those emotions into this song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had mixed feelings about writing this because I don\u2019t like inserting my political or social beliefs into art,\u201d he explains. \u201cArt should be about connecting people, not drawing lines between them. But I was listening to Dylan\u2019s Desire album at the time, especially \u2018Hurricane.\u2019 I always wanted to write a song like that. It was like, \u2018How can you tell a story almost journalistically with great emotional impact and yet not come off heavy-handed?\u2019 I wanted to see if I could do it. Now I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\n\n\nKnown for his empathetic work with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and other utterly original artists, producer Dave Cobb played a critical role in bringing James to fruition. \u201cHis honesty and old-fashioned vibe were so appealing to me,\u201d Bronson says. \u201cThey leant themselves to the way I created. And, of course, it was a huge boost to have this great artist/producer at your back.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey had worked together previously on his 2014 release, Eliot Bronson. \u201cBut this album is different,\u201d Bronson points out. \u201cIt\u2019s more sparse and economical. My voice is stronger. And I think it\u2019s a step away from the purely Americana vibe of the last one in a direction that I have a hard time defining. I\u2019m excited to discover how this music will define itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nWherever he\u2019s bound, Bronson promises to write and sing the truth as he sees and feels it. \u201cFor the really great artists, like Dylan or Paul Simon, you never quite find what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get closer, it changes.

When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do. Having already established themselves both as melodic songwriters (2004\u2019s RIAA-Certified Gold record They\u2019re Only Chasing Safety) and as ambitious power merchants (2006\u2019s stentorian, gold-selling Define The Great Line and its majestic follow-up, 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound Of Separation), the evolution detailed on Erase Me finds them using the sonic dialects they\u2019ve crafted to reveal where they are now. Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems. Even with a comeback title seemingly marinating in self-fulfilling prophecy, nobody in their right mind would dare delete Under\u00f8ath\u2019s measurable contribution to the advancement of post-hardcore and heavy rock. The only thing you need to erase is your patience with their pretenders. Accept no substitutes and your culture won\u2019t feel destitute.

You will hear him talk about \u201cstaying constant,\u201d being \u201creal\u201d and \u201cnatural.\u201d They resonate in the songs he writes, those he chooses to record and in every aspect of his career.\nIt isn\u2019t that Tom Wurth does not embrace change and growth. He has experienced a lot of that musically as he met milestone after milestone in his career. At the same time though, he believes that music can be a \u201cconstant\u201d for most people and they crave consistency from an artist.\nWhether you sit down to talk about his career, where he has been, where he is going; or listen to the lyrics of each song, you will know his commitment to that real and natural music. It is music you can count on with every song and at every show.\nThe new album A Different Soul shows that commitment. There are deep roots that brace this album. Roots from his small town up-bringing to his musical roots that are evident with the collaborations found on this new project which includes Vince Gill, T. Graham Brown and John Ford Coley.\nOut of the gate, at only twenty years of age, Tom Wurth was nominated for a Grammy. That particular milestone built a foundation for his career. The Grammy experience fresh in his mind, Wurth pushed forward with his songwriting aspirations.\nWurth initially signed as a staff writer with Belden; later signing with one of the largest publishers in the world, BMG Music Publishing. At BMG he garnered two major record label cuts including; \u201cIf the Road Runs Out,\u201d appearing on This is Ty Herndon \u2013 Greatest Hits and a Ken Mellons cut, \u201cI Can\u2019t Kick My Country\u201d for a NASCAR compilation, Inside Traxx.\nTom Wurth found the best school was on the road playing and in the studio recording. He took to both and never looked back. He has shared a stage with some of the most respected and successful artists in music including\nVince Gill, John Ford Coley, T. Graham Brown, Eddie Money, Larry Gatlin and The Gatlin Brothers, Lonestar, Billy Dean, Ronnie Milsap, Rascal Flatts, Billy Currington, LoCash, Pam Tillis, Mel Tillis, Thompson Square, Marty Stuart, Tim Rushlow, Trick Pony, Clay Walker, Tony Coleman & many others.\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Tom Wurth for several years. I\u2019ve always appreciated his friendship and what I\u2019ve always admired was his professionalism. As we say in Alabama \u2013 he\u2019s a hard charger. (He\u2019s a) great entertainer, and one of the true inspirations in this business!\u201d \u2013 Marty Raybon\nIn 2006 Wurth signed his first record deal, recorded and released his first album on Aspirion Records. The first release from Tom Wurth, \u201cBread On The Table,\u201d reached the top thirty on the charts as well as earned a spot on CMT.com for the single\u2019s video. Wurth\u2019s next two single releases (\u201cGood Ground,\u201d from the album Tom Wurth and \u201cIf The Road Runs Out,\u201d from If The Road Runs Out) also enjoyed top thirty chart status.\n\"Tom Wurth is a three-way hitter. He's a tremendously gifted vocalist and artist and a Grammy nominated artist. Tom has a genuine love for the song, strong and memorable melody-tunes that people can sing along with. Tom is truly a gifted singer with a style all his own. I think you'll love what you hear.\u201d - John Ford Coley\nThis quote may well explain the feelings both peers and fans have about Tom Wurth and his music. What you hear on Tom Wurth\u2019s records are exactly what you will hear on stage. No smoke, no mirrors just great music.\n\u201cSome time ago Vince Gill finished performing and sat next to me backstage ... I have the same remark about Tom as I said to Vince, \"You did more with just you and a guitar than the act that preceded you with a full band. This is a wonderful talent that should be a much bigger name because he understands what it means to get up on a stage and perform. A wonderful talent.\u201d \u2013 Sandy Smolen\nTom Wurth crossed paths with famed rocker Eddie Money leading to a friendship and several collaborations. Money asked him to produce a special project, The Other Side of Money. Wurth took on the project bringing in John Ford Coley to co-produce the project with him. The album included a remake of Money\u2019s song, \u201cGimme Some Water\u201d and featured Vince Gill. For Tom Wurth\u2019s new project, A Different Soul, Wurth and Money once again collaborated, along with Scott Soderberg, with their co-write of \u201cBack On The Highway Again.\u201d\n\u201cEvery once in a while, someone comes along that has the quality, that believability tone in their voice with a simple but honest emotion, like he\u2019s talking late at night to his sweetheart in a quiet driveway. It\u2019s a gift. Tom Wurth has that gift. \u2013 Eddie Money\nIn 2012, Wurth signed with TaDa Records recording the studio album, Midnight Rain. The album brings together Tom Wurth\u2019s soulful blend of country with his trademark additions of R&B and gospel. Midnight Rain was featured on iTunes New and Noteworthy right off the presses. Singles from the album included, \u201cTo Love Somebody,\u201d and \u201cDiggin in The Dirt.\u201d\nFor Tom Wurth, music isn\u2019t just a vocation, it defines him as a person. If he isn\u2019t crafting a new song, out on the road singing or in the studio recording his own music he often takes to the studio as a producer. His latest project is with John Ford Coley. Coley\u2019s latest album, Eclectic, is a 26 song collection co-produced by Wurth and features Vince Gill, Collin Raye, Jamie O\u2019Neal, Georgia Middleman and T. Graham Brown.\nYet, there is nothing Tom Wurth would rather be doing than singing. This past year and a half he has devoted everything to the making of A Different Soul. There is no \u201cfast forward\u201d to this latest project on TaDa Records.\nIt is part of his artistic progression and builds on his musical roots. A Different Soul has quickly become labeled \u201ca different style, a different sound.\u201d It is not \u201cdifferent\u201d for Tom Wurth, but gives that same \u201cconstant\u201d fans have come to expect from his music. But, it is music different from anything you have heard before.\nThe project includes a song he will say \u201cdefines him.\u201d \u201cWhere I Belong\u201d was written by Wurth with Vince Gill and features Gill on vocals and guitar. For Wurth it is another milestone in his career. Right next to that is another Wurth co-write, \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Build It,\u201d that has his soulful vocals paired with those of another soulful singer, T. Graham Brown. John Ford Coley also appears offering his talents with background vocals on two songs on the project, \u201cOnce A Lover (Always A Friend)\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Make Love.\u201d\nA Different Soul is produced by T. W. Cargile (who also co-produced Wurth\u2019s Midnight Rain) and Tony Coleman (former B.B. King drummer for thirty years).\n\u201cIn my lifetime as a musician, I have had the opportunity and honor to work with the world\u2019s greatest soulful singers \u2013 Otis Clay, Bobby Blue Bland, Johnnie Taylor, Etta James, B.B. King and others. Tom Wurth is one of those soulful singers that I can add to that list. The first time I heard him sing I knew immediately I had to work with him. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of co-producing him on his latest recording, A Different Soul. I consider his voice and singing to be as soulful as those great artists I\u2019ve worked with and grew up listing to whether jazz, blues, country or R&B.

Whether it was rocking out to Bruce Springsteen in his dad\u2019s car or singing along to Garth Brooks with his mom, music always played a big part in Chris\u2019 life. Fast forward a few years and, like most kids, Chris couldn\u2019t stand to listen to the same music as his parents. Being from St. Louis he had to know every word to Nelly\u2019s \u201cCountry Grammer\u201d, he also fell in love with artists such as Usher and Fall Out Boy. His mix of pop, rock and country separates him from most other artists out there. After graduating from Ole Miss and spending a few summers traveling back and forth from Oxford to Nashville, Chris decided it was time to make the move. Initially knowing only a few people in the Music City, his drive and determination were quickly noticed throughout town.\n\nFrom almost empty bar rooms to fraternity parties to sold out shows, Chris has been captivating audiences everywhere he goes. Having opened for bands like The Marshall Tucker Band and LoCash, Chris\u2019 stage presence and voice pull the audience in until they are all on their feet!

Combine that with Delta blues, compliments of a childhood spent in Cajun country, and you\u2019ve got one badass up-and-comer, with the pure musical talent and vocal chops to back him up. Already turning heads throughout Nashville, Baton Rouge and beyond, having been named one of the \u201cTop New Artists You Need To Know\u201d by Rolling Stone Country, CJ says the driving force behind his current success isn\u2019t fame nor fortune \u2013 it\u2019s just a diehard infatuation with the music he grew up on.\n\n\u201cI just want to write songs that say something that really means something. I want to ride around in a van, tour the country, and play songs with my buds. Everything I do in music, I want to do it for the love of the music and the sake of the song,\u201d he adds.\n\nIt all started back in Baton Rouge where his family\u2019s affinity for music struck a chord. \u201cMy grandparents loved country music. My dad was a big classic rock fan,\u201d he said. \u201cDad kept a guitar in a closet, and I dug it out when I was seven and started making noise of my own with it,\u201d Solar recalls. That so-called \u201cnoise\u201d would sharpen quickly, through lessons at the young age of eight, to enrollment at Nashville\u2019s Belmont University, to cuts on albums by Justin Moore and Jerrod Niemann, and, now, his own critically acclaimed solo EP that\u2019s turning heads, Hard One to Turn Down.\n\nAnd a Hard One To Turn Down, the EP is. Critics at The Daily Country write, \u201cSolar injects a hefty (and welcome) dose of Southern rock into his country, which melds perfectly with his gravelly vocals.\u201d Country Music Rocks was \u201cimmediately captivated by all five songs and hopes that [the EP] obtains the recognition it deserves.\u201d The Rowdy found it \u201cexactly what country fans are looking to savor.\u201d And The Shotgun Seat welcomes Hard One to Turn Down as \u201cthe perfect pairing of country storytelling and rocking rhythms, married by his dynamic vocals.\u201d And that\u2019s only the beginning.\n\nFlashback to Louisiana where CJ put a group together while in elementary school, recruiting his two brothers. They called themselves The Solar Heat, recollected by CJ as \u201cthe cheesiest band name of all time.\u201d But the band built up a solid local fan base, and helped CJ hone his writing and performance skills. However, CJ knew he needed to be in Nashville where he attended Belmont and landed an exclusive publishing agreement before he had even graduated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded some of my best songs in December of my senior year,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started interning at Sea Gayle Music in February, I played these and two other songs I hadn\u2019t recorded for Mike Owens (VP Creative at Sea Gayle). A week later I had a publishing deal. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not the way it happens with most interns. I\u2019m grateful for these opportunities, and I don\u2019t plan on taking them for granted.\u201d\n\nThe ink was still wet on Solar\u2019s degree when artists all over town started putting the new Nashville songwriter\u2019s self-penned songs on hold. \u201cBlue Bandana,\u201d which he\u2019d written in January, was chosen by Jerrod Niemann and released as a single. Then, Solar began writing with Bob DiPiero and other members of Nashville\u2019s songwriting elite.\n\nSolar tracked and produced Hard One To Turn Down, alongside Sea Gayle\u2019s Brent Anderson, (who\u2019s producing and songwriting credits include Chris Janson, Blake Shelton and others), with established country hit-maker Jerrod Niemann joining in on one song as guest vocalist. Its lead single, a paean to the powers of sipping on a \u201cTall Boy,\u201d dropped in mid-March and quickly garnered over 164,000 Spotify spins in its first month of release. The EP followed on April 15, in both digital and physical formats. In May, the music video for \u201cTall Boy,\u201d directed by Marcel Chagnon, premiered on CMT. Tour dates from coast to coast include his own headlining dates and opening slots for The Cadillac Three, Old Dominion, Hank Williams, Jr., and the list goes on.\n\nIf it\u2019s not obvious yet, Solar is on the fast track to success, with a solid team in Nashville to back him up. And he\u2019s not going to leave any stones left unturned. As important as songwriting is and will always be to Solar, he is excited to be stepping into the spotlight as an artist. CJ is a powerful vocalist with his Southern, gravelly edge and he has the guitar chops to match. His live show puts it all together and will knock you off your feet.\n\nYet the pensive, bolero-brimmed, too-wise-for-his-age 23-year-old is riding his momentum thoughtfully, with the long haul in mind. \u201cI\u2019d love to tour the country and have a handful of hit songs,\u201d he muses. \u201cBut I\u2019m totally cool with living pretty normally as long as I need to.

After attending high school in South Texas, Stalling studied at Texas A&M - College Station, where he earned a masters degree in Food Science. He followed the corporate road from there and eventually landed in Dallas working in product development for Frito-Lay.\n\nDuring this time, Stalling discovered the Three Teardrops Tavern and Dallas community radio station KNON. These outlets exposed a musical heritage to which Stalling had been nearly oblivious. Inspired by artists like Townes Van Zandt, Robert Earl Keen, Guy Clark, Lyle Lovett, and Jerry Jeff Walker, Stalling started writing songs, recording albums, and eventually touring with a full band to back him. In June 2008, Stalling joined musical greats Kris Kristofferson, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, Selena, Guy Clark and many others when he received a star on the South Texas Music Walk of Fame in Corpus Christi.\n\nStalling's style is modern with a vintage feel. With Jeff Howe on drums and percussion, Glenn Wallace on nylon-string guitar and electric guitar, Heather Stalling on fiddle and harmony vocals, and Jason Steinsultz swapping between stand-up and electric bass, Stalling creates a dynamic live show that\u2019s smart, charming and as listenable as it is danceable. Stalling and troupe are equally at home on a huge concert stage in front of thousands or playing an acoustic set for a hundred.

His unique voice and amusingly clever song lyrics pull him in a different direction - a direction most obviously evident in his newest record Banquet.\n\nStalling has put together an elite team for his newest studio project, Banquet, including recording heavyweight and Grammy winner Lloyd Maines. Maines has been instrumental in developing the sounds of some of the best artists in music and has worked with industry giants including the Dixie Chicks, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Bruce Robison. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the life that this record has,\u201d says Max. \u201cWe poured heart and soul into this project and I think people will be wowed by what this project contains\u201d\n\n\nBanquet was released in 2015.

They have pushed forward with a passion, and unrelenting drive that will see Renegade Station become a name that anyone hearing their unique pop and rock-infused brand of country music is unlikely to forget.\nOriginally known as Domino, the band came together almost accidentally as husband and wife duo of singer/bassist Luanne and guitarist Russell Carl began attending and performing at a town variety show in Stettler, not long after moving to the rural Alberta community. There they met guitarist/vocalist Kent Nixon and drummer Scott McKnight at the popular event and decided to create a band to play local dances and parties becoming the \u2018go to\u2019 act on the circuit.\n\u201cWe were the backing band at this event and decided to take the show on the road, playing a lot of rodeo dances and weddings. But after a few years we realized we had something special. We just gelled as musicians and our voices harmonized so well together that we all just felt we needed to do more. So, we acquired ourselves a professional manager and began recording some originals and some songs that were gifted to us,\u201d said Luanne.\nTheir new name is symbolic of the group\u2019s unconventional approach to their music and sense of independence. They are unabashed about injecting their original music and the songs presented to them by other noted songwriters with healthy doses of pop and classic rock nuances \u2013 with a focus on lushly produced and beautiful layered vocal harmonies which owe as much to Fleetwood Mac as they do to Lady Antebellum.\nThe \u201cStation\u201d part of their name is a nod to vintage working steam train that is a tourist attraction in Stettler and which is a throwback to the region\u2019s pioneering past. Therefore, a name that is reverent towards tradition, but which also alludes to a desire to go one\u2019s own way is ideal for the band approaches their craft.\nAs proof of Renegade Station\u2019s commitment to excellence, for the recording of Along for the Ride, they worked with respected industry veteran Johnny Gasparic (Gord Bamford, George Canyon, Snoop Dogg) at Dave Temple\u2019s MCC Recording Studio in Calgary. It was the second time working with Gasparic, but this time around Luanne said he became more integral to the creative process as well as the recording process.\n\u201cWe collaborated a lot more with him on the production side and it was awesome. He brings an amazing background and experience with him. He knows that we are very much a vocal band and a harmony band, and he really helped to emphasize that, but was also able to get us to do some things vocally that we hadn\u2019t done before. He really got us to relax and open up. I don\u2019t think we have ever sounded this good,\u201d she said.\nThe lead-off single, Who\u2019s Gonna Love Me Tonight, fits into the more adventurous approach that is Renegade Station\u2019s hallmark. Sung by Kent who shares lead vocal duties with Luanne, it\u2019s a mature, somewhat saucy but very true-to-life take on modern romance.\n\u201cWe were really drawn to the song at first because of the amazing harmonies, but then once we got a sense of the meaning and message we knew we had to record it. It\u2019s a little different and a little more risqu\u00e9 than a traditional country romantic song. It\u2019s not the normal \u2018I love you and you love me\u2019 song. It\u2019s a little more mature and realistic. Who is going to go home with who? Who is the strong person in the song, and who is the one going to just give in to the temptation of the moment,\u201d Luanne said.\nDon\u2019t Hold Your Breath was penned primarily by Nashville-based Canadian singer/songwriter Jaida Dreyer and, again, the breathtakingly infectious harmonies fit the Renegade Station sound so well, they could not resist putting it on Along for the Ride.\n\u201cThe song has this Little Big Town vibe, with an incredible melody and when we first harmonized together to the song we all just looked at each other with these amazed expressions. It is such a good song for us to really show off not only our country influences but how we can really bring that together with our pop and rock background. And I personally love this song because it\u2019s about being a strong woman,\u201d she said.\nProving that there is true musical versatility in Renegade Station, the song Rodeo Road is written by Joni Delaurier and pays tribute to the western rodeo lifestyle, which has special meaning for Nixon that comes across in his passionate vocal performance.\n\u201cKent\u2019s grandfather is in the Canadian Professional Rodeo Hall of Fame. His father in law is in the Hall of Fame. His three brothers in laws are Canadian Pro Rodeo Champion\u2019s and there is a long line of cowboys and rodeo competitors in his family. That song was so special to him and we all loved it too and wanted it there as a sort of throwback to that gritty traditional country sound that we all grew up with. It represents a big part of the Alberta mystique and the importance of rural life, the rodeo circuit and the country dances that are part of so many people\u2019s lives here,\u201d Luanne said.\nThe rock-solid foundation that was built as Domino is not being shunted aside as the talented quartet moves forward. Renegade Station\u2019s legacy is etched deep into the firmament of the western Canadian music scene and that can never be taken from them. In recent years they have won back to back Association of Country Music in Alberta, as Group of the Year (2015 and 2016) as well as the ACMA Fan\u2019s Choice of the Year in 2015. They also garnered a CCMA nomination for songwriter of the year for their tune 2:15 and Luanne was also nominated for CCMA Bass Player of the Year for 2016.\nThe band has shared the stage with a who\u2019s who of Canadian and international country music luminaries, from George Canyon and Carolyn Dawn Johnson, to David Lee Murphy, Emerson Drive, and Bobby Wills.\nAlong for the Ride is a bold statement by a collection of talented musicians and songwriters that is infused with authenticity, impressive vocal performances and insistent melodies that will stick with you for days.\nAnd with this impressive collection of new songs, a live show that never fails to enchant and entertain, and an unparalleled creative drive, Renegade Station is truly poised to break through to a national and international stage.", "otherInfo": "Join us for Quarantine Match Game on Wednesday Night!

The Sailor is a literal and metaphorical expression of a young man who is observing his own changing-self in the greater context of today\u2019s world.\nGrowing up homeschooled in Indonesia, Brian found the Internet to be his English teacher and window to the world beyond. After moving to America alone at the age of 17, Brian has been both awed and humbled by his experiences, as they simultaneously smack him down to Earth and lift him up. 2 years later, Rich Brian has come a long way.\n\u201cThe Sailor is a symbol of being an explorer.\u201d Brian says. \u201cOf exploring uncharted territory and just going through life, curious. It\u2019s my own story as well as the story of all immigrants that brave new worlds for a chance at something better.\u201d\nBrian came to see himself in the same boat that many have traveled in before; and came to understand the reality of crossing oceans, hoping for something better \u2013 with nothing guaranteed.\nAfter making the leap to America, Brian has experienced all the glory of \u201cmaking it\u201d - from collaborating with the likes of 21 Savage, Offset, and Playboi Carti, to selling out shows and playing festivals around the world.

Life is not stagnant and can change really fast.\u201d\nFollowing an extended and anxiety-inducing writer\u2019s block, making an album that was written with real instruments in real time in the studio was the antidote to the paralysis of overthinking. The Sailor is pure \u2013 clear in motivation and self-awareness. It\u2019s about being another Asian kid with dreams, one who just went for them and continues to make them happen. The intent was to inspire others like Brian to be curious - to see what else there is to see.\nThe Sailor has a gentle, wide-eyed wisdom; looking to the future and becoming more burdened with life.

In 2015, Margo Price was a country underdog just trying to keep enough gas in the tank to get to the next gig, but by the end of 2016, she was one of the genre's most celebrated new artists and a ubiquitous presence on late night television and at major festivals around the world. It's the kind of year most musicians can only dream of, and the arrival of Price's spectacular sophomore album, \"All American Made,\" proves that she hasn't taken a moment of it for granted. Delivering on the promise of her debut and then some, the record finds Price planting her flag firmly in the soil as a songwriter who's here for the long haul, one with the chops to hang with the greats she so often finds herself sharing stages with these days.\n\n\"People have started asking me, 'Now that you're having success, what are you going to write about?'\" Price recounts with a laugh. \"A lot of what I wrote on my debut came out of my struggles in the music business, but we don't have any shortage of material now. I'm just excited to finally have an audience and know that people are going to listen to our songs.\"\n\nA prolific writer with a knack for candid self-reflection, Price has never had to look too far for inspiration, and on 'All American Made,' she and her songwriting partner/husband, Jeremy Ivey, continue to depict the trials of everyday life with unflinching honesty, painting poetically plainspoken portraits of men and women just trying to get by. Highs and lows, long nights and hard days, wild women and cocaine cowboys, politics and sexism, it's all in there, singularly filtered through Price's wry, no-bullshit perspective. Throughout the album, her contemporary take on classic sounds is at once familiar and daring, an infectious blend of Nashville country, Memphis soul, and Texas twang that tips its cap to everyone from Waylon and Willie (who makes a guest appearance) to Loretta and Dolly, all while flipping a middle finger to the cookie-cutter pop that dominates modern country radio. Rich with swirling pedal steel, honky-tonk rhythms, and Price's stop-you-in-your-tracks vocals, 'All American Made' is deeply reverent of tradition even as it challenges conventions, a nuanced exploration of conflicted emotions for our deeply conflicted times.\n\nFar from overnight, Price's recent meteoric rise is the product of more than a decade of hard work and sacrifice. While she'd long been one of East Nashville's best-kept-secrets, she burst onto the international scene with the 2016 release of her first solo album, 'Midwest Farmer's Daughter.' The record debuted in the Top 10 on Billboard's Country Albums chart and graced Best-Of lists everywhere from Entertainment Weekly to NPR Music, who called it \"the hard-won arrival of an artist who feels like she's always been here.\" Vulture described Price as \"one of the most compelling country talents to come out of Nashville in recent memory,\" while Pitchfork hailed the album as \"a potential classic,\" and Rolling Stone praised its \"amazingly vivid songcraft.\" Price solidified her next-big-thing status with stellar performances on Saturday Night Live, Colbert, Fallon, CBS This Morning, Seth Meyers, A Prairie Home Companion, and more, in addition to taking home Emerging Artist of the Year honors at the Americana Music Awards and winning The American Music Prize for the year's best debut album. She shared stages and bills with Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, and Chris Stapleton among others, and her compelling story-years of toil in the Nashville trenches, the loss of her family's farm and the tragic death of her infant child, a brush with the law, selling her car and pawning her wedding ring to afford studio time, signing to Jack White's Third Man Records as the label's first country artist-was recounted in glowing profiles everywhere from the NY Times Magazine and the New Yorker to Morning Edition and Fader.\n\nWhen it was time to record the follow-up, Price and her band headed back to Memphis, TN, where they'd cut 'Midwest Farmer's Daughter' on a shoestring budget. Instead of returning to Sun Studios, though, they moved down the street to the larger Sam Phillips Recording studio, which the legendary producer opened in 1960 when his own skyrocketing success necessitated more space.\n\n\"We recorded live again because that's really how I like to work,\" Price explains. \"We'd get in around ten or eleven each morning, and then after about twelve hours of recording, we'd all start yelling for tequila, take a shot, and then just keep going.\"\n\nThat spirited, energetic atmosphere infuses even the record's darkest moments with a potent sense of vitality. On the uptempo album opener \"Don't Say It,\" Price dishes out sardonic wordplay over smoking hot guitar, while the pedal-steel and fiddle-fueled \"Weakness\" toes the line between sobriety and mayhem, and the tender \"Learning To Lose\" finds her living out a country music fantasy as she duets with Willie Nelson.\n\n\"We'd gotten to know him a bit from playing shows together and I idolized the hell out of him,\" says Price. \"I didn't know there were people like that, who'd achieved such massive stardom but remained so down to earth.\"\n\nOld school country may be the album's most obvious touchstone, but Price and her band incorporate 60's and 70's R&B into many of the arrangements here, fusing two of Tennessee's greatest musical exports. The funky \"Do Right By Me\" shimmies and grooves with Gospel legends The McCrary Sisters helping out on backing vocals, and the driving \"A Little Pain\" gets an assist from sweeping orchestration by Memphis legend Lester Snell (the man responsible for the string arrangements in \"Shaft\").\n\n\"Sometimes you feel like you've got to please everybody, but ultimately you should be the one you're worrying about taking care of,\" Price says of the inspiration behind the song. \"I wrote it pretty quickly just thinking about being on the road and trying to keep it together while you're burning the candle at both ends.\"\n\nThey say write what you know, and there are few things Price knows better than the road and the myriad of obstacles facing women who make their living on it. On \"Pay Gap,\" she laments the financial state of gender inequality (\"why don't you do the math? / Pay gap, pay gap / Ripping my dollar in half,\" she sings), and \"Wild Women\" looks at the hypocrisies of what's expected from male musicians compared to their female counterparts.\n\n\"There's a definite double standard,\" says Price, \"but I think if you're out there long enough, you stop giving any fucks and you just want to call it out. I get asked questions in interviews that no man would be asked, and if I'm assertive about what I want for me and my band, I get called a 'diva.' That song is really about the judgment I get from people who act like women shouldn't be out on the road. Girls should be encouraged to follow their careers and their dreams just as much as men.\"\n\nThe album closes with an intimate, acoustic rendition of \"All American Made,\" a song which calls to mind \"Born In The USA\" with its patriotic-sounding title and far more troubled lyrics.\n\n\"We actually wrote that song during the Obama administration,\" says Price, \"but it really altered meaning for me on the day Trump was elected. That song embodies the good and the bad in the ugly in this country. America is so beautiful to me, but it's in a really hard spot right now. I feel like I was one of the first and only country artists to speak out so openly against Trump, and I had a lot of people tell me I shouldn't be giving my opinion, but as far as I'm concerned, there's not a lot of doubt about the difference between right and wrong.\"\n\nThat candor is part of what makes 'All American Made' such a powerful follow-up release. Price could have taken her moment in the spotlight as an opportunity to homogenize and chase a slicker, more polished sound built for radio and arenas, but instead, she doubled down on the grit and the truth in her music. It's honesty that brought her to this remarkable moment, and honesty that will continue to carry her into the future. How much higher will Margo Price's star rise? Only time will tell, but just remember, a lot can change in a year.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Eva Under Fire ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7589250.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Rock, Alternative", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605BIO\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Emerging from Detroit's underground rock scene is an eclectic mix of veteran performers who have teamed up to give you \"Eva Under Fire\".

They tour the Northwest regularly as a duo, and put on theatrical shows with their full ensemble. They are alumni of the Johnny Mercer Songwriters Project and have played before Randy Newman.\n\nPortland's The Bylines exists in a unique musical plane, one at once grounded in the big-band past of glamorous pop performances and rooted in a present realm of intricate and highly addictive songwriting. With a focus on grand live spectacle--a facet of music often lost in the digital age--the group is equally at home in velvet-curtained jazz halls, large rooms and intimate venues.\n\nThat sound is the product of a marriage both sonic and literal. The Bylines is made up of two songwriters whose styles and influences converge to bring The Bylines' catchy, addictive sounds to vibrant life. Frontwoman Marianna Thielen, the glamorous face of the group, brings to the fore a background in composition, classical vocal work and, most obviously, musical theater, illuminating the stage with endlessly watchable bravado backed up by her powerful -- yet playful -- vocal prowess. Meanwhile, gliding his fingers across the keys is Reece Marshburn, letting loose a symphony of intricate melodies rooted in a combination of classical, jazz and pop music.\n\nThe resulting combination is a unique pop confection drawing on decades of influences, as if Cole Porter, Carole King, Dusty Springfield, Freddie Mercury, Paul Simon, Rufus Wainwright and Regina Spektor combined forces and filtered their unique compositions through classical maestros and film composers, then sprinkled it with a keen pop sensibility and a commitment to putting on the most involving, charismatic and personalized live shows this side of the Copacabana.\n\nThe Bylines have used their unique-yet-familiar sound to play to audiences large and small throughout the country, and have released both a studio(self titled, recorded by Bob Stark at Kung Fu Bakery) and a live album(The Bylines Live, recorded at the Alberta Rose Theatre in Portland, OR). The Bylines are proud alumni of the Johnny Mercer Songwriting Project, and have had support from the Regional Arts and Culture Council.\n\nWhether performing as a Thielen/Marshburn duo or with a larger band, the result is a blend of butter-smooth melodies, densely layered songwriting and powerful vocals. Most importantly, though, The Bylines musical cocktail goes down easy, and emphasizes something that is so often forgotten when such prolific songwriters present their craft: listening to music is, above all, supposed to be an experience\u2026 and a fun one.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lim Kim ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/260004.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "alextbh ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8874332.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "twink pop music", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rich Brian ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9194930.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Rap, Hip Hop, Hip-hop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "OnTheSailor, RichBrian is not only feeling the sea change, but motion sickness too.

She is a veritable triple-threat of musical talent as a guitarist, songwriter and vocalist. As with many blues women of the past, Foley has a long history of defying convention, and being a positive role model for aspiring, young female musicians.\n\nThe Canadian has been working professionally since the age of 16, and by the age of 21, Foley had relocated to Austin, TX and began recording for Antone\u2019s\u2014the esteemed blues label and historic nightclub that helped launch the career of Stevie Ray Vaughan and many others. In the two decades that have followed, Sue Foley has been busy touring and recording steadily, all while toting her signature pink paisley Fender Telecaster. In 2001, she won the prestigious Juno Award (Canadian equivalent of the Grammy) and also holds the record for the most Maple Blues Awards and has earned three Trophees de Blues de France. She has also garnered several nominations at the Blues Music Awards in Memphis, TN.\n\nWith 11 recordings under her own name, an instructional DVD and book, as well as various compilations and projects, Foley is set to release her new album, The Ice Queen (March 2, 2018) on Stony Plain Records. \u201cI\u2019m extremely excited to be working with Holger Petersen and Stony Plain Records. Holger is one of the most knowledgeable \u201creal music\u201d people in the business\u201d, says Foley. \u201cStony Plain is known to put out great music and I know The Ice Queen has found her home.\u201d\n\nRecorded throughout 2017, The Ice Queen represents Foley\u2019s full circle journey \u2013 her return to the roots of her career in Austin with producer Mike Flanigin. The album was recorded with her long-time friends and collaborators Jimmie Vaughan and Billy F Gibbons (ZZ Top) as well Chris \u2018Whipper\u2019 Layton from Double Trouble, Charlie Sexton, and members of the Tedeschi Trucks and Gary Clark Jr bands.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a teenager I idolized Jimmie Vaughan and Billy F Gibbons,\u201d Foley says. \u201cThey're both legends now so this feels like an historical event (at least it does for me). And I grew up sitting at the feet of players like George \u2018Big Beat\u2019 Rains, Derek O'Brien and The Texas Horns. I spent many nights watching Charlie Sexton and the Arc Angels with Chris Layton. I learned and grew more musically in my years in Austin than at any point in my life. The fact that all these mega talented musicians have graced my album is beyond anything I hoped for. I am still pinching myself.\u201d\n\nA flood of inspiration and themes can be found on each of the tracks \u2013 ranging from lost love, anguish, and struggle to release, forgiveness and rebirth. Mostly recorded live-off-the-floor, Foley\u2019s emotional vocal delivery, conviction, accessible yet inspired lyrics and intrepid guitar playing are all laid out, bare and raw for the songs to reveal.\n\nOpening with the radio friendly and funky \u201cCome to Me\u201d, The Ice Queen also features upbeat and rollicking tracks \u201cRun\u201d, \u201cThe Lucky ones\u201d (a duet with Jimmie Vaughan) and \u201cGaslight\u201d. There are several bluesy and soulful tracks including \u201c81\u201d, \u201cThe Ice Queen\u201d, \u201cFool's Gold\u201d (featuring Billy F Gibbons on vocals and harmonica)\u201d, \u201cIf I Have Forsaken You\u201d, and a cheeky, guitar-heavy cover of Bessie Smith\u2019s \u201cSend Me To The \u2018Lectric Chair\u201d. Foley also provides some more mellow and unexpected songs on The Ice Queen with the jazzy \u201cDeath of a Dream\u201d, the flamenco-blues hybrid \u201cThe Dance\u201d and a beautiful cover of the Carter Family\u2019s \u201cCannonball Blues\u201d.\n\nThe Ice Queen represents Sue Foley\u2019s indefatigable commitment to her craft, and her transparency with the journey that birthed her, further proving that\nyou can\u2019t keep a good blueswoman down, particularly when she is The Ice Queen.\n\nsuefoley.com", "otherInfo": "Texas Blues Party, the NEW weekly livestream show featuring Sue Foley & Mike Flanigin.

She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week. I only made it through one semester of college, but being around these amazing songwriters here in Austin\u2026 It\u2019s like getting an education.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Adam the Dancing Cowboy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10355685.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Professional Country DJ & Dance Instructor from the Bay Area.

It's a sound rooted in big melodies, blasts of brass, percussive punch, and old-school grooves, with songs that shine a light not only on frontwoman Alanna Quinn-Broadus' larger-than-life voice, but her songwriting chops, too.\n\nThe band formed in Nashville, where Alanna and guitarist Jared Colby relocated after cutting their teeth as working-class musicians in Boston. Once in Tennessee, they teamed up with drummer Matt Snow, and bassist Gabriel Golden, forming a core lineup that often swells to as many as ten members -- including backup vocalists and a two-piece horn section -- in concert. Together, the band looked beyond Nashville's country-filled past and, instead, took inspiration from Motown's soul, Stax's funky strut, and rock & roll's rebellion. Tattooed, brash, and unapologetically unique, they stood out in a town dominated by Americana music, charting a unique course whose highlights have since included an appearance at Bonnaroo, a string of cross-country shows supporting acts like Lee Fields and St. Paul and the Broken Bones, and an audience that celebrates the band's diversity.\n\nOn their fourth release, 2018's So Bad You Can Taste It, Alanna matches the brassy spirit of the band's previous records \u2014 including their full-length debut, Achilles \u2014 with rare vulnerability. There's still plenty of soulful stomp here, from the upbeat sweep of the record's lead single, \"I Know,\" to the funky fire of \"Giving It All Away.\" There's also a more mature, sober look at the demands thrust upon independent artists \u2014 or anyone's who's willing to chase down an uncertain horizon, no matter how rough the journey may be. With songs that examine the midpoint between desperation and drive, So Bad You Can Taste It is the band's most genuine work to date.\n\n\"There are mountains and valleys to any journey, and this record is about being in the valley,\" explains Alanna Quinn-Broadus. \"It's about the low moments. It's basically the opposite of someone's Instagram feed, because it's not a highlights reel. It's just real.\"\n\nLow moments notwithstanding, So Bad You Can Taste It marks a creative high for Alanna Royale, whose members recorded the record's six songs with producer Kelly Finnigan and engineer Mindy Watts across multiple studios. Joining them were guests like trombonist Nadav Nirenberg -- known for his work alongside artists like Wyclef Jean, Breakdown Brass, and Wu Tang -- as well as Kirk Donovan, Meggan Utech, and Alexis Saski. Working with this expanded crew, Alanna Royale carved out a song-based sound that targeted not only their audience's dancing shoes, but their heads and hearts, too. Songs like the powerful, poignant ballad \"I Used to Dream\" were reworked multiple times, resulting in a record that's nuanced, heartfelt, and unafraid to show off its own scars.\n\n\"The title, So Bad You Can Taste It, says it all,\" Alanna explains. \"This record is all about the idea of something that's in front of you, and you can see it and feel it, but it's just out of reach. That thing can be your sanity or your sobriety or your success. I sometimes think it's harder to see the light at the end of the tunnel, rather than not seeing any light at all. Once you know the possibility of light is there, you have no option but to go after it. That can be really hard and really dangerous\u2026which makes it really worthwhile to sing about.\"", "otherInfo": "hey dolls, i'm pairing up with the good people at Marathon Music Works for my very first live stream ever. the show will be free but of course, donations/tips are very much welcome. find more details at the FB event below. stay smart, stay safe. love you all. xx\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1216868255371665"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bonstone ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10342844.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Rock, Pop, Folk Rock, Power Pop", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bonstone is a group effort.

Sinclar started DJing in 1986, when he was just 18 years old, specializing in funk and hip-hop music, with the name Chris The French Kiss. His first club hit was Gym & Tonic, a track produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, featuring vocals illegally taken from a Jane Fonda fitness tape. The Bob Sinclar persona was based on a character from Philippe de Broca's film Le Magnifique.\n\nSinclar is famous for popularizing the \"french touch\" of house music, with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. His track \"Feel for You\", a tribute to french musician Cerrone, from his second album Champs Elys\u00e9es, hit #9 in the UK Top 40. On track \"Darlin'\", he worked with vocalist James \"D-Train\" Williams.\n\nSinclar has also worked under other pseudonyms. Under the aliases The Mighty Bop and Reminiscence Quartet, he has dabbled in hip-hop and acid jazz. He also created the Africanism project, where an ensemble of artists produce house music with a combination of latin, jazz, african and tribal flavors. In 2005 he scored a hit with his single \"Love Generation\", that reached #1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts and the German Media Control Single Charts in 2006. The song was a huge success throughout Europe, also peaking at no. 2 in the Dutch Top 40.

It only took eight years of waiting for one of the most unique artists to finally deliver a new dose of contemporary electro pyrotechnics and a worthy successor to the smashing Total. During those eight years, SebastiAn successfully completed a 360\u00b0 turn. Plus, it\u2019s been eight years of putting his talent to the good use of others (Frank Ocean, Philippe Katerine, Charlotte Gainsbourg) to help him get to where he wants to be today. From European electro to American R&B via classic pop, Thirst sets ablaze all genres. His taste for explosive mechanisms (like his well-known \u201cturbine\u201d techno sub-genre label-mates at Ed Banger) made Total an elegantly revolutionary debut album that captivatingly took things to the extreme, while being as frightening as a ticking bomb. But now, the wait is over. Thirst bursts forward providing an amazing opening to brand new worlds. This 14-track adventure narrates the journey of how he mastered machines, his own demons and even several time zones.\n\n\u201cThe general approach to this record corresponds to the time when Frank Ocean called me in Paris, telling me I had to be in Los Angeles the next day to work alongside him,\u201d reveals SebastiAn. \u201cAt the same time, I\u2019d met Charlotte Gainsbourg to produce her latest album. So I found myself working with these two opposing personalities: on one side you\u2019ve got Frank Ocean, who\u2019s ultra charismatic and fanciful, while on the other, Charlotte Gainsbourg is both an introvert yet so openly real. When Charlotte moved to New York, Frank landed in London, and so the work process suddenly switched. I found this really interesting. My record came about from all the encounters I made going between these two projects.\u201d The energy from such contrasts brought this project to life, provoking SebastiAn to call upon an impressive list of artists to feature on Thirst (Syd from The Internet, Mayer Hawthorne, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Allan Kingdom, Sevdaliza, Cautious Clay, Sunni Col\u00f2n, Sparks, Gallant and Loota). \u201cFrom Ed Banger to Jean-Louis Costes and Katerine, or Frank Ocean to Charlotte Gainsbourg, my music has always looked to build bridges,\u201d outlines the self-confessed fan of DJ Premier, Giorgio Moroder and Suicide, who\u2019s managed to bring different styles together as one on this record. From this head-on collision between cold European techno and the warm tones of R&B, hip-hop and American gospel comes a series of explosions which progressively topple towards unchartered territories. With a certain Slavic melancholy that\u2019s an homage to his roots, SebastiAn makes the single Beograd evolve from metronomic dirty disco to a melody of cinematographic stature worthy of De Roubaix, entangled in a Chopin-esque lamenting sonata. The art of SebastiAn is certainly the art of suspense. He\u2019s like a tightrope walker, juggling a balancing act from the intimate to the epic (just take Run For Me which is a tour de force), and from minimalism to baroque to create a mystical form of electronic music. Thirst has such a contemporary edge to it, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s not aiming for a total collision between music\u2019s major current trends (electro and R&B), but in fact he\u2019s looking to rearrange the rules, settling alight the history of pop (The Beach Boys-eque Better Now) and rock (Handcuffed To A Parking Meter reaching dizzying heights with his idols Sparks), and a certain classicism in a recurring dialogue between strings, piano and knob-twiddling machines.\n\nIn 2011, for the cover work for Total, Jean-Baptiste Mondino captured SebastiAn as a modern-day Narcissus, photographing the musician kissing his alter ego. Eight years later, the same photographer once again depicts the artist with his double, however this time the love affair has ended and it\u2019s fists up ready for a fight. To sum up this game of metaphors, Thirst is a beefed-up declaration of love - not of SebastiAn to himself, but to the world around him. Thirst leaves you thirsty for more.", "otherInfo": "Meditate with Stuart"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "M\u0100RTY de Lut\u0113ce ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SK Shlomo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10359643.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Beatbox, Electronic", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "After collaborating with Ed Sheeran, Bjork and Damon Albarn, award winning singer-songwriter, beatboxer, producer & live looping technologist SK Shlomo's acclaimed debut solo album 'Surrender' is out now raising #MentalHealthAwareness: http://skshlomo.com/listen", "otherInfo": "This Thursday, and for the next 6 Thursdays at 2pm BST, I'm launching a weekly livestream called Homeskool Beatbox Adventures to help isolated families and raise funds for NHS Charities Together.\n\nWe're partnering with 80 music venues to simulcast the livestream to thousands of homes worldwide, with weekly special guests including Basement Jaxx, Bastille, Bill Bailey, Jason Mraz, KT Tunstall and Radio 1\u2019s Dr Radha helping me to raise a target of \u00a32500 to help frontline staff, patients and families affected by COVID19.\n\nThe show will be livestreamed on our brand new beatboxadventures.com website, on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nAnd you can be part of the show!\n\nEach week I am inviting a virtual studio audience of up to 50 lucky families to join me in our digital theatre - also known as the \u2018Zoom Room\u2019.

She was a piano prodigy from the beginning, playing by ear at age 2 1/2, and writing her own songs by age 4. It's been said that by age 5, she could play anything on the piano after hearing it only once. She won a scholarship at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, Maryland - the youngest person ever to be admitted there. She often ran into trouble there, as they discouraged her from composing her own music. She was kicked out at age 11 for playing classic rock tunes from Led Zeppelin and The Beatles by ear, which the institute deemed unacceptable.\n\nShe started playing clubs at the age of 13, accompanied by her father as a chaperone, which continued through high school. In 1977, she won a local (Montgomery County, Maryland) talent contest. In 1980, at the age of 17, she even released her first single, Baltimore/Walking With You, on the MEA label (her initials). She received a citation from the mayor of Baltimore for the song.\n\nShe adopted the name Tori, also at the age of 17, after a friend remarked that she looked like a Tori. After graduating from high school, she performed at hotels (both old standards and some of her own material) while taking some music classes at a local college.\n\nIn 1984, at the age of 21, she moved out on her own to Hollywood. She played solo in clubs to earn money and did a few television commercials.\n\nIn 1987, she formed the pop band Y Kant Tori Read, and signed under Atlantic Records. In May of 1988, the debut album was released and proceeded to flop miserably. Even today, with Tori's success, Atlantic has kept this album out of publication at Tori's request. \"It was a different time; I was in a different place. Everything was over the top -- the high hair, everything. I was shopping at Retail Slut.\" Soon after, she decided to go back to the girl and her piano. In fall 1989, Atlantic gave her one more shot at doing an album. The next March, she gave them a tape of her songs and received the go-ahead to start recording. They later rejected the master tape, and she became even more determined.\n\nIn 1991 she wrote Me And A Gun a few hours before a show and performed it that night. In October of that year, it was released as a single. It was received well in the UK, and Atlantic decided to release her first album, Little Earthquakes, there. It debuted at #15 on the charts and was quickly followed up by a release in the US.\n\nHer second album, Under the Pink, was released in 1994. During production, Atlantic Records wanted to bring in a new producer for the album. However, as she liked her producer, this did not please her, and she threatened to burn her master tapes. Atlantic relented and ended up with another successful album. Soon after, she helped found R.A.I.N.N. - Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network.\n\nIn December of 1995, she distributed her single Caught a Lite Sneeze over the internet, which was the first single by any artist to be distributed in that manner. The rest of the album Boys for Pele was released in 1996. It received more notice by her parents - her father originally thought the song \"Father Lucifer\" was about him, and she was forced to explain that the song was derived from somewhere else completely. \"No! I was taking drugs with a South American shaman and I really did visit the Devil and I had a journey.\"\n\nLate in 1996, she discovered she was pregnant by Mark Hawley, one of the sound engineers of her Dew Drop Inn Tour. But two days before Christmas, she suffered a miscarriage, only three months into the pregnancy. The miscarriage provided the focus for a new set of songs, which became From The Choirgirl Hotel, her first album recorded with other musicians joining her live, going past the girl and her piano sound.\n\n\"The songs started coming not long after I miscarried. The strange thing is, the love doesn't go away for this being that you've carried. You can't go back to being the person you were before you carried life. And yet you're not a mother, either, and you still are connected to a force, a being. And I was trying to find ways to keep that communication going. Along the way on the search, sort of walking with the undead, I would run into these songs. The one thing they kept saying to me was I had to find a deep woman's rhythm. You begin to create where you can. If you can't create physical life, you find a life force. If that's in music, that's in music. I started to find this deep, primitive rhythm, and I started to move to it. And I held hands with sorrow, and I danced with her, and we giggled a bit. And this record really became about being alive enough to feel things, no matter what that is.\"\n\nIn February 1998, she was married to Mark in a small ceremony at the Church of St Lawrence in West Wycombe, England. Her father was there to give her away - which was a suprise to some, as the two have had a rocky relationship at times.\n\nTori released To Venus and Back in 1999, her first double album. The first disc contained fresh studio material, while the second disc claimed to capture some of the magic from her live performances. Many saw this 2-CD package as nothing more than a cynical marketing ploy that forced fans to purchase to two CD's just to hear an album worth of new material. Indeed, there was virtually nothing stylistically similar between the two disks that would warranted the bundling.\n\nOn September 5, 2000, Tori gave birth to her daughter, Natashya L\u00f3rien Hawley.\n\nIn 2001, Tori's sixth album, Strange Little Girls, was released. It consists of 12 covers of various songs, all originally written by men about women.\n\n2002 saw the release of her seventh album, Scarlet's Walk, released at the end of October. Some of the songs on the album come from stories that one set of her grandparents, who were eastern Cherokee, used to tell her as a child. Others were a result of, or at least influenced by, the events on September 11, 2001.\n\nIn 2003, Tori released Tales of a Librarian, a greatest hits collection for which she revisited many of her favorite songs as well as adding a few new songs for her fans.\n\n2005 presented us with The Beekeeper, a somewhat more accessible album than some of her earlier work. In conjunction with the album, Amos released an autobiography entitled Piece by Piece in February 2005; co-authored by rock music journalist Ann Powers, it delves deeply into Amos\u2019 obsession with mythology and religion. It explores her songwriting process while telling the story of her progression into fame.\n\nDuring 2005, Amos negotiated a contract with the Warner Bros. reissue imprint Rhino to release a string of reissues and compilations. The first release of the deal was the two-disc DVD set Fade to Red: The Video Collection in February 2006, which contained all but three of Amos' solo music videos, as well as behind-the-scenes footage and commentary. The contract continued in September 2006 with the release of the career-spanning five-disc box set A Piano: The Collection, celebrating Tori's 15-year solo career. The set includes various album songs, singles, remixes, alternate mixes, demos, outtakes, and a string of unreleased songs from album sessions - \"Ode to My Clothes,\" \"Peeping Tommi,\" \"Not David Bowie,\" \"Dolphin Song,\" and the much-mythologised \"Zero Point,\" which Tori mentioned in interviews as well as the liner notes to 1999's To Venus and Back. The collection is lavishly packaged to resemble a piano keyboard.\n\n\nTori is well known for her extremely dedicated fans, Toriphiles, and the 'Net fans Tori herself has nicknamed Ears With Feet. A group of these fans are due to her song, Me And A Gun, which has helped many deal with their own rapes. Michael Stipe, from R.E.M., once even remarked to Tori, \"Hey, can I borrow your audience?\"\n\nOne of her primary influences is Joni Mitchell. Another is Kate Bush. She is well known for her very enigmatic lyrics, especially on the newer albums. She's often said that she likes to challenge the fans, and knows they like it when she does.\n\nHer ninth studio album, American Doll Posse, was released on May 1st and the ensuing tour began on May 28 in Rome, Italy.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dash Berlin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10338199.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Music", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Top 25' Dash Berlin including the new singles 'Home' and 'Love Out Loud'!

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Laura Wyatt ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9451384.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Acoustic, Adult R&b, Soul Jazz, Jazz Blues, Country Gospel, Alt-country, Adult Contemporary, Adult Alternative, Country, Acoustic Blues", "Time": "6:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Laura Wyatt from Suffolk has recently returned to the original music scene.

We stoked the creative fires with 2017's 'Nightbringers' and it's gone much further now in 'Verminous',\" states vocalist Trevor Strnad. \"It's a very colorful, moody, and charismatic album that experiments with new sounds and ideas without losing the cutthroat Black Dahlia edge. There is a lot of minutiae to digest. Plenty of delicious little Easter eggs woven into the fabric of each song. Each one is a living, breathing entity that will stand on its own as some of the best music this band has ever created.\"\n\nThat this is a new phase for The Black Dahlia Murder is apparent as the compellingly filthy opening title track rumbles to life, and the album remains gripping for each of the nine tracks that follow. One of the most immediately evident evolutions is in how anthemic their ninth record is, the band inspiring fist-in-the-air responses, particularly in closing track \"Dawn Of Rats\". \"'Verminous' has got some really huge parts that I'm sure will resonate greatly with our fans. It was definitely intentional on our part - a band can only hope to write a song so good that it would be seen as an anthem.\" Likewise, there is more melancholy on the record, particularly on \"Removal Of The Oaken Stake\" and \"Sunless Empire\", adding another dimension to the band's sound and expanding the dark sonic palette with which they paint, all of this coming naturally. \"As usual, there was no discussion nor preemptive planning going into the album. We prefer to keep things completely organic and just let the music flow when the time is right. We just write what we write. I do however think it's been an underlying goal for the last several years to make more diverse music. We want an album to feel like a wild ride. A journey from beginning to end that has peaks and valleys.\"\n\nWhen it came to title the record, Strnad looked around at the scene he has helped nourish for two decades and found his inspiration. \"We, members of our beloved and hidden world of the heavy metal underground teeming just below the surface, are the verminous. The rats and roaches looming in the cracks and crevices of this fallen world. We are the pariahs that the world of normality finds loathsome and obscene. We are the carriers of a plague of knowledge so vile that it could bring the unsuspecting mankind to its knees. Always the underdogs. Our love for this music and what it means to our lives is foolishly underestimated.\" This ties into the lyrical themes that permeate the record, though not exclusively, Strnad not struggling to find subject matter that engaged him. \"The outside world of religion-warped 'normalcy' is the opposing viewpoint. We are the ultimate antagonist to their archaic ways of thought, the dreamers of the nightmares that shake them to their very core. Although we are but lowly vermin to them, the unseen and underestimated, our numbers are millions strong. We cast aside their ways and prefer to take solace in the hidden realm of the underground where the dark fruits of free thought can be enjoyed. We are our own Gods. The responsibility of our actions is ours alone.\" In his position, he is also able to both provide listeners with opportunities to exorcise compulsions toward exploring dark themes and find some personal release. \"Not unlike the appeal of a horror movie, there is a curiously dark side in all of us that can enjoy the occasional gaze through the eyes of the all-powerful masked killer. I enjoy taking the listener on such a ride. There is a certain catharsis in putting myself into the heart of each character I create. Where I lack power in my life, I channel it in my creations.\"\n\nWhile the drums were recorded at The Pipeyard in Plymouth, Michigan by ex-bassist and longtime studio guru Ryan \"Bart\" Williams, the bulk of the album was recorded in New Jersey at guitarist Brandon Ellis' home studio, the Shred Light District, then mixed by Tue Madsen and mastered by Alan Douches. Produced by Ellis and the band, Verminous sees Black Dahlia having a greater level of control over every facet of recording than on any previous release, enabling them to tweak and fine-tune all the small details right up until the point they sent it to Madsen in Denmark. \"To say we were anal-retentive would be an understatement. Tue did an outstanding job. His mix is organic. Classic sounding. Not too slick. It's got an old school 'real life' feel to it rather than being the overly polished quantized-to-hell drek that is coming out these days. We wanted the album's sound to have its own personality, and he helped us achieve just that. Finally, Alan did a great job of smoothing out the final details with his mastering. He beefed it up into what you hear now.\" The only other outside collaborators with which the band worked were soundscape artist Michael Ghelfi, who provided the sample that opens the record and \"sets the pest-ridden vibe\", and Juanjo Castellano, who painted the cover. \"It's amazing and classically death metal cover artwork. I call it an evil underground sewer world, home to the verminous ones. If you look closely you can find all kinds of rats and bugs and critters scattered throughout. The amount of detail Juanjo put in there is second to none.\"\n\nAs has been their MO since inception, the band intend to tour the record hard, planning on being on the road with Verminous for the next two to three years, as long as the demand is there. Having had very successful tours with Whitechapel and Meshuggah on the Nightbringers cycle, as well as converting some newbies to the Black Dahlia cause while out with Black Label Society and Insomnium, they look forward to the challenge of playing the increasingly complex music in which they deal. \"It's like a drug, the challenge of it all. There is a masochistic thrill in performing this technically demanding music that you just can't get anywhere else. We are a live band through and through. We live to destroy ourselves onstage every night. We give one hundred and ten percent every time and drain ourselves until there is nothing left to give.

One of our most compelling singers, she is at home in R&B but made her mark in country, bringing the entire spectrum of popular music to bear on music she calls \u201cSouthern Soul.\u201d\n\nHer new album, Revival, is her most powerful work to date. The product of a mature artistic vision, laser-focused social consciousness, and a voice with the power and grace only experience can bring, it is also her most important work. Revival finds Rissi dealing with some of the most pressing issues of the times, as well as with the personal realms of love, loss, and identity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most personal things I\u2019ve written and recorded,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything I write is personal, but I feel like I\u2019m in a place of being really honest and transparent with people, because that\u2019s what I like in an artist. That\u2019s what I look for; those are the people I\u2019m interested in, and I want to do that same thing for others.\u201d\n\nThe first single from the project, \u201cSeeds,\u201d along with its riveting video, finds Rissi taking an unflinching look at tensions as old as humanity and as fresh as today\u2019s headlines, with a message that joins biblical themes and modern equality movements. \u201cSeeds\u201d celebrates human freedom and dignity in the face of oppression, counseling understanding and communication in a spirit of hope and unity.\n\n\u201c\u2018Seeds\u2019 is a crowd favorite and has been since I wrote it,\u201d she says, \u201cand so it was the first thing I recorded and put out from this record. It\u2019s the first thing you hear on the album and it sets the tone for everything else you\u2019re about to hear.\u201d\n\nTwo of the other key tracks are \u201cSoul Message,\u201d written just after she married her husband Bryan, and the powerful \u201cYou Were Here,\u201d written after her miscarriage.\n\n\u201c\u2018Soul Message\u2019 is the only love song on this album, and having been married now for nine years I feel like this is pretty expressive of what marriage is. There are times when all you can do is dig deeper and reach out to each other from a visceral soul place because regular communication is not getting it. It\u2019s one of my favorite songs on the record, and I love the production that Brian Owens, my producer, came up with. It just totally fits, with this kind of old Muscle Shoals-ish vibe. \u2018You Were Here\u2019 is probably one of the hardest songs I\u2019ve ever written. Thank God for my cowriters Deanna Walker and Rick Beresford\u2014I think I sobbed the entire time we wrote it. I was struck by how many of my friends have experienced this and don\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s a profoundly lonely experience even if you have a partner, and I just didn\u2019t want people to feel alone anymore.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the project reflects Rissi\u2019s engagement with a world clearly in need of uplift, with songs of exhortation like \u201cBreathe In\u201d and \u201cRevival,\u201d and of compassion and hope, as in \u201cLittle Black Boy, Little Black Girl.\u201d\n\nThe daughter of Georgia natives, Rissi was born near Pittsburgh and spent her adolescent years in Missouri. Raised in a musical family that loved both country and R&B, she sang in a singing and dancing troupe sponsored by a local television station at 16. She was offered her first publishing and label deals at 19, and in 2007 released the album Rissi Palmer, charting with the singles, \u201cCountry Girl,\u201d \u201cHold On To Me,\u201d and \u201cNo Air.\u201d She followed with a Christmas single, an independently released children\u2019s album, Best Day Ever, and an EP called The Back Porch Sessions.\n\nRissi has performed at The White House, Lincoln Center, and the Grand Ole Opry, has appeared on Oprah & Friends, CNN, the CBS Early Show, and the Tavis Smiley Show.

In 2012 she joined an all-star collaboration called The Wandering, composed of Amy, Luther Dickinson, Shannon McNally, Sharde Thomas and Valerie June. They released Go On Now, You Can\u2019t Stay Here (Songs Of The South, 2012) to critical acclaim and sold out shows.\n\nIn the afterglow of The Wandering, Amy and Shannon McNally hit the road together and released an EP titled Chasing the Ghost, The Rehearsal Sessions (Archer Records, 2012) which featured songs from both artists recorded live during rehearsals for the tour.\n\nAmy next paired up with noted rocker John Paul Keith to create Motel Mirrors. Their styles clearly complemented one another, which made for magic on stage and in the recording studio. Their eponymous vinyl EP release was named one of the \u201c10 Essential Albums of 2013\u201d by No Depression.\n\nAlthough she\u2019s a singer and songwriter first, Amy is also an actress. In 2005 she was cast in the role of Wanda Jackson in the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line (Twentieth Century Fox). Since she has appeared in a variety of independent and studio productions: Black Snake Moan (Paramount, 2006), $5 Cover (MTV, 2009), Woman\u2019s Picture (2011) The Romance of Loneliness (2012) and most recently with Grace Zabriski in Only Child (2015).\n\nIn 2017 Amy is keeping a busy tour schedule and writing songs for a new album to be recorded later in the year. Watch for a new Motel Mirrors album to be released on Last Chance Records in the spring of 2017.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jon Cleary ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10363916.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "New Orleans Piano, Funk, New Orleans Funk And Groove", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jon Cleary\u2019s love and affinity for New Orleans music goes back to the rural British village of Cranbrook, Kent, where he was raised in a musical family. Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jessa Campbell & the Saplings ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9059060.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Kindie, Folk", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jessa Campbell is an Oregon-based performer who bridges the worlds of music and ecology by enchanting young audiences with the wonders of nature through her songs!

She was a piano prodigy from the beginning, playing by ear at age 2 1/2, and writing her own songs by age 4. It's been said that by age 5, she could play anything on the piano after hearing it only once. She won a scholarship at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, Maryland - the youngest person ever to be admitted there. She often ran into trouble there, as they discouraged her from composing her own music. She was kicked out at age 11 for playing classic rock tunes from Led Zeppelin and The Beatles by ear, which the institute deemed unacceptable.\n\nShe started playing clubs at the age of 13, accompanied by her father as a chaperone, which continued through high school. In 1977, she won a local (Montgomery County, Maryland) talent contest. In 1980, at the age of 17, she even released her first single, Baltimore/Walking With You, on the MEA label (her initials). She received a citation from the mayor of Baltimore for the song.\n\nShe adopted the name Tori, also at the age of 17, after a friend remarked that she looked like a Tori. After graduating from high school, she performed at hotels (both old standards and some of her own material) while taking some music classes at a local college.\n\nIn 1984, at the age of 21, she moved out on her own to Hollywood. She played solo in clubs to earn money and did a few television commercials.\n\nIn 1987, she formed the pop band Y Kant Tori Read, and signed under Atlantic Records. In May of 1988, the debut album was released and proceeded to flop miserably. Even today, with Tori's success, Atlantic has kept this album out of publication at Tori's request. \"It was a different time; I was in a different place. Everything was over the top -- the high hair, everything. I was shopping at Retail Slut.\" Soon after, she decided to go back to the girl and her piano. In fall 1989, Atlantic gave her one more shot at doing an album. The next March, she gave them a tape of her songs and received the go-ahead to start recording. They later rejected the master tape, and she became even more determined.\n\nIn 1991 she wrote Me And A Gun a few hours before a show and performed it that night. In October of that year, it was released as a single. It was received well in the UK, and Atlantic decided to release her first album, Little Earthquakes, there. It debuted at #15 on the charts and was quickly followed up by a release in the US.\n\nHer second album, Under the Pink, was released in 1994. During production, Atlantic Records wanted to bring in a new producer for the album. However, as she liked her producer, this did not please her, and she threatened to burn her master tapes. Atlantic relented and ended up with another successful album. Soon after, she helped found R.A.I.N.N. - Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network.\n\nIn December of 1995, she distributed her single Caught a Lite Sneeze over the internet, which was the first single by any artist to be distributed in that manner. The rest of the album Boys for Pele was released in 1996. It received more notice by her parents - her father originally thought the song \"Father Lucifer\" was about him, and she was forced to explain that the song was derived from somewhere else completely. \"No! I was taking drugs with a South American shaman and I really did visit the Devil and I had a journey.\"\n\nLate in 1996, she discovered she was pregnant by Mark Hawley, one of the sound engineers of her Dew Drop Inn Tour. But two days before Christmas, she suffered a miscarriage, only three months into the pregnancy. The miscarriage provided the focus for a new set of songs, which became From The Choirgirl Hotel, her first album recorded with other musicians joining her live, going past the girl and her piano sound.\n\n\"The songs started coming not long after I miscarried. The strange thing is, the love doesn't go away for this being that you've carried. You can't go back to being the person you were before you carried life. And yet you're not a mother, either, and you still are connected to a force, a being. And I was trying to find ways to keep that communication going. Along the way on the search, sort of walking with the undead, I would run into these songs. The one thing they kept saying to me was I had to find a deep woman's rhythm. You begin to create where you can. If you can't create physical life, you find a life force. If that's in music, that's in music. I started to find this deep, primitive rhythm, and I started to move to it. And I held hands with sorrow, and I danced with her, and we giggled a bit. And this record really became about being alive enough to feel things, no matter what that is.\"\n\nIn February 1998, she was married to Mark in a small ceremony at the Church of St Lawrence in West Wycombe, England. Her father was there to give her away - which was a suprise to some, as the two have had a rocky relationship at times.\n\nTori released To Venus and Back in 1999, her first double album. The first disc contained fresh studio material, while the second disc claimed to capture some of the magic from her live performances. Many saw this 2-CD package as nothing more than a cynical marketing ploy that forced fans to purchase to two CD's just to hear an album worth of new material. Indeed, there was virtually nothing stylistically similar between the two disks that would warranted the bundling.\n\nOn September 5, 2000, Tori gave birth to her daughter, Natashya L\u00f3rien Hawley.\n\nIn 2001, Tori's sixth album, Strange Little Girls, was released. It consists of 12 covers of various songs, all originally written by men about women.\n\n2002 saw the release of her seventh album, Scarlet's Walk, released at the end of October. Some of the songs on the album come from stories that one set of her grandparents, who were eastern Cherokee, used to tell her as a child. Others were a result of, or at least influenced by, the events on September 11, 2001.\n\nIn 2003, Tori released Tales of a Librarian, a greatest hits collection for which she revisited many of her favorite songs as well as adding a few new songs for her fans.\n\n2005 presented us with The Beekeeper, a somewhat more accessible album than some of her earlier work. In conjunction with the album, Amos released an autobiography entitled Piece by Piece in February 2005; co-authored by rock music journalist Ann Powers, it delves deeply into Amos\u2019 obsession with mythology and religion. It explores her songwriting process while telling the story of her progression into fame.\n\nDuring 2005, Amos negotiated a contract with the Warner Bros. reissue imprint Rhino to release a string of reissues and compilations. The first release of the deal was the two-disc DVD set Fade to Red: The Video Collection in February 2006, which contained all but three of Amos' solo music videos, as well as behind-the-scenes footage and commentary. The contract continued in September 2006 with the release of the career-spanning five-disc box set A Piano: The Collection, celebrating Tori's 15-year solo career. The set includes various album songs, singles, remixes, alternate mixes, demos, outtakes, and a string of unreleased songs from album sessions - \"Ode to My Clothes,\" \"Peeping Tommi,\" \"Not David Bowie,\" \"Dolphin Song,\" and the much-mythologised \"Zero Point,\" which Tori mentioned in interviews as well as the liner notes to 1999's To Venus and Back. The collection is lavishly packaged to resemble a piano keyboard.\n\n\nTori is well known for her extremely dedicated fans, Toriphiles, and the 'Net fans Tori herself has nicknamed Ears With Feet. A group of these fans are due to her song, Me And A Gun, which has helped many deal with their own rapes. Michael Stipe, from R.E.M., once even remarked to Tori, \"Hey, can I borrow your audience?\"\n\nOne of her primary influences is Joni Mitchell. Another is Kate Bush. She is well known for her very enigmatic lyrics, especially on the newer albums. She's often said that she likes to challenge the fans, and knows they like it when she does.\n\nHer ninth studio album, American Doll Posse, was released on May 1st and the ensuing tour began on May 28 in Rome, Italy.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dash Berlin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10338199.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Music", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Top 25' Dash Berlin including the new singles 'Home' and 'Love Out Loud'!

We stoked the creative fires with 2017's 'Nightbringers' and it's gone much further now in 'Verminous',\" states vocalist Trevor Strnad. \"It's a very colorful, moody, and charismatic album that experiments with new sounds and ideas without losing the cutthroat Black Dahlia edge. There is a lot of minutiae to digest. Plenty of delicious little Easter eggs woven into the fabric of each song. Each one is a living, breathing entity that will stand on its own as some of the best music this band has ever created.\"\n\nThat this is a new phase for The Black Dahlia Murder is apparent as the compellingly filthy opening title track rumbles to life, and the album remains gripping for each of the nine tracks that follow. One of the most immediately evident evolutions is in how anthemic their ninth record is, the band inspiring fist-in-the-air responses, particularly in closing track \"Dawn Of Rats\". \"'Verminous' has got some really huge parts that I'm sure will resonate greatly with our fans. It was definitely intentional on our part - a band can only hope to write a song so good that it would be seen as an anthem.\" Likewise, there is more melancholy on the record, particularly on \"Removal Of The Oaken Stake\" and \"Sunless Empire\", adding another dimension to the band's sound and expanding the dark sonic palette with which they paint, all of this coming naturally. \"As usual, there was no discussion nor preemptive planning going into the album. We prefer to keep things completely organic and just let the music flow when the time is right. We just write what we write. I do however think it's been an underlying goal for the last several years to make more diverse music. We want an album to feel like a wild ride. A journey from beginning to end that has peaks and valleys.\"\n\nWhen it came to title the record, Strnad looked around at the scene he has helped nourish for two decades and found his inspiration. \"We, members of our beloved and hidden world of the heavy metal underground teeming just below the surface, are the verminous. The rats and roaches looming in the cracks and crevices of this fallen world. We are the pariahs that the world of normality finds loathsome and obscene. We are the carriers of a plague of knowledge so vile that it could bring the unsuspecting mankind to its knees. Always the underdogs. Our love for this music and what it means to our lives is foolishly underestimated.\" This ties into the lyrical themes that permeate the record, though not exclusively, Strnad not struggling to find subject matter that engaged him. \"The outside world of religion-warped 'normalcy' is the opposing viewpoint. We are the ultimate antagonist to their archaic ways of thought, the dreamers of the nightmares that shake them to their very core. Although we are but lowly vermin to them, the unseen and underestimated, our numbers are millions strong. We cast aside their ways and prefer to take solace in the hidden realm of the underground where the dark fruits of free thought can be enjoyed. We are our own Gods. The responsibility of our actions is ours alone.\" In his position, he is also able to both provide listeners with opportunities to exorcise compulsions toward exploring dark themes and find some personal release. \"Not unlike the appeal of a horror movie, there is a curiously dark side in all of us that can enjoy the occasional gaze through the eyes of the all-powerful masked killer. I enjoy taking the listener on such a ride. There is a certain catharsis in putting myself into the heart of each character I create. Where I lack power in my life, I channel it in my creations.\"\n\nWhile the drums were recorded at The Pipeyard in Plymouth, Michigan by ex-bassist and longtime studio guru Ryan \"Bart\" Williams, the bulk of the album was recorded in New Jersey at guitarist Brandon Ellis' home studio, the Shred Light District, then mixed by Tue Madsen and mastered by Alan Douches. Produced by Ellis and the band, Verminous sees Black Dahlia having a greater level of control over every facet of recording than on any previous release, enabling them to tweak and fine-tune all the small details right up until the point they sent it to Madsen in Denmark. \"To say we were anal-retentive would be an understatement. Tue did an outstanding job. His mix is organic. Classic sounding. Not too slick. It's got an old school 'real life' feel to it rather than being the overly polished quantized-to-hell drek that is coming out these days. We wanted the album's sound to have its own personality, and he helped us achieve just that. Finally, Alan did a great job of smoothing out the final details with his mastering. He beefed it up into what you hear now.\" The only other outside collaborators with which the band worked were soundscape artist Michael Ghelfi, who provided the sample that opens the record and \"sets the pest-ridden vibe\", and Juanjo Castellano, who painted the cover. \"It's amazing and classically death metal cover artwork. I call it an evil underground sewer world, home to the verminous ones. If you look closely you can find all kinds of rats and bugs and critters scattered throughout. The amount of detail Juanjo put in there is second to none.\"\n\nAs has been their MO since inception, the band intend to tour the record hard, planning on being on the road with Verminous for the next two to three years, as long as the demand is there. Having had very successful tours with Whitechapel and Meshuggah on the Nightbringers cycle, as well as converting some newbies to the Black Dahlia cause while out with Black Label Society and Insomnium, they look forward to the challenge of playing the increasingly complex music in which they deal. \"It's like a drug, the challenge of it all. There is a masochistic thrill in performing this technically demanding music that you just can't get anywhere else. We are a live band through and through. We live to destroy ourselves onstage every night. We give one hundred and ten percent every time and drain ourselves until there is nothing left to give. It's a good pain and I wouldn't do things any other way.\"", "otherInfo": "The Black Dahlia Murder live from Boston\nNoon PT: Facebook, YouTube, and Twitch\ntwitch.tv/metalbladeofficial"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rissi Palmer ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10115523.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Southern Soul", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Rissi Palmer's gift lies in reaching across boundaries. One of our most compelling singers, she is at home in R&B but made her mark in country, bringing the entire spectrum of popular music to bear on music she calls \u201cSouthern Soul.\u201d\n\nHer new album, Revival, is her most powerful work to date. The product of a mature artistic vision, laser-focused social consciousness, and a voice with the power and grace only experience can bring, it is also her most important work. Revival finds Rissi dealing with some of the most pressing issues of the times, as well as with the personal realms of love, loss, and identity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most personal things I\u2019ve written and recorded,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything I write is personal, but I feel like I\u2019m in a place of being really honest and transparent with people, because that\u2019s what I like in an artist. That\u2019s what I look for; those are the people I\u2019m interested in, and I want to do that same thing for others.\u201d\n\nThe first single from the project, \u201cSeeds,\u201d along with its riveting video, finds Rissi taking an unflinching look at tensions as old as humanity and as fresh as today\u2019s headlines, with a message that joins biblical themes and modern equality movements. \u201cSeeds\u201d celebrates human freedom and dignity in the face of oppression, counseling understanding and communication in a spirit of hope and unity.\n\n\u201c\u2018Seeds\u2019 is a crowd favorite and has been since I wrote it,\u201d she says, \u201cand so it was the first thing I recorded and put out from this record. It\u2019s the first thing you hear on the album and it sets the tone for everything else you\u2019re about to hear.\u201d\n\nTwo of the other key tracks are \u201cSoul Message,\u201d written just after she married her husband Bryan, and the powerful \u201cYou Were Here,\u201d written after her miscarriage.\n\n\u201c\u2018Soul Message\u2019 is the only love song on this album, and having been married now for nine years I feel like this is pretty expressive of what marriage is. There are times when all you can do is dig deeper and reach out to each other from a visceral soul place because regular communication is not getting it. It\u2019s one of my favorite songs on the record, and I love the production that Brian Owens, my producer, came up with. It just totally fits, with this kind of old Muscle Shoals-ish vibe. \u2018You Were Here\u2019 is probably one of the hardest songs I\u2019ve ever written. Thank God for my cowriters Deanna Walker and Rick Beresford\u2014I think I sobbed the entire time we wrote it. I was struck by how many of my friends have experienced this and don\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s a profoundly lonely experience even if you have a partner, and I just didn\u2019t want people to feel alone anymore.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the project reflects Rissi\u2019s engagement with a world clearly in need of uplift, with songs of exhortation like \u201cBreathe In\u201d and \u201cRevival,\u201d and of compassion and hope, as in \u201cLittle Black Boy, Little Black Girl.\u201d\n\nThe daughter of Georgia natives, Rissi was born near Pittsburgh and spent her adolescent years in Missouri. Raised in a musical family that loved both country and R&B, she sang in a singing and dancing troupe sponsored by a local television station at 16. She was offered her first publishing and label deals at 19, and in 2007 released the album Rissi Palmer, charting with the singles, \u201cCountry Girl,\u201d \u201cHold On To Me,\u201d and \u201cNo Air.\u201d She followed with a Christmas single, an independently released children\u2019s album, Best Day Ever, and an EP called The Back Porch Sessions.\n\nRissi has performed at The White House, Lincoln Center, and the Grand Ole Opry, has appeared on Oprah & Friends, CNN, the CBS Early Show, and the Tavis Smiley Show. She has shared stages with Taylor Swift, The Eagles, Chris Young, and Charley Crockett, and she has been featured in Rolling Stone, The Wall Street Journal, People, Parade, Ebony, Newsweek, and The Huffington Post", "otherInfo": "In this new normal that everyone's living in, there are still challenges for a lot of people, not least musicians and artists that rely on revenue from tours to pay bills, eat food, and keep going in their chosen profession.

On Hallelujah, Amy and Will capture the immediacy of the live show they developed on the road together, reveling in a more stripped-down sound and celebrating the freedoms and limitations that come with it in stunning form. No Depression said simply: \u201cpure bliss.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her solo records and a tireless touring schedule, Amy enjoys collaborating with other artists. In 2012 she joined an all-star collaboration called The Wandering, composed of Amy, Luther Dickinson, Shannon McNally, Sharde Thomas and Valerie June. They released Go On Now, You Can\u2019t Stay Here (Songs Of The South, 2012) to critical acclaim and sold out shows.\n\nIn the afterglow of The Wandering, Amy and Shannon McNally hit the road together and released an EP titled Chasing the Ghost, The Rehearsal Sessions (Archer Records, 2012) which featured songs from both artists recorded live during rehearsals for the tour.\n\nAmy next paired up with noted rocker John Paul Keith to create Motel Mirrors. Their styles clearly complemented one another, which made for magic on stage and in the recording studio. Their eponymous vinyl EP release was named one of the \u201c10 Essential Albums of 2013\u201d by No Depression.\n\nAlthough she\u2019s a singer and songwriter first, Amy is also an actress. In 2005 she was cast in the role of Wanda Jackson in the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line (Twentieth Century Fox). Since she has appeared in a variety of independent and studio productions: Black Snake Moan (Paramount, 2006), $5 Cover (MTV, 2009), Woman\u2019s Picture (2011) The Romance of Loneliness (2012) and most recently with Grace Zabriski in Only Child (2015).\n\nIn 2017 Amy is keeping a busy tour schedule and writing songs for a new album to be recorded later in the year.

As a writer, producer and vocalist, Boisseau(pronounced \u201cboy-so\u201d) has been honing his craft since childhood and embracing opportunities that have helped him build his musical career. The culmination of his lifelong musical journey and passion all lie within the contemporary fusion of modern-day R&B, hip-hop and jazz to comprise his forthcoming debut set, Back To Love.\nBoisseau\u2019stalent was first recognized and encouraged in his home in Richmond, Virginia, where the musician grew up with combination of musical influence from the church, to his own classical instrument trainings, to the beginning of hip-hop era. Music was constantly playing in his home; from a young age, he trained on the family piano while also enjoying the classics from his mother\u2019s and grandmother\u2019s generations. And as part of the first generation to grow up on hip-hop, it was inevitable that the quick-mind, clever and talented Bee was drawn to its sound. He developed his craft wherever he could, from recitals to rap battles, and found a love for performing front of an audience. Consequently, his passion and fixation on music and performance followed him to college, where he focused on his keyboard and began playing gigs. The beauty in the range of music that inspired him, coupled with the applause of the crowd enlivened Bee to seek music as his profession.\nBoisseaubegan his career as a professional performer as the keyboardist for The Fuzz Band in Virginia, leading him to play for the likes of Lauryn Hill, Faith Evans, Avant, Jill Scott and other neo-soul heavyweights. As his demand and networking circle grew, Bee made firm connections and soon found himself propositioned with the opportunity to do shows in Denver, Colorado. His musical path transitioned to smooth jazz in Denver as he gained connections and respect in the smooth-jazz circuit, performing in there for nearly ten years. Bee played with major smooth-jazz artists like Nick Colionne, Gerald Albright and Jakiem Joyner, ultimately leading him to New York and meeting Raheem DeVaughn.\nBOISSEAU\u2019s soon-to-be-released Back To Love, from DMG serves, as an introduction to his multifaceted talents and musically-rich \u201cjazz-soul-hop\u201d sound. The album has something to titillate the ears of all contemporary music lovers.

He has collaborated with a wide range of artists, filmmakers and legendary musicians. But it is his work as a leader that has garnered increasing attention and accolades. The New York Times described Frisell\u2019s music this way. \u201cIt's hard to find a more fruitful meditation on American music than in the compositions of guitarist Bill Frisell. Mixing rock and country with jazz and blues, he's found what connects them: improvisation and a sense of play. Unlike other pastichists, who tend to duck passion, Mr. Frisell plays up the pleasure in the music and also takes on another often-avoided subject, tenderness.\"\n\nFrisell\u2019s recordings over the last decades span a wide range of musical influences. His catalog, including over twenty recordings for Nonesuch, has been cited by Downbeat as \u201cthe best recorded output of the decade.\u201d It includes original Buster Keaton film scores to arrangements of music for extended ensemble with horns (This Land, Blues Dream); adaptations of his compositions originally written as sound-tracks to Gary Larson cartoons (Quartet); interpretations of work by other classic and contemporary American composers (Have a Little Faith) ; and collaborations with the acclaimed rhythm section of bassist Viktor Krauss and drummer Jim Keltner (Gone, Just Like a Train, Good Dog, Happy Man). Other releases include an album with Nashville musicians (Nashville), the solo album Ghost Town, an album of his arrangements of songs by Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach (The Sweetest Punch), a trio album with jazz legends Dave Holland and Elvin Jones, and a collection of American traditional songs and original compositions inspired by them entitled The Willies. The Intercontinentals, nominated for a Grammy in 2004 is an album that combines Frisell\u2019s own brand of American roots music and his unmistakable improvisational style with the influences of Brazilian, Greek, and Malian sounds. His 2004 release, entitled Unspeakable, produced by Hal Wilner, won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album. East/West is a two CD set, featuring his two working trios recorded in concert on both coasts. Bill Frisell, Ron Carter, Paul Motian features two jazz legends that Bill considers among his true mentors and musical inspirations. His collaborative project Floratone (Blue Note) with drummer Matt Chamberlain and producers Lee Townsend & Tucker Martine, was described by All About Jazz as \u201ca modern masterpiece.\u201d History, Mystery was nominated for a Grammy award in Best Instrumental Jazz category, featuring an octet of strings, horns and rhythm section with some of his closest music collaborators exploring a fuller palette of compositional colors and timbres than any he has previously written for. \u201cThe whole album stands as yet another testament to the man's place at the very epicenter of modern American music.\" - BBC. The recent collection titled The Best of Bill Frisell, Vol 1: Folk Songs is the first in a series of compilations, this one drawn from Frisell's catalog spotlighting his idiosyncratic excursions into country and traditional folk. His latest album, \u201cDisfarmer\u201d, was inspired by the photographer Mike Disfarmer. It was described by the Houston Chronicle as follows: \"Frisell's pacing is magnificent, and the album sweeps along with purpose like a gorgeous, spacious epic. It is full of sounds that suggest settings and characters, including the mysterious eccentric who inspired the recording.\"\n\nBeginning in 2008, a trilogy of Frisell\u2019s music DVD\u2019s was released.

Labels like Schematic in Miami, Interdimensional Transmissions from Detroit & Viewlexx out of The Hague set the foundation for Daze. Daniel Gomez adopted his Daze moniker early on at his mother\u2019s suggestion. Practicing on a set-up she bought him, Daze was spinning at weddings by age 14, funneling his earnings into vinyl to play raves on the side. That eventually led to producing his first tracks in 2004 on a cracked version of Fruity Loops and later that year, he jumpstarted a electro / techno white label called Omniamm. Daze\u2019s risk-taking & punk approach is at the core of everything he does and it\u2019s a big part of the ethos of his current label, Omnidisc. \"We're not searching for chart topping hits. We\u2019re more interested in curating a catalog of music you\u2019ll remember when you walk out the door. We seek out tracks that are as raw as possible & welcome imperfections. We love the charm of an unpolished record\u201d, says Daze. It\u2019s also this freeform & experimental approach together with an element of surprise that sets him apart from the pack as both a DJ & Producer. As a DJ, he prefers to express his versatility across long sets. He is known to cut & weave from Electro to Techno into Italo Disco, into a record by Yazoo deliberately intended to provoke a reaction. \u201cI once played a Paula Abdul record at Berghain\u2026 basically, it\u2019s like it or leave it,\u201d says Daze. As a producer, his output ranges from releases on Kompakt\u2019s Speicher series, to remixes on Phantasy, Comeme, Monkeytown & more\u2026 but he also reaches far beyond techno & has created original runway soundtracks for award winning American streetwear designer John Elliott & the Australian brand Song for the Mute. \"I\u2019m obsessed with the detailed manipulation of audio. It\u2019s at the core of how I make music & I constantly feel the need to involve myself with projects that challenge & allow me to think out of the box... whether it\u2019s creating a single recognizable noise for the new MacBook, or an advert for a fashion campaign blending original music with sound design,\u201d says Daze. Danny Daze\u2019s radical approach to preserving music\u2019s integrity while breaking its boundaries may seem volatile, but it\u2019s not random. \u201cI\u2019ve always gone against the grain & it\u2019s important for everything I do to feel authentic.

They were later joined by Tony to become Above & Beyond.\n\nAnjunabeats was formed when Jono Grant and Paavo Siljamaki met at Westminster University and discovered a mutual love of electronic music. The pair kicked off the label in 2000 with \u2018Anjunabeats Volume 1\u2019, a massive club success which instantly ear-pricked the likes of Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold and Paul van Dyk. The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label. It provided the perfect outlet for their numerous production projects \u2013 Oceanlab, Aalto, Freestate, Nitromethane, POS, Rollerball and Tranquillity Base \u2013 and every release was warmly received by elite DJ\u2019s and club-goers across the globe.\n\nIn late 2002 James Grant joined the Anjunabeats management team and the label began to expand its output, signing a series of fresh artists. The first external track to be released was Rusch and Murray\u2019s much talked about \u2018Epic\u2019 \u2013 a track made entirely across Internet forums by two producers who\u2019ve never met \u2013, with subsequent signings including Finnish trance maestro Super8 (who later joined forces with DJ Tab), talented UK duo Smith & Pledger and Dutch Deep Tech Genius, Stephen J.Kroos.\n\nSince then, the roster has expanded to over 30 artists and Anjunabeats has earned a reputation as one the most consistent dance labels in the world, with its releases proving to be essential tools for many of the world's top DJs. In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

On the album, songwriter Lauren Denitzio (they/them) addresses themes of reconstructing and reexamining relationships as they relate to the current zeitgeist. \u201cI thought a lot about how the state of the world makes any sort of partnership stressful. The album is partially autobiographical but it\u2019s also addressing more universal questions that people have to ask these days. Do we have kids? Do we move to a place that could be underwater in 20 years? How does having no idea how you\u2019ll ever retire affect planning your future?\u201d\n\nSonically, the new album does an incredible job of reflecting these anxieties. To help capture the band\u2019s fresh sound, Denitzio recruited veteran producer John Agnello, best known for his work with some of indie rock\u2019s most influential acts such as Sonic Youth, Kurt Vile, Alvvays, and Dinosaur Jr. Agnello recorded with Worriers over 11 days in Jersey City, NJ at Kaleidoscope Sound and in Brooklyn, NY at Russell Street Recording. On the album, Denitzio is joined by new guitarist Frank Piegaro, and longtime drummer Mikey Erg and bassist Nick Psillas. Unlike their previous releases, 2015\u2019s Imaginary Life (Don Giovanni) and 2017\u2019s Survival Pop (Side One Dummy/reissued by 6131 Records), the band recorded the majority of the album live in the studio.

Live they seriously pack a punch and are noted for their impassioned songs about sexism, feminism and everyday life-isms.

Founding members, Nadia Javed (guitar/lead vox) and Beverley Ishmael (drums) recruited Harriet Doveton (bass/vox) in 2011. The following year they were spotted by Kate Nash and supported her UK and European tours, building up their fan base of \u2018Tutters\u2019 wherever they went. Kate Nash raved \u2018they are currently the best UK band I\u2019ve seen live in a really long time\u2019. These tours were notably an all-female rock experience that celebrated feminism in the unapologetic 1990s \u2018Riot Grrrl\u2019 tradition.

Studio album No.6 - \u2018WAX\u2019 - the 2nd in a trilogy, out now.\n\nSince scoring a worldwide smash with her debut album \u2018Eye To The Telescope\u2019 in 2004, which went on to sell over 5 million copies, KT Tunstall has remained at the forefront of UK singer- songwriter talent. Over the next decade, three further critically acclaimed albums followed; \u2018Drastic Fantastic\u2019, \u2018Tiger Suit\u2019 and \u2018Invisible Empire//Crescent Moon\u2019 in 2007, 2010 and 2013 respectively, keeping the platinum sales rolling and cementing the Scottish singer-songwriter\u2019s reputation as a major recording talent, as well as a mesmerising live artist.\n\nTunstall has toured the world many times over. She outsold every other female artist in the UK in 2005, won the 2006 Brit Award for Best British Female Solo Artist, won the Ivor Novello Best Song award for her huge, self-penned hit 'Suddenly I See\u2019, and a Q award for Track of the Year. She also landed a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and lent her tunes to a host of movies and TV shows ('Suddenly I See', used in the iconic opening scene of Meryl Streep flick 'The Devil Wears Prada').\n\n2012 and the years that followed saw a seismic shift in outlook - the loss of her father, a divorce, and a relocation to Venice Beach, California.\n\nAfter a period of healing, soul-searching, and a change of scenery, 2016 hailed the arrival of the first of a trilogy of albums, the critically acclaimed UK top 10 album - 'KIN'. The trilogy evokes, separately and in sequence, spirit, body and mind. With 'KIN' being her phoenix- from-the-ashes 'spirit' album, 2018 marked the second offering of that trilogy, the \u2018body\u2019 album \u2018WAX\u2019 - released October 5th.\n\nSpeaking about her 6th studio album, Tunstall says of \u2018WAX\u2019 \u201cI knew before I started writing that I wanted it to be an electric guitar record. It had to be visceral, about the physical, and the weight of that, and the obstacles of that. It\u2019s a record about human-ness, which we so often just write off as \u2018flaws\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe title a nod to the viscous pungency of one of the body\u2019s natural substances. \u201cWax evokes colonies of bees, candlelight, the material that the first long-playing records were made of\u201d, she explains, \u201cbut more than that, wax is produced inside your own head. You unconsciously create it, and then weirdly that same basic substance has been used for centuries to make the most lifelike replicas of human beings. It has a life glow to it. It sticks to you. We have these strange, ancient connections and relationships with wax. How odd is it that the body produces all these substances from all these holes!\u201d laughs this stoutly down-to-earth singer, songwriter and guitarist.\n\nLead single \u201cThe River\u201d, which was released August 23rd, opens with an arresting synth hook, before Tunstall\u2019s powerful voice enters, emotionally taking centre stage. The track builds with strong rhythmic guitar textures, exploding into an anthemic chorus. Heavy guitar riffs are central to this track capturing the dirt, grit and physicality of the album. Tunstall explains, \u201cit\u2019s about wanting to escape the madness in the world, escaping bad relationships, and wanting to be washed clean - emancipation through nature\u201d. The single was named one of Rolling Stone's \u2018Songs You Need To Know\u2019. The music video, directed by Alexo Wandael, premiered on Clash Magazine and features KT performing a sensual routine with dancer Alex Thomas.\n\nKT released \u2018WAX\u2019 in October 2018 via Virgin Records (UK) / Rostrum Records/ InGrooves (US / RoW). \u201cWAX\u201d entered the UK album chart at number 15 (Tunstall\u2019s 6th Top 20 album in the UK), was featured on Spotify\u2019s \u2018New Music Friday\u2019 playlist in a dozen countries worldwide and received critical acclaim from both national publications and specialist music outlets in both the UK and USA.\n\nThe Sunday Times - \u201cKiller folk-rock melodies and chord progressions; lyrics rich with emotional intelligence, candour, self-awareness and bite and vocals of immediacy\u201d\n\nThe I \u2013 \u201cFrom the moment she strikes the first meaty chord of her new album, KT sounds visceral capturing the grit of her live shows\u201d\n\nThe Sun 4* \u2013 \u201cWAX provides a gritty collection of classic rock-pop\u201d\n\nSecond single, \u2018Human Being\u2019, was released in December 2018, accompanied by a self- directed video by Tunstall which was premiered on NYLON and features an 8-year-old black belt nunchuck talent Eccaia Sampson. KT says of the video: \u201cMy vision for the video was to create a mirror between a young, crazy- talented, bold little girl, and link that burgeoning energy to a band of warrioress women\u201d.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s positive or optimistic or whatever, but that's what's going on with me.\u201d\n\nBrendan Benson finds himself in an enviable spot as he enters the third decade of a remarkably creative, consistently idiosyncratic career \u2013 an accomplished frontman, musician, songwriter, producer, band member, husband, and dad. Benson\u2019s seventh solo album, and first new LP in almost seven years, DEAR LIFE is this consummate polymath\u2019s most inventive and upbeat work thus far, an 11-track song cycle about life, love, family, fatherhood, and the pure joy of making music. Produced and almost entirely performed by Benson at his own Readymade Studio in Nashville, the album sees the Michigan-born, Nashville-based artist \u2013 and co-founder, with Jack White, of The Raconteurs \u2013 reveling in a more modernist approach than ever before, fueled by a heady brew of cannabis, hip-hop, and a newly discovered interest in software drum programming. The result is an untapped playfulness that elevates expertly crafted songs like the opener, \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d and the first single, \u201cGood To Be Alive,\u201d with voluble arrangements, elastic grooves, and incandescent power. Imbued with revitalized ambition and confidence, DEAR LIFE is Brendan Benson at his very best.\n\nBeginning with his now-classic 1996 major label debut, ONE MISSISSIPPI \u2013 recently reissued by Third Man in its first-ever vinyl pressing \u2013 and its masterful 2002 follow-up, LAPALCO, Benson has always infused classic craftsmanship with contemporary invention. Along with his own critically acclaimed canon, Benson is of course co-founder \u2013 with Jack White, Jack Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler \u2013 of The Raconteurs. The band first convened in 2006, winning worldwide acclaim, GRAMMY\u00ae Award nominations, and a chart-topping smash single in \u201cSteady As She Goes,\u201d with their now-classic debut album, BROKEN BOY SOLDIERS. The Raconteurs returned two short years later with 2008\u2019s CONSOLERS OF THE LONELY. Like its predecessor, the LP proved a popular and critical phenomenon, earning the GRAMMY\u00ae Award for \u201cBest Engineered Non-Classical Album\u201d as well as a nomination as \u201cBest Rock Album.\u201d\n\nDEAR LIFE came about gradually and organically after a self-imposed creative hiatus rooted in the happy arrival of his son and later, a daughter. Having spent the majority of his adult life on the road, Benson decided he\u2019d prefer to stay home for a change and just be a dad.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so enamored with my kids, I just sort of lost touch with my career. I just didn\u2019t want to go back to work.\u201d\n\nInstead, Benson directed his musical energies elsewhere and fast proved an in-demand producer/engineer (Robyn Hitchcock, Young The Giant, Trapper Schoepp, The Greenhornes) and collaborative songwriter, with a CV that includes partnerships with Jake Bugg, Iain Archer (Snow Patrol), and The Kooks\u2019 Luke Pritchard, among others. Despite his successes, after a few years in this voluntary wilderness, Benson surprised himself in 2017 by writing and recording the rocker \u201cHalf A Boy (And Half A Man).\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just felt really good,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like I was like born again. Seriously, it was almost a religious experience, like, oh my God, I love making music. I had forgotten. That\u2019s how it started. It was kind of a spark. A re-ignition.\u201d\n\nThough Benson wasn\u2019t \u201cconsciously making a record,\u201d the songs kept coming. Rather than overthink every move, he simply let go. He got stoned in his studio and worked on music simply because it made him happy.\n\n\u201cI started dreaming again,\u201d Benson says. \u201cGetting lost in the music and just letting it take me. Not being so serious, not thinking I was some sort of great writer or producer. I just enjoyed myself. I wasn\u2019t racking my brain on how to from one chord to the next. I wasn\u2019t trying to come up with the best lyrics ever. I was just having fun.\u201d\n\nBenson worked with surprising intensity, most days skipping meals until long after dark. Determined to keep moving forward, he opted to play virtually every instrument on his own. Though a skilled drummer in his own right, Benson began working with Pro Tools and an array of other drum programming software.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a self-taught only child,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go elsewhere for things. If I want drums, I think, OK, how do I create drums? Well, I\u2019ve got to play them or I\u2019ve got to program them. It\u2019s all happening really quickly. I don\u2019t have time to wait for some guy to come over and learn the song, all that crap.\u201d\n\nWorking with programming helped free Benson from his previous creative habits, opening up uncharted paths and new approaches towards making his music.\n\n\u201cI may never go back to playing the drums,\u201d Benson says. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true, but it is a lot of fun. It\u2019s a different discipline entirely. On the drum kit, you feel it out, see what feels good or whatever. But with software drums, you\u2019re constructing beats with your hands, with a mouse, and with a keyboard. It\u2019s really weird. So of course you do things that you wouldn\u2019t do on a drum kit. It\u2019s like, wow, I never would have played that beat. And then the options are limitless. Everything is right at your fingertips.\u201d\n\nUnrestrained by anything other than his own imagination, Benson drew less from genre and more from his own instincts, melding jangle and crunch, hook and riff, pomp and subtlety, into something original and his own. Sonic motivation came from a range of unexpected sources, spanning hip-hop icons like Vince Staples and Kendrick Lamar to the top 40 hits his kids played around the house.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always kind of battling cynicism,\u201d he adds, \u201cbeing a cynic about music. So listening to what my kids listen to, it helps me break down the barriers in myself. The kids put on Justin Bieber and my knee jerk reaction is to turn it off. But I don\u2019t. I\u2019m forced to listen in and by God, I start liking it. I find something good in it and then that maybe pops up in my music.\u201d\n\nWith the aesthetic doors blown open, Benson saw his songs grow more complex, multi-tiered, and rhapsodic. From the future funk-fueled \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d through \u201cGood To Be Alive\u201d and the madcap \u201cFreak Out,\u201d to the elegiac finale, \u201cWho\u2019s Gonna Love You,\u201d his long vaunted knack for pure pop craftsmanship is paired with a progressive, left-of-center dynamism unlike anything in his body of work.\n\nWhile tracks like \u201cDear Life\u201d and the ecstatic \u201cRichest Man Alive\u201d are undeniably animated and even joyful, Benson is quick to note that there\u2019s more going on than necessarily meets the ear. The buoyant melodies and irrepressible hooks are tinted with self-doubt and instinctive irony, their affirmative messages colored by encroaching middle age and the songwriter\u2019s own mortality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just singing about me,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI\u2019m almost 50 and it\u2019s freaking me out so that\u2019s kind of coming up in the songs.\u201d\n\nAfter almost two years, DEAR LIFE was finally approaching completion. Benson signed on with new management and began talking with labels, ready at last to return to the fray. And then Jack called.\n\n\u201cMy wife was like, OK, off you go,\u201d he says. \u201cSeriously, I was stoked. That band is fun. I get to be in a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band, that\u2019s my dream. And I get to share it all with a bunch of guys that I love and respect.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a decade, The Raconteurs finally returned to action in 2019 with their critically acclaimed, chart-topping third LP, HELP US STRANGER, highlighted in part by a couple of songs Benson had been kicking around for his own LP, \u201cOnly Child\u201d and \u201cSomedays (I Don\u2019t Feel Like Trying).\u201d The Raconteurs\u2019 epic 2019 world tour proved equally successful, playing to ecstatic sold-out houses from Nashville to New Zealand and all points in-between. Still buzzing with big rock energy, Benson returned home and recorded two more for DEAR LIFE: the short, sharp \u201cI\u2019m In Love\u201d and the persistent slacker anthem, \u201cI Quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Raconteurs helped me get off my ass and get back into the swing of things,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI got to exercise that muscle again. I came home really excited just to get back to my thing. Whereas before, I think I was a little overwhelmed. It\u2019s daunting to make a record and get a band together and tour an album. But now I\u2019m really ready. It\u2019s not so daunting.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Benson is currently considering how to bring DEAR LIFE to life. Having made a record he can take unabashed pride in, he is determined to continue defying expectations and resisting easy pigeonholes. DEAR LIFE marks a milestone on what has already been an atypical artistic journey as well as a bold signpost towards future triumphs, a showcase for Benson\u2019s matchless gifts for wry introspection, insightful wordplay, and powerhouse melody, once again affirming his place among the finest singer-songwriters of this or any era.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kyle Hancharick ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7248519.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Folk-rock", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "It\u2019s always been about the music for Kyle Hancharick, a singer/songwriter from Warwick, New York.

And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear.

Purchase & Stream at https://mannequinpussy.ffm.to/patience.\n\nThe third full-length from Mannequin Pussy, Patience is an album fascinated with the physical experience of the body, its songs tracking the movements of mouths and hands and racing hearts, skin and spit and teeth and blood. Deeply attuned to the power of their own physicality, the Philadelphia-based band channels complex emotion in blistering riffs, thrashing rhythms, vocals that feel as immediate and untamed as a gut reaction. But throughout Patience, the Philadelphia-based band contrasts that raw vitality with intricate melodies and finely detailed arrangements, building a strange and potent tension that makes the album all the more cathartic.\n\nThe follow-up to Romantic\u2014a 2016 release praised by Pitchfork for \u201ccombin[ing] punk, shoegaze, death metal, and more, with the ferocious push-pull energy of a mosh pit\u201d\u2014Patience came to life at Studio 4 in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. In creating the album, Mannequin Pussy worked with producer/engineer Will Yip (Quicksand, The Menzingers), shaping an explosive sound that never overshadows the subtlety of their songwriting. \u201cIn the past there\u2019s been a chaotic feeling to the recording process, but working with Will put us in a different headspace,\u201d says Dabice. \u201cIt helped us show our progression over the past few years and make a very crisp-sounding record, without losing the dirtiness of what Mannequin Pussy really is.\u201d\n\nOpening with its gloriously frenetic title track, Patience matches Mannequin Pussy\u2019s wild volatility with a narrative voice that\u2019s often painfully vulnerable. On \u201cDrunk II,\u201d for instance, Dabice\u2019s vocals shift from fragile to furious, the track\u2019s stormy guitar work colliding with lyrics capturing the grief of post-breakup inertia. \u201cI wrote that song one night when I was very heartbroken, after I\u2019d been out with friends trying to pretend like I wasn\u2019t feeling so hopeless,\u201d says Dabice. \u201cI went home and just started playing guitar and crying, and stayed up working on that song till about four in the morning.\u201d\n\nOn the delicately sprawling \u201cHigh Horse,\u201d Patience takes on a more restrained tone but still maintains a devastating intensity, with Mannequin Pussy presenting an intimate portrait of an abusive relationship (\u201cPushing me up against the kitchen sink/I feel your breath on me/I can taste it in my teeth\u201d). Meanwhile, \u201cWho You Are\u201d shifts into a brightly tender mood, assuming a classic-love-song sweetness in its message of self-acceptance. \u201cI turned 30 as we were working on the record, and it changed my whole perspective on my life and relationships and everything,\u201d says Dabice. \u201c\u2018Who You Are\u2019 came from thinking about what I\u2019d want to say to myself when I was still in my 20s and wasting so much time not believing in myself.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on Patience, Mannequin Pussy transmit an unstoppable fury: the 39-second \u201cClams\u201d delivers as a brutal blast of vitriol against those who\u2019ve tried to hold them back, while \u201cF.U.C.A.W.\u201d unfolds in unhinged riffs and relentlessly pounding beats. And on \u201cIn Love Again,\u201d the album closes out with a magnificently epic anthem driven by dreamy guitar tones, lilting piano melodies, and a particularly elegant performance from Reading (\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the nuanced drum beat and the percussion odyssey at the end,\u201d she notes. \u201cAnd yes, there are bongos on the track\u201d). The most undeniably hopeful moment on Patience, \u201cIn Love Again\u201d telegraphs utter joy and awe in its heart-on-sleeve lyrics. \u201cI always want our records to end in a place of optimism,\u201d says Dabice. \u201cThe songs take you on a journey through all these very toxic emotions and traumatic experiences, but what I\u2019m trying to articulate is that something good can come from getting through all that.\u201d\n\nThe push toward transformation has long propelled the songwriting of Mannequin Pussy, who formed as a duo when childhood friends Dabice and Paul reconnected after years apart. At the time, Dabice had recently returned to the East Coast from Colorado in order to help take care of her mother, who\u2019d just suffered a stroke. \u201cIt was one of the most trying times of my life, and at some point my mom suggested that I try going to therapy,\u201d Dabice recalls. \u201cBut instead I was like, \u2018I think I\u2019m just gonna learn to play guitar.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone; I just wanted to lose myself in the creative process.\u201d Once she and Paul played music together, they discovered a chemistry she now describes as magical. \u201cWe created so much in such a short period of time,\u201d Dabice says. \u201cWe never even thought of making records or anything\u2014it was just this pure emotional outlet, just us screaming onstage with our guitars.\u201d\n\nAs they continued collaborating, Dabice and Paul later added Reading and Regisford to the lineup, making their debut with GP in 2014 and releasing Romantic in fall 2016. Recently signed to Epitaph, Mannequin Pussy found themselves newly revitalized in the writing and recording of Patience, their creative connection stronger than ever. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of how hard we\u2019ve worked to get to this point,\u201d says Dabice. \u201cThis album sounds exactly how I\u2019ve always wanted us to sound\u2014I\u2019ve never listened to something we\u2019ve made and felt so inspired by it.\u201d\n\nAs Dabice explains, the band\u2019s journey toward the making of Patience partly inspired the album\u2019s title. \u201cI think you have to be patient that you\u2019ll find the sound that\u2019s in your head,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to take your time if you can\u2019t figure it out right away\u2014you\u2019ve got to just trust that you\u2019ll get there eventually.\u201d And within that process, Mannequin Pussy have continually found the emotional release that ultimately makes their music so powerful. \u201cFeeling isolated in your most toxic experiences can slowly destroy you from the inside, but going through the motion of creating something can make you feel at peace,\u201d Dabice says. \u201cAnd the real beauty is that, by sharing your experience, it helps other people to feel less alone as well. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve always searched for with our music, and I don\u2019t think that will ever change for us.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/girlgangleeds"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Peter ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6342988.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "1.)

Longtime friend Mike Bishop Smith (drums) completes the trio.On February 14, 2019, The Powell Brothers released their first full length album entitled \u201cLeave On The Light.\u201d Recorded in Nashville at Ravens Landing studio, \u201cLeave On The Light\u201d was produced by Scott Quintana and engineered and mixed by Gena Johnson (\u201cA Star Is Born\u201d soundtrack, Zac Brown Band, Brandi Carlile) and features ten tracks written by Taylor and Blake Powell.

Perseverance, resilience and life on the road provide the backdrop for this new collection of songs that staggers artfully between timeless arrangements and sharp songcraft showcasing a defiant, evolving band on the rise. Taylor Powell had this to say about the new record:\n\n\u201cHurricane Harvey definitely changed a lot of things for us,\u201d explains Taylor Powell. \u201cThe plans we had been making for the previous few months were completely wiped out. As we were tearing down our childhood home, there were definitely many moments of despair. But as they say, when you are going through hell, keep on going. Looking back, it actually wiped the slate clean, and gave us an opportunity to do something much greater than we had planned before. We decided to use this as a sign that it was time to make the record we had always wanted to make.\u201d\n\nThe first radio single off the new album was \u201cComing Home,\u201d a love letter to Taylor and Blake Powell\u2019s hometown of Houston, Texas. The single enjoyed seven weeks in the Top 20 on both the TRRR and CDX Traction Texas radio charts.

The way their voices blend together in song conjures an imagined romance, much like their own. Before they met, Benjamin and Mia worked hard at their craft but each felt separately, something was missing. Their first songwriting session together, in 2004, led to the discovery that what they were missing was each other. Fast forward to today, they have now released five studio albums, one live album, were named semi-finalists at the 2018 International Songwriting Competition, and were nominated at the 2018 International Acoustic Music Awards.\n\nTheir most recent project, \u201cLive at Home\u201d was recorded in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, at a house concert in Azalea\u2019s living room. The recording captures the acoustic heart and soul of six songs from their 2017 studio release, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, two new original songs, and a cover of \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d, from the motion picture \u201cOnce\u201d. Tickets were sold as a crowdfunding perk to help raise funds to record the aforementioned studio release.\n\n\u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was released on October 13, 2017 and was supported by a multi-province 2 week tour. Written and recorded in their home studio, this project features love songs, beautiful vocal harmony and showcases Benjamin & Mia\u2019s musical abilities. The album sits comfortably in the \u201cContemporary Roots\u201d genre featuring songs that borrow from North American and Eastern European folk traditions, as well as conventional pop sensibilities.\n\n\u201cI See The Church\u201d from the album \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was nominated at the 2018 IAMA (International Acoustic Music Awards) in the \u201cBest Group/Duo\u201d category .\n\nHamilton Blues Lovers Blog has this to say about the album,\n\n\u201cHamilton musical duo, Azalea keeps growing with every recording and their latest, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d proves it. The production is amazing and they\u2019ve created a fabulous melding of pop and roots music. Their lush vocal harmonies flow through the entire album as the sometimes infectious and always beautiful melodies bolster the sound. It\u2019s a perfect mix of vocals and music that can\u2019t help but effect you emotionally\u2026\u201d\n\nIn May 2015 Azalea was hand picked by GigSalad & CD Baby to play their junket for Canadian Music Week in Toronto, Ontario. In honour of this occasion, Azalea recorded and released a limited edition EP called \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d. As a salute to GigSalad & CD Baby\u2019s DIY methodology, \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d was made completely in house with fabric bound hand packaging.\n\nIn 2013, Azalea released the EP \"Inside Out\". An album which streamlined their folk- tinged pop sound and showcased songs to tug at the heart strings with haunting melodic and harmonic lines. Reminiscent of The Civil Wars, and Fleetwood Mac \u201cInside Out\u201d shed light on Azalea\u2019s Alt-Country side. The pitch for its successful crowd- funding campaign gave some insight into their work:\n\n\". . . it has always been our goal to release quality music that is culturally relevant and speaks to the heart. . . . However, we wanted to take listeners on a journey beyond the routine of everyday life to the place that connects them with their emotions, beliefs, and values in a real way.\u201d\n\nIn late 2012 Azalea released \u201cAt the End of This Year...\u201d, their seasonal single which has received the nod of approval from CBC radio.\n\nAzalea\u2019s 2010 release, \u201cCoffee & Kisses EP\", was among the top three finalists for Recording of the Year, Rock Recording of the Year, Instrumentalist of the Year, and Producer of the Year at the 2010 Durham Region Music Awards. The album was featured in prominent music magazines and generated good response from college radio across Ontario.\n\nYears before anyone knew Benjamin & Mia Hackett as Azalea, they performed, travelled, and recorded an album as Benjamin & Mia. \u201cThe Carousel of Life\u201d (2007) is the root of their love for each other and for their musical life together. That first album thrust them into the life they know, love, and hope to express in song, to every listener.\n\nAzalea\u2019s chemistry is undeniable - their stage presence magnetic! To experience Azalea in concert is to be invited into their love story. They will will draw you in and pull on your hearts strings. Azalea will take you on an emotional rollercoaster as they move through their repertoire of simple & sweet love songs, then take you south with swampy tunes which are full of rich vocal harmony and live looping. Two complementary voices supported by guitar, piano, \"suitcase-kick-drum\u201d, and foot tambourine create a breathtaking concert experience.\n\nA must see for fans of \u201cFleetwood Mac\u201d, \u201dThe Civil Wars\u201d, and the film \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d.\n\nAzalea is currently performing on board cruise ships around the world.

On their fourth studio album Everything Seems Like Yesterday, the San Diego-based band twist that dynamic to deliver their most emotionally direct body of work to date: a collection of songs written and performed solely by Carnevale, each track matching its stripped-back simplicity with both raw outpouring and intense reflection.\n\nThe follow-up to their 2019 album Live at the Observatory, Everything Seems Like Yesterday first took shape through a handful of songs Carnevale wrote on acoustic guitar back in fall 2018. \u201cHypochondriac was the first time I\u2019d ever written that way, and it felt really therapeutic,\u201d he says, referring to the band\u2019s 2018 Epitaph debut. \u201cIt pushed me to get much more into the craft of songwriting\u2014as opposed to mostly writing songs for people to mosh to\u2014and it felt right to keep going with that on this record.\u201d\n\nAlthough he originally intended to release that acoustic material as a solo album, Carnevale had a change of heart upon sharing his new songs at a series of shows in San Diego and L.A. \u201cAll the guys in the band came out and the response was pretty positive, so I started to think this might be something more than a bunch of songs to put online for free,\u201d he says. Envisioning the album as a natural evolution for The Frights, Carnevale soon enlisted Dotson as a producer, and the two bandmates set off to record at Carnevale\u2019s grandmother\u2019s cabin in Idyllwild, California.\n\nKicking off with the sweetly offbeat folk of \u201c24,\u201d Everything Seems Like Yesterday documents a particularly challenging year of Carnevale\u2019s life\u2014a period that began with the release of Hypochondriac on August 24, 2018 (i.e., Carnevale\u2019s 24th birthday). \u201cA lot of these songs are about friends who are gone now, either in the sense that they passed away or that we don\u2019t speak anymore,\u201d Carnevale points out. \u201cOur songs have always involved some kind of looking back over the past, but this one feels like the first time where I\u2019m dealing with those situations and growing from them. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s more mature\u2014because I don\u2019t know if I actually am more mature\u2014but it feels a little healthier than the songs where I\u2019m more caught up in nostalgia, and wishing things could just go back to the way they used to be.\u201d\n\nDuring their time at the Idyllwild cabin\u2014a free-flowing but rigorously productive week in late-April 2019\u2014Carnevale and Dotson purposely laid down the entire tracklist to Everything Seems Like Yesterday in exact sequence. In that process, they eschewed all digital production methods in favor of using a field recorder to capture a wide array of ambient sounds. \u201cThere were no plugins on the whole record; we wanted to force ourselves to be as creative as we could,\u201d Carnevale says. To that end, the two musicians ended up relying on everything from pinecones to pots and pans to construct the album\u2019s percussive components, in addition to introducing such sonic elements as the crunching of fallen leaves and the thump of tennis ball thrown against the cabin wall. And while recording the beautifully untethered \u201cSimple and Strange,\u201d Carnevale found his performance disrupted by an incoming call on the cabin landline\u2014then left that ringing in the track\u2019s final version. (\u201cEvery time I go up to Idyllwild my dad will always call to fuck with me\u2014like, \u2018I\u2019m watching you\u2026\u2019, so we just figured it was him,\u201d Carnevale recalls. \u201cBut when we picked up the phone during that take no one was there, and we never actually figured out who was calling.\u201d)\n\nWith recording in sequence giving Carnevale the motivation to \u201cmake each song better than the last,\u201d Everything Seems Like Yesterday ends on the heavy-hearted but hopeful \u201c25\u201d: a harmonica-laced number whose distinctly lo-fi aesthetic stems from some trickery on Dotson\u2019s part. \u201cWhen I was done writing that one I told Richard to come listen, and without telling me he turned on the field recorder\u2014and that\u2019s the take we ended up going with,\u201d says Carnevale. \u201cSo what you\u2019re hearing on the album is the first time I ever even played that song out loud.\u201d\n\nIn creating the more starkly composed songs heard throughout Everything Seems Like Yesterday, Carnevale made a point of placing a more careful focus on his lyrics, partly drawing from his burgeoning love of poets like Allen Ginsberg, Charles Bukowski, and Sylvia Plath. \u201cIf you can read a song as a poem and still get the same feeling from it, you know you\u2019ve done something right,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure I have plenty of songs from the old days that would really lack something if you took away the music and the melody, but these new songs feel more connected to when I first started writing\u2014back before the main concern was mostly just trying to get people to dance.\u201d\n\nAs they gear up for the release of Everything Seems Like Yesterday, The Frights are building up the album\u2019s tracks in order to accommodate the unhinged energy of their live performance. But for Carnevale, the album will always maintain an undeniable intimacy. \u201cWhen this was going to be a solo record, I had it in the back of my mind that it would really just be for my friends and my family,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd to be completely honest, that\u2019s still 100 percent what I want from this album. There\u2019s a lot of stuff on there that\u2019s about things that people close to me have gone through, and in a way the songs are just me trying to talk through them, and get a very personal message across without really worrying about anything else.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Featuring artists from their 2020 SXSW lineup, Dr. Martens is swapping the physical stage for the virtual one to bring fans a fun Instagram Live set with San Diego's punk rockers The Frights!

It's decided that we should respect each band and we should have separate groups for both bands.\n\n\nPopular French rock group Dolly got together in Nantes, a town in the west of France, in 1991. Their formation came about thanks to drummer Thierry Lacroix and singer Emmanuelle Monet - aka Manu - who shared a mutual passion for English and American music. The Anglophile duo teamed up with two musician friends - bass-player Mick Chamberlin and guitarist Nicolas Bonniere (who was just 15 at the time!) - and went on to make a name for themselves on the local music scene as Dolly and C\u00b0.\n\nDolly and C\u00b0's early influences might have been lifted from the best chapters of an English/American rock compendium - indeed, the group's sound was heavily influenced by the likes of Blondie, Prince, the Pixies and the Smashing Pumpkins. But lead singer Manu's greatest source of inspiration was the work of English indie diva PJ Harvey. The young French singer was fascinated by Harvey's deep, melancholy vocals and, after seeing PJ in concert, Manu decided to accompany her own singing on guitar. Performing extensively on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 soon began to build up an extensive repertoire (most of which was written by Manu). And before long the group attracted a massive following of fans.\n\nEncouraged by this early success on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 went into the studio to begin work on their d\u00e9but album. After producing a mini album (featuring six tracks), Dolly and C\u00b0 went on to produce their first full-length album themselves. (The album, entitled simply \"Dolly and C\u00b0, actually scored a considerable hit on the national music scene, selling over 85,000 copies).\n\nShortly after the release of their d\u00e9but album, the group underwent several major changes in their line-up, re-inventing themselves as Dolly. The new-look Dolly went on to sign a recording deal with the East West label and then returned to the studio to set to work on a new CD album.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nDolly (\u30c9\u30ea\u30a3, \uff24\uff4f\uff4c\uff4c\uff59) is an japanese rock band.\nThey started their activities in 2005.\n\nMember:\nVocals: Mitsu\nGuitar: Masa\nGuitar: Yuina (ex Luecie)\nBass : Hachi\nDrums : Takashi (ex Plastic Tree)\n\nThe release Ussetsu Drop had their first proper PV with more of a budget than the previous.\nNow they have just released the Red and White singles of the tricolore opera trilogy making a total of 3 pvs and 9 songs.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dan Andriano ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9714262.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Acoustic, Folk", "Time": "10:59 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dan Andriano (born 1977 in Elgin, Illinois) is the bassist and co-vocalist (alongside vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba and drummer Derek Grant) for the punk rock band Alkaline Trio.

The Pittsburgh native, along with his band Hard Rain, delivers a sound that takes the greatest of America\u2019s most beloved genres and melds them into a poetic representation of the best the country has to offer.\n\nWith his ninth full-length studio release, Good For My Soul (street date October 27), Toms channels a foot-stomping, wall-shaking blend of soul, blues, gospel, and rock vibes, all brought together with his lyrical specialty -- stories of everyday men and women doing their best to stay ahead while still managing to keep a dream or two in their heads.\n\nSoaring horns, gritty licks, toe-tapping rhythms, and Toms\u2019 own rough-hewn vocals will draw listeners in, as well as well-deserved comparisons to the greats such as Dr. John, Little Feat, Springsteen, Joe Tex, The Blasters, Otis Redding, and Rufus Thomas.\n\n\u201cThe idea of a horn section behind my songs has been something I\u2019ve thought about for a while,\u201d explains Toms. \u201cAlbert King, and all the Stax artists come to mind when I think of what true rhythm and blues can do. I wanted a piece of that; creating dynamics, and drama within the song; and fostering the deep emotion that a great horn section can give. The words also needed this place-- in order to be fully interpreted as the representation of \u2018my America,\u2019 and the people who make up my small part of this world.\u201d\n\nGood For My Soul was recorded in February 2017 by Oscar-winning composer Rick Witkowski, who also co-produced the set with Will Kimbrough (Rodney Crowell, Todd Snider). Both artists have collaborated with Toms frequently on parts of his earlier catalog.\n\nToms launched his musical career in 1987 as lead guitarist of Pittsburgh\u2019s legendary band Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers, During that period, he opened for and played with such legendary names as The Band, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Little Feat, and Stevie Ray Vaughn. While playing guitar, co-writing, and adding backup vocals for the Houserockers, Toms and the band recorded six studio albums and one live concert album. In 1995, The Houserockers released American Babylon, which was recorded and produced by Springsteen himself.\n\nAs a solo artist, Toms has opened for the likes of Buddy Guy, Levon Helm, Marshall Crenshaw, The Kennedys, Steve Forbert, and Ellis Paul. He\u2019s plotting a string of regional east coast dates to support Good For My Soul, as well as a full European tour in 2018.\nFor more information and tour dates, please visit www.billtoms.com", "otherInfo": "Blues Society Of Western Pennsylvania Presents Bill Toms Live Stream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Now Is Now ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8505184.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Much like the caterpillar who rarely thinks about becoming a butterfly until he actually is one, NOW IS NOW is a band about living in the moment. \"Mitch Alden has passion!

If this record is anything like their first CD, \"Transitions,\" which according to Portland rock critic Dan Short who describes this CD as a \"shockingly good record,\" it would appear that the successful future of Now is Now as one of Maine's premier rock & roll bands is one which is already set in stone.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Southern Halo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10212195.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 7 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-07", "Genre": "Country Pop, Pop Country, Country, Contemporary Country, Rock, Modern Country", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Mississippi Delta, recognized by many as the birthplace of Rock and Roll and the Blues, is heavily rooted in the upbringing of the Morris sisters.

A half-hour later, he called back to change it to Won-Ton Haggis. But neither sounded right, and Enter the Haggis seemed to flow.\n\n\"It's like Enter the Dragon, but a lot messier,\" said Downie. \"It ended up sticking ... but it's not the sort of name we expected to go with.\"\n\nDownie -- a native of Glasgow, Scotland, expatriated to Ontario with his parents at age 7 -- enjoys a good haggis \"if it's cooked properly. If I had a couple of pints first, it's even better.\"\n\nHaggis, for those not in the know, is a traditional Scottish dish made of minced sheep's innards, oatmeal and a varied assortment of other ingredients. Enter the Haggis, on the other hand, is an energetic Celtic rock band from Toronto.\n\nDownie, pulled from a Toronto recording studio for this interview, is the band's founder, primary kilt-wearer, singer, bagpiper and chief songwriter. He has a penchant for inserting odd imagery into his music.\n\nSongs on the band's first album, Let the Wind Blow High, deal with the likes of Scottish-Mexican brawlers, bagpipers in space and \"loch monsters\" of a different sort.\n\n\"I came from Scotland as a kid,\" Downie said, as if that explains everything. Since it didn't, he continued. \"I wanted to know more about my culture, but most of what I could find out was the Hollywood version of Scotland,\" he explained. \"I watched Brigadoon and things like that, which portrayed Scotland in a comical light. ... I thought, 'There's a lot of comedy coming out of Scotland.' So I started putting it together.\"\n\nHe finds ideas for songwriting in various places, from a Mexican native with a Scottish education and accent to headlines about Lorena Bobbit's exercise in extreme circumcision.\n\nDownie is by no means a traditional piper, either, drawing on a variety of musical styles to create his own unique sound.\n\n\"I'd like to think of myself as an entertaining pipe player more than anything else,\" he said. \"If I can get a different sound out of my pipes and keep people interested -- that's my job and that's my hobby.\"\n\nDownie, who recently delayed recording to get married, buy a house and go on tour, said he finds musical inspiration in everything from early Beatles and Led Zeppelin to the pibroch, the classical music of the Highland pipe.\n\n\"The pipes were the first rock 'n' roll instrument,\" he insisted. \"With what other instrument can you get up and cut a swath through a room of 200 people?\"\n\nBesides Downie, Enter the Haggis is Trevor Lewington (electric and acoustic guitars), James \"Seumas\" Campbell (drums), Brian Buchanan (fiddle) and Mark Abraham (bass). The band, with its second album in the works, is hoping to help bands like Seven Nations spread Celtic \"bagpipe rock\" to the masses.\n\n\"I would like to see Celtic rock become a dominant force in music,\" Downie said. \"Rock music has really become kind of homogenous. I don't know where it's going to go these days. You turn on the radio and one song sounds like the next. \"I would like to take Celtic rock to its epitome.\"\n\nThe band's evolution is already underway, he noted. \"We're a tighter band than we were before -- just from doing a lot more playing. Our sound has become a bit more dynamic,\" Downie said.\n\n\"It's got a bit more of an electric feel to it for sure. We're trying to get a bit more power into it,\" he added. \"It's 'more good.'\"\n\nThe band's biggest joy comes from live performances, jamming on-stage with a jammin' mix of traditional tunes, original material and plenty of humor. While they once bribed audiences with T-shirts and CDs to get them up and moving, that no longer seems to be a problem.\n\n\"We played recently at the Mosiac Festival out in Regina,\" Downie recalled. \"The stage was swarmed by about 200 people. ... Nobody got hurt or killed or anything, so I guess it was a good show.\n\n\"Of course, there's always a potential for mishaps. Last week, an older gentleman leapt up on stage, embraced our guitarist and kissed him.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

A half-hour later, he called back to change it to Won-Ton Haggis. But neither sounded right, and Enter the Haggis seemed to flow.\n\n\"It's like Enter the Dragon, but a lot messier,\" said Downie. \"It ended up sticking ... but it's not the sort of name we expected to go with.\"\n\nDownie -- a native of Glasgow, Scotland, expatriated to Ontario with his parents at age 7 -- enjoys a good haggis \"if it's cooked properly. If I had a couple of pints first, it's even better.\"\n\nHaggis, for those not in the know, is a traditional Scottish dish made of minced sheep's innards, oatmeal and a varied assortment of other ingredients. Enter the Haggis, on the other hand, is an energetic Celtic rock band from Toronto.\n\nDownie, pulled from a Toronto recording studio for this interview, is the band's founder, primary kilt-wearer, singer, bagpiper and chief songwriter. He has a penchant for inserting odd imagery into his music.\n\nSongs on the band's first album, Let the Wind Blow High, deal with the likes of Scottish-Mexican brawlers, bagpipers in space and \"loch monsters\" of a different sort.\n\n\"I came from Scotland as a kid,\" Downie said, as if that explains everything. Since it didn't, he continued. \"I wanted to know more about my culture, but most of what I could find out was the Hollywood version of Scotland,\" he explained. \"I watched Brigadoon and things like that, which portrayed Scotland in a comical light. ... I thought, 'There's a lot of comedy coming out of Scotland.' So I started putting it together.\"\n\nHe finds ideas for songwriting in various places, from a Mexican native with a Scottish education and accent to headlines about Lorena Bobbit's exercise in extreme circumcision.\n\nDownie is by no means a traditional piper, either, drawing on a variety of musical styles to create his own unique sound.\n\n\"I'd like to think of myself as an entertaining pipe player more than anything else,\" he said. \"If I can get a different sound out of my pipes and keep people interested -- that's my job and that's my hobby.\"\n\nDownie, who recently delayed recording to get married, buy a house and go on tour, said he finds musical inspiration in everything from early Beatles and Led Zeppelin to the pibroch, the classical music of the Highland pipe.\n\n\"The pipes were the first rock 'n' roll instrument,\" he insisted. \"With what other instrument can you get up and cut a swath through a room of 200 people?\"\n\nBesides Downie, Enter the Haggis is Trevor Lewington (electric and acoustic guitars), James \"Seumas\" Campbell (drums), Brian Buchanan (fiddle) and Mark Abraham (bass). The band, with its second album in the works, is hoping to help bands like Seven Nations spread Celtic \"bagpipe rock\" to the masses.\n\n\"I would like to see Celtic rock become a dominant force in music,\" Downie said. \"Rock music has really become kind of homogenous. I don't know where it's going to go these days. You turn on the radio and one song sounds like the next. \"I would like to take Celtic rock to its epitome.\"\n\nThe band's evolution is already underway, he noted. \"We're a tighter band than we were before -- just from doing a lot more playing. Our sound has become a bit more dynamic,\" Downie said.\n\n\"It's got a bit more of an electric feel to it for sure. We're trying to get a bit more power into it,\" he added. \"It's 'more good.'\"\n\nThe band's biggest joy comes from live performances, jamming on-stage with a jammin' mix of traditional tunes, original material and plenty of humor. While they once bribed audiences with T-shirts and CDs to get them up and moving, that no longer seems to be a problem.\n\n\"We played recently at the Mosiac Festival out in Regina,\" Downie recalled. \"The stage was swarmed by about 200 people. ... Nobody got hurt or killed or anything, so I guess it was a good show.\n\n\"Of course, there's always a potential for mishaps. Last week, an older gentleman leapt up on stage, embraced our guitarist and kissed him. That was a bit weird.\"", "otherInfo": "We're gonna party like it's 2004.\n\nJoin us (and our old friend James Campbell) for a deep dive into the album that introduced ETH classics like Gasoline and Down With The Ship.

Having built a substantial grass-roots fan base through tireless touring and old-fashioned hard work, McConnell is primed for a mainstream breakthrough.\n\nSean McConnell demonstrates exactly why McConnell has already won such a devoted audience. He writes vivid, forthright, effortlessly catchy songs whose incisive melodic craft is matched by their resonant emotional insight. Such instantly memorable tunes as \u201cHoly Days,\u201d \u201cBeautiful Rose,\u201d \u201cBottom of the Sea\u201d and \u201cBest We\u2019ve Ever Been\u201d are both catchy and personally charged, conveying an unmistakable sense of personal experience while exploring universal truths.\n\n\u201cThis record\u2019s a bit of a step for me,\u201d McConnell asserts. \u201cIt\u2019s a real storyteller record, and it\u2019s pretty autobiographical. I\u2019m learning how to be more honest and understated in my writing, and I wanted to match that sonically and vocally. When I look at this collection of songs, I see a lot of nostalgia, and looking back on sacred moments. I\u2019m kind of nostalgic and reflective by nature.\u201d\n\nMcConnell recorded the album in his adopted hometown of Nashville with producers Jason Lehning and Ian Fitchuk, who also contributed keyboards and drums, respectively. The recording took place prior to McConnell signing with Rounder, with the artist financing the sessions himself.\n\n\u201cThis project started,\u201d he explains, \u201cwhen I went to a cabin by myself for a week, with the intention of writing some songs. In that week, I wrote about half of the songs on the record, and I could see the thread of what this record was gonna be. That was exciting for me, because it normally takes me a year to find an album\u2019s worth of songs that belong together. The whole recording process was really fun and liberating, and the energy in the studio was really positive.\u201d\n\nSongwriting and music-making have been a part of Sean McConnell\u2019s life for as long as he can remember. \u201cMy mom was a singer and my dad was a guitar player and songwriter,\u201d he notes. \u201cThey\u2019d play in coffeehouses and I\u2019d go along and watch them perform, and seeing that lifestyle showed me that music was an option. And seeing my dad painstakingly writing songs had a huge influence on me, and gave me license to feel like I could enter into that world.\u201d\n\nBy the age of ten, he had become proficient on guitar and was writing his first songs. \u201cI fell in love with the instrument first,\u201d McConnell recalls. \u201cLearning guitar gave me a feeling of uncharted territory laid out in front of me. And as I got better on guitar, the songs started to come naturally. At around the same time, we moved from Massachusetts to Georgia, and the first song I wrote was about the feeling of leaving the familiar and feeling lost in a new place. Music gave me a focus and became an emotional outlet for me.\u201d\n\nHis supportive family background helped to instill the confidence and drive to pursue his muse early on. \u201cI started playing in middle school, doing any gig I could get just to get my chops up,\u201d he says. \u201cBy high school, I would be doing local gigs and really promoting them, bringing out a couple hundred kids to my shows a few times a month and starting to make a decent living at it. That made me think that maybe I could do this in other towns. So I started traveling around the southeast a little bit, and there was always enough progress to take things to the next level. While I was in college, I did a lot of college touring, just me driving all over the United States in a Toyota Corolla. It was hard work, but it showed me that I could do it.\u201d\n\nMcConnell was just 15 when he self-released his first album, Faces, in 2000. Followed by 2001\u2019s Here In The Lost and Found, 2004\u2019s 200 Orange Street, 2006\u2019s Cold Black Sky, 2007\u2019s Tell The Truth, 2008\u2019s The Walk Around EP, 2010\u2019s Saints, Thieves and Liars, 2012\u2019s Midland and the 2014 EP The B Side Session.\n\n\u201cI had a guitar teacher in Atlanta who had a home studio, and he was the first one to say \u2018Hey, you should make a record,'\u201d he says. \u201cIf I go back and listen to that first record now, the songs are kind of crude, but at the same time there\u2019s a directness about them that I like. My writing has evolved since then, but at the same time I\u2019ve tried to hold on to some of that directness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really attracted to songwriters who just put it out there honestly, and I feel like I\u2019m getting back to basics and expressing things in a simple, direct way on the new album,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to learn how to be a more honest storyteller, trying to get my mind in a place where I\u2019m not actually thinking and the music\u2019s just kind of happening naturally. When I read interviews with songwriters that I admire, they always say that the best songs are the ones that just kind of happen, like they\u2019re operating from the unconscious. That\u2019s a place I want to get to.\u201d\n\nHaving spent much of his life honing his craft and paying his dues, Sean McConnell is eager to launch the next chapter of his career.\n\n\u201cI kind of feel like I\u2019ve been in a really long boot camp,\u201d he concludes. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful for that, because I feel like I\u2019ve gained enough experience to know the deal and be prepared for anything. I\u2019m excited to see where the next part of the journey takes me.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Vice ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8219715.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Hard Rock, Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u26a1\ufe0f", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ron Gallo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8914850.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Ron Gallo", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba", "otherInfo": "i'm anxious to share new music and releasing things is always a drawn out process, so hosting this provate listening party to share unreleased music both new/old with conversation during and after."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bob Moses ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8726957.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Electronica", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"Howie and Vallance are worthy of attention for how they fuse house with genuine singing and songwriting talent, as well as a live aesthetic that comes through clear and cohesively\" - Ibiza Voice\n\n\"Hankering for some moody, post-club music that doesn't totally expunge the fire within?

I\u2019ve never had voice lessons, and it wasn\u2019t until after graduating from college that I started teaching myself how to play guitar. So, if you\u2019d told me then that I\u2019d end up making a living as a singer-songwriter, I wouldn't have believed you. Even now, with the release of my fifth studio album, Morning Light, I can barely believe it.\n\nMy performing career began in the smoky corners of Knoxville, TN\u2019s restaurants and bars, singing cover songs for distracted drunks and underage college students. I didn\u2019t seriously consider pursuing a career in music until May 9, 2007, after an unexpected opportunity to open for John Legend at Knoxville\u2019s Tennessee Theatre. The guy that walked on stage that night, wasn\u2019t the same guy that walked off. One set, six songs in just thirty minutes, changed my life forever.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve shared a tour bus with Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Famers, performed in front of crowds of over 20,000 people, and been lucky enough to share the stage with artists like Brandi Carlile, Heart, Gavin DeGraw, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, James Blunt, Edwin McCain, Chris Isaak, and Daughtry, as well as tour Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, performing for our men and women in uniform stationed overseas.\n\nMusic has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It\u2019s taken me to parts of the world I would\u2019ve never seen and connected me with lifelong friends I would\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s given my life purpose. Without music, I may have never met the two greatest loves of my life, my wife, Mandy, and my daughter, Annabelle Rose Baker. However, at the same time, music almost tore my life apart.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2013, I was touring over 200 days a year. By many standards, I was living the dream, but life on the road was taking its toll. While my music career had never been better, my personal life had never been worse. At home, waiting for me, was the life that I\u2019d dreamed of, and I was missing it. First words were being spoken, first steps taken, and it was all passing me by like road signs on the highway. Sadly, the two people I was working hardest to protect, were the ones getting hurt the most.\n\nThen one day I walked into an empty house and found my wife\u2019s wedding ring on the kitchen table along with a note that read, \u201cI will not be sorry for the choice YOU made.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, success as a singer-songwriter didn\u2019t seem nearly as important if it meant failing as a husband and as a father. I was at an intersection in my life and a choice had to be made. I could continue down the road I was on, whatever the cost, or change my direction and come home.\n\nThankfully, I made the choice to refocus on my family, and in January of 2014, I put down my guitar and started picking up the pieces. I stopped recording and touring, and traded the stage lights, for front porch lights, but as it turns out, the day that I decided to stop making music, was the day a new chapter in my music career began.\n\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve learned is that you get what you give in this life. 5 years ago, I GOT a second chance, and everything that\u2019s happened has GIVEN me this moment.\n\nToday, I am a better husband. I\u2019m a better father, and hopefully, I\u2019m a better songwriter. Music may have tried to tear my family apart, but now it\u2019s graciously bringing us back together. So, I see music as a celebration of every wrong turn and right turn that has led me here, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t give thanks for that old wooden box with six strings.\n\nHere\u2019s to the hope that keeps us holding on and to never losing sight of the things that are truly important. Here\u2019s to the promise and possibility of each NEW DAY. Here\u2019s to the beauty of the present moment and to trying our best to make the most of it. The road here has not been easy, but over the last few years, I\u2019ve learned that if you look hard enough, the shadows always show us the light.

In the two years since, the members of Wildermiss\u2014Cole, guitarists Josh Hester and Seth Beamer, and drummer Caleb Thoemke\u2014have built up a massive and fiercely loyal grassroots following in its hometown of Denver, Colorado, and crisscrossed the country winning over fans as the supporting act on tours with the Oh Hellos, Jared and the Mill and Bronze Radio Return.\n\nMore than a fan favorite, the quartet has also earned accolades from the press and radio in the Mile High City on the strength of its music and live show. \u201cCarry Your Heart,\u201d a Lost With You single that has attracted more than half a million streams on Spotify, received heavy rotation on KTCL, the taste-making station that first introduced the country to the Oh Hellos, The Fray, Flobots, Churchill, and many other breakout acts in the past fifteen years.\n\nIn addition to selling out the Bluebird Theater and thrilling capacity crowds with intimate back-to-back New Year\u2019s Eve dates at the Larimer Lounge, Wildermiss has played prime mainstage sets at all of the city\u2019s biggest music festivals, including iHeart Radio\u2019s Big Gig at the 18,000-seat amphitheater Fiddler\u2019s Green, the Westword Music Showcase and the Underground Music Showcase, which drew tens of thousands of fans, in addition to sharing a bill at the 6,500-seat 1STBANK Center arena with the Revivalists, Elle King, American Authors.\n\nThe outfit\u2019s ascent has all been organic. The members of Wildermiss have attracted fans the old fashioned way by writing memorable songs and playing their hearts out each night, winning over fan after fan one at a time. As viewers who happened to catch Wildermiss on Last Call With Carson Daly can attest, the act isn\u2019t a tough sell. Portions of the band\u2019s set at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles were captured for broadcast, and the performance was so compelling that it ended up airing on two different episodes of NBC\u2019s late-night show.\n\nBut just as those performances served as a sneak peek for the fortunate few across the country who were still up in the wee hours of the morning, Lost With You merely hinted at the potential of Wildermiss. In My Mind, the outfit\u2019s new seven-song EP, surpasses any expectations set by the group\u2019s highly acclaimed debut. From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band. If you look and listen closely, there is far more to this band than meets the eyes and ears.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Clarks ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9069822.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Alt Country Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Early on, The Clarks were once described as a bunch of out of tune country hicks.

He has been on the road since 2013, performing more than one thousand shows across the United States. His live performances draw from his own discography as well as an extensive collection of folk, bluegrass, and gospel songs and select tracks from his favorite classic and contemporary songwriters. The necessity of travelling and performing solo has informed the development of Ryan\u2019s musical and songwriting style. Jordan Lawrence, writer for Free Times in Columbia SC called his arrangements \u201cdelicate but sweeping, making for a remarkably cohesive collection littered with stunners that rival many of indie folk\u2019s biggest names.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in South Carolina, Hutchens had been exposed from an early age to southern appalachian traditional music in the bluegrass, folk, and gospel genres as well as to styles ranging from classical orchestral to Nat King Cole to Nirvana. Family members played guitar and banjo and Ryan picked up guitar in his early teens but didn\u2019t consider it a serious calling for another decade. In 2010 Ryan began experimenting with songwriting and self recording, focusing on sparse guitar and vocal tracks combined with keyboards and synthesizers. In 2011, he became a founding artist of the newly formed Post Echo Media Label and started crafting a plethora of songs under his Grandfather\u2019s surname turned band name, \u201cCancellieri\u201d. As years passed and his musical experiences and interests grew, Ryan found that the honest root of what he wanted to do with music was best found in live performances and better executed with more traditional instrumentation.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2015, Hutchens released six albums under the Cancellieri name. Early Spring released in 2011; Bad Hands released in 2012; III released in 2013; Welcome To Mount Pleasant released in 2014; Closet Songs: A Collection Of Demos And Covers released in 2014; 46 And Raleigh released in 2015. Generally speaking, each album saw Hutchens progressing further away from his electronic and experimental musical beginnings, and closer to what he was doing at his live performances. The last two of these albums (Closet Songs and 46 And Raleigh) include original music but are predominantly based around Ryan\u2019s live performance covers of American traditional, gospel, bluegrass, and folk songs. In January of 2016, Ryan dropped the \u201cCancellieri\u201d moniker in favor of his real name. The name change facilitated his career shift from bedroom electronic song sculptor to touring singer songwriter and live performer. As part of this transition, a \u201cbest of\u201d album was released in September 2016 under the name Ryan Hutchens. This album is fittingly called Collection and features previously recorded and newly remastered tracks from the 2013 album III and the 2014 album Welcome To Mount Pleasant. Ryan followed up that release with his second original album, The Last Ten Years. The Last Ten Years was recorded at Archer Avenue Studio in Columbia South Carolina during the Summer of 2017 and independently released on October 13, 2017. Five years after beginning his never ending tour, he looks forward to continuing to create new music and to bringing his live performances to people around the world.", "otherInfo": "Ryan Hutchens will perform a live concert from his basement studio in Denver Colorado on Thursday May 7!

The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions. We have to build something to last, rather than just build it because it looks good at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Annie Zeleski", "otherInfo": "donate:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/Ounsworth"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Shane Martin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10366112.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Shane - One Man BandShane Martin Band:, Brad - Lead Guitar Background vocals, Shane Martin - Vocals Acoustic & Electric Guitar, SOLO, Shawn Kolles - Drums Background vocals, Mike May - Bass Background vocals", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The title of Shane Martin\u2019s latest album \u201cKeepin\u2019 The Night Alive\u201d sums up how he keeps his music alive and loves what he does: \u201cLivin\u2019 every moment, hangin\u2019 on for life\u201d and play his powerhouse brand of country rock. .

Timeless and timely, it's a classic sound with every word sang from the heart, driven forward by a mix of southern storytelling, Bible Belt twang, and Owens' big, booming baritone.\n\nFresh out of the studio, Owens has just finished recording his latest album due to release at year\u2019s end. He traveled to Texas for this project to record in The Panhandle House Studio enlisting the talents of JT Corenflos | Electric Guitar ( Alan Jackson, George Jones, Charley Pride, George Strait), Mitchell Smithey | Steele Guitar (Ray Price, Lee Ann Rimes, TG Sheppard, Gary Stuart), Dale Morris Jr. | Fiddle (Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Ray Price, Marty Stuart, Travis Tritt), Kerry Huckaba | Bass Guitar (The Hansons, The White River Band), Jay Brown | Piano (Canyon, Ty Herndon), and Andrew Raley | Drums (Deryl Dodd). Together, they captured a sound filled with fiddle, pedal steel and all the hallmarks of classic country music. Ten of the eleven tracks are penned by veteran writer Galen Griffin (Luke Bryan, Joe Diffie, Craig Morgan, Clay Walker) and magically Engineered and Produced by Nick \u201cAce\u201d Lutz (David Alan Coe, Ty Herndon, Little Texas, Ronnie Milsap, Kellie Pickler). This is an album filled with music intended to take the listener back to an earlier era in Country Music reminiscent of a simpler time. Owens shines brightly delivering each song with the same supersized voice that once shook the pews of his hometown church as the musicians expertly lay the sounds of Dance Halls long gone.\n\nLong before he hand-built his career in the honky-tonks and country clubs of the southeast, Owens grew up in rural Alabama. In many ways, it was a classic American upbringing, filled with family, faith, and music. Owens shines a light on those old-school values with his debut album Where I\u2019m Coming From and his newest release It\u2019s A Southern Thing, working closely with a roster of country music's top songwriters \u2014 including Bob Diperio, Greg Barnhill, Tony Stampley, Wynn Varble, Brian Callihan and Trent Willmon \u2014 for his most upbeat collection of songs to date.\n\n\"Like a lot of my favorite country singers, I grew up singing Gospel music,\" says Owens, who grew up listening to artists like Randy Travis and Keith Whitley. \"I grew up the same way, and I've stayed true to my Traditional Country roots. I'm still singing about going to church, eating fried chicken, and keeping it country. Why wouldn't I? Once you start trying to be something you're not, that's when you lose track of where you're headed.\"\n\nLongtime country music journalist Robert K. Oermann agrees, pointing to Owens' traditional approach as his strongest weapon. \"I like to think that there are cycles in [country] music,\" Oermann explains. \"Usually, the pendulum swings out and the Pop-Country people bring in a whole lot of new listeners, and then the new listeners discover real Country music. Then there's usually a swing back to more traditional styles. I hope we're on the cusp of that\u2026 and if we are, Shane is perfectly positioned.\"\nA self-made road warrior who was recently named \"Independent Artist of the Year\" by MusicRow Reveals 2018 Country Breakout Awards, Owens continues to maintain an active schedule of listening room and honky tonk shows along with festival appearances. He made his Grand Ole Opry debut in 2017. He also appeared at summertime events like CMA Music Festival and Jamboree In the Hills, both of which were voted as the top two American country music festivals of the year. Cracker Barrel has picked Owens' music to appear in several of the store's exclusive releases, including Country Faith America and Country Faith Love Songs, while Netflix included his song \"Country Never Goes Out of Style\" in the popular series The Ranch. No wonder Rolling Stone Country named Shane Owens one of the magazine's \"10 New Country Artists You Need to Know!\"\n\nNew music. New album. New shows. Shane Owens continues to more forward, but he also remains rooted in the sound that launched his career, breathing new life into a sound that's at once fresh and familiar. \"I've grown my business the old-school way,\" he explains. \"I played the honky-tonks for years. I developed myself and my sound. It can be tough when you've got a traditional sound, but I can't be anything I'm not. If it was easy to do, everybody would do it. And I'm nowhere near done doing it.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dawes ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8739115.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "New album PASSWORDS out now.\nhttp://smarturl.it/dawes-passwords", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Claire Cronin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6275731.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Gothic Americana, Dark Ambient, Folk", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "From Ba Da Bing!

Yet the homespun, heartwarming music of family-oriented indie folk group GoldenOak provides evidence that the dense woods of the Pine Tree State might just be a better muse than the slick streets of New York and LA.\n\nGoldenOak is driven by the songwriting and harmonies of the brother-sister duo Zak and Lena Kendall. After a bit of a recording hiatus and a shift in personnel, the group is back with an enchanting pair of songs. \u201cRiver\u201d and \u201cPoet And The Painter\u201d find this collective simultaneously building on previous strengths while also striking out in an interesting new direction.\n\nZak Kendall explains that he and his sister had a heart-to-heart about how the band should sound once some intra-band changes took place. \u201cWith the original lineup, we were very much a four-piece group. Everybody had similar roles in the band and there was not really much of a lead, per se. As the band evolved and those two bandmates left, Lena and I kind of sat down and said, \u2018What we were doing is changing up, but what\u2019s staying the same is our relationship to each other, our musical journey as siblings.\u2019 I think with this music we\u2019ve kind of settled into that role. We\u2019ve learned to really understand and work with each other, write together more, bounce ideas off each other.\u201d\n\nThe pair leaned into the family-oriented dynamic when they dove into the new material, recorded at Rustic Studios in Portland. \u201cThe new stuff is built around that relationship and particularly our vocals and our harmonies,\u201d Zak says. \u201cLike on \u2018Poet And The Painter\u2019, there\u2019s no lead vocals on it. It\u2019s us singing harmonies the whole time, kind of like Simon & Garfunkel\u2019s early stuff. When I wrote \u2018River\u2019, I said to Lena, \u201cI\u2019m writing this song, but I want you to sing it.\u201d That was the first time that I had written lyrics for Lena to sing. And so it really became the closest to a partnership that it\u2019s ever been for us. We were really working closely together on this new stuff.\u201d\n\nEven as Zak and Lena found a new direction by honoring their musical bond, which they first started to form during campfire singalongs as youngsters, the new members of the band, bassist Mike Knowles and drummer Jackson Cromwell, also helped determine the sound of this single. Zak explains the process since the release of the band\u2019s 2017 EP Foxgloves: \u201cIt\u2019s been like a year-and-a-half or so since we released music. We were touring with a cellist and a trumpet player at the time. They were big focal points of a lot of our arrangements and a lot of our writing. When they left, we started playing with Mike and Jackson. And they started shaping the direction of what we were going to be putting out, because we wanted it to sound like our live set was sounding. It took a long period before we started working on new stuff because we were adjusting to having a new lineup and getting to know each other as musicians and bandmates. As we felt we were starting to click, we started working on a new stuff.\u201d\nSpeaking of that new stuff, \u201cRiver\u201d manages to seamlessly connect two different pieces of music that Zak had been writing. The moody music, accompanying verses about how political shifts are mirrored by the changing seasons, segues into a more upbeat outro, connected by a gorgeous moment of brother and sister singing a cappella, \u201cI\u2019ve come to witness the things I can\u2019t see.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cPoet And The Painter\u201d find the two in close-harmony throughout, but the shuffle of the rhythm section adds some momentum to the lyrical musings on the potency of nature.\n\nIn many ways, the themes of GoldenOak\u2019s music are driven by their home base. \u201cMaine is such an interesting place to be an artist,\u201d Zak says. \u201cIt\u2019s so remote in a lot of ways. And the landscape and the woods are so inspiring. People are often spread out, but there\u2019s also this amazing artistic community, not only in Portland but also in the towns all over Maine.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing in a place like Maine, we\u2019re not surrounded by buildings. I think the art is very reflective of the landscape, the nature of Maine. As you walk through the woods, you never see the same thing twice. And I think that represents the Maine music scene in a perfect way.\u201d\n\nThat music scene has thrown its arms around GoldenOak, and, in return, the band is helping to draw more attention to it with these excellent new songs. \u201cThe Portland music scene is so friendly and welcoming,\u201d Zak says. \u201cI think, unfortunately, a lot of music scenes get competitive by nature. But that\u2019s something you just don\u2019t find in Portland. There\u2019s just a lot of fantastic people involved in it that kind of have that \u2018Mainer\u2019 attitude to help each other out and support each other.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tedeschi Trucks Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8582946.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Blues & Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The 12-piece band that booms like a soul thunderclap", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/DerekAndSusan"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Remorsefully Numb ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10324399.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Post Hardcore, Emo", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Remorsefully Numb is a post-hardcore band from Kansas City, Missouri, formed in 2016.", "otherInfo": "Be sure and tune into Perennial Talent Agency, May 7th to catch our unplugged set live.

Said lead singer Zack Kibodeaux, \u201cWe wrote this as a band, and we wanted to tap into the feeling of that special friendship where you know you can count on one another.

After seeing Doc Watson on TV, he became a lifelong devotee of old time and bluegrass music.\n\nHe started making his living as a musician at age 19 in Chicago and in Jackson, Wyoming, eventually relocating to Boulder, Colorado in the fall of 1974. O\u2019Brien found work there as a fiddler with local bluegrass bands and as a member of the Ophelia Swing, recording with them and with Pete Wernick in 1977. In those early Colorado years, he started playing the mandolin, and studied guitar and music theory with local jazz great Dale Bruning.\n\nIn 1978, Tim co-founded the bluegrass group Hot Rize with Pete Wernick, Charles Sawtelle, and Nick Forster. Hot Rize and Western Swing alter-egos Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers eventually recorded ten albums and toured the US, Europe, Japan, and Australia. The group was named Entertainer of the Year 1990 by the International Bluegrass Music Association, and their \"Colleen Malone\" was named IBMA\u2019s Song of the Year in 1991. He won IBMA\u2019s Male Vocalist of the year in 1993, and again in 2005, when he also won song of the year for \"Look Down That Lonesome Road\".\n\nSolo recordings started with 1982\u2019s \"Hard Year Blues\", and other projects included three duet albums with his sister Mollie O\u2019Brien. Folks in Nashville started noticing Tim\u2019s songs, and he had top ten country hits in 1989 and 1990 with Kathy Mattea\u2019s versions of Hot Rize songs \"Walk The Way The Wind Blows\" and \"Untold Stories\". Other notable covers by New Grass Revival, Nickel Creek, Garth Brooks, and the Dixie Chicks followed. Hot Rize went dormant in the spring of 1990, after which O\u2019Brien performed and recorded on his own, eventually releasing fourteen solo recordings, as well as collaborations with Dirk Powell (\"Songs From The Mountain\") and with Darrell Scott (\"Real Time\"). Landmarks solo releases include a Grammy nominated set of bluegrass Dylan covers \u2013 \"Red On Blonde\", the Celtic/Appalachian fusion of \"The Crossing\", and 2005\u2019s Grammy winning \"Fiddler\u2019s Green\".\n\nTim toured and recorded with Steve Earle\u2019s Bluegrass Dukes in the early 2000\u2019s, and with Mark Knopfler in 2009 and 2010. Other recent collaborations include another CD with Darrell Scott (\"Memories and Moments\"), a track with Steve Martin (\"Daddy Played The Banjo\"), a family band set of Roger Miller songs (\"Reincarnation\"), and the reunited Hot Rize\u2019s \"When I\u2019m Free\". A collaboration with Jerry Douglas, Shawn Camp and others -\"The Earls Of Leicester\" - won a Grammy as well as IBMA\u2019s Record of the Year in 2015.\n\nTim has produced recordings for Laurie Lewis, the Yonder Mountain String Band, the Infamous Stringdusters, Old Man Luedecke, and early mentor J.D. Hutchison. He has recorded and performed with The Chieftains, Joan Baez, Dierks Bentley, Bill Frisell, and the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra. He contributed to the movie soundtrack of \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" as well as those of \"Cold Mountain\", and \"The Blob\". He is a former president of the International Bluegrass Music Association, and currently serves on the board of the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame. O\u2019Brien formed his own record label, Howdy Skies Records, in 1999, and in 2015 launched the digital download label Short Order Sessions (SOS) with his partner Jan Fabricius. SOS releases a new track every month. He has two sons, Jackson and Joel , and has lived in Nashville since 1996.

He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage. Whether Love Saves The Day makes one dollar or a million isn\u2019t a big concern to him. It stands as a huge success because he made the gritty, honest album that he intended by \u201ckeeping it raw, keeping it immediate, keeping it real.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that he has honed over the years: \u201cbe original and be true to what you do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To Benefit Show Box, Seattle"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Amy Speace ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9217513.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Singer, Songwriter, Folk, Country, Singer-songwriter", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cAmy Speace is on a roll. Each new release has brought an expansion of her voice and her art, and she has reached the level of absolute mastery. Her new record Me and the Ghost of Charlemagne is brilliant. The song Ginger Ale and Lorna Doones is a masterpiece, a hard hitting gut punch on every level- voice, melody, words, performance, instrumentation. I nominate it for song of the year, and predict that this song will bring legions of new fans to Amy\u2019s work. Folk music doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d - Mary Gauthier\n\nA modern folksinger whose music nods to the genre's 1970s glory days, Amy Speace has spent two decades chronicling the high marks, heartbreaks, and hard roads of a life logged on the road. She's been a tireless traveler, chasing the dream from the coffeehouses of New York City to larger stages across the globe. Along the way, she's built an international audience without the help of a major label, relying instead upon a touring schedule whose milestones include the Glastonbury Festival, NPR's Mountain Stage, and a yearly average of 150 shows.\n\nMe And The Ghost Of Charlemagne finds Speace focusing on the other side of that so-called dream. The real side, filled with an ever-shifting balance of struggle and joy. Produced by longtime collaborator Neilson Hubbard and recorded during the final weeks of Speace's pregnancy with her first son, Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne captures Amy Speace at her most nakedly honest, with sparsely-decorated songs that double down on her larger-than-life voice and detail-rich songwriting. It\u2019s an album about the colliding of dreams and reality, full of characters making sense of their lives when something is lost and then found. Really, it's an album about the trials and triumphs of an artist's journey \u2014 a journey that's no longer focused upon the destination, but upon the actual trip itself.\n\nDiscovered and mentored by folk-pop icon Judy Collins during the early 2000s, Speace left her career as a classically-trained Shakespearean actress and, instead, kicked off a string of acclaimed albums, including Songs for Bright Street, The Killer in Me, and How to Sleep in a Stormy Boat. Championed by The New York Times, NPR and other taste-making outlets for her solo work, she received further acclaim as a member of Applewood Road, a harmony-heavy trio whose self-titled album became a critical success in the UK, earning a five-star review from The London Sunday Times.\n\nYears before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Speace was one of the genre's earliest champions, mixing the best parts of American roots music \u2014 gospel, alt-country, folk, classic pop \u2014 into her own songs. Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne follows in that diverse tradition, but it also shines its light on a new Amy Speace: a clear-eyed, reenergized songwriter who's done with chasing things that don't matter\u2026but isn't anywhere close to being done with her art.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Shaun Daniel ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10358054.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Blues, Acoustic Blues, Jazz, Americana, Folk Rock, World Music, Folk, Alt-country", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Shaun Daniel is a singer-songwriter whose style embraces folk rock, blues, jazz, Americana, world music, and more.

Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week. I only made it through one semester of college, but being around these amazing songwriters here in Austin\u2026 It\u2019s like getting an education.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Side Project ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9148919.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Adult Contemporary, Acoustic, Pop, Adult Alternative", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"Unique versions of your favorite cover songs and addictive original songs combined\"\n\nThis acoustic-indie-pop husband and wife team began performing in Seattle, WA in 2004.

The audience, however, is too busy dancing to the one-man acts layered guitar riffs, foot stomping percussion, blues harmonica, and emotionally charged lyrics to even think about looking away.\nThe New Jersey native is able to emulate the sound of a full rock band with his percussive fingerstyle approach to the acoustic guitar and an array of effects pedals. Kenny has even customized a vintage red suitcase which has been dubbed \u201cThe Big Red Suitcase\u201d to use as a kick drum, which has appeared with him on stage for over a decade of live performances.\nHis debut appearances at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park paved the way for Kenny\u2019s developing one-man band show and led him into the national touring circuit and beyond. Over years of honing his craft on the road, Kenny caught the attention of one of his guitar idols, Mickey Melchiondo, a.k.a. Dean Ween from WEEN. Melchiondo recently asked Kenny to tour opening up for his new band, The Dean Ween Group, and has gained him new fans around the United States. Kenny has also been spreading his music internationally with multiple tours throughout Europe and performances in SE Asia to raise awareness about unexploded bombs. In recent years he has shared the stage with the likes of John Butler Trio, Keller Williams, WEEN, The Dean Ween Group, Leon Russell, John Hammond Jr., New Riders of the Purple Sage and John Kadlecik (Further & Dark Star Orchestra). In January of 2016, The Eagles of Death Metal released Kenny\u2019s version of \"I Love You All The Time\" as a part of their Pay it Forward Campaign to raise money for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.\nOn his latest self-titled release, Kenny teamed up with three-time Grammy Winning Producer Justin Guip (Sound engineer for Levon Helm and current touring drummer for Hot Tuna) to create a record that expanded on his signature one-man band sound. The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks. With an influential voice that lies somewhere between Neil Young and Jack White, Kenny delivers clear and concise visions of dynamic musical deliverance. Combining a deep dive into tone, originality and believability, he ushers the listener into his brand new living room of roots riddled rock and roll.\nNever going for the standard attack, he flies far from the 12-bar blues, three-chord rock and Americana stereotype to land some place between a rock and a new place. The album illustrates a highly skilled writer who utilizes the same down-home approach in his music as he does with his day-to-day interactions with others. It\u2019s a combination that will continue to see Kenny reach exciting new levels as he helps future fans \u201csee the light\u201d of his musical message.\nTo hear his full discography, watch recent videos, and check out upcoming tour dates visit www.KeithKenny.com\n(Excerpt from John Pfieffer & Jessica Smith of The Aquarian Weekly)", "otherInfo": "Virtual Tip Jar!\nVenmo: Keith-Kenny-1\nPaypal: Keith@KeithKenny.com or Paypal.me/KeithKenny\nCashApp: $KeithKenny\n\nMerchandise!

The lead off track, \"Still My Girl\" tells a relatable story of finding a significant others flaws and imperfections to be what you love most about them. The title track is the story of a troubadour who travels around working odd jobs and various 9-5's in an attempt to follow societal norms. \"Feel Like Gold\" is a polite jab at today's society. \"If we stick to hate, then all that's left to do is wait and see.\"\n\nAndy says about his new EP, \"Perhaps for the first time in my life I do feel a sense of fulfillment. Life is good. I've met the right lady, I go for long runs in the morning, I'm constantly inspired by my job. I enjoy myself. What gives me wicked dreams is not achieving my career goals. When I was 17, I promised myself that by 30 I'd be headlining 500 cap rooms and playing stages like the Telluride Blues & Brews Festival and eTown. Perhaps my goals were ignorant statements at the time, but I'm 28 (quickly approaching 29) and I'm nowhere near where I want to be. Yes, I'm thankful for what I have! Yes, I'm happy!

It's easy to see why she's caught the ear of greats like legendary Lubbock, Texas fiddler Tommy Hancock (widely regarded as the godfather of West Texas music), who was quoted as saying of Leigh's work; \"It's great to hear music that affects you on an intellectual level as well as makes you want to dance\".\n\nAll musical and performing prowess aside, the thing Leigh has become most famous for is her whip-smart songwriting. Her songs have been recorded by country music legend Lee Ann Womack, Sunny Sweeney, Charley Crockett, Whitney Rose, Austin's The Carper Family, and Norway's Liv Marit Wervik, among others. Leigh has collaborated with songwriting greats such as Jim Lauderdale, Rodney Crowell, John Scott Sherrill, Robbie Fulks, Charlie Louvin and David Olney. On the critically acclaimed duet album Holdin' Our Own (2008), Leigh sang duets penned with country rockabilly giant Jesse Dayton. In 2013 Leigh released the Gurf Morlix produced Before The World Was Made with her frequent songwriting and touring partner Noel McKay. In 2015, Leigh appeared on Don't Forget Me Little Darling, Remembering the Carter Family, along with fiddler Jenee Fleenor (Blake Shelton) and guitarist Brandon Rickman (Lonesome River Band). Leigh was a core member of country bluegrass band High Plains Jamboree from 2015 to 2017, also featuring guitarist Noel McKay and bassist and banjo player Simon Flory.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town.

She combines her pop and folk influences to help us arrive at the refreshing and simple truths as we each go through our own journeys.\n\nGrowing up in a suburb of Los Angeles, Cat was surrounded by the entertainment industry. Her dad, a screenwriter and stand-up comedian, always encouraged her to pursue her passions. Always a writer, Cat soon put words to music when she combined her love for writing with piano. At 16, she released her first EP, Cat Ivy, and began performing around the Los Angeles area at venues such as the Mint and the Witzend.\n\nSoon after, Cat left for college, trading pop music for Classical and Jazz. Studying intensively at the George Washington University in Washington, DC, Cat found herself aching to get back in the studio and have the freedom to create her own music. A psychology major and music minor during the day, Cat would spend hours late at night in the basement of a building writing songs. On her 21st birthday, Cat realized that she couldn\u2019t picture herself doing anything other than creating music and decided that night she would move back to Los Angeles and pursue a career as a singer/songwriter.\n\nUpon moving back to Los Angeles, Cat became involved at the Songwriting School of Los Angeles where she diligently focused on creating music both on her own and with other members of the community.

Most clear in my memory, even amid the party that a live music backstage scene can tend to be, Will was the happiest guy in the place \u2013 clearly exactly where he wanted to be, and loving every second. This was a contagious vibe from the outset, one that Will had no trouble channeling into music that rings in the heart of the listener, and a live show as inspiring as it is entertaining. Between two acclaimed and successful albums, 2012\u2019s Rose Queen and 2015\u2019s Ringling Road, and what now clocks in at a near-decade's worth of dogged road work, William Clark Green has established himself as one of the most important voices of his genre - a voice that now pipes up again on his anticipated new album, Hebert Island.\n\nTexas is a big place, complete with fully distinct sub-territories - we reserve the right to bust into several states, should that become strategically expedient - and our traveling musical artists tend to become experts on the rich mosaic that makes up Texas' cultural geography. Will has found himself onstage in a growing portion of her 254 counties, and has called several his home; as he puts it, \"I kinda spend six years everywhere\". Childhood northeast in Tyler, high school years in College Station, college years at Texas Tech in Lubbock, early music career years in the north-central hamlet of Eastland, and lately his most urban digs so far, in Fort Worth - but deep down, Will's Cajun roots call to him incessantly, and thus southeast Texas is never far from his mind. The new album is named for Will's retreat at Hebert Island (say \"AY-Bear\", though you'll occasionally hear \"HEE-Bert\") near Beaumont, and refers to the hilltop upon which his camphouse sits - not an actual island, but a potential one, should the occasional flood come to pass; high ground is valuable in this landscape. Will considers himself a \"half-ass coon-ass\" - a distantly-descended Cajun, but one who holds a deep appreciation for that history and that way of life. \"It's a real place\", Will insists, with the feeling that only such a beloved space can foster - his family has owned it since 1869, in the early years of Reconstruction, and is where they established one of the state's first rice farming operations. It's a place that echoes through time for William Clark Green, connecting his family's past and tradition to who he is as an artist, and as a man, today.\n\nIt's been over three years since Ringling Road. \"I'm not gonna force songs,\" Will sighs. \"We could have finished the record a long time ago, but we didn't like the mixes - we're the bosses, and we don't have to listen to ourselves.\" The pressures and deadlines of the professional recording artist are nothing new, and while he certainly notices that pressure, Will recognizes it to be a good problem to have. \"I remember when no one gave a shit, so yeah, it's incredible to have that want-to. So far, every record I've come out with has been my best record - I wrote my ass off for this one. I wanted to make sure it beat Ringling Road, and I'm not bragging on myself - I just knew it was going to take effort.\"\n\nThat effort has paid off; Hebert Island is a stellar new batch of songs from a guy who has gone to great lengths to keep his energy focused, through all distraction, on quality songcraft. \"My favorite songwriter is Guy Clark - the songwriter's songwriter. It's what I've always cared about the most...the craft of songs is really where it's at for me. I think good songs are undeniable.\" Mostly recorded at Nashville\u2019s Sound Emporium with Benjy Davis at the board, the new album also features players who have been backing Will for near the full ride, including guitarist Steven Marcus and bassist Cameron Moreland. \u201cGoner\u201d stands as a shimmering, no-hard-feelings take on the moment of breakup, the protagonist of the quasi-travelogue \u201cStay\u201d understands that it doesn\u2019t matter where you are, as long as you\u2019re close to love, and the ballad \u201cShe Loves Horses\u201d exemplifies both the warmth and strength that\u2019s developed in Will\u2019s songwriting and the performance power of his players.\n\nWill's desired contribution to the world is songs that change lives for the better, and he realizes that he's conduit as much as creator for that change. And in spite of - or, perhaps, because of - the demands and pressures of the life he's chosen, and the position of leadership he's earned through a decade of determination, William Clark Green is a guy who takes none of this for granted. \"Our path is guided by something that's greater than me, I believe that. We can be very proud of what we've accomplished; we've done it the right way...I feel very proud of what we've done, and I'm thankful every day for where we're at.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bowling for Soup ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10360550.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Pop Punk", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bowling for Soup (acronym: BFS, or sometimes B4S) is an alternative, comedy band based in Denton, Texas (but originally from Wichita Falls, Texas) formed in 1994 from the ruins of an old metal band.

As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album.

In the last 25 years, they have toured both nationally and internationally with various artists.\n\nFresh out of college Doug Byrkit and Brian Zielie met Mike Zito who was looking for a rhythm section to form his band.

In the late \u201990s, they recorded Blue Room which celebrated it\u2019s 20th Anniversary and was recently remastered and released on Ruf Records.\n\nOdds Lane was formed in 2003 and they began recording and playing live to a steadily growing fan base. As part of an effort to promote emerging artists, they were invited to record at legendary Sun Studios, after which they released the first of several projects as independent songwriters in 2004. In 2012 their release Dark Matters garnered Byrkit an ASCAP Plus Songwriting Award.\n\nLOST & FOUND, Odds Lane\u2019s newest release on Gulf Coast Records was inspired by the re-mastered release of Mike Zito\u2019s Blue Room.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT).

Consisting of guitarist and vocalist Todd Tate alongside drummer Daniel Guaqueta, Sayla Dobro was brewed up in the Bay Area, between Marin and San Francisco. Originally created as a stage name for Tate\u2019s persona in a now defunct Marin bar-hopping band, \"The Deep Sounds of Bobby Peru\", Sayla Dobro has since evolved into a much more complex and mature getup.\n\nThe band really kicked off after Tate saw dobro guitar virtuoso Jerry Douglas play live - he instantly went out and bought a dobro guitar and starting writing and recording immediately. Now part of his namesake, Sayla Dobro is characterized by Tate\u2019s customized Regal RD-35 square neck dobro. Enter Colombian-raised, Mississippi-born multi-instrumentalist Daniel Guaqueta. The drummer and Tate came together through mutual friend Michael Starita, President of the San Francisco area Grammy chapter. Starita mixed the first two Sayla Dobro singles, \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d and \u201cJ-Train\u201d. During this time, he introduced Guaqueta and Tate and the rest was history.\n\nSayla Dobro\u2019s songs hearken seasoned folk-rockers like Beck and Calexico, thoughtfully self-produced and rough around the edges. It\u2019s no surprise that Sayla Dobro has been able to capture such a potent essence - the band\u2019s frontman and lead songwriter Todd Tate\u2019s industry experience runs deep. In the mid-nineties Tate\u2019s main focus was audio engineering at The Blue Room Studios, working on Grammy nominated Latin jazz with Carlos \u201cPatato\u201d Sanchez, and with popular rock artists like Train. On the brink of the millennium, Tate ditched full-time engineering and went to the other side of the glass to focus on making his own music. He made a rock record with a new group Life Love Misery (members of The Starship and Cacophony).\n\nMeanwhile, Guaqueta has a rich musical background of his own. He\u2019s written and released music with artists including Questions in Dialect, Buddy & The Squids, Mainframe Theory, and Storage 24. He\u2019s collaborated directly with Roy Mitchell-Cardenas (of Mutemath) and Mississippi rapper Kamikaze. His diverse background runs further; Guaqueta\u2019s visual artwork has earned honors for his music videos, including the Telly Award, the Addy Award, and the Ruma Award at Crossroads Film Festival.\n\nWith plans to release singles and videos \"very often\" in the upcoming months of 2016, Sayla Dobro is ready to hit the ground running. Supporters of the band\u2019s efforts to release a new single every month can download the band\u2019s single's as they are released in any format now at sayladobro.com/music or any online digital music service. In the upcoming months, fans also have the opportunity to pledge support on Patreon or Bandcamp and receive access to the private Sayla Dobro social feed, an array of special \"awards\", and even a live performance at their own home or business.", "otherInfo": "Live Dobro, electric and acoustic guitar, singing to tracks.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lowground Records ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8600706.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Americana, Blues-rock, Soul, Rock", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "We are a community-driven record label producing music, videos and live performances directly for our fans.

There are so many layers to Canadian-Colombian singer Lido Pimienta\u2019s identity that you might get lost in them. But if you did, you\u2019d be missing the point.\n\nHer multi-textural, mind-bending voice and music project what Canada\u2019s The Globe and Mail called her \u201cbold, brash, polarizing\u201d persona, which constantly confronts the powers that be. But it also reveals an embrace of the Afro- and Indigenous traditions that is at once defiant, delicate and sweetly nostalgic.\n\nPimienta\u2019s new album Miss Colombia takes her ecstatic hybridity to a new level, building on the \u201cnu\u201d intersection of electronica and cumbia established by her first two albums, Color, released in 2010, and the 2016 Polaris Prize-winning La Papessa as Canadian album of the year. The latter was the first 100% independently released, non- English or French album to win the $50,000 prize. Produced with Matt Smith, a/k/a Prince Nifty, Miss Colombia overflows with the kind of understated genius that promises yet another breakthrough.\n\nAs a Canadian global-beats trailblazer, Lido has an affinity for acts like A Tribe Called Red and Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq, but her work also resonates with British-Sri Lankan rapper MIA and she draws unabashed inspiration from the New York-bred Dominican-Trinidadian rap queen Cardi B. Miss Colombia has the effect of expanding the narrative about her dual Colombian/Canadian identity to her family\u2019s mixed roots in the Afro-Colombian and Indigenous Wayuu communities, while establishing an ambitious new sonic palette that brings her closer to home.\n\nWho or what exactly is Miss Colombia? Pimienta\u2019s new album\u2019s title was inspired by Miss Universe MC Steve Harvey\u2019s gaffe in 2015 when he mistakenly awarded the crown to Miss Colombia instead of the actual winner, Miss Philippines. The incident not only caused her to reflect on the anti-blackness she experienced as a child growing up in Barranquilla, but the fact that while her sister was groomed to be a beauty queen, she suffered through an awkward adolescence as the \u201cweird artistic tomboy\u201d of the family.\n\n\u201cSo I was like am I still Colombian or should I just keep calm and carry on because I\u2019m Canadian now?\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the premise and genesis of Miss Colombia.\u201d\n\nThe central mood of Miss Colombia coalesces around a series of moving, musical poems embracing how she\u2019s loved and lost. The journey magically documents an introspection tinged with sadness, yet still evoking a kind of optimism about experiencing the emotion in glorious repetition. \u201cTe Quer\u00eda,\u201d (I Wanted You) pulses with a kind of samba-like cumbia, floating in the memory of desire and denial. The narrator\u2019s \u201cwant\u201d is quickly dismissed by quoting 2018\u2019s Latin trap hit \u201cTe Bot\u00e9\u201d (I discarded you).\n\nAs Pimienta more firmly grounded herself in her return to the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where Miss Colombia was recorded \u201clive\u201d in rustic settings, her approach evolved from the opulent electronic crafting of La Papessa to something even more sensual and spiritual. The change in scenery helped her closer to her goal of re-contextualizing her music. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to control electronic music,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWhat\u2019s hard about electronic music is to make it sound emotional, make it sound beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe emblematic track \u201cEso Que Tu Haces,\u201d flows with an ethereal mysticism that fuses Lido\u2019s love for traditional porro and slow-building cumbia. Its unique orchestral swirl of wind instruments and synthetic sounds quickly sets the tone for Miss Colombia. On \u201cNada,\u201d she teams up with Bomba Estereo\u2019s Li Samuet, venturing further with her transcendent soprano, crafted with precision and clarity, and driven by sharp-edged metallic beats.\n\nLido clearly remembers the moment when she began her journey as a transnational, cultural mixing experiment as a singer. The brashly dynamic electro-cumbia diva had gone through several phases, starting in her early teens fronting punk and metal bands, and had become obsessed with trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack and Tricky.\n\n\u201cIt was before I moved to Canada, I was in this dance group called Cumb\u00e9 in Colombia,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy cousin was one of the drummers in the group and he told me, \u2018you know you have a really good voice, why would you waste that voice on this depressing music?\u201d\n\nPimienta\u2019s cousin then introduced her to an Afro-Colombian group called Sexteto Tabala, who she later collaborated with on the song \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves\u201d (I Want You To Save Me). Initially formed in 1996, Sexteto Tabal\u00e1 are the cultural heartbeat of Palenque and guardians of Afro-Latin musical history who can swing like a salsa band, groove like a fuji orchestra and serenade you all at the same time. They are one of the most representative musical expressions of the African communities in Colombia.\n\nPimienta credits her time in Sexteto with the development of her singing and overall aesthetic. \u201cThat\u2019s what shaped me, how I learned to have stage control,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because of some bar in Ontario; it was because I was in front of thousands of people singing Afro-Colombian spiritual music.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the flow of Miss Colombia so riveting and rewarding. Structurally it\u2019s bookended by two versions of \u201cPara Transcribir,\u201d one listed as \u201cSol,\u201d (Sun) and the other \u201cLuna\u201d (Moon), a song that tries to come to grips with Pimienta--who is fully bilingual--as a perpetual translator of cultures. The edgy playfulness of her love songs gives way to tracks like \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves,\u201d \u201cPelo Cucu,\u201d which celebrates the symbolic African texture of her hair, and \u201cResisto y Ya,\u201d which makes pointed reference to recent massive Colombian protests against the current government.\n\nWith the latter track, Lido wants to make it clear that while she shares the popular disdain for a \u201cpolitics of division\u201d that squeezes Colombians, she insists that just by being who she is, an Afro-Indigenous, queer feminist, and Canadian outsider, she has always been engaged in resistance. The setting of the recording with Sexteto Tabala in San Basilio de Palenque, a historic town settled by escaped slaves in the 17th century, allows for an expression of healing through traditional culture. \u201cThe chance has arrived/To fix our past,\u201d she sings hauntingly in the chorus of \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel like Miss Colombia is me really doing it for real,\u201d mused Lido. \u201cLike I feel everything up until this point has been happy accident or a horrible accident. This album has been a beautiful process. It\u2019s a really good representation of where I am now and where I\u2019m ready to go next.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Devon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8392678.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A talented singer and songwriter, Devon began her musical career when she was still an innocent-eyed child. She managed to record two full-length albums and tour with some of the music world's biggest names even before she hit the age of 20. Her first album drew rave reviews from most critics and put her on the often rocky road toward stardom.\n\nDevon was born in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in the spring of 1982. She grew up in a household filled with music and family and friends. She admits some of her influences include Bikini Kill, Frank Zappa, and even some of the classic rock & roll groups her parents loved, like the Beatles. At a young age, Devon practiced vocal harmony with her father. Later she used his old guitar to strum out her first tentative notes. By the time she was 15, she was putting her musical talents to work, playing in front of local places for change from those who stopped to listen. There was never any other dream in her mind but music, and luckily no one to tell her it was the kind of dream that was out of reach.\n\nWhen Devon was still in her teens, she recorded her debut album, a self-titled offering filled with original songs. That album -- really, her voice on that album -- drew a lot of interest, and in the end landed her a spot touring as a side act with the very popular Dave Matthews Band. One tour turned into two. For 2001, Devon released a second album, LONG SLEEVE STORY, under the Three Word Records label. She had some pretty impressive help on her sophomore release, such as drummer Nate Brown, bassist David Saull, trumpeter John D'earth, and bass player Stefan Lessard, who also served as producer for the album.\n\nDevon's 2003 CD, UPSTATE SONGS, (City Salvage Records) was included in Rolling Stone's \u201cCritics Top Albums of 2003\u201d. Critic Julie Gerstein called the record \u201cperhaps the sweetest and most honest folk-pop album recorded this year,\u201d and added, \u201cSproule's vocal and lyrical beauty is unmatched.\"\n\n2007 brought the release of her 'getting-married' (to songwriter Paul Curreri) CD, KEEP YOUR SILVER SHINED (City Salvage/Waterbug). Produced by Jeff Romano in the heart of Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge mountains, this CD highlights Sproule\u2019s talent for combining Appalachian, folk and jazz influences. From the front porch thump of \"Old Virginia Block\" to the high lonesome traditional \"The Weeping Willow,\u201d featuring fellow Virginia-native Mary Chapin Carpenter, the record finds Sproule making another important contribution to the Great American Songbook. The New Yorker magazine: The nimble singer-guitarist Devon Sproule chronicles her ongoing love affairs with humanity, nature, and the state of Virginia. She performs with a sweet, round diction that shines through even her most ornate imagery and rambunctious melodies. In July 2007 Devon graced the cover of fRoots magazine in the UK; the first American artist on the cover this decade.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tim Burgess ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8263503.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tim Burgess (born Timothy Allan Burgess on May 30, 1967, in Salford, Lancashire, England) is the lead singer of British rock/indie act The Charlatans.

Sinclar started DJing in 1986, when he was just 18 years old, specializing in funk and hip-hop music, with the name Chris The French Kiss. His first club hit was Gym & Tonic, a track produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, featuring vocals illegally taken from a Jane Fonda fitness tape. The Bob Sinclar persona was based on a character from Philippe de Broca's film Le Magnifique.\n\nSinclar is famous for popularizing the \"french touch\" of house music, with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. His track \"Feel for You\", a tribute to french musician Cerrone, from his second album Champs Elys\u00e9es, hit #9 in the UK Top 40. On track \"Darlin'\", he worked with vocalist James \"D-Train\" Williams.\n\nSinclar has also worked under other pseudonyms. Under the aliases The Mighty Bop and Reminiscence Quartet, he has dabbled in hip-hop and acid jazz. He also created the Africanism project, where an ensemble of artists produce house music with a combination of latin, jazz, african and tribal flavors. In 2005 he scored a hit with his single \"Love Generation\", that reached #1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts and the German Media Control Single Charts in 2006. The song was a huge success throughout Europe, also peaking at no. 2 in the Dutch Top 40. The followup hit was \"World, Hold On\", that features Steve Edwards and also managed to chart in the top ten in most of the European countries. \"Rock this Party (Everybody Dance Now)\" followed on August 22, 2006.\n\nThe remix of \"World, Hold on\" by E-Smoove is nominated for a Grammy 2007 in the category \"Remixed Recording\". Also, \"World Hold on\" was chosen by Billboard Magazine as the number one Hot Dance Club Play Single of 2006, beating Madonna and Christina Aguilera.\n\nThe fourth single of the album 'Western Dream' called 'Tennessee' was supposed to be released in April 2007, but has been cancelled due to the rumour of a new album being released.\n\nThis album is Soundz Of Freedom. It came out in France on May 21st. It has not yet come out in the United States.\n\nTaken from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Sinclar)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Roberto Surace ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Danny Howard ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Selena Faider ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Duke Dumont ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8735823.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Blas\u00e9 Boys Club.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "A-Trak ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8934783.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "At a time when the DJ sits firmly at the center of popular culture, A-Trak stands out as MVP, the key participant who holds together all facets of the craft.

Over the last couple of years, the man originally turned on to the dance by Derrick Carter has fomented his own groove driven, emotive brand of house that now resonates around the world. Turning heads right from the off were his compilations on Deep Down and Defected, which found Sonny adding his remix flair to a bunch of classics, and after that came sophomore effort After Parties & Aeroplanes. Again a collaborative affair featuring the likes of Doorly, Gene Farris and Cajmere, it was a more jacking, sharp-edged treat designed for maximum dance floor impact, but was also stuffed with unforgettable vocals that agin saw Sonny stepping up his game.\n\n2016 saw the already influential artist stepping up yet again, this time by making his brilliant entry into the hallowed Defected In the House series. His standout contribution is a terrific three disc affair that is jam packed with his own stellar originals and remixes as well as some brand new and exclusive material (including Sonny Fodera ft. Alex Mills \u2013 \u2018Always Gonna Be,\u2019 Sonny Fodera ft. Shannon Saunders \u2018Over This\u2019 and \u2018The Definition\u2019 amongst many others). Aside from that high impact work, Sonny has also turned out a consistently excellent string of EPs on labels like Defected, Dirtybird and Visionquest, as well as remixing Rudimental. Never was he in finer form that with \u2018Let Go\u2019, a collaboration with Cervendos that sat pretty in the Beatport Deep House Top 10 for no fewer than 12 weeks in 2014, whilst more recently, his current single with Yasmin, \u2018Feelin U\u2019 shot straight in to the 2nd spot in the Beatport chart, only to be outdone by a stunning remix of Gershon Jackson on the legendary Strictly Rhythm label. As such, Sony currently has no fewer than six releases in the Beatport Deep House Top Ten, proving that he is very much creating the sounds of now for DJs and dancers everywhere.\n\nAs a result, of course, Sonny is a hugely in demand DJ who started 2016 with a 30 date tour of the UK, United States and Australia. It was his smooth technical skills in the booth that first won him the affections of Green Velvet, and nowadays he weaves his tight, seductive sets featuring all colours of the house spectrum everywhere from Footwork Toronto to Warung in Brazil, Cielo in New York City to Pacha, Sankeys, Amnesia DC10 and in Ibiza as well as We ARE FSTVL and many others.\n\nThe future is just as bright as the past for Sonny, who was born in Adelaide, Australia, and has lived between there, Ibiza, the USA and the UK since, though he is currently settled in London. It means he is fully focussed on the next chapter, which already promises to be a thrilling one for his fans, with a new album due on Defected \u2018Frequently Flying\u2019 , as well as more EPs on influential labels like Cajual and Lee Foss\u2019s highly anticipated new imprint, Repoulate Mars.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "offaiah ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8893725.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Tech House, Techno, House", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "BOOKINGS:\nAMERICA: hamilton.wright@unitedtalent.com\nROW: ben@radiusartists.com\n\nMANAGEMENT:\nCircle Eight Management\nmicky@circleeightmgmt.com\n\nStill waters run deep, but OFFAIAH prefers to keep it that way.\nAfter growing up in East London, he did a little revitalizing\nhimself in tandem with the growth of his town that was\nthreatened to crumble under neglect and rubble.

In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa.

Born with a membrane between her and the rest of the world, yet still very much connected to and dependent on a larger life force. It\u2019s this origin story that inspired the name of Squirrel Flower\u2019s new album I Was Born Swimming.\n\nWilliams comes from a deep-rooted musical family tree. Her grandparents were classical musicians who lived in the Gate Hill Co-op, an artistic cooperative from upstate New York that grew out of Black Mountain College. Ella\u2019s father, Jesse Williams, spent most of his life as a touring jazz and blues performer and educator, and lends his bass playing to the album (listen for his smooth solo on \u201cHeadlights\u201d). Growing up in a family of hard working musicians fostered a love of music and started Williams down her own musical path. As a child, Williams adopted the alter ego of Squirrel Flower. A couple years later, she began singing with the Boston Children\u2019s Chorus while studying music theory and teaching herself to play the guitar. As a teen, she discovered the Boston DIY and folk music scenes and began writing, recording, and performing her own songs, now returning to the name Squirrel Flower as her chosen moniker. By the time Williams had begun performing live, recording and touring she was already well on her way to the signature artful songcraft heard on the album.\n\nSquirrel Flower\u2019s music is ethereal and warm, gushing with emotional depth that the listener can step into like a warm bath. The band on I Was Born Swimming plays with delicate intention, keeping the arrangements natural and light. The album was tracked live, with few overdubs, at The Rare Book Room Studio in New York City with producer Gabe Wax (Adrienne Lenker, Palehound, Cass McCombs). The musicians were selected by Wax and folded themselves into the songs effortlessly. At the heart of the album lives Williams\u2019 massive, haunted vibrating voice and melancholic, soulful guitar playing. The sounds expand and contract over diverse moods, cutting loose on the heavier riffs of \u201cRed Shoulder\u201d or \u201cStreetlight Blues,\u201d both recorded in her hometown of Boston, and holding back with atmospheric restraint on \u201cSeasonal Affective Disorder\u201d or \u201cBelly Of The City\u201d.\n\nI Was Born Swimming begins with an Iowa drive down I-80 and continues to travel, poetically, between her college town of Grinnell Iowa, Boston, MA and New York City where the album was recorded. Throughout the 12 songs, landscapes change and relationships shift, \u201cThere\u2019s so much in the record about movement and stagnation. Feeling stuck, needing to move, needing to stay still, swimming, falling, running, growing, etc etc.\u201d said Williams. The album\u2019s lyrics feel like effortless expressions of exactly the way it feels to change \u2014 abstract, sad and hopeful.\n\nWilliams eventually returns to the image of her in the sac; born swimming, knowing how to exist, love herself, and not needing anyone else to do it for her.\n\nBorn swimming in blue water\nDidn\u2019t ever need another\nNow I live underwater.\nHeat\u2019s rising\nCan you see it shimmer?\nI\u2019m spinning\nCan you see me shimmer?\nI\u2019m moving faster than it\nCan you see me shimmer?\nSo dip me in the water.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sofi Tukker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9797297.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Dance, Electronic, Jungle Pop", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"FUCK THEY\" IS OUT NOW: smarturl.it/FuckThey Debut EP: smarturl.it/SoftAnimals", "otherInfo": "TUCKER & SOPHIE\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfa4\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfa4DJing live from our living room everyday at 1PM EST and virtual festivals on TWITCH"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sorry ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9491038.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Punk, Hardcore Punk", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "There are two bands known as sorry.

In the following years he started his own production studio dedicating his time to produce his own material as well as developing tracks for many other artists from the romanian dance scene.\n\n2014 came with a change of scenery, switching from mainstream music to deephouse, making a great impression with the smashing remix for 'Colindul Cerbului', which boosted his brand on romanian clubbing scene, as well as outside its borders.\n\nThough he loves playing in nightclubs or festivals, his love for music goes beyond the spectrum of mixing tunes. As a producer, he has found plenty of ways to express himself musically.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about mood and a housy, hypnotic groove [\u2026] playing those tracks that get you tapping your feet and nodding your head without you realizing it, regardless of tempo, style, or release date. \u201c\n\n2017 / 2018, became one of the most airplayed dj/producer on Dance FM radio with 7 tracks, encouraging him to release the nine EP called \"Going Forward\".\n\n2020 is a year for new challenges.

Though like almost all love stories, this one is not without its complications. Offering wistful rumination on how mental health can send shockwaves through even the most intimate and entwined of relationships, \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 sees Karima strike a masterful balance of meditative and melancholy songwriting.\n\n\u201cIn a world where we sometimes feel we can\u2019t speak out, we tend to take it the worst out on people closest to us.\u201d says Karima, opening-up about the track\u2019s fragile subject matter.\nRelocating from the shores of the Irish Sea to the expansive horizons of the Pacific last year, \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 was one of a number of new songs penned in Venice Beach, California, as the singer found herself instinctively drawn to the sun and sounds radiating from the West Coast and its simmering alternative scene. Finding a kindred spirit in LA producer Tim Carr (who also produced her sublime \u2018Shelf Life\u2019 track of last year), the textured and transient feel of \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 is testament to the stimulating new environs Karima found herself writing in.\n\u201cI was fantasising about making more, organic, saturated sounding records for a long time and alongside this, I wanted to record out in America as I was finding most of my musical influences were artists from America.\u201d she says. \u201cLast year I made the move to go out to California to find the sound for the new record and to immerse myself in the West Coast indie/alternative scene and out there, the relationship with Tim bloomed and the music was made.\u201d\n\nDusky of atmosphere and mellifluous of melody, the record also features appearances from close friend Simon Edwards on Bass (who notably played on Talk Talk\u2019s seminal \u2019Spirit of Eden\u2019 record; a favourite of Karima\u2019s), plus London-based singer/songwriter Klara from Sweden who feathers the record with its ethereal omnichord layerings.\n\nProduced by Tim Carr, the track was further mastered by Grammy-nominated Phillip Shaw Bova (Andy Shauf, Father John Misty).\n\n\u2018Orange Rose\u2019 arrives with a captivating video filmed in Las Vegas just before Christmas last year. \u201cI had the idea about a concept of self-destructive behaviour\u201d she says, \u201ca constant running away from our fears which potentially ends in us running away from the people who can make us whole again.\u201d Subtle of narrative and cinematic in quality, the video finds Karima lost deep in thought and caught-up between a rock and a hard place in the Nevada state city. Karima Francis is a critically acclaimed musician and songwriter, renowned for her innate ability to blend haunting melodies with honest lyrics and alluring ambiance. With an ear for music evident from an early age, Karima went on to release her debut album \u2018The Author\u2019 in 2009 to widespread critical acclaim. Her consequent album\u2019s \u2018The Remedy\u2019 (2012) and \u2018Black\u2019 (2016) witnessed further acknowledgment of her artistic abilities and saw her truly begin to spread her wings. Her journey to date has found her playing on Later\u2026 With Jools Holland, supporting the likes of Paul Simon, Amy Winehouse and The Stereophonics, as well as working with renowned producer Flood (Nine Inch Nails, Nick Cave, PJ Harvey, Depeche Mode). Entering her thirties, Karima found a new rhythm to recording life on the West Coast of the USA last year.

During a bad patch in his life, when he\u2019d lost his woman, was stuck in a dead end job, and down on his luck, he decided to make a change. Leaving everything behind, he took to the road on a musical pilgrimage around America that would come to define his sound and himself. Picking up an old guitar in a pawn shop along the way he found gigs from town to town playing his way across the states in the tradition of the delta Bluesmen before him.\n\nThen while stumbling home drunk one night along the main drag of Nashville, he came across a crowd. The crowd were surrounding an old man playing a one string guitar made from a broom handle and a box, while playing drums with his feet. In that moment Ben new he had found the inspiration he was looking for. But it wasn\u2019t until he made his way to New Orleans that he managed to get his hands on such an instrument. Walking down the backstreets of the french quarter he found his way into an old instrument shop selling a cigar box guitar. And he realised that he\u2019d discovered something special.\n\nWhen he finally got back to London along with the collection of songs he\u2019d written along the road, he recorded his first album \u2018Broken Man\u2019. With nothing more than the equipment he had to hand, he self released the album to critical acclaim. The Blues Magazine called him 'A unique musical identity\u2019; Blues Blast Magazine described his songs as being 'of bleak beauty' and Americana U.K. hailed his work as 'A new Blues\u2019.\n\nSince then he has never looked back, going on to tour internationally four times to date, and releasing a second album \u2018City of Streets\u2019, independently and to great success. A maverick in the true sense of the word his live shows are the stuff of legends.

Playing guitar, bass, keyboard, and turntables, MING toured the world and gave international audiences an introduction to electronic music, opening up for acts like Sting, RUN-DMC, and Moby.\nOver the last decade, MING has pulled the studio more into focus, while still keeping a hand in the touring life. He remixed singles for a star-studded lineup including Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Ellie Goulding, and Black Eyed Peas. His original tracks climbed the charts, scoring four Top 40 trap remixes on Beatport. Collaborations on singles like \u201cDisintegration\u201d from Le Castle Vania for deadmau5\u2019s Mau5trap label and \u201cKing Kong\u201d for Steve Aoki\u2019s Dim Mak Records staked claim on dancefloors worldwide.

But as he proved on his South African Music Award-winning album \u201cHome Brewed\u201d, this DJ and producer defies convention. Sidestepping Afro-house clich\u00e9s and stage-managed highs in favour of restrained sophistication, Black Coffee's penchant is for true Afropolitan house: home-brewed but fresh and future-focused. Expect almost sculptural balance and beauty.\n\nIf one heard a clamour and ululating emanating from the eastern provinces of South Africa, KwaZulu Natal and the Eastern Cape, announcing the recognition of a cultural phenomenon.. and their role in the development of this cultural phenomenon.. one could not argue were that clamour and ululating to be in respect of one.. that is the soul, spirit, talent and vision of Nkosinathi Innocent Maphumulo, one better known as \u201cBlack Coffee\u201d.\n\nBlack Coffee was born in Durban in KwaZulu Natal and grew up in the Eastern Cape in Mthatha, before moving back to Durban to study music at Natal Tech where he majored in Jazz. His reason for studying music was because he felt that as a producer, he had to deepen his overall musical knowledge, develop his listening skills and advance his knowledge of music theory. Leaving tech prior to completion of his studies, Black Coffee with two friends Thandukwazi \u201cDemor\u201d Sikhosana and Mnqobi \u201cShota\u201d Mdabe worked as backup vocalists for the renowned Madala Kunene. Deciding then to form an urban soul trio \u201cShana\u201d the three moved to Johannesburg to make their way.\n\nKeeping \u201cSimply Hot And Naturally African\u201d (the meaning of \u201cShana\u201d) together as an ongoing project, the three also pursued their individual visions, collaborating on the way. Black Coffee was chosen as one of two South African participants in the Red Bull Music Academy in 2003 jump-starting him into the South African DJ scene - a decision he says he has never looked back on. His first big break was when his song \u201cHappiness\u201d was featured on the \u201cDJs At Work\u201d album.\n\n2005, the same year as the release of Black Coffee\u2019s powerful debut album \u201cBlack Coffee\u201d saw the birth and formation of Soulistic Music, Black Coffee\u2019s wholly owned 360\u00b0 corporate structure, his team\u2019s home base and the jump-off point for himself, and as time has evidenced for many others too. Black Coffee revealed that his first album was created using very basic music-making software. \u201cI don't know how to explain the production stages of my album because all I did was put down the basic ideas that I had, I didn't use any MIDI controllers everything was played with a computer mouse. He added that the use of live instruments in a song is also very important, giving a track that final magic touch and bringing it to life.\n\nA view through the Black Coffee \u2018lens\u2019, at the end of 2011, confirms a delightful, fresh and truly heart warming vista of dynamic and exciting creative production, glimpses of a genius unfolding and degree\u2019s of difficulty, challenge and hardship. To many Black Coffee has led the \u2018house music\u2019 way.. establishing since a global pre-eminence in vocal house music and a business approach structured to unlock the plethora of opportunities offered by a converged digital realm driven by the songs and their performance.\n\nReserved, studiously academic, inventive, imaginative, quiet, enigmatic, shy and bold are but of the few ways in which many across the world perceive Black Coffee. No matter how he is seen he remains one of the very few club DJs in the country who genuinely understands the precise function of a music disc jockey: he does not simply mix songs, he re-interprets their previously unimagined musical possibilities, adapting and arranging as each work advises and so quietly creating new works that give life. When he debuted his interpretation of Hugh Masekela\u2019s rambunctious jazz hit \u201cStimela\u201d (2005 original South African release, 2008 UK release), Black Coffee simply demonstrated how it was possible to rework the South African canon music vault into club music, creating works that were acceptable to both the young and the old, a feat not easily achievable. It has required a decidedly original-inclined, singular mind such as this to be able to pursue this kind of music trajectory and the gold and platinum awards since are testimony to his resolve .\n\n2007 brought another powerful Black Coffee release \u201cHave Another One\u201d which featured amongst others a host of great female vocalists and the likes of Bucie, Siphokhazi and Busi Mhlongo at the helm of an array of original works. With world demand and interest in a Black Coffee performance starting to stand up and shout so to speak, he began a new phase of growth in 2008 with a string of new Soulistic Music signed releases from Culoe de Song, Tumelo and the great Zakes Bantwini all achieving gold and platinum sales.\n\nIn 2009 Black Coffee dropped his third offering, titled \u2018\u2019Home Brewed\u2019\u2019, featuring Ringo Madlingozi, Zonke, Hugh Masekela, Zakes Bantwini and others, and at the South African Music Awards in 2010 he scooped two awards in the categories \u201cBest Urban Dance Album\u201d and \u201cBest Male Artist\u201d.\n\nHighlights during 2011 included a nomination for the 2011 MTV Europe Awards in the Africa, India and Middle East category for \u201cBest Worldwide Act\u201d, the launch of Africa Rising and its first presentation (which included a 24-piece orchestra along with a band and featured artists performing Black Coffee\u2019s works) at Moses Mabhida Stadium, four releases on the Soulistic Label including Culoe de Song\u2019s \u201cElevation\u201d, Sai & Ribatones \u201cHere and Now\u201d, Boddhi Satva\u2019s \u201cInvocation\u201d and the label\u2019s \u201cSoulistic Cuts\u201d and a Channel O Award for \u201cMost Talented Male Artist\u201d.\n\nIn 2012, Black Coffee\u2019s Africa Rising DVD and CD (triple CD) featuring artists such as Bucie and the soulful Toshi Tikolo on international house hit \"Buya\u201d, garnered double platinum sales status in the space of a single month and went on to win \u201cBest Dance Album\u201d at the 2013 South African Music Awards. All of this transpiring shortly after Soulistic Music announced the signing of Thembisa born rising star DJ Shimza to the imprint.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Soulistic Music under Black Coffee\u2019s leadership has built a worldwide network of exclusive track licenses, tours and agents giving Black Coffee and other Soulistic Music artists their break into the international touring market where they have become regular features in cities from Sydney to New York, London to Luanda and Los Angeles to Athens.\n\nBlack Coffee continued to grow his profile internationally during 2013, gracing the decks at Cape Town Electronic Music Festival, Southport Weekender, ADE and for Berlin\u2019s Panorama Bar, Iberian institution Circoloco and Boiler Room. He also forged a strong relationship with Bridges For Music by taking up the role of official spokesperson and ambassador for the music charity initiative.\n\nFast forward to present day and it\u2019s starkly evident that the past 24 months have been no less than a rollercoaster of career milestones, accolades and achievements for the Durban born musical mastermind. Attention grabbing performances for the likes of Ultra South Africa, FabricLive, BPM Festival, Ballantines\u2019 Boiler Room Stay True, Sonar Barcelona, Mixmag Live, SW4, an 8-date North American tour, RMBA debut tour of Japan, two consecutive seasons as a one of Circoloco\u2019s most talked about residents and a 2015 world tour this past summer which spanned 17 countries across 4 continents over 5 months has elevated Black Coffee into the realm of global superstar in waiting.\n\nIn addition to that, he also launched the Black Coffee Foundation Scholarship with SAE and Bridges For Music, scooped Breakthrough DJ and Dance Nation Of The Year for South Africa at the 2015 DJ Awards and unveiled his 5th artist album titled Pieces of Me to an African audience in September 2015. Both Pieces of Me and the debut album single We Dance Again featuring vocalist Nakhane Tour\u00e9 triumphantly laid claim to the #1 spot on iTunes and the album went on to reach double platinum status within 3 months of release.\n\nAs 2015 drew to a close, accolades continued to roll in unabated. Black Coffee became the first African DJ to be selected by BBC Radio 1 to deliver his 2-hour musical journey for the prestigious Essential Mix. Shortly thereafter, Red Bull revealed an official limited edition Black Coffee hero can and dedicated legacy website centred around celebrating the first decade of immense success achieved by SA\u2019s house music luminary. Black Coffee is the second only musical artist and first person of colour to be singled out and depicted on a Red Bull commemorative can.\n\nBlack Coffee continued his path of global domination at the 22nd annual SAMAs this past June by scooping Album of the Year, Best Dance Album and Best Engineered Album for Pieces of Me. And was also honoured with a prestigious International Achievement Award. Later that same month, Black Coffee made history by becoming the first South African to win a BET Award. He was recognized in the Best International Act: Africa category whilst attending the 3-day awards festivities in Los Angeles.\n\nNotwithstanding an already stellar year, Black Coffee surprised fans across the globe with a re-work of the Alicia Keys track In Common. Black Coffee\u2019s retake released by the award winning US songbird on July 1 as part of a 5-track remix package, has drawn unprecedented praise with many hailing it as the best version of the song. All the while, Black Coffee is still hard at work preparing the worldwide release of \u201cPieces of Me\u2019 through US record label Ultra Music later this year.\n\nFrom family, to community, to clan, to culture, to country, to the world; all are blessed with the prodigious talent and productivity of such a great creative genius, as is Black Coffee.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Charli XCX ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8363770.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Experimental, Other, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Wild Nothing ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8973666.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Alternative, Dream Pop, Shoegaze", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Captured Tracks / Big Nothing (JAP)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Snarky Puppy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10361270.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Jazz, World & Latin Jazz, Funk, Soul, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With every new project\u2014hell, with every show they play\u2014Snarky Puppy hopes to do something they\u2019ve never done before. With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Keita Ogawa (percussionist in Snarky Puppy) and Jamey Haddad discuss the rhythmic exercises they've been doing over many years to internalize the feel into your body so you can be able to play and feel the grove.\n\nEntry is a choose-your-own-donation basis between $1-100.

His passionate performances are punctuated by a crisp acoustic guitar and soaring tenor vocals. This is best shown in his 2018 EP \u201cBreathe,\u201d a four song project consisting only of acoustic guitar, bass and vocals. And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.\n\nKyle takes in the world, processes it and turns it into song with his own special touch. He has a unique take on things, a view of the world others may not necessarily notice. He continues to grow as an artist, sharing his story and messages of love and peace.\n\nAbove all, though, it\u2019s still about the music.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Caitlyn Smith ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8618987.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Roots Rock, Rock, Americana, Folk, Country", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "CAITLYN SMITH\n\nIn a time when everything is big, fast and bombastic, it's rare to find an artist who can hush a room with just the power of her voice or the will of her pen. Caitlyn Smith, one of Nashville's most prized writers, is one of them: and, after years spent composing songs for and with everyone from Dolly Parton to Garth Brooks to Meghan Trainor, she's finally ready to unveil all sides of her enormous talent with Starfire. Long lauded for her ability to whirl pure emotion into unforgettable tracks, Starfire is a raw, visceral journey about love, hardship and the struggle to pave your own way, all anchored by her unforgettable tone. A few minutes of listening and one thing becomes abundantly clear: there is no one better to sing the music of Caitlyn Smith than Smith herself.\n\n\"I wanted to unlock my heart and dig around inside a little,\" Smith says about the songs of Starfire, with the first five songs available now. \"And I wanted to be more vulnerable, and tell the stories I have lived. It's more of a raw process to write for myself.\"\n\nIndeed, songs like \"Before You Called Me Baby\" shake the listener to the core: blending her soulful vocals with stirring, deeply honest lyrics and instrumentation that only amplifies the organic construction, they occupy a unique space that can both blossom with a full band or be stripped down into intimate, solo experiences. Because Smith, who has toured and opened for acts such as Eric Church, Sheryl Crow and Dierks Bentley, understands not only how important the craft itself is, but also how music can \u2013 and should - transform in a live setting. With just her acoustic guitar, Smith can stun to silence.\n\nRaised in the small town of Cannon Falls, Minnesota, Smith grew up singing in the church and at county fairs \u2013 and it soon became abundantly clear that her talent stretched well beyond the ordinary. She wrote her first songs at the young age of eight, and had already convinced her parents that a career as an artist was her true path by the time she reached her teenage years. \"I released two records before I graduated high school,\" Smith recalls. \"I knew I needed to do music and nothing else.\" After a stint in Minneapolis, it was clear that Nashville was where she belonged, and she quickly became a sought-after force in the songwriting scene: so much so that even music she intended to sing herself quickly got snatched up by others, yielding her two top country hits, including the platinum \"Wasting All These Tears,\" recorded by Cassadee Pope.\n\nA celebrated force in the writer's room, Smith's also had her songs cut by Parton, Brooks and Lady Antebellum, and co-wrote Trainor's John Legend duet, \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You,\" among many others. For a while, Smith balanced her two worlds \u2013 as an artist, and a writer \u2013 while primarily focusing on the latter, working to perfect her craft and discover exactly what she wanted to say in her solo work. She released some music under her own name, but it didn't capture the spirit she ultimately wanted. \"I was shooting for something instead of singing music that was in my heart, that I loved,\" she says, as honest as ever. \"So I stepped back. I said to myself, 'the next thing that I release, I don't want to ask anybody's opinion. I want to go into the studio and make a record that I love and is true to me.'\"\n\nThat next thing became Starfire, produced by Paul Moak, who quickly became Smith's trusted collaborator. They would often bunker down at his Nashville studio, while Smith enlisted friends and colleagues for co-writes, like Gordie Sampson, Kate York and Sarah Buxton. But suddenly, some news came along: Smith was expecting a child. \"It added a beautiful layer of excitement,\" she says. \"Not only was I making a record, but I'm making a life. This little boy has been along for the ride.\"\n\nStarfire, itself, is all about growth, and what it takes to get to your most honest and true incarnation. Smith decided to trust her strengths: her soulful vocals, her strong sense of imaginative storytelling and her ability to craft melodies that exist outside of genre walls and instead focus on timelessness. But there are plenty of infectious hooks in there, too.\n\n\"We didn't want to think about genre or radio or any boundaries,\" she says. Like Chris Stapleton, Maren Morris or even Crow, she artfully blends a steady catalogue of influences and reference points, held together by stellar craft and her formidable voice. \"We wanted to make music that moved us, stay out of the way of the songs and let my voice shine through. Some songs sound more country, some sound more folk. There's a little rock and soul in there, too, which makes it a bit of a genre-less record. But it feels just right to me.\"\n\nGenreless, maybe, but full of vitality, and also downright honest. Take a song like \"This Town is Killing Me,\" about how life as an artist in Music City isn\u2019t all champagne and roses, even when there are small successes. \"It can be a such a hard, heartbreak town,\" Smith says. \"As much as you want to write those songs you know would pay the bills, if you did it every day, the artist part in you would die. There is this balance of loving this town because you get to create, but also it is just so brutal.\" Smith isn\u2019t the kind to smile and nod \u2013 instead, she turns her emotions into moments like this that manage to be about both her own experience and the human condition as a whole.\n\nAnd then there are songs like \"Tacoma,\" devastating in both its lyrics and its sheer beauty: \"I'm burning your memory one mile at a time\" Smith sings in her stunning vocal delivery to stripped-down production. Then, of course, there is the title track, which blends a pop groove with a soulful, chugging chorus. It's about how important it is to keep going even when the world wants to bring you down \u2013 an attitude that has ruled Smith's career thus far. Here, she proclaims her strength to a dynamite beat: it's one thing to have the talent to be a star, but it's another to have the will to keep your fire flaming bright.\n\n\"This whole record and process, I've been on a journey,\" she says. \u201cI've heard no many times and just kept going. I've learned that one thing is for certain: nothing is going to burn me out.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.instagram.com/caitlynsmith"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "King Charles ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10151616.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative, Folk", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Check out the Official Website for the latest news, tracks, and free exclusive content at http://www.KINGCHARLESMUSIC.com", "otherInfo": "Introducing The Takeover presented by Bose in support of Nordoff Robbins.

There will also be a special limited edition of the album available only on the benreel.com website, which will include 5 bonus tracks. Since his debut back in 1999, each album has gone from strength to strength, touching on different styles of music from rock,soul,blues, Alt Folk/Americana & with the occasional injection of reggae. This was highlighted on his 2012, 18 song best of album (Ben Reel 1999-2009 Compilation 10) released only as a limited edition for loyal fans to buy at gigs, also available on iTunes worldwide. Ben\u2019s music has evolved into an honest earthy sound that has matured like a fine wine and he has very much his own sound today. This can be heard on this new album. Darkness & The Light is a powerful soulful album with deep meaningful lyrics and memorable epic anthemic songs, with strong melodies combined with imaginitive expansive arrangements. Recorded digitally but with an analog feeling of warmth. The songs deal with the struggles of life of ordinary folk since the global economic crash. Also probing for spiritual meaning and balance between the Yin and the Yang, trying to find light, hope and healing in these troubled times. Serious songs from a serious artist in a serious moment in time.

Rainy Nights nails down the pang of loneliness that emigrants feel when they are far from home and someone says something that just triggers regret. The easy, soulful melody and performance underlines the impact, with Reel\u2019s singing striking just the right note. It is the high point of the album. Though Feel Alive , the title track and the gospel of Old Bog Road come close. The Armagh singer-songwriter comes across as a honest man determined to use his love of music to best effect, and he is lucky in having a band, particularly guitarist Mick McCarney, full of expression and no little skill. www.benreel.com Download tracks: Rainy Nights, Time to Get Real http://dvdfever.co.uk/reviews/erbenreel.shtml Elly Roberts reviews The Ben Reel Band: Time To Get Real Another little gem from the Emerald Isle. Rating: 8/10 Irishman Ben Reel has consistently released solid albums over the past 10 years. My last CD encounter was 2007\u2019s fabulous New Horizon. Now on his fifth album, Time To Get Real, keeps that tradition well and truly alive with a dazzling collection of Americana crossover songs that ought to have ears pricking at all the \u2018real music\u2019 stations. Reel has a penchant for ignoring fads and trends keeping the focus on real music which is why he\u2019s become a cult artist in his native Ireland, though sadly he hasn\u2019t been picked up as genuine singer-songwriter in the UK. Everybody in the business knows he\u2019s hot stuff having supported Jools Holland, Alabama 3, The Cranberries and stage star Michael Ball no less. The good news is he doing rather well in Holland, Belgium and Germany. As an introduction to the album he\u2019s released Feel Alive as a single. The down and dirty groove has some sublime guitar licks carried by a great melody and his rough edged vocals. ________________________________________ This box of delights opens with a gentle country shuffle in the form of Rainy Night as the band moves with confidence and swagger, again with Reel dropping in some superb guitar breaks and a fine line in vocal gymnastics including falsetto along with a Neil Young-like harmonica swish. The introduction of songbird Julieanne Reek on the deliciously tender love ballad Summers Always Here only adds to the romantic mood. With a troubled heart he gushes with lyrics like \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re like the warm summer sun that\u2019s rising / Feel your warm love in my heart / Melting away the cold ice of winter / The storms have passed / There\u2019s a new life on the way.\u201d Embracing an eclectic mindset, Keep On Drivin\u2019 takes on a C.C.Rider rockabilly hue drenched in honeyed vocals, stylish pedal steel, thumping basslines and wah wah, whereas Time Slips Away is deeply reflective, yearning for his childhood days and the onset of wisdom now he\u2019s turned 35. A heavy funky bass, rolling organ, and acoustic chords make Who You Are the albums catchiest song, with the main hook coming in the chorus. For Old And Wise Reel delves deep into a more traditional Irish template which brings forward his wishes not to die a typical rock\u2019n\u2019roll death \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t wanna overdose like a rockin-roll star /Or choke on my vomit after whiskey in the jar.\u201d By far the best song on the album, closes it \u2013 the stripped back dusty-bowl ballad Old Bog Road. Reverbed harmonica leads to gentle acoustic picks, chords slabs and wailing solos, on what is essentially a mournful ballad. The verdict \u2013 Quality album. http://www.billybop.be/admin/CDdetail.asp?ID=8717 Ben Reel : Time To Get Real \u2013 CD, BRBCDA-007;B Reel Records Album Kindly Submitted by G-Promotions Style : Americana Rate (1-5) : Ben Reel is the latest addition to a series of Americana artists emerging from Ireland! Against the backdrop of the troubles in Northern Ireland, Ben first picked up his guitar when he was 15 years old inspired by greats like Bruce Springsteen or Neil Young. Today this inspirations are still to be found in his passionate music! Leading track \u201cRainy Night\u201d is one of those tunes that you start to whistle along without ever having it heard before! Country and Americana are the main genres on this album but this doesn\u2019t mean the album is limited to it. On \u201cFeel Alive\u201d Ben comes with some enjoyable soul influences while \u201cKeep on drivin\u2019\u201d throws in a lot of country as does \u201cLooking for a Lost Horizon\u201d. \u201cOld & Wise\u201d throws in some old styles and mix folk influences into this Americana tune. On \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d the title track of this album, Ben Reel, returns to his old habits and creates a song that could be from the hand of \u201cThe Boss\u201d. Closing down the album is \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d that opens with a beautiful haunting blues harp. The haunting keeps going on, both with his voice and slide guitar! As an extra, hidden track we can hear a nice rockabilly kind of version (Live) of Keep on Drivin\u2019 in a mix with the classic \u201cTrain Train\u201d Time To Get Real is already the fifth album for Ben Reel and in the past two years he has successfully toured Holland, Belgium and Germany steady working on a growing fan base. Back you\u2019ll can find him as supporting act for bands like the Cranberries, Alabama 3 or Jools Holland. The album is a true Americana effort and comes with handful of interesting tunes that makes me feel that this artist need to be in the spotlight a little more. Mr Blue Boogie http://www.getreadytorock.com/reviews2009/ben_reel.htm BEN REEL Time To Get Real (2009) Play this new Ben Reel CD to any music aficionado, and ask them where it was recorded. Nine out of ten would say Nashville. Guaranteed. Now, Ben Reel may not be a household name (yet), but let's assume for a moment his work is unfamiliar to you. OK, what genre music would you say Time To Get Real was? No problem - southern, country blues rock. And name any influences you can hear at play? Again, no problem - Neil Young is an obvious one, but also Springsteen and perhaps Chris Isaak and even a little Clapton circa 361 Ocean Boulevard. So, nationality? No brainer - a man from the deep south of the US of A. Wrong on all accounts, because Time To Get Real is the 5th album in 10 years from Irish guitarist and singer songwriter Ben Reel. And naturally it was recorded in Monaghan in the north of the emerald isle. In reviewing Ben's last album New Horizon (2007) - which had an altogether more 'west coast' feel - we pondered on image, and what might make Ben stand out from the likes of Marc Cohn. It may be that with Time to Get Real, and diving deep into Americana, Ben has found his niche. Beautifully played and recorded it's bound to strike a chord with the market that's fuelling the resurgence of Neil Young, and Springsteen's exploration of the American psyche. But the challenge is still to get his music across the pond. It's not easy to crack America - many have tried and failed, but the rootsy warmth of the songs, the soulful singing and classy playing (some wonderful blues guitar and harmonica work) would undoubtedly be lapped up with a little exposure. So remember the name - Ben Reel - a real class act. *** Review by Pete Whalley http://www.lonesomehighway.com/pdf/online-issue-7.pdf Ben Reel Time To Get Real B. Reel Northern Ireland native Ben Reel has delivered a roots album that is full of strong songs and good playing. There\u2019s some solid keyboard playing, a rhythm section that drives things along and some very tasty guitar from Mick McCarney. Reel\u2019s voice is accompanied by welcome backing vocals that help to portray the mood of the songs. Rainy Night sets the tone for time and place, a song that looks at what has been missed by moving away from your home town. Other topics are ageing, freedom, the nature of searching and of truth. Mature songs for a mature audience that\u2019s given a melodic and malleable musical base that could just as easily have come from the States as from Northern Ireland. Reel no doubt has taken from those who have also come from the North, such as the undeniable influence of Van Morrison as a beacon of musical innovation. Reel does not have Morrison\u2019s track record, but this is an album that shows all the signs of a true talent making his own way. It\u2019s time to get serious is the signal Ben Reel gives with the release of his latest cd \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d. Wasn\u2019t he before? Haven\u2019t got a clue because for me Ben Reel is a complete stranger. He is (northern) Irish and has been working at his craft for quite some time. \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d sure is a good way to get to know him and the cd is full of piercing impulses. Delicate songs, strongly carried by the accompanying musicians, but by no tarnishing ben\u2019s Vocals. (His vocals show comparisons to Rod MacDonald and John Stewart). I hope that I grow old and wise suggests that Ben has come to an age where he starts realising his own mortality, what undoubtedly determines the profundity you find again in his lyrics. With what I don\u2019t want to affect his compositions. As I said before, I only know Reels past from what I read in his biography, But \u201cTime to get Reel\u201d indeed looks like the start of a new development, a new awakening. No trace of a personal crisis. My guts tell me Ben Reel has defined he wants to make a good product. One he will be remembered by. The closing song \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d tells of a permanent goodbye Ben Reel manages to create a excellent variation of styles, and within a limited nr of spins I still a real positive feeling about Ben Reel. Serious, skilful. driven \u2026. (after the official songs there is a hidden track, a live song, where you hear the presence of a modern day Elvis. Not renewed, but very entertaining. www.rootstime.be /Rein van den Berg Oct 09 The Irish hearts are often rather melancholic. Maybe the beautiful sceneries see to a tendensy of warmth and retirement. It characterizes at any rate the dark songs of Ben Reel, which the cover of the newest album, time to get real, suggest. Eleven songs written by reel himself and richly arranged with violin, piano, appropriate guitar lines and a choice of extra additioned instruments. With this the Irish know how to display a large scale of spheres and feelings, carying names as Neil Young and sometimes Bob Dylan. Indeed in rags, because Ben Reel is a slippery costumer. Ben\u2019s first album, \u201cthis is the movie\u201d, came out in Ireland in 1999, after this the EP \u00ebxorcise me\u201d(2000) only with 3 tracks, which seemed to be forerunner for his second album \u201cLost in Haze\u201d (2001). After that came Sweet Victory (2004), U People (2006) and New Horizon (2007). We don\u2019t have to complain about man\u2019s releases and qualities: guitarplayer Ben Reel, born in silverbridge but now living in Castlebalyney, is a supreme storyteller; has a pleasant voice, writes, beside that, upperclass songs and has also the quality to gather very able musicians around him. At his new album Ben Reel is accompanied again by a fine equilibiated band: Ronnie, Michael. Mickey, John, Colin. And now we are calling names: the recordings were done in the Attic studios with producer Ronan who also has a vocal contribution in the last two songs. In the quite openers Rainy Summers etc. we hear Reel\u2019s wife Julieanne who takes the change of the singing second. Anyway, in their natural but yet larger soundscape is more than enough space for improvisation and variety, which we can hear clearly on their new album. What Ben has settled with this successor is impressing. In 11 songs the band knows to create an oppressing atmosphere, which gets enlightened only now and then. Rasping and grating, then again with deceptive lovely acoustic guitars, then with thin guitarsounds and spacious violin, the listener is taking to a voyage through the Deep South of the mind, which only can turn out bad. It is oppressing, dark, stirring and especially very beautiful. Roots, pop and folk are going hand in hand with now and then an experimental strain. The point is that Ben Reel makes magnificent music. Music that mixes influences from alt-country with the atmospheric and darkness the music from Ireland so often charcterizes. Music that attracts attention by the variety and the highstanding music, because they really can play. Ben Reel searches, with his new album, joining with the greatness of the alt-country, but takes here at the same time surrender. Time to get real is just a good patterncard of the ability of the Ben Reel Band. Everything sounds beautiful, clear and especially respectable. The sharp ends are removed expertly and almost everything is produced in a way that it has to be specially accessed for the singersongwriter radiosize.

There's lots to inspire and Ben Reel has absorbed those influences and let them inform his particular style of travelling blues. \"Time To Get Real\" isn't a classic troubadour album, but it is deep hearted blues packed with characters, places and just a wee bit of drinking. The songs are strong through out, all could standalone without being thought of as filler. Time to step up from being a solid support to being the headliner. BELGUIM http://www.ctrlaltcountry.be/Pagina1.htm#BenReel BEN REEL \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d (Ben Reel) (3,5****) Ireland has long been enjoying a good reputation, where the singer-songwriters are concerned. And with Ben Reel has another one to be proud of. With \"Time To Get Real\" the man has just delivered his fifth album in ten years time, and that is a very beautiful album. Reel is gifted with a warm, a little soulful vocal style, shows himself a truly excellent song smith and professional manner together in genres like rock, pop, folk, Americana and blues into his songs. He calls himself Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young as inspiration, but there really is not much sign of that. Reel sounds like a particularly original. Someone with a vision of his own writing and placing songs. Someone with an own sound. And it would absolutely not surprise us if he behave the songs on \"Time To Get Real\" soon break on larger scale. He fully deserves it already! Songs like it a little reminiscent of Neil Young \"Rainy Night\", the beautifully subdued piano and harmonica work on-going rootspopdeuntje \"Summer's Always Here\", the soulful rockin 'Feel Alive', the bluesy bounce \"Keep On Drivin '\", the summer, somewhere between pop, folk and country resident \"Old & Wise\" is simply magnificent. (Ben Reel is doing these days also Netherlands and Belgium for some gigs. On November 13 he is as such in McCormack's Irish Pub in Turnhout. And De Sport in Geel On Monday 9th http://www.ilpopolodelblues.com/rev/novembre09/recensione/ben-reel.html Ben Reel is part of the wide array of successful songwriters born and raised in Ireland.

(SWA) REAL ROOTS CAF\u00c9 Netherlands Dutch to English translation Very recently came from Time to get real, the fifth full-time CD of Irish singer-songwriter Ben Reel. For me a great unknown, but already 20 years active in music since he was a teenager in 1989 founded his first band, \"Trim the Velvet '. After the breakup of this band eight years later, Ben's solo tour in 1999 and came from his solo CD's available. With five number one so he just scored an average of two years each. Ben's music is best described as Irish mid-tempo alt-country, the songs are nice sound and treat a number of pressing issues for Ben. He describes one part of his life and Rainy Night Time just slips away, do proclaim his feelings, especially love, respect, in four songs and shares his thoughts with us and future expectations in another four songs. He concludes (No. 11 is) a kind of summary of this in Old Bog Road: Seasons change as people come and go, life and death is the endless flow. Want to find the answers, because the story to be told, is not gonna quit the mining for gold. Want to find a reason before I go. Before they take my body, down that old bog road. Heavy thoughts for a guy who has several years of the 40 removed. But we are not all looking for the deeper meaning of life? Incidentally, after more than six minutes of the final number is still nearly six minutes a lasting valve closure, which Ben totally in style and tempo rocking (leading to a sodden organ) announces yet another time by a wish to: (I 'll) keep on driving, a live concert recording and a perfect valve. Always funny, some unexpected hidden track. Ben's band was great response and are in addition to Ben's acoustic guitar (and occasional harmonica) bass, drums and electric guitar. A few songs do keyboards and violin along. Ben has a somewhat gritty but pleasant voice. His wife Julianne sings along to eight songs, four songs is half Bloch (e, you never know with those Irish first names) to hear. I think it's a good CD, especially through the expressiveness of the songs both lyrically and in terms of melody (Fred Schmale) Put simply and aptly, New Horizon is all killer, no filler! Rarely have I heard an album so complete and so fully realised. From the brilliance of the playing and arranging to the magnificence of Reel's voice, this is heaven all the way. A superb album by an artist good enough to hold his own in rock\u2019s premiere league. Andrew Hobbs, Hi Fi + magazine When it comes to making classy albums, Ben Reel's your man. Year on year, Reel's songwriting is growing in stature in every department, yet he still doesn't get the wide spread recognition he richly deserves it's one of the strongest albums this year. This CD isn't just music: it's art. AllGigs.co.uk review of New Horizon, 8th October 2007 Ben Reel, a native of South Armagh, has in the words of one journalist \u2018operated under the media\u2019s radar for far too long\u2019. On the evidence of this release, his fourth album, I would have to agree. The songs and the playing are really impressive, an earthy mix of rock, roots and blues, all mixed lovingly together with soulful vocals. His song writing shows maturity and progression which comes through with repeated plays. Featuring some great slide guitar from Micky McCarney and terrific vocals from Kelie Redmond, \u201cHell In Ur Own Head\u201d is a standout, closely followed by the semi spoken \u201cWhen Will Be Ever Be Free\u201d. \u201cFor U And I\u201d shows the band at their best with a lovely rock/soul groove that you wish would go on longer. All in all this is an impressive album from a major talent who needs further investigation.

Later he wrote the inspirational songs, \u201cGot a Song in My Heart\u201d, \u201cWind of the Spirit\u201d, \u201cDancing in a Field\u201d and many others for a year round \u201ccamp in the city\u201d program called Rise Up, this was his initiation as a recording artist.\n\nFrom there he stuffed his young family into a motorhome and, armed with a slew of new material, toured across Canada for 5 years with the group Upstream. They hauled a 350 seat theatre from town to town and set up in mall parking lots hosting community celebrations. (chronicled in the book \u201cOff The Map\u201d) He recorded 4 CDs with Upstream.\n\nIt was these experiences that forged the Russ Rosen Band sound. Roots rock with a celtic Gospel twist. Percussive guitars and fierce drums anchoring the energetic folk songs. Their 2002 release \u201cOil\u201d (Produced by Alan Shacklock - Roger Daltrey, The Alarm, Meatloaf, Jeff Beck, Mike Oldfield) and the French version \u201cHuile de paix\u201d have received high praise from listeners and critics who say it sounds like a crazy blend of The Chieftans, Dave Mathews Band and The Who.\n\nIn 2010 Russ released a compilation disc, \u201cAudio Memories, 20 years of soul tracking\u201d a collection of songs from his twenty some years of traveling and recording. This extremely diverse anthology is packed with gospel, folk, blues, and inspirational campfire songs with unique stories as part of his journey.\n\nIn 2012, with songs that were tried and tested over several years the Russ Rosen Band released \"Waiting For Abraham\", produced by Brett Ziegler. Folk to funk to dance with nods to celtic roots. The collection of songs reflect the joys and pains of Canada\u2019s history and potential future. They have performed with Graham Ord, Marcus Mosely, Greg Sczebel, Brian Houston, Jacob Moon, Norm Strauss and many others at events across the country.\n\nOn the heels of Abe, Russ released \"Songs From Christmas Tales\" which is as the title suggests, the music from the super successful and well travelled show, Christmas Tales. Russ partners with master storyteller, Justyn Rees, multi- instrumentalist Brett Ziegler and others to deliver the traditional songs and stories like you've never heard before. Since 2013 Christmas Tales has been selling out dozens of shows each year as it makes the rounds of western Canadian towns with plans to continue this annual tradition.\n\nRuss is now the artistic director at Bez Arts Hub in Langley, BC where he and his wife train and mentor emerging artists, host live music events, dance shows, workshops and all manner of arts and community interactions.", "otherInfo": "The delightful Shari Ulrich joins Russ and Sandy Rosen with music and conversation on the Bez Livestream.\nWatch live at 2:00PM Friday afternoon on the Bez Arts Hub Facebook page or YouTube channel.\nJoin the fun with live comments and interaction.\nThe video will remain available on FB and YT after the live broadcast.\n\nShari Ulrich is an award winning singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist (violin, mandolin, piano, guitar, dulcimer) who has been winning hearts with her music for over four decades.

prolific Brill building pop Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and \u2013 fingers crossed - Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music - and give them an experience that they will never forget.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Every Friday I will transport my viewers into the past where they will feel as thought they are sitting behind the recording console at Motown's Hitsville recording studio.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s positive or optimistic or whatever, but that's what's going on with me.\u201d\n\nBrendan Benson finds himself in an enviable spot as he enters the third decade of a remarkably creative, consistently idiosyncratic career \u2013 an accomplished frontman, musician, songwriter, producer, band member, husband, and dad. Benson\u2019s seventh solo album, and first new LP in almost seven years, DEAR LIFE is this consummate polymath\u2019s most inventive and upbeat work thus far, an 11-track song cycle about life, love, family, fatherhood, and the pure joy of making music. Produced and almost entirely performed by Benson at his own Readymade Studio in Nashville, the album sees the Michigan-born, Nashville-based artist \u2013 and co-founder, with Jack White, of The Raconteurs \u2013 reveling in a more modernist approach than ever before, fueled by a heady brew of cannabis, hip-hop, and a newly discovered interest in software drum programming. The result is an untapped playfulness that elevates expertly crafted songs like the opener, \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d and the first single, \u201cGood To Be Alive,\u201d with voluble arrangements, elastic grooves, and incandescent power. Imbued with revitalized ambition and confidence, DEAR LIFE is Brendan Benson at his very best.\n\nBeginning with his now-classic 1996 major label debut, ONE MISSISSIPPI \u2013 recently reissued by Third Man in its first-ever vinyl pressing \u2013 and its masterful 2002 follow-up, LAPALCO, Benson has always infused classic craftsmanship with contemporary invention. Along with his own critically acclaimed canon, Benson is of course co-founder \u2013 with Jack White, Jack Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler \u2013 of The Raconteurs. The band first convened in 2006, winning worldwide acclaim, GRAMMY\u00ae Award nominations, and a chart-topping smash single in \u201cSteady As She Goes,\u201d with their now-classic debut album, BROKEN BOY SOLDIERS. The Raconteurs returned two short years later with 2008\u2019s CONSOLERS OF THE LONELY. Like its predecessor, the LP proved a popular and critical phenomenon, earning the GRAMMY\u00ae Award for \u201cBest Engineered Non-Classical Album\u201d as well as a nomination as \u201cBest Rock Album.\u201d\n\nDEAR LIFE came about gradually and organically after a self-imposed creative hiatus rooted in the happy arrival of his son and later, a daughter. Having spent the majority of his adult life on the road, Benson decided he\u2019d prefer to stay home for a change and just be a dad.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so enamored with my kids, I just sort of lost touch with my career. I just didn\u2019t want to go back to work.\u201d\n\nInstead, Benson directed his musical energies elsewhere and fast proved an in-demand producer/engineer (Robyn Hitchcock, Young The Giant, Trapper Schoepp, The Greenhornes) and collaborative songwriter, with a CV that includes partnerships with Jake Bugg, Iain Archer (Snow Patrol), and The Kooks\u2019 Luke Pritchard, among others. Despite his successes, after a few years in this voluntary wilderness, Benson surprised himself in 2017 by writing and recording the rocker \u201cHalf A Boy (And Half A Man).\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just felt really good,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like I was like born again. Seriously, it was almost a religious experience, like, oh my God, I love making music. I had forgotten. That\u2019s how it started. It was kind of a spark. A re-ignition.\u201d\n\nThough Benson wasn\u2019t \u201cconsciously making a record,\u201d the songs kept coming. Rather than overthink every move, he simply let go. He got stoned in his studio and worked on music simply because it made him happy.\n\n\u201cI started dreaming again,\u201d Benson says. \u201cGetting lost in the music and just letting it take me. Not being so serious, not thinking I was some sort of great writer or producer. I just enjoyed myself. I wasn\u2019t racking my brain on how to from one chord to the next. I wasn\u2019t trying to come up with the best lyrics ever. I was just having fun.\u201d\n\nBenson worked with surprising intensity, most days skipping meals until long after dark. Determined to keep moving forward, he opted to play virtually every instrument on his own. Though a skilled drummer in his own right, Benson began working with Pro Tools and an array of other drum programming software.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a self-taught only child,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go elsewhere for things. If I want drums, I think, OK, how do I create drums? Well, I\u2019ve got to play them or I\u2019ve got to program them. It\u2019s all happening really quickly. I don\u2019t have time to wait for some guy to come over and learn the song, all that crap.\u201d\n\nWorking with programming helped free Benson from his previous creative habits, opening up uncharted paths and new approaches towards making his music.\n\n\u201cI may never go back to playing the drums,\u201d Benson says. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true, but it is a lot of fun. It\u2019s a different discipline entirely. On the drum kit, you feel it out, see what feels good or whatever. But with software drums, you\u2019re constructing beats with your hands, with a mouse, and with a keyboard. It\u2019s really weird. So of course you do things that you wouldn\u2019t do on a drum kit. It\u2019s like, wow, I never would have played that beat. And then the options are limitless. Everything is right at your fingertips.\u201d\n\nUnrestrained by anything other than his own imagination, Benson drew less from genre and more from his own instincts, melding jangle and crunch, hook and riff, pomp and subtlety, into something original and his own. Sonic motivation came from a range of unexpected sources, spanning hip-hop icons like Vince Staples and Kendrick Lamar to the top 40 hits his kids played around the house.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always kind of battling cynicism,\u201d he adds, \u201cbeing a cynic about music. So listening to what my kids listen to, it helps me break down the barriers in myself. The kids put on Justin Bieber and my knee jerk reaction is to turn it off. But I don\u2019t. I\u2019m forced to listen in and by God, I start liking it. I find something good in it and then that maybe pops up in my music.\u201d\n\nWith the aesthetic doors blown open, Benson saw his songs grow more complex, multi-tiered, and rhapsodic. From the future funk-fueled \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d through \u201cGood To Be Alive\u201d and the madcap \u201cFreak Out,\u201d to the elegiac finale, \u201cWho\u2019s Gonna Love You,\u201d his long vaunted knack for pure pop craftsmanship is paired with a progressive, left-of-center dynamism unlike anything in his body of work.\n\nWhile tracks like \u201cDear Life\u201d and the ecstatic \u201cRichest Man Alive\u201d are undeniably animated and even joyful, Benson is quick to note that there\u2019s more going on than necessarily meets the ear. The buoyant melodies and irrepressible hooks are tinted with self-doubt and instinctive irony, their affirmative messages colored by encroaching middle age and the songwriter\u2019s own mortality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just singing about me,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI\u2019m almost 50 and it\u2019s freaking me out so that\u2019s kind of coming up in the songs.\u201d\n\nAfter almost two years, DEAR LIFE was finally approaching completion. Benson signed on with new management and began talking with labels, ready at last to return to the fray.

And I get to share it all with a bunch of guys that I love and respect.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a decade, The Raconteurs finally returned to action in 2019 with their critically acclaimed, chart-topping third LP, HELP US STRANGER, highlighted in part by a couple of songs Benson had been kicking around for his own LP, \u201cOnly Child\u201d and \u201cSomedays (I Don\u2019t Feel Like Trying).\u201d The Raconteurs\u2019 epic 2019 world tour proved equally successful, playing to ecstatic sold-out houses from Nashville to New Zealand and all points in-between. Still buzzing with big rock energy, Benson returned home and recorded two more for DEAR LIFE: the short, sharp \u201cI\u2019m In Love\u201d and the persistent slacker anthem, \u201cI Quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Raconteurs helped me get off my ass and get back into the swing of things,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI got to exercise that muscle again. I came home really excited just to get back to my thing. Whereas before, I think I was a little overwhelmed. It\u2019s daunting to make a record and get a band together and tour an album. But now I\u2019m really ready. It\u2019s not so daunting.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Benson is currently considering how to bring DEAR LIFE to life. Having made a record he can take unabashed pride in, he is determined to continue defying expectations and resisting easy pigeonholes. DEAR LIFE marks a milestone on what has already been an atypical artistic journey as well as a bold signpost towards future triumphs, a showcase for Benson\u2019s matchless gifts for wry introspection, insightful wordplay, and powerhouse melody, once again affirming his place among the finest singer-songwriters of this or any era.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dixie Jade ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8996625.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Country, Pop, Rock", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With their own brand of Country Pop Rock, Dixie Jade blend their love for classic country and vintage soul with in-your-face pop radio production.

R. Castillo. While a lot of artists can say the same, the influence of music on Castillo\u2019s life began years before he was born. When Castillo\u2019s father was a boy, he idolized his brother who was nine years older and in the Navy. Castillo\u2019s uncle would come home on leave from the Navy and play guitar on the front porch, and Castillo\u2019s father aspired to play just like his older brother. Tragically, his uncle lost his life serving in the Navy and his father\u2014now the oldest son and responsible for his family\u2014never learned to play like he wanted. \u201cAs he got older [my father] said, \u2018If I ever have a son, I want to put a guitar in his hands and make sure he learns to play,\u2019\u201d Castillo says, and to honor the brother he lost, Castillo\u2019s father put a guitar into his son\u2019s hands at a very early age. His mother also loved music. She encouraged him to sing and find harmonies as she introduced him to all kinds of music, and both his father and mother\u2014a \u201ccloset poet\u201d and \u201cgrammar queen,\u201d respectively\u2014encouraged their son to write. It was no surprise then when their son was fronting bands and performing his own music by the time he was 13. With the bands he was in during middle and high school, Castillo would work his own original music into sets of well-known covers at parties and festivals, and the reaction was always very positive. \u201cIt always seemed that every time I\u2019d announce, \u2018Here\u2019s a song that I wrote,\u2019 it immediately drew people in, which caught my attention,\u201d Castillo recalls. \u201cI saw that people all the sudden weren\u2019t just out there dancing and having a good time, their attention was on the song that I\u2019d written. The reaction of those first few folks\u2014they don\u2019t realize it, the influence they had\u2014as they were out there listening and giving me those words of encouragement after they heard the songs, it really encouraged me to continue with the song writing. It really set me on the path that I\u2019m on today.\u201d Despite his early success, he didn\u2019t immediately run off to Nashville to pursue a record deal; his family assumed that first he would get a college education, though they encouraged him to continue with his music while doing so. However, avoiding the temptation to quit college wasn\u2019t easy when record labels started showing interest during his sophomore year. \u201cIt kind of scared my folks a little bit, because they thought that I was just going to stop everything and pack my bags and move to Nashville. It just seemed like the right thing at that point in time.\u201d It was the advice of friend Casey Monahan at the Texas Music Office that persuaded him he could do both, a decision he\u2019s happy with in retrospect: \u201cI often look back at that moment and I know that it didn\u2019t have a huge an impact. If I had moved over there, it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. I was still able to do everything they wanted us to do, but at the same time we were still able to take care of things at home and I was able to continue my education.\u201d Over the last 15 years\u2014through his formative years, his time at the University of Texas, and up to the present day\u2014Castillo has written over a thousand songs for himself and other artists, 25 percent of which are in Spanish. His songwriting strays from that of many other artists, as his music is often more specific and personal than other artists\u2019 music. \u201cA lot of the stuff is based on life experiences and stuff that I\u2019ve gone through, personal stories,\u201d Castillo says of his songwriting. \u201cI try to take actual stories and actual experiences and lay them out in that three and a half minute length of a song.\u201d For Castillo, the joy of songwriting isn\u2019t in mass appeal, but connecting on a deeper, more-personal level with his listeners. \u201cI want to write about real things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about writing the basic love songs where everybody can relate. I want to write about stuff that people out there listening can actually hold on to and say, \u201cThat\u2019s my song. That guy wrote that song about my life and what I\u2019m going through.\u201d His latest single, \u201cThe Flip Side of Sober,\u201d was released on July 4, and is apart of a full CD release entitled The Hombre that Castillo expects to be released in late September. Other songs on the 16-track album include the classic Leo Sayer hit, \u201cMore Than I Can Say\u201d (one of his mother\u2019s favorites), and unofficial Texas High School football anthem, \u201cAny Given Friday.\u201d \u201cSome of my fellow artists and writers are like, \u2018Man you\u2019re nuts. You\u2019re the only one who would serve up that many songs in one project,\u2019\u201d Castillo remarks. \u201cBut hey, it\u2019s music. I\u2019m cranking it out. I feel blessed to be able to write as much as I do. It gives me an opportunity to share some of myself with the fans.\u201d By Andrew Miller, Nashville Music Guide", "otherInfo": "J.R.

The younger brother of Cajun fiddler Michael Doucet, Doucet has used his distinctive hybrid of folk-style fingerpicking and bluegrass-like flatpicking to strengthen the performances of Beausoleil, the band he's shared with his brother for over 21 years. With the release of his debut solo album, Quand J'ai Parti in 1991, Doucet successfully stepped into the spotlight.\nDoucet first played the guitar after recuperating from a broken arm sustained while practicing with his high school football team. Although he initially taught himself to play by using Bob Dylan and Paul Simon songbooks, Doucet became fascinated with flatpicking after listening to an album by Doc Watson.\n\nTogether with his brother and banjo player Raoul Breaux, Doucet played Cajun music in Louisiana clubs in 1975. When the project proved commercially unsuccessful, the band broke up with Doucet enrolling in college and his brother going on to form the Cajun rock band Coteau and the original lineup of Beausoleil. A turning point in Doucet's evolution as a guitarist came when he heard the playing of the late Clarence White on an album, The Kentucky Colonels 1965-1967, in 1980. Inspired by White's use of unusual chords and imaginative melodies, Doucet began to develop his own unique style.\n\nAlthough Doucet did not play on Beausoleil's first recording session in Paris, he joined the group before the recording of their debut album, The Spirit of Cajun Music, in 1976.\n\nGrand Texas Doucet moved to New Orleans, where he continues to reside, in 1980 to work at the World's Fair. In addition to his solo album and recordings with Beausoleil, Doucet was featured on albums by Chuck Guillory (Grand Texas), Octa Clark & Hector Duhon (Ensemble Encore) and Michael Doucet (Dit BeauSoleil).\nDoucet was accompanied on Quand J'ai Parti by members of Beausoleil (Michael Doucet, Jimmy Breaux, Tommy Comeaux, Billy Ware and Tommy Alesi) and influential dobro player Josh Graves, whom he met during a \"Legends of Folk Violin\" tour.\n\n\nMore to come", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Erin Bowman ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9125714.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "London, United Kingdom", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Growing up with 2 parents who grew up in the 60\u2019s, Erin Bowman has been listening to and loving amazing music her entire life. Whether it was \u201cLet it Be\u201d by The Beatles, \u201cBorn to Run\u201d by Bruce Springsteen (a fellow New Jersey native), or \u201cIt\u2019s My Party\u201d by Leslie Gore she was into it. A 90\u2019s baby herself, Bowman\u2019s knowledge and love for music spans decades. Inspired by pop acts and bands of the 90\u2019s in particular she knew she wanted to pursue music at an early age. After graduating high school, not having a clue how to pursue a career in music, she started going into New York City looking to meet with producers and songwriters who might want to work with her. After several failed auditions, several unreturned phone calls, and a little bit of heartbreak she met a producer who saw something in her. Bowman, only a singer at the time began recording songs written by the producer. Suggesting she start writing herself, with the melody and concept already started Bowman alongside her producer finished writing what would be her first single \u201cProblem.\u201d \u201cProblem\u201d was added to Sirius XM 20 on 20 and in 2 weeks was a top 5 requested song. Her next single \u201cKing Boy\u201d trumped her first becoming the 5th most played song of the year on Sirius XM 20 on 20 while also selling over 20,000 copies, a major feat for an independent artist.\n\nWith the success of her first 2 releases Bowman found herself writing with more and more producers/songwriters. She had been working on new music with a writer at Warner Chappell Publishing when the synch team there received a request for a song about staying warm. Alongside the producer Bowman wrote \u201cKeep Me Warm,\u201d a release that would play in a national McDonald\u2019s ad campaign for over a month, as well as receive airplay on 3 different radio formats: Top 40, Hot AC, and AC.\n\nContinuing to work alongside different writers/producers she caught the attention of Kobalt Music. A publishing company who\u2019s rosters includes the likes of Max Martin, Mumford and Sons, Simon and Garfunkel, Lionel Richie, Dixie Chicks, Beck, and countless other successful artists and songwriters. Eventually signed to a Kobalt publishing deal herself Bowman released \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d through AWAL, Kobalt\u2019s global artist services company. \u201cGood Time Good Life\u201d debuted on NBC\u2019s This Is Us, ran in a national Target ad, a national Beaches Resort ad, and was chosen by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to drive The Oscar\u2019s 2017 promo aired on ABC for over 2 months. The Oscar promo lead to Bowman\u2019s national TV debut on Good Morning America where she performed \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d followed up with a performance at the Radio Disney Music Awards, and Live with Kelly and Ryan.\n\nWith the success of \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d and a move out west (a NJ native now in Los Angeles) Bowman found herself working on music going in a slightly different direction. She was doing less co-writes and found herself writing everyday on her own. Songs started pouring out of her. Her life was changing and the music she was writing was some of the realest she had ever written. In March of 2018 Bowman found herself traveling to London to explore a new city and work on new music. A NJ native, now based in Los Angeles, traveling to London. It was on a whim that she decided to attend an open mic night where she\u2019d perform a couple of her new songs for the first time. It was at that open mic night that she would meet the 2 cowriters/producers that would bring this new direction of music, this new project, to life. Bowman traveled back to London for over a month in the summer and in the fall to work on what will be her first ever EP.

Her youth belies her musical influences, which include 80s New Wave and 90\u2019s Britpop \u2013 music that came out mostly before she was even born.\nMoving to New York City upped the stakes for Chaidez. She busks in Union Square and lives in Brooklyn, testing her material on a tough crowd \u2013 New Yorkers in the downtown mecca for protest. Getting people to focus on what she was singing there was the best endorsement possible for her anthemic songs.\nThere are two levels in which you can appreciate Chaidez\u2019 music. The music is sublime, but the lyrics are where her intentions are truly revealed. \"I used to be afraid of expressing myself directly through the band's lyrical content. But I've been through a lot over the past couple of years, and you're gonna hear about it in this new record.\u201d\nJoining forces with young, talented musicians she has assembled for her band, Chaidez is extremely enthusiastic about going on tour.

In the fall of \u201999 she moved to Salzgitter, Germany where she collaborated on a commercial pop project, marking her first experience singing in a professional studio. In May 2000 she returned to Austin to explore performing and song writing. Following her role as supporting vocalist and dancer for the Austin high-energy rock band Young Heart Attack in 2001, Martin launched her solo career in 2002 with an opening slot for Wilco and her debut album Pretty Things. Shortly after the album\u2019s release, she moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia and had her first commercial success when two of her songs were placed in the award-winning British-Canadian two-part drama Sex Traffic (2004) and in the TV drama series Snakes and Ladders (2004).\n\nWith her second album, Two Hearts (2008), Martin gained considerable attention as a hot up-and-coming artist with several East Coast Music Awards and Nominations. Her Two Hearts music video rose to #5 on the Much More Music Countdown, leading to tours across Canada, the US and Ireland. She performed high-profile shows with Canadian rock icon Matt Mays and sang on Parliament Hill in Ottawa for The Queen of England. You Come Home was placed in the internationally distributed teen drama series The Best Years (2010). Two Hearts won Martin two 2008 Music Nova Scotia Awards, and a 2009 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\nHer third album I Can Too (2010) received rave reviews and includes a collaboration with Blue Rodeo\u2019s Greg Keelor on her rendering of Andrew Sisk\u2019s Subject To Change. \u201cWhat sets I Can Too apart is Martin\u2019s commitment to honestly exploring complicated relationships.\u201d (Exclaim Magazine, October 2010). Following multiple East Coast Music Award Nominations and extensive touring across Canada with Juno nominated indie rock band Cuff The Duke, Martin began touring independently in Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nIn 2011 Martin worked on building her label Come Undone Records, and focused on developing a global online presence with fans via community-based projects. She worked with PledgeMusic.com to release A House Concert (2011) containing fourteen live acoustic versions of songs from her first three studio albums. Martin was nominated at the 2011 Music Nova Scotia Awards for Digital Artist of the Year and A House Concert was nominated at the 2012 East Coast Music Awards for Folk Recording of the Year. This project also raised awareness and funds for the Canadian Mental Health Association. During 2011-2012 Christina continued her community development initiatives with a yearlong Artist in Residency through Geriatric Medicine Research (GMR) at Dalhousie University and The Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 2014 she released an EP titled Remember Me, featuring five songs inspired by and dedicated to individuals affected by dementia. Co-produced and written by Dale Murray, the EP won the 2014 Music Nova Scotia Award for Inspirational Recording of the Year.\n\nSleeping With A Stranger (2012), Martin\u02bcs fifth award-winning album, reflects the artist\u2019s coming of age lyrically and musically. \u201cIt\u02bcs one of those rare albums where you have to listen to it all in one sitting. Like a good book that\u2019s hard to put down, Sleeping With A Stranger tickles the ears and within three bars you\u2019re completely hooked.\u201d (Americana UK, October 2012). The album won her the 2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Recording of the Year Award. It was nominated for three East Coast Music Awards Come Undone Records was nominated for Music Nova Scotia Company of the Year. What I Always Knew was placed in the CBC television drama Heartland and her single Falling For You remained on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 countdown for five months.\n\nMartin returned home from Europe in the spring of 2014, following eighty concert dates which included a performance at Rolling Stone Weekender Festival, a publicity partnership with PopUp Records in Hamburg, and an endorsement from the esteemed Duesenberg Custom Guitar Shop in Hannover, Germany. She secured relationships for her future from her home base as Artist in Residence in the city of Dachau, Germany.\n\nIt\u2019ll Be Alright (2015) found Christina attaining what her music has always suggested, a place where the ghosts of her musical heroes freely mingle with the architecture of modern music. Working closely with her long-time producer and guitarist Dale Murray, drummer Brian Murray and bassist Jason Vautour, Martin made a conscious effort to confound the expectations of those who have categorized her in the past. This record utilizes far more sonic textures, allowing Martin to explore the many sides of her musical personality. The album won a 2016 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year and her It\u2019ll Be Alright single rose to #6 on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 chart. You Ran From Me was voted the #14 most played Canadian song on Sonica for 2015, and Somewhere With You was placed in the CBC Television show Heartland.\n\nFollowing two years of touring across Germany, Poland, The Netherlands, The UK, Switzerland, Austria, France and Canada, Martin returned home briefly in 2016 to write her newest album. A fervent anthem for those who are lost and longing, Lungs Are Burning was the first single from her album Impossible To Hold (Released March 23, 2018). The first single was triggered by the rising Fentanyl drug crisis killing thousands of Canadians, with Christina\u2019s lyrics set to music by her and Dale Murray. With lyrics like \u201cwhile I\u2019m watching the babies\u201d and \u201cgot to go out and get some, baby\u201d, Martin captures the desperation of \u201cchasing the dream\u201d and the horror of living it. Murray\u2019s stately production brings that stark reality home with a bite. Martin: \u201cThe song is an modest attempt to bring light to the heavy topic of addiction, and reflects my own personal sense of loss, longing and a deep void, and the ache I feel from losing my brother and friends to addiction and mental illness.\u201d For her Canadian tour dates, Christina has partnered with Center for Addiction and Mental Health to increase engagement and awareness.\n\n\u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is Martin\u2019s sixth and strongest studio album, achieving a perfect balance between organic ambience and impeccable production. \u201cI\u2019m writing about faith and love more than ever with songs like \u2018Keep Me Calm\u2019 and \u2018Always Reminding\u2019, but I haven\u2019t shaken the need to write about the darker things that are part of our human journey\u201d. Combining good taste, passionate singing and thoughtful lyrics, \u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is where music and poetry meet. The album won the 2018 Music Nova Scotia Award for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\n\nAWARDS\n\n2018 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Impossible To Hold)\n2016 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (It\u2019ll Be Alright)\n2014 Music Nova Scotia Inspirational Recording of the Year (Remember Me \u2013 EP)\n2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Sleeping With A Stranger)\n2009 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n\nARTIST IN RESIDENCIES COMPLETED\n\n2013-2015 Dachau, Germany\n\n2010-2011 Halifax NS, Canada \u2013 Dalhousie Geriatric Medical Research & Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN)\n\nFESTIVALS/CONFERENCES\n\n2019 Ottawa Blues Fest - Ottawa ON, Canada\n2019 Area506 - Saint John NB, Canada\n2018 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto, Canada\n2017 Sonder Fest \u2013 Manchester, United Kingdom\n2016 Reeperbahn Festival \u2013 Hamburg, Germany\n2016 Rising Tide Festival @ Fundy National Park- Alma NB, Canada\n2016 Harmony Bazaar Festival \u2013 Lockeport NS, Canada\n2016 Maverick Festival \u2013 Suffolk, United Kingdom\n2013 Rolling Stone Weekender Festival \u2013 Weissenh\u00e4user Strand, Germany\n2011 Winter Olympics @ Atlantic Canada House \u2013 Vancouver BC, Canada\n2011 Canada Games \u2013 Halifax NS, Canada\n2011 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2010 Belfast Nashville Songwriters Festival \u2013 Belfast, Ireland\n2009 Folk Alliance \u2013 Memphis TN, USA\n2009 North By North East \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2009 Stan Rogers Festival \u2013 Canso NS, Canada\n2002 SXSW - Austin TX, USA", "otherInfo": "Our doors might be closed for the time being\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t put on a great show.\n\nSince we\u2019re all stuck inside, join us every Friday night for a virtual concert featuring a local or regional artist performing from the comfort of their own home.

Since then she has released 20 recordings of her own, and her songs have been covered by such notables as Joan Baez, Bob Geldof, Tom Rush and Rosanne Cash.\n\nThe Grammy-nominated songwriter has appeared on NPR, Austin City Limits, Mountain Stage, eTown, XM Radio, Air America Radio and has toured worldwide as a solo artist and in support of Richard Thompson, Patty Griffin, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Dan Fogelberg, as well as with the Woody Guthrie review, Ribbon of Highway-Endless Skyway, alongside the Guthrie Family, Jimmy Lafave, Slaid Cleaves, and special guests Pete Seeger, Jackson Browne and Kris Kristofferson.

The song has become a standard in choir repertory the world over. Two of her songs appeared on Joan Baez\u2019s Grammy-nominated CD, Day After Tomorrow.

Eliza is currently touring her new album in the virtual fashion of the day - online - streaming a weekly show on Friday nights.\n\nGilkyson\u2019s music, in the classic folk music tradition, has always offered a vivid reflection of the times we live in with each song a window into a world of struggle and beauty in a culture she feels is \u201ccaught somewhere between collapse and reinvention.\u201d\n\nEliza is an active member of the Austin music and political community, including the environmental organization Save Our Springs (www.sosalliance.org),and she is a co-founder of www.5604manor.org, an Austin-based activist resource center that promotes political activism and community involvement around issues of race, patriarchy and global injustice.\n\nPraise for 2020\n\n\"The singer exudes a poetic wisdom few songwriters achieve, and a timeless quality to the album's secular hymns hearkens Leonard Cohen.\" \u2013 Austin Chronicle\n\nEliza Gilkyson is still creating music of richness and depth.\" \u2013 Spirituality & Health Magazine\n\nGilkyson manages to articulate what has remained -- to most of us -- inexpressible, hidden by our fear of forever, and has done so by willing vulnerability and accountability to become her gritty resolve.\" \u2013 All Music", "otherInfo": "Eliza's weekly Friday shows continue!

His unique sandy tenor and masterful blend of rhythm and melody draw comparison to Paul Simon and contemporaries Josh Ritter and Jason Mraz. He wins song competitions. He fills rooms. But most of all he moves people.\n\nFirst time listeners often are drawn to Garveys engaging performance style, accomplished musicianship, and memorable melodies. But his lyrics project a depth and sincerity that allow the observant listener to find meaning beyond the catchy hook. Meanwhile, the intricate production of his albums adds emotional depth and keeps the songs fresh play after play.\n\nThis combination of songwriting and performance strength has earned Garvey numerous awards including being named winner of the Kerrville New Folk, Rocky Mountain Folks Fest, SolarFest, Wildflower Art and Music Festival and Maine Songwriters Association songwriting competitions, voted as Most Wanted artist at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, nominated for Best Male Performer in the New England Music Awards, and a top new singer songwriter by Sirius XM's The Coffeehouse.\n\nOn his latest release, Meteors and Beating Hearts, Garvey shows further maturity as a songwriter, addressing personal and universal themes through a series of lyrical stories. Many of the songs were written as assignments for a weekly songwriting group. The challenge of writing a new song each week and presenting it to a group of artists he admires challenged and pushed Garvey to try a new approach to his songwriting.\n\nGarveys interest in music and writing began at a very young age. Both his parents are educators and his father was a songwriter. Growing up in such a musical environment in the artistically rich Northeast, Garvey developed the firm belief that songwriting is a method for bringing community together and a way for people to explore a greater depth within their own lives.\n\nOriginally a drummer, he picked up the guitar in his teens, in part because his best friend was better with the sticks and together they could start a rock band. But this rhythmic background remains at the core of his musical style. He merges syncopated bass lines with melodic leads to create a full sound from his acoustic guitar.\n\nThe themes of community and living with intention run deep for Garvey, from the musical memories of his youth to his ease in developing relationships with audiences and fellow artists. He builds upon on the energy of live performance to deliver a memorable experience in a way that has led folk stalwarts Vance Gilbert and David Wilcox to proclaim the tradition of acoustic music is in good hands with Connor Garvey.\n\n*2015 Rocky Mountain Folks Fest Main Stage Performer\n\n*2015 Kerrville Folk Festival Main Stage Performer\n\n*2014 Kerrville Folk Festival Grassyhill NEW FOLK WINNER\n\n*2014 Rocky Mountain Folks Fest Singer Songwriter Showcase Winner\n\n*2014 SolarfestSinger-Songwriter Showcase Winner\n\n*2014 Nominee for New England Music Award Best Male Artist\n\n*2014 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival MOST WANTED Artist (crowd voted)\n\n*2012 Winner of Wildflower Festival Singer Songwriter Competition\n\n*2010, 2011, & 2012 Rocky Mountain Folks Fest Singer Songwriter Honorable Mention\n\n*2011, 2012, & 2013 Telluride Troubadour Competition Honorable Mention\n\n*2011 Winner of Maine Songwriters Associations Annual Songwriting Competition\n\n*Top 6 Sirius XM's The Coffeehouse's New Singer Songwriter of 2010", "otherInfo": "Moving our Falmouth Coffee House show to the digital realm!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jesse Roper ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10366400.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Rock, Blues", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Jesse Roper Livestream performance.

USA TODAY once said of Owen, \u201cHe developed a reputation for a singer willing to sacrifice technical perfection for a moment of authentic emotion.\u201d Each song in his catalogue is a glimpse into who Owen is as a person, and a testament to the joy that can only come from being yourself.\n\nHis newest single, \u201cHonesty,\u201d will be released in April 2020; it will be the first song from his forthcoming EP, Las Virginia, which he recently wrapped recording. \u201cI feel like with this new EP I am redefining who I am and showing the world that I\u2019m not just a singer, but an artist and songwriter with a perspective and story to tell.\u201d\n\nLas Virginia reflects Owen\u2019s journey of growth, as well as the combination of where he came from with who he is now. \u201cIt\u2019s all about my internal yin and yang, growing up in the east but now living in the west, and the battle of who I was taught to be versus who I am becoming.\u201d Owen has also coyly said, \u201cWhat happens in Las Virginia . . . ended up on this EP,\u201d in reference to a troubled romantic situation from his past. \u201cI\u2019m proud that I can freely sing about what I\u2019ve been through now. All of the lyrics on my last EP seemed like they were about a girl . . . but they definitely weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAuthenticity is a common theme within the native Virginian's music; past EPs delved deeply into themes of personal authenticity, self-confidence, and love. It took awhile to get there, however.\n\nFollowing his journey as a Season 14 Top 4 finalist on American Idol, Owen embarked on a 38-city tour as part of American Idols LIVE! He had garnered national recognition but felt like he was \u201cliving a lie.\u201d After finding himself in a serious relationship with a man, Owen made the brave decision to come out\u2014through his music, of course.\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day in 2015, Owen released the music video for his first post-Idol single, \u201cCan't Fight It,\u201d along with an exclusive Billboard interview that publicly shared Owen's story as a gay man. In spite of some negative backlash, \u201cCan't Fight It\u201d went on to have over 1 million YouTube views and over half a million Spotify streams. Later that same year, after releasing his EP Air, he also earned the moniker of L.A. Music Award\u2019s \u201cRising Star.\u201d\n\nOwen\u2019s glowing collection of pop gems\u2014layered with textures of soul, R&B, and incandescent synth\u2014have earned attention from the likes of People Magazine, Huffington Post, USA Today, and Billboard. Recent singles have included: \u201cFlexin\u2019 My Vibe,\u201d with a feature appearance from the \u201cSelfie Kid,\u201d Ryan McKenna; \u201cTonight\u201d with a feature from Matillo; \u201cLike a Storm;\u201d and \u201cX,\u201d which Owen credits for inspiring the vibe of Las Virginia.\n\nOnstage, Owen has appeared with some of the most prolific and prominent recording artists, including Jamie Foxx, Ricky Martin, Boy George, and Frankie Grande. He toured with Postmodern Jukebox all over the United Kingdom, Ireland, and South America, and has sung the National Anthem for several major sporting events, including at games for the San Francisco 49ers, San Diego Chargers, Carolina Panthers, Arizona Cardinals, Kansas City Chiefs, Los Angeles Clippers, and Phoenix Suns.\n\nAdditionally, Owen is honored to have performed at over sixty colleges nationwide and has been a featured performer at LGBT Pride Festivals in Columbus, Ohio, Richmond, Virginia, Louisville, Kentucky, and Los Angeles, California\u2014a particular honor for him. \u201cPeople experience and hear countless negative things every day. I think you can get really down when you\u2019re only hearing negative things about what people are saying about you, or what people are doing to you. I think that the best thing you can do is to be yourself and I hope that people find that message through my music.\u201d\n\nOther significant appearances and accolades have included being Elvis Duran's \u201cArtist of the Month\u201d (Jan/Feb 2018); performing his single \u201cGold\u201d on the TODAY Show; winning the \u201cRising Star\u201d award at the 2015 L.A.

Symphonic compositions flow from her fingertips effortlessly, with sound ranging from transcendental folk-pop to virtuosic instrumentals. Christie is often described as \u2018Michael Hedges meets Joni Mitchell and Dave Matthews,\u201d integrating melodic pop lyricism with catchy hooks and percussive, harmonic textures. As an Official Showcase Artist at Folk Alliance International consistently logging a number of major festivals, events, opera houses and theaters nationwide, Christie Len\u00e9e performs with radiant joy that awes crowds and inspires fellow musicians. She recently told Digital Journal that \"years ago, I set my intention to be an inspirational songwriter, though over time I've come to realize that inspiration comes in many forms. Talking about the dark and the light, the beauty and moments of pain are all forms of inspiration.\"\n\nChristie has shared stages with Tommy Emmanuel, Tim Reynolds (Dave Matthews Band), Andy McKee, and Amy Ray (Indigo Girls) to name a few, who have all raved about her talents (see below). Her first place victory in the acclaimed 2017 International Fingerstyle Guitar Championship has earned her featured coverage in Guitar Player Magazine, Acoustic Guitar Magazine, and Premier Guitar. She has released five albums, with \u201cSTAY\u201d one of three finalists for \u201cBest CD of 2016\u201d (Indie Acoustic Project Awards). The album includes three instrumentals produced by Grammy Award Winning producer Will Ackerman, founder of Windham Hill Records, and a music video for the title track supporting a movement on suicide prevention.\n\nChristie\u2019s live shows present a menu of percussive and sonic effects, larger than life sounding instruments, her solo shows embody layers of orchestral elements with a wide array of dynamics and harmonic textures. In 2018 Christie released an arrangement of Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d which garnered media attention across several Digital Publications. AXS.com's Jim Wood noted \"through the use of harmonics and tapping, Len\u00e9e's infectious style utilizes all parts of the guitar and combines elements of folk, rock and pop into one tasty and eclectic musical stew.\"\n\nWith over 12,000 fans on Facebook and nearly half a million plays on YouTube, Christie continues to spread the love of music through live performance, radio airplay and appearances on multiple television stations. Her most recent music video \"Call My Heart Back Home\" premiered via Acoustic Guitar Magazine. Her next video, \u201cFree World Citizen\u201d, is an anthem expressing the connection of all beings. As an artist, she hopes to bring joy, freedom, and light to the world though the love of music.\n\n\u201cChristie Len\u00e9e is a wonderful spirit making beautiful music on the guitar.

Using moody electric guitars, horns, accordion, pedal steel and drums, Bridge 19 presents riffs that bend and blend genres. Touches of Americana, lively pop, vintage Nashville, Motown, singer-songwriter, and even disco float from song to song. You\u2019ll want to dance and sing along.\n\u201cIn the Afterglow\u201d is the third full-length album for a five-person band that has been entertaining live audiences and garnering critical acclaim since 2007, when Lucas and Cecil first began performing together.\n\nBridge 19 has shared stages with Brandi Carlile, Dr. Dog, Langhorn Slim, Sarah McLachlan, Asleep at the Wheel, Richard Thompson and more. The band has been booked at major music festivals, including MidPoint, RiverRoots, FreeFall, Lilith Fair and the International Folk Festival.\n\nBridge 19 has also been featured on nationally syndicated NPR and was ranked No. 1 in Thrillist\u2019s \u201cTop Louisville Bands You Need to Hear.\u201d \u201cRiding on a Wire,\u201d the band\u2019s last full-length release, was ranked No. 14 in Louisville AAA station WFPK\u2019s 100 Best Albums of 2015, and Bridge 19 was a finalist for Folk Artist of the Year at the 2015 Louisville Music Awards.\n\nLucas and Cecil\u2019s vocal harmonies have always been a cornerstone of Bridge 19, and they guide song after song on \u201cIn the Afterglow.\u201d Lucas and Cecil\u2019s soulful singing is reminiscent of female Americana duos like the Secret Sisters and the Watson Twins. Bridge 19\u2019s leaders aren\u2019t related by blood, though their effortless melodies might make you think they are.\n\nIn fact, Lucas and Cecil have been close friends for most of their lives, and that trust and comfort enables them to push past vulnerabilities and dig deep. Together, they craft songs that explore love, loss, addiction, heartache, anxiety, fear, joy and desire.\n\n\u201cWe know what each other is thinking or means at all times,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging to write music with somebody, but I don\u2019t find it challenging to write with Audrey because we know each other so well.\u201d\nLong before they were band mates, Lucas and Cecil were teammates \u2013 beginning as 10-year-olds and continuing through high school on a traveling youth softball club.\n\nThey lost touch somewhat when they went to different colleges to play ball, but unbeknownst to each other at the time, they took parallel paths in becoming self-taught musicians, learning to play guitar and write songs. They discovered each other\u2019s work on MySpace \u2013 music\u2019s go-to digital platform at the time. After Cecil invited Lucas to practice with a band she was in, they hit it off and began performing as a duo.\n\nThey became Bridge 19 and have added band members over the years; the current lineup has been in place since 2014. In addition to Cecil on lead guitar and Lucas on rhythm guitar or handheld percussion, Bridge 19 features Joey Thieman (horns, accordion), Meg Samples (drums), Jeff Faith (bass). Over the years, they\u2019ve reached a new height in their art, a reckoning with self and society that can only come with age and experience.\n\nThe new album\u2019s first track and first single is #MeToo-inspired \u201cThe One,\u201d arguably Bridge 19\u2019s most overt social commentary. Lucas and Cecil wrote it after hearing the courageous courtroom statements of the survivors of serial sexual predator Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor. \u201cThe One\u201d contains haunting lyrics while using a pedal steel guitar and catchy drumbeat to combine sounds of Americana, vintage Nashville and pop. The song is presented from the perspective of a perpetrator who is stalking a woman, imagining a sense of entitlement and privilege to excuse such vile behavior.\nOther songs include the high-energy soul track \u201cThe Truth,\u201d which a danceable Motown throwback; the slow, heartrending \u201cDiamonds;\u201d and the surprising disco tune, \u201cBreakdown,\u201d which is about an overly emotional crush who comes on too strong. Meanwhile, \u201cGet Back in Bed\u201d is a simple, country love ballad about longing to avoid the harshness of the world outside.\n\n\u201cIn the Afterglow\u201d was recorded with engineer Anne Gauthier at Louisville\u2019s acclaimed La La Land Studio, where My Morning Jacket, Ray Lamontagne and many other popular acts, including Louisville-based White Reaper and Murder by Death, have recorded.\n\nBridge 19 is on tour now in support of \u201cIn the Afterglow,\u201d and music videos of \u201cThe One\u201d and \u201cThe Truth\u201d are available on YouTube and at Bridge19.com.\n\nThis band is already well-established as a celebrated member of Louisville\u2019s music scene.

This principle governs Erelli\u2019s approach to his craft, and is uniquely evident on his latest release, Mixtape, which features revelatory reinterpretations of songs by the Grateful Dead, Neko Case, Roy Orbison and others.\n\nErelli\u2019s two decade career highlights include 11 solo albums, stints accompanying Josh Ritter, Paula Cole and Anais Mitchell, and a pair of records he produced for GRAMMY-winning songwriter Lori McKenna. Ever since Billboard magazine heralded the \u201csimple, atmospheric grace\u201d of his Signature Sounds debut, Erelli\u2019s belief in the sacredness of an examined life has driven him between the ostensible extremes of lullabies and murder ballads, western swing and protest anthems.

I loved Sergio Mendes\u2019 songs, liked John Hartford on the Glenn Campbell Show and really got into James Taylor and Joni Mitchell who I still consider my two main influences. I also loved the singer-songwriters of the time including Carole King and Laura Nyro and later fell in love with Steely Dan\u2019s music, and just wore out my copy of Hubert Laws\u2019 Rite Of Spring. I was completely self-taught, by llistening to records and playing them over and over, teaching myself tablature from a great James Taylor book and modal tunings from Joni Mitchell\u2019s For The Roses song book. I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit. Other long term members include drummer Ray Levier and keyboardist Peter Vitalone, both of whom have been with KJ since\u201998 and \u201899. I am always interested in stretching myself and performing my music in different ways. The Lucky 7 recordings feature some wonderful pairings of great players that I don\u2019t always get to tour with but who have appeared in with me at The 55 and are wonderful friends too.\nKJ manages between 120-140 performances a year.

A self-described \u2018military brat\u2019, Welling\u2019s struggle to feel rooted in any one place carved a unharmonious path of heartbreak, doubt, and insecurity that defined her 20s and early 30s\u2026 a journey that lead to her soul-defining rebirth as an international touring artist with a place to call home in Nashville, TN.\n\nHer bold, sultry voice, reminiscent of Sheryl Crow\u2019s grit, Natalie Maines\u2019 twang, and Stevie Nicks\u2019 heart, is upstaged only by the genuine love and connection this natural performer has with her fans both on and off stage. But embracing confidence has not always been easy for this singer-songwriter, who speaks candidly about her battle to be good to herself, and to quiet the inner voice nagging her to be \u201cperfect\u201d. Through the process of creating her latest work, a collection of songs that encapsulate Carrie\u2019s determination to embrace self-love, self-care, and leave the past behind, she\u2019s found a place of peace and healing, recognizing that authenticity and vulnerability is the glue that binds us all.\n\nIn 2018, a few years after the release of her first solo EP, The Edge, Welling put out a Patreon campaign, embracing her dream to finally quit the side hustle and focus on music full-time. Her patrons, which Carrie refers to as her \u201cchampions\u201d, have proven to be an integral part of the artist\u2019s journey - not only supporting her online but also at live performances across the globe. \u201cMy Patreon champions started out as my fans and now we\u2019re all friends.

Since the 1970s, Lovano has been one of the world's premiere tenor saxophone players, earning a Grammy award and several nods on Down Beat magazine's critics' and readers' polls.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Ohio, Lovano was exposed throughout his early life to jazz by his father, Tony \"Big T\" Lovano. John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, and Sonny Stitt were among his earlier influences. He developed further at Berklee College of Music, and then served a big band apprenticeship with Woody Herman's Thundering Herd and the Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra.\n\n\"Big T\" Lovano, a fine Cleveland tenorman, was his first inspiration. He taught Joe all the standards, how to lead a gig, how to pace a set, and to be versatile enough to always find work. Joe started on alto at age six and switched to tenor five years later. He attended Berklee before working with Jack McDuff and Dr. Lonnie Smith. After three years with Woody Herman's Orchestra, Lovano moved to New York and began playing regularly with Mel Lewis\u2019 Big Band. This influence is still present in his solos. He often plays lines that convey the rhythmic drive and punch of an entire horn section.\n\nOne of the top saxophonists of the 1990s, Joe Lovano continues to grow and explore as a musician. He has a husky tenor tone based in the tradition, but an approach to improvisation that is modern and daring. In the early \u201880s he began working in John Scofield\u2019s Quartet and a bass-less trio with Paul Motian and Bill Frisell. Steeped in the tradition of Ornette Coleman, Motian\u2019s recordings show off Lovano\u2019s avant-garde abilities.

She was raised surrounded by living, breathing roots music\u2014her father\u2019s country band rehearsing; the lively music at church and at community dances; the tunes she rocked out to win fiddle competitions. She thought every little girl learned to stepdance at the age of three and fiddle at the age of six. She knew nothing else and decided early on that she wanted to be a professional musician.\n\nShe took that leap, and for over two decades has been recording and captivating audiences worldwide, exploring new and nuanced places each step of the way. On April 12, 2019, Verch will release her twelfth recording, Once A Day, via Slab Town Records. A followup to her 2017 career-\u00ad\u2010 spanning release The April Verch Anthology, this new album is a heartfelt homage to 1950s and 60s classic country.\n\nRecorded in Nashville by Bil VornDick and produced by Doug Cox, Once A Day features the talents of country veterans including steel guitarist Al Perkins (Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris), guitarist Redd Volkaert (Merle Haggard) and fiddler Kenny Sears (Mel Tillis, Grand Ole Opry). From the title track, a hit debut single for Connie Smith, to Loretta Lynn\u2019s \u201cYou Ain\u2019t Woman Enough,\u201d and Webb Pierce\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re Not Mine Anymore,\u201d the album is a dynamic crash course in one of Country Music\u2019s most influential time periods. Her admiration for these musicians and this iconic era is evident from start to finish. Void of contemporary gimmicks and over-\u00ad\u2010production, Verch revels in the history and lets the music speak for itself.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, making this album was not a choice. It was something I felt I had to do. It has been more daunting than any other project I\u2019ve embarked on, because these songs, these artists, the history of this music matters to me on the deepest level. It is a love letter and a thank you letter in one, to the artists, songwriters, musicians, and industry professionals who created, perhaps in some cases without even realizing it, an era of music that speaks to me in a way that no other music does. If someone hears a song on this album and that prompts them to look up and love the original that will be the highest compliment I could receive,\u201d explains Verch.\n\nWhile Verch is perhaps best known for playing traditional fiddle styles from her native Ottawa Valley, Canada, her performances extend into old-\u00ad\u2010time American and Appalachian styles and far beyond, for a well-\u00ad\u2010rounded tour-\u00ad\u2010de-\u00ad\u2010force of North Americana sounds. Verch and her fellow trio members pare down their arrangements, highlighting the simple pleasures of upright bass, guitar, clawhammer banjo, voices, fiddle, and stepping in intimate conversation. At the heart lie Verch\u2019s delicate voice, energetic footwork, and stunning playing. Sometimes she sings, steps and fiddles all at once, with apparent ease and precision. Verch is -\u00ad\u2010 as they say -\u00ad\u2010 a triple threat in performance, her live show a beautiful companion to her music: versatile, robust, and masterfully executed.\n\nVerch began her full time touring career in 2000 and has performed around the world, including festival, theatre and performing arts centre appearances in Canada, USA, China, Australia, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, Spain, Czech Republic and the United Arab Emirates. She also presents workshops, master classes, and lectures as part of her tours and at selected music camps.\n\nVerch won\u2019t be the one to tell you about her championship titles, nominations, and awards, or the fact that she was one of 6 fiddlers who represented the Canadian fiddle tradition to the world at the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, as part of a segment called \"Fiddle Nation\u201d. Instead, in speaking with her, you\u2019ll hear about how passionate she is about sharing her music; in small gatherings in remote communities in Iqaluit, to large prestigious concert halls like Mozartsal in Vienna.\n\nEven as she plays with the tradition she inherited, Verch keeps the community-\u00ad\u2010fired celebratory side of her music at the forefront, honing a keen awareness of how to engage contemporary listeners. It\u2019s why Rolling Stone cited her \u201cOne of the 12 best things we saw at MerleFest in 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as contemporary bluegrass has Alison Krauss as an ambassador, the Ottawa Valley has April Verch,\u201d said NPR\u2019s Marco Werman on \u201cThe World.\u201d And Verch never forgets the roots of her music, that connection to the people out there in the audience, on the dance floor, to the community sparked by a good song. \u201cIt\u2019s about joining together to celebrate everyday life, through music. We\u2019re all in this together.\u201d Verch\u2019s ability to preserve the authentic folk traditions of the past and reintroduce them into the musical landscape of the present is a testament to her masterful musicianship and widespread appeal.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anthony D'Amato ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9501754.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Rock, Acoustic, Folk, Indie, Americana", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Produced by Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes, First Aid Kit) and recorded with contributions from an Omaha all-star team including Conor Oberst and members of Bright Eyes, The Faint, and Cursive, 'Cold Snap' is Anthony D'Amato's most ambitious record yet.

It is a pure country voice through and through. Blessed with a Johnny Cash baritone and the wit of Jerry Reed, Ray displays both over the 11 songs on his fourth album, the self-titled Ray Scott. A mix of roadhouse foot-stompers, stone-cold country ballads and the sing-speak songs for which he\u2019s become known, Ray Scott flashes with the energy and verve that defined Ray\u2019s earlier hits \u201cMy Kind of Music\u201d and \u201cThose Jeans.\u201d\nBut the album is also a reintroduction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reboot\u2014or a Ray-boot, if you will,\u201d quips Ray, who dubbed his last album Rayality. \u201cIt is an evolution, but I think people will hear it and know it\u2019s the same guy from \u2018My Kind of Music\u2019 and \u2018Those Jeans.\u2019 Lyrically, I tend to say things a certain way. You can always tell it\u2019s me.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s good reason for that, aside from that rumbling voice. Save for a few trusted cowriters here and there, like Mark Stephen Jones, Tony Mullins and Brandy Clark, Ray prefers to write solo. In this era of five-plus writers collaborating on a single song, Ray is a true lone wolf.\n\u201cCollaboration is fun and some of my favorite things have been written with other people, but at the same time, if you can write by yourself, you should,\u201d Ray says. \u201cThere was a time in Nashville when people wrote alone. Some of my favorite old writers, the people who got me interested in doing this in the first place\u2014Harlan Howard and Bob McDill\u2014wrote alone.\u201d\nThe results of such a writing style are pure, unfiltered songs, the undiluted vision of the artist.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always recorded my own material because it\u2019s almost impossible for me to sell a song that someone else wrote. I was more or less made to tell stories through my own window\u2014and the window\u2019s pretty smudged sometimes,\u201d Ray laughs. \u201cBut if I can entertain myself, I feel like other people might be entertained as well.\u201d\nThe tracks on Ray Scott are certainly entertaining. These are story songs that, instead of just repeating a catch phrase over and over, actually go somewhere. \u201cPapa n Mama,\u201d a loping blues number, is the tale of a son who stops his father\u2014 permanently\u2014from abusing his mother, landing himself in the pen. \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Gonna Be You\u201d is a defiant kiss-off to a cheating lover, promising she\u2019ll never break this guy\u2019s heart again. The cinematic \u201cLeave This World,\u201d however, is the polar opposite: a love song of devotion elevated by Ray\u2019s Male Vocalist of the Year-worthy performance, proof that Ray\u2019s bread and butter isn\u2019t just in the spoken word.\nStill, there is magic in those recitation numbers, especially in \u201cTijuana Buzzkill.\u201d A true tale of a disastrous, if humorous, south-of-the-border adventure that ended with Ray and his buddy in jail, the track exemplifies Ray\u2019s gift for wry storytelling.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just as much an art to recitation as there is singing. It\u2019s all in how you emote, your emphasis and how you tell a story,\u201d he says. And it helps if you have comic timing, which Ray does in spades. In songs like the hazy bonus track \u201cWhat Works for Willie\u201d and the take-one-for-the-team anthem \u201cThe Ugly One,\u201d he delivers the pay-off lines with the cadence of a comedian.\n\u201cThe songs end up being a little on the polarizing side,\u201d Ray admits. \u201cBut I love that. Everything I\u2019ve ever had any luck with was a song that made people turn their head and go, \u2018Well, that\u2019s different\u2019 or \u2018That pisses me off.\u2019\u201d\nProduced by Dave Brainard (Brandy Clark\u2019s 12 Stories, Jerrod Niemann\u2019s Free the Music), Ray Scott excels in the details\u2014the swampy harmonica of lead-off track \u201cCookin\u2019\u201d; the mariachi horns of \u201cTijuana Buzzkill\u201d; and the hypnotic rhythm of the white-trash nursery rhyme \u201cWheels on the House.\u201d In the end, no two songs sound alike, and Ray cements himself as a deft performer, able to toggle between those funny tunes and serious fare like the staggering \u201cI Miss the Days.\u201d\nA bittersweet ballad about being young, \u201cI Miss the Days\u201d is a slice of nostalgia, both in subject matter and production. Sonically, it recalls the 1970s and \u201980s sound of country music.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we were going for. If you listen to an old Waylon Jennings record or something from that time period, a lot of those songs had a \u2018Luckenbach\u2019 vibe to them,\u201d says Ray, who agrees that today\u2019s country music frequently borrows some of the bombast of late \u201980s hard rock. \u201cBut I\u2019m a little more Waylon and a little less Warrant.\u201d\nIn the end, Ray Scott furthers Ray\u2019s identity as a modern day outlaw, not in image, but in his approach to the music industry.\n\u201cAfter all these years in Nashville I\u2019ve never been willing to compromise my artistic vision as far as writing goes or the way things are recorded and produced. I don\u2019t chase trends, which is not necessarily your quickest road to riches by any means,\u201d he says.\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, I\u2019d like to walk outside my trailer, look up at the sun and say, \u2018I did it the way I wanted.\u2019\u201d Ray stops to laugh. \u201cWhen the cops come to serve the warrant, at least I\u2019ll have my integrity\u2014integrity and a beer.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Yall join us for another mancave Jam this Friday on the Official Ray Scott Facebook page at 7:30PM cst!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gareth Emery ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9112299.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Dance Pop, Trance, Electronic", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Check out all Gareth Emery music on Spotify:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/GE-MUSIC", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Khris Royal ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8964801.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Jazz, Funk, Rock, Rnb, Edm", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Khris Royal was born to be a musician.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

He\u2019s played four hour shows single-handedly, and traded half-hour sets at a weekly house gig at a bar in Guatemala City with \u201csome guy named Luis, who sang songs like \u2018My Way\u2019 in Spanish.

Leaving the past where it belongs, accepting there\u2019s no way to know what\u2019s ahead, and challenging himself to be present in both love and life. It\u2019s heady stuff. It also rocks.\n\nWith a career full of critical acclaim and popular success, Carll could\u2019ve played it safe on this, his sixth record, but he didn\u2019t. The result is a musically ambitious and lyrically deep statement of an artist in his creative prime.\n\nHayes Carll\u2019s list of accomplishments is long. His third album, 2008\u2019s Trouble In Mind, earned him an Americana Music Association Award for Song of the Year (for \u201cShe Left Me for Jesus\u201d). The follow-up, KMAG YOYO was the most played album on the Americana Chart in 2011 and spawned covers by artists as varied as Hard Working Americans and Lee Ann Womack, whose version of \u201cChances Are\u201d garnered Carll a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers swept the Austin Music Awards, and was his fourth record in a row to reach #1 on the Americana Airplay chart. Kelly Willis and Kenny Chesney have chosen to record his songs and his television appearances include The Tonight Show, Austin City Limits, and Later w/Jools Holland. Carll is the rare artist who can rock a packed dancehall one night and hold a listening room at rapt attention the next.\n\n\u201cRepeating myself creatively would ultimately leave me empty. Covering new ground, exploring, and taking chances gives me juice and keeps me interested.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wanted to find the next level. On What It Is, he clearly has.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessarily easy to get there. Carll\u2019s last release, 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers was an artistic and commercial risk \u2014 a bold move which eschewed the tempo and humor of much of his previous work. The record revealed a more serious singer-songwriter dealing with more serious subjects \u2014 divorce, new love in the middle of life, parenting, the worth of work. What It Is finds him now on the other side, revived and happy, but resolute \u2014 no longer under the impression that any of it comes for free.\n\n\u201cI want to dig in so this life doesn\u2019t just pass me by. The more engaged I am the more meaning it all has. I want that to be reflected in the work.\u201d\n\nAnd meaning there is. Carll sings \u201cbut I try because I want to,\u201d on the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cNone\u2019Ya.\u201d He\u2019s not looking back lamenting love lost, rather, finding joy and purpose in the one he\u2019s got and hanging on to the woman who sometimes leaves him delightedly scratching his head. \u201cIf I May Be So Bold,\u201d finds him standing on similar ground \u2014 lyrically taking on the challenge of participating fully in life rather than discontentedly letting life happen.\n\nBold enough to not surrender bold enough to give a damn\n\nBold enough to keep on going or to stay right where I am\n\nThere\u2019s a whole world out there waiting full of stories to be told\n\nI\u2019ll heed the call and tell\u2019em all if I may be so bold\n\nThere\u2019s no wishy washy here and he\u2019s not on the sidelines. In fact, he\u2019s neck-deep in life. On the rambunctious, fiddle-punctuated, \u201cTimes Like These,\u201d he laments political division in America while delivering a rapid-fire plea to \u201cdo my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor, while keeping all my joie de vivre.\u201d Carll\u2019s signature cleverness and aptitude for so-personal-you-might-miss-it political commentary is as strong as ever. The stark, \u201cFragile Men,\u201d co-written with singer-songwriter Lolo, uses humor and dripping sarcasm to examine his gender\u2019s resistance to change in less than three minutes of string-laden, almost Jacques Brel invoking drama. It\u2019s new musical territory for Carll, and the result is powerful. His voice is strong and resonant on these songs, and it\u2019s thrilling to hear him use it with a new authority. He is alternately commanding and tender, yet always soulful.\n\nCarll returned to trusted producer Brad Jones (producer of 2008\u2019s Trouble in Mind and 2011\u2019s KMAG YOYO) and Alex the Great Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to record What It Is, and recruited singer-songwriter, author, and fiancee Allison Moorer as co-producer. The production is adventurous while keeping the focus on the singer and his songs and providing a path for him to go where he wants to go. Where that is, is forward.\n\nThat\u2019s evident in the songwriting. Carll continues to hone his singular voice, but is also a flexible co-writer. Matraca Berg, Charlie Mars, Adam Landry, and Moorer have co-writing credits here, but it was Moorer\u2019s inspiration that provided the largest impact.\n\n\u201cOn the songwriting front she\u2019s just a pro. She helps me cut through the noise and she does it with wit and style.\u201d\n\nCarll\u2019s own wit and style has never been more evident. Whether it\u2019s with the put-you-in-picture detail of, \u201cBeautiful Thing,\u201d the not quite sheepish enough, dude-esque defense of dishonesty in, \u201cThings You Don\u2019t Wanna Know,\u201d or the strong as a tree trunk declaration of love on, \u201cI Will Stay,\u201d he displays an increasing command of his poetic lexicon.\n\nWriters most often wrestle with experience and expectations, either romanticizing the past or telling us how good it\u2019s going to be when they get where they\u2019re going. What It Is is a record that is rooted solidly in the present, revealing an artist in the emotional and intellectual here and now.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "LP Giobbi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8890908.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Electro House, Disco, Dance Pop, House, Electro Pop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "LP Giobbi is rock \u2019n roll with a disco soul, born draped in sequins and cloaked in fog at a seance in the mountains of Oregon.\n\nShe was trained in jazz piano at UC Berkeley before becoming a synth warrior goddess in Los Angeles.

The band has gained plenty of experience, touring perpetually over the last 4 years; they have performed over 500 shows across the United States, Canada and Mexico, including their opening sets for Bon Jovi, The Doobies Brothers, The Struts and Buckcherry.\n\n\u201cI have had the pleasure of working with the guys from Daring Greatly.

Their fresh approach brings a wide array of infectious dance grooves to their high-energy live show. The band released their highly-anticipated debut album, \"Tongue & Groovin\u2019\", in late 2016, and is now available everywhere including iTunes, Amazon, GooglePlay, Spotify, CD Baby, Band Camp and many more sites.\n\nThe band formed in 2012 by long-time Bay Area guitarist and vocalist Jason Movrich (The Mission Players, Jason Movrich & Friends). The band is comprised of a tight group of top notch musicians including vocalist Lydia Walker, Bay Area bassist John Bartlett, southern California native Blake Ritterman on drums, along with multi-saxophonist Brian Lassiter.\n\nThe band\u2019s music is strongly influenced by the classic sounds of Motown, Stax, Daptones and Blue Note Records but with a fresh and original spin. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to connect with our audience, get you to feel the groove that makes you want to dance,\u201d says Movrich.\n\nBig Blu Soul Revue has tour dates scheduled throughout 2020.

He followed that impulse when he left an Ivy League school to pursue a career in music, and when he moved to LA after seven successful years in Boston. And it was that impulse that compelled him to write a concept album about the search for sanity and empathy in a fractured America. That\u2019s why Jake founded Drunken Logic, a band that \u201cblend[s] more genres and styles than we have room to list, all in the name of creating an eclectic fast-forward sound that\u2019s shaken up after each track\u201d (Vanyaland). Since then, DL has released three critically acclaimed albums and several award-winning music videos, and performed at major events and venues like AT&T Park and First Night Boston \u2014 all while demonstrating profound honesty, scathing wit, and musical fearlessness.\n\nJake\u2019s artistic journey has taken him around the world and back again, with jobs in every corner of the music industry and performances at everything from celebrity galas to improv comedy shows. He\u2019s also participated in grassroots campaigns for automatic voter registration and universal healthcare, and taught songwriting classes to young people trying to find their voices. Despite his busy schedule, Jake still saves time for pickup basketball, urban and rural hiking, and trying new beers based solely on their names.\n\nWith each step forward, DL have been careful to give back to their community by supporting progressive causes and hosting music workshops for young people. In 2016, Drunken Logic donated their song and video \u201cWhat A Beautiful Morning!\u201d to the 30 Days, 30 Songs project for a Trump-free America, alongside artists like Death Cab for Cutie, R.E.M. and more. And this past year, Jake has returned to his home state of California to release DL\u2019s third record, The Loudness Wars \u2014 an unblinking reflection on the forces roiling our country and the people left in their wake.

We eat gumbo in our flannel shirts, and we eat red beans and rice while head-banging!\u201d\n\nMusic was a huge part of Eva and Cedric\u2019s childhood, their first shared fandom being for \u201cTurn Your Love Around\u201d by iconic vocalist and guitarist George Benson, which they would dance to together every time the radio played it. They enjoyed looking in at what their older siblings were digging on MTV, such as Jay Z, Nirvana, Blind Melon, Michael Jackson, and \u201c90s pop music was awesome too! And R&B like SWV, En Vogue, etc.,\u201d Eva says. In high school their tastes had drifted; Eva was introduced to Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd. After high school she researched and grooved on the old blues and folk that had influenced those classic rock bands. At the same time, she and Cedric were also big World-Wide Wrestling fans \u2014 \u201cwe loved wrestling! Cedric loved it before I did, but then I became a fanatic too.\u201d They really enjoyed the hard rock music used in bouts, drawing them closer to heavy metal.\n\nAbout this time Cedric had started to play the drums and wanted to hear the songs that Eva was writing, which she found exciting. He matched drum parts to songs she had only worked out so far on guitar, later on getting a bass player and another guitarist. As soon as they had a few arranged, they were ready to start performing. They went through some changes: The Black Tones as a four piece only lasted for a while, then became a trio, \u201cbut Cedric and I were the founders and the only consistently reliable members, so now we just keep it as a duo, while hiring other musicians to play instruments live with us.\u201d Eva had also been in an all-girl punk band called BUST, but she ended up channeling everything into The Black Tones with Cedric.\n\nThrough countless shows supporting a few early singles, The Black Tones felt they finally got their first big breakthrough opening for Death Cab for Cutie in an anniversary benefit for the Paramount Theater. \u201cThat was the biggest show we\u2019ve done!\u201d Eva exclaims. She gives credit for reaching that height to NighTrain, the all black female punk band that she says discovered and championed them when they had freshly started.\n\nFor Cobain and Cornbread, The Black Tones are returning from their singles to work with the renowned, glorious grunge producer Jack Endino, introduced to them by Eva\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and music writer Jake Uitti. Jake had interviewed Jack and sent him their song \u201cWoman in Black\u201d without Eva\u2019s knowledge and Jack replied how much he loved it and wanted to work with The Black Tones.\n\n\u201cI was never really big on recording in a studio,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m a live show nut, I just love performing. Being in studios was always very stressful for me, but when we worked with Jack, that totally changed! It was the best recording experience I\u2019ve ever had. Jack is like a scientist, a chemist behind the soundboard. He had great ideas that strengthened each song. I\u2019ve never met anyone with an ear like his, it\u2019s unbelievable, though he\u2019s a calm, humble, kind, efficient, honest and very intelligent guy \u2014 I was so intimidated at first, I mean, here\u2019s the guy who recorded the Melvins, Nirvana, Soundgarden, and the list goes on. And now he\u2019s working with us and he\u2019s really into it!\u201d\n\nCobain and Cornbread also features help from their friend Mason Lowe from Bread & Butter, on \u201cChubby and Tubby\u201d (a frenetic garage rock instrumental ode to the landmark Seattle variety store) and \u201cWelcome Mr. Pink\u201d (the band\u2019s autobiographical anthem). \u201cMason has a great ear and was really amazing to work with.\u201d Ed Brooks mastered all the songs on the record, with Jack checking back in to make sure he was looped on everything. \u201cAs a band we are of course rooting for the record, but it\u2019s even more special when everyone else is as well!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something very unique about the songs (all originals save for a cover of \u201cRiver of Jordan\u201d) and sound unique about the minimalist sound Jack helped The Black Tones achieved, reminding one of the debuts from The Ramones to the Stooges to the Modern Lovers. Eva acknowledges the brute power of the album\u2019s sound, \u201cit\u2019s pretty vulnerable and raw and I like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are songs like \u2018Welcome Mr. Pink\u2019 where you can hear the click sound from me pressing down on the button to turn on my reverb pedal.\u201d Or in their righteous, ferocious Black Power anthem, \u201cKey of Black (They Want Us Dead),\u201d \u201cafter the second guitar chorus when I go back to the solo, I almost forgot to press my Wah Wah pedal back on so it comes in a little late.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not factory made or even ever scratch the surface of perfection, we\u2019re real people, this is real life and these little details remind me of the imperfections of life,\u201d she says. \u201cLife\u2019s real, life\u2019s the blues, coming from the heart. My doctor told me I have a slight heart murmur, well, so does our music!\u201d", "otherInfo": "Nectar Virtual Concert Series #11 featuring THE BLACK TONES & TRES LECHES ! \"Pay What You Will\" via PayPay @ paypal.me/nectarlounge"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bodies On The Beach ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10364923.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Indie Rock", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Sparkle sparkle.", "otherInfo": "Live, full band show presented by Live Stream Seattle.

She managed to record two full-length albums and tour with some of the music world's biggest names even before she hit the age of 20. Her first album drew rave reviews from most critics and put her on the often rocky road toward stardom.\n\nDevon was born in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in the spring of 1982. She grew up in a household filled with music and family and friends. She admits some of her influences include Bikini Kill, Frank Zappa, and even some of the classic rock & roll groups her parents loved, like the Beatles. At a young age, Devon practiced vocal harmony with her father. Later she used his old guitar to strum out her first tentative notes. By the time she was 15, she was putting her musical talents to work, playing in front of local places for change from those who stopped to listen. There was never any other dream in her mind but music, and luckily no one to tell her it was the kind of dream that was out of reach.\n\nWhen Devon was still in her teens, she recorded her debut album, a self-titled offering filled with original songs. That album -- really, her voice on that album -- drew a lot of interest, and in the end landed her a spot touring as a side act with the very popular Dave Matthews Band. One tour turned into two. For 2001, Devon released a second album, LONG SLEEVE STORY, under the Three Word Records label. She had some pretty impressive help on her sophomore release, such as drummer Nate Brown, bassist David Saull, trumpeter John D'earth, and bass player Stefan Lessard, who also served as producer for the album.\n\nDevon's 2003 CD, UPSTATE SONGS, (City Salvage Records) was included in Rolling Stone's \u201cCritics Top Albums of 2003\u201d. Critic Julie Gerstein called the record \u201cperhaps the sweetest and most honest folk-pop album recorded this year,\u201d and added, \u201cSproule's vocal and lyrical beauty is unmatched.\"\n\n2007 brought the release of her 'getting-married' (to songwriter Paul Curreri) CD, KEEP YOUR SILVER SHINED (City Salvage/Waterbug). Produced by Jeff Romano in the heart of Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge mountains, this CD highlights Sproule\u2019s talent for combining Appalachian, folk and jazz influences. From the front porch thump of \"Old Virginia Block\" to the high lonesome traditional \"The Weeping Willow,\u201d featuring fellow Virginia-native Mary Chapin Carpenter, the record finds Sproule making another important contribution to the Great American Songbook. The New Yorker magazine: The nimble singer-guitarist Devon Sproule chronicles her ongoing love affairs with humanity, nature, and the state of Virginia. She performs with a sweet, round diction that shines through even her most ornate imagery and rambunctious melodies. In July 2007 Devon graced the cover of fRoots magazine in the UK; the first American artist on the cover this decade.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Sherlocks ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7734421.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Kiaran Crook - Lead Vocals/Rhythm Guitar, Andy Davidson - Bass, Brandon Crook - Drums, Josh Davidson - Lead Guitar", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "We are a 4 piece indie/alternative band consisting of two sets of brothers", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Phil Madeley ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gaffa Tape Sandy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9803827.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Alternative, Garage Punk, Garage Rock, Indie Rock, Rock, Indie", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Formed in 2015 by three friends with a desire to do something loud and exciting, Gaffa Tape Sandy\u2019s popularity quickly escalated thanks to a series of incendiary live shows and a seemingly endless succession of instantly memorable garage-punk/rock tunes.\n\nThe Brighton/Bury St Edmunds outfit\u2019s brand of giddily frantic, high-octane hyper rock \u2018n\u2019 roll has already landed them support slots with acts including IDLES, Peace, Art Brut, Weakened Friends, SuperGlu, Bloody Knees and UK tours supporting Indoor Pets & Skegss.\n\nTheir debut EP \u2018Spring Killing\u2019 lead to them performing at Glastonbury Festival 2017, with their next single \u2018Beehive\u2019 gaining much support including Huw Stephens\u2019 BBC Radio 1 Tip Of The Week, before being included in NME\u2019s 100 Essential Acts for 2018.\n\nThe past two years have seen them performing all of the UK festival circuit, from Live At Leeds & Liverpool Soundcity, to Latitude & The Great Escape Festival, as well as a number of international festivals across Iceland & Germany.

There are so many layers to Canadian-Colombian singer Lido Pimienta\u2019s identity that you might get lost in them. But if you did, you\u2019d be missing the point.\n\nHer multi-textural, mind-bending voice and music project what Canada\u2019s The Globe and Mail called her \u201cbold, brash, polarizing\u201d persona, which constantly confronts the powers that be. But it also reveals an embrace of the Afro- and Indigenous traditions that is at once defiant, delicate and sweetly nostalgic.\n\nPimienta\u2019s new album Miss Colombia takes her ecstatic hybridity to a new level, building on the \u201cnu\u201d intersection of electronica and cumbia established by her first two albums, Color, released in 2010, and the 2016 Polaris Prize-winning La Papessa as Canadian album of the year. The latter was the first 100% independently released, non- English or French album to win the $50,000 prize. Produced with Matt Smith, a/k/a Prince Nifty, Miss Colombia overflows with the kind of understated genius that promises yet another breakthrough.\n\nAs a Canadian global-beats trailblazer, Lido has an affinity for acts like A Tribe Called Red and Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq, but her work also resonates with British-Sri Lankan rapper MIA and she draws unabashed inspiration from the New York-bred Dominican-Trinidadian rap queen Cardi B. Miss Colombia has the effect of expanding the narrative about her dual Colombian/Canadian identity to her family\u2019s mixed roots in the Afro-Colombian and Indigenous Wayuu communities, while establishing an ambitious new sonic palette that brings her closer to home.\n\nWho or what exactly is Miss Colombia? Pimienta\u2019s new album\u2019s title was inspired by Miss Universe MC Steve Harvey\u2019s gaffe in 2015 when he mistakenly awarded the crown to Miss Colombia instead of the actual winner, Miss Philippines. The incident not only caused her to reflect on the anti-blackness she experienced as a child growing up in Barranquilla, but the fact that while her sister was groomed to be a beauty queen, she suffered through an awkward adolescence as the \u201cweird artistic tomboy\u201d of the family.\n\n\u201cSo I was like am I still Colombian or should I just keep calm and carry on because I\u2019m Canadian now?\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the premise and genesis of Miss Colombia.\u201d\n\nThe central mood of Miss Colombia coalesces around a series of moving, musical poems embracing how she\u2019s loved and lost. The journey magically documents an introspection tinged with sadness, yet still evoking a kind of optimism about experiencing the emotion in glorious repetition. \u201cTe Quer\u00eda,\u201d (I Wanted You) pulses with a kind of samba-like cumbia, floating in the memory of desire and denial. The narrator\u2019s \u201cwant\u201d is quickly dismissed by quoting 2018\u2019s Latin trap hit \u201cTe Bot\u00e9\u201d (I discarded you).\n\nAs Pimienta more firmly grounded herself in her return to the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where Miss Colombia was recorded \u201clive\u201d in rustic settings, her approach evolved from the opulent electronic crafting of La Papessa to something even more sensual and spiritual. The change in scenery helped her closer to her goal of re-contextualizing her music. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to control electronic music,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWhat\u2019s hard about electronic music is to make it sound emotional, make it sound beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe emblematic track \u201cEso Que Tu Haces,\u201d flows with an ethereal mysticism that fuses Lido\u2019s love for traditional porro and slow-building cumbia. Its unique orchestral swirl of wind instruments and synthetic sounds quickly sets the tone for Miss Colombia. On \u201cNada,\u201d she teams up with Bomba Estereo\u2019s Li Samuet, venturing further with her transcendent soprano, crafted with precision and clarity, and driven by sharp-edged metallic beats.\n\nLido clearly remembers the moment when she began her journey as a transnational, cultural mixing experiment as a singer. The brashly dynamic electro-cumbia diva had gone through several phases, starting in her early teens fronting punk and metal bands, and had become obsessed with trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack and Tricky.\n\n\u201cIt was before I moved to Canada, I was in this dance group called Cumb\u00e9 in Colombia,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy cousin was one of the drummers in the group and he told me, \u2018you know you have a really good voice, why would you waste that voice on this depressing music?\u201d\n\nPimienta\u2019s cousin then introduced her to an Afro-Colombian group called Sexteto Tabala, who she later collaborated with on the song \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves\u201d (I Want You To Save Me). Initially formed in 1996, Sexteto Tabal\u00e1 are the cultural heartbeat of Palenque and guardians of Afro-Latin musical history who can swing like a salsa band, groove like a fuji orchestra and serenade you all at the same time. They are one of the most representative musical expressions of the African communities in Colombia.\n\nPimienta credits her time in Sexteto with the development of her singing and overall aesthetic. \u201cThat\u2019s what shaped me, how I learned to have stage control,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because of some bar in Ontario; it was because I was in front of thousands of people singing Afro-Colombian spiritual music.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the flow of Miss Colombia so riveting and rewarding. Structurally it\u2019s bookended by two versions of \u201cPara Transcribir,\u201d one listed as \u201cSol,\u201d (Sun) and the other \u201cLuna\u201d (Moon), a song that tries to come to grips with Pimienta--who is fully bilingual--as a perpetual translator of cultures. The edgy playfulness of her love songs gives way to tracks like \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves,\u201d \u201cPelo Cucu,\u201d which celebrates the symbolic African texture of her hair, and \u201cResisto y Ya,\u201d which makes pointed reference to recent massive Colombian protests against the current government.\n\nWith the latter track, Lido wants to make it clear that while she shares the popular disdain for a \u201cpolitics of division\u201d that squeezes Colombians, she insists that just by being who she is, an Afro-Indigenous, queer feminist, and Canadian outsider, she has always been engaged in resistance. The setting of the recording with Sexteto Tabala in San Basilio de Palenque, a historic town settled by escaped slaves in the 17th century, allows for an expression of healing through traditional culture. \u201cThe chance has arrived/To fix our past,\u201d she sings hauntingly in the chorus of \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel like Miss Colombia is me really doing it for real,\u201d mused Lido. \u201cLike I feel everything up until this point has been happy accident or a horrible accident. This album has been a beautiful process. It\u2019s a really good representation of where I am now and where I\u2019m ready to go next.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "HANYA ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}]
