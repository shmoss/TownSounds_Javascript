Written largely on the tour that followed 2015\u2019s Short Movie and recorded in Los Angeles with production from Blake Mills, it is at once a distinctive and musically compelling collection of songs, run through with Marling\u2019s fierce intelligence; a keen, beautiful and unparalleled take on womanhood.\n\n\u201cI started out writing it as if a man was writing about a woman,\u201d Marling says. \u201cAnd then I thought it\u2019s not a man, it\u2019s me \u2014 I don\u2019t need to pretend it\u2019s a man to justify the intimacy of the way I\u2019m looking and feeling about women. It\u2019s me looking specifically at women and feeling great empathy towards them and by proxy towards myself.\u201d\n\nThe songs grew out of what Marling regards as \u201ca masculine time\u201d in her life. \u201cA certain time when I\u2019d sort of gone on this trip of abandoning any sexuality,\u201d she says. \u201cNow in retrospect I was hopped up on the times, but I was living in LA, and LA does have an amazing knack for removing sexuality. I found it quite scary; I was scared of what I perceived to be the disappearance of my feminine side. But it gave me an ability to look at women in a different way and consider how I\u2019d been looked at.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect there was a precursor to this strange period of her life \u2014 Short Movie had been concerned with the breaking down of the ego, \u201cAnd then I guess piecing back together an ego you get to see it in all its parts,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd tied in with this was the magical realism of living in LA.\u201d Having spent several years in Los Angeles, Marling now splits her time between the UK and California. \u201cAnd LA makes me feel very different to England,\u201d she says. \u201cNow my love affair with LA is at a point where I don\u2019t really leave my house and all my friends are English. It\u2019s a great place to be, but it\u2019s not an enticing fantastical adventure anymore, and I think the election has brought that home.\u201d\n\nMarling\u2019s exploration of femininity is as broad as it is tender. On tracks such as Wild Once she was interested in the archetype of the wild woman and her unrestrained physicality. \u201cIn the more masculine phase of my life I got really into hiking and bouldering, scrambling up trees or whatever,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd I just hadn\u2019t exercised that part of myself for such a long time, and it was felt fantastic. It touched something that was really sweet and innocent. At a time when I couldn\u2019t really find that center, I was touching on it running through a forest by Big Sur with no shoes on.\u201d\n\nElsewhere she\u2019s looking at \u201cWhat\u2019s been forbidden to me in female relationships in all forms, and at female empathy between each other, and friendships that have been really intense.\u201d On The Valley, for instance, a track she calls \u201ca bit of an English nostalgia trip\u201d she writes about \u201cbroken female friendships, and how that feels to be betrayed or betray a friend or a woman in any way.\u201d\n\nThe nature of female friendship has been a long-standing interest for Marling. \u201cAnd again it\u2019s blurred as you open up the boundaries more,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the falling in love that you experience with friendship is so less defined than romantic or sexual love. I\u2019ve been obsessed with that always I think,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I have sisters maybe, and a mother. And I think because of that there\u2019s a high standard of trust and care that I place on myself and that I feel in my female friends as well \u2014 we have quite a high empathetic standard for each other. So I feel when that\u2019s broken it\u2019s so powerful. And I\u2019m guilty of that in many respects because I\u2019m so absent-minded. Until now I just hadn\u2019t really thought about that being a subject matter for a song, but when I tapped into the sadness of that, or the regret, or the feeling of being on the other side of that, I found that quite a fruitful well of stuff. So there\u2019s a lot of that on this record, that trying to make amends for those sort of broken channels.\u201d\n\nShe also became fascinated by the life of the psychoanalyst Lou Andreas-Salome. \u201cI came across her by accident through a love letter that [Rainer Maria] Rilke wrote,\u201d Marling says. \u201cI was obsessed with Rilke, and he wrote about her being the only tangible thing that he\u2019d ever encountered in his life \u2014 the famous quote is \u2018You alone are real to me\u2019.\u201d Marling read about Andreas-Salome extensively \u2014 from her upbringing in Russia, through her intellectual and romantic relationships with figures such as Paul Ree, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud, her unconsummated marriage to Friedrich Carl Andreas, and her passionate affair with Rilke which led to his Duino elegies.\n\nRather than her relationships with famous male figures it was Andreas-Salome\u2019s own psychoanalytic research that Marling found particularly interesting: \u201cJust before Freud died she wrote him a letter saying \u2018I\u2019ve been doing some research into the feminine psyche and I think you\u2019ve got it completely wrong. Penis envy is an invention of man because women\u2019s sexuality by its nature is internal and self-perpetuating, so there\u2019s no lack of this or need of that. It\u2019s this internal, inherently creative thing without men.\u2019 And Freud wrote to her and said this is amazing and this is true, but he died two months later so it never got published. And that blew my mind. Imagine! It would\u2019ve changed the entire psyche of the western world.\u201d\n\nThese thoughts were shaped further by Marling\u2019s ongoing podcast project Reversal of the Muse which saw her interviewing women from across the music industry \u2014 from famed singers such as Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris to female sound engineers, and guitar shop owners, discussing the nature and shape of female creativity. \u201cI would say that feminine creativity, the feminine part of the brain is in both sexes, but is inherently different to the masculine,\u201d she says, \u201cI had a lot of chats with Blake about how we started playing guitar,\u201d she says, \u201cand he said \u2018I started playing because I wanted to impress girls- though I suspect that was a flippant remark rather than the whole truth. But it worked as an example as that was obviously so different to why I started playing guitar \u2014 that was never in my brain to impress boys; \u201cand for me, playing guitar has always been tied up with my identity, it\u2019s always been involved in myself, rather than enticing people in.\u201d\n\nHaving produced Short Movie herself, Marling decided to enlist Mills as producer for Semper Femina. \u201cI really enjoyed producing but it\u2019s just not my calling,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d love to do it for someone else, but for myself it was too difficult to play both roles. Making the podcasts I discovered I play off the vulnerability of being a solo human being, playing a very vulnerable song in front of a microphone with six people in a control room. It\u2019s a weird dynamic, but it has always worked for me. A lot of songwriters I know can\u2019t bear to be overheard when they\u2019re songwriting, but I quite like it \u2014 I write in venues or dressing rooms when there are eight people in the room. There\u2019s something thrilling and weirdly voyeuristic about it. But I like the idea that it will be heard, and if I\u2019m producing it feels like it might only be heard by me.\u201d\n\nLooking for a producer, and already a fan of his music, she was told that Mills had written a list of people he wanted to work with and that her name was on it. This is not to say recording was always straightforward, and working with a new, male producer brought familiar challenges for Marling. \u201cI think Blake was very sweetly not sure what to do with an English girl,\u201d she says. \u201cIt took a week or two to shake off the very set image of what I was in his mind \u2014 a very romping through the countryside delicate character from Emma. And I\u2019ve had that so many times. And in some ways I\u2019m think you can keep that image of me, but in other ways I have to break it in order to get work done, because it\u2019s a really heavy block between you and what you want to get done. And also because I\u2019d just come from producing a record myself I had to get rid of that idea of delicacy.\u201d\n\nMore than anything on Semper Femina Marling addresses the space between the perceptions and realities of being a woman, the space in which women are not frail but powerful, creative and abundant figures. \u201cWhen I was a teenager in my head you were either this delicate tragedy or you were a muse,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they\u2019re both such horrifyingly subjugated roles. But our culture loves female tragedy. That\u2019s just been so ingrained over and over again, and there haven\u2019t been enough examples of a written alternative. My main focus is re-writing the idea of tragic woman.\u201d\n\nIf Marling sounds galvanized it\u2019s because this album marks a shift in her career. \u201cThe time and the political climate that we live in, we\u2019re coming to a point where there\u2019s no need for this sort of artistic expression that I\u2019ve been a part of,\u201d she says. \u201cInnocent creativity had a little flourish in the last ten years. But also I\u2019m getting older and now I think \u2018What use is that?\u2019 It\u2019s not rooted, not pointed, not political. For me right now I feel like it\u2019s more important that I have a practical use.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Laura Marling"}, {"Address": "158 Ludlow St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "The Swayzees ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9196258.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.987746, 40.72104], "Date": "Mon Apr 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-13", "Genre": "Soul, Surf, Rockabilly, Rock-n-roll", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Pianos", "moreBioInfo": "From surf rock to doo wop, rockabilly to beach music, Patrick & The Swayzees have created a current, yet still wholly nostalgic blend of early rock \u2018n\u2019 roll sounds that bring crowds to their feet from opening to encore.

They say there\u2019s an innate bond between siblings, a relationship is forged that can last a lifetime. Now, take that intuitive understanding and translate it into music; magic can happen. This is exactly the case for the brothers of Lime Cordiale, whom growing up within a creative, musical family on Sydney\u2019s Northern Beaches, it was natural for the pair to make music together.\n\nLime Cordiale express their feelings that people need to break the rules in order to progress, with Oli stating \u201cyou don't have to take the conservative route. You don't need to necessarily plan out your life in your twenties or thirties\u201d. With the brothers compassionate and progressive awareness, the band are focussed on using their love of music to keep Sydney\u2019s music scene alive, along with the support from their surrounding communities and the Australian community as a whole.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the pair are passionate, and overly sensitive to the effect humans have on Australia\u2019s environment after being raised on an island home and in coastal areas while growing up. The band\u2019s vegan lifestyle and plastic free rider may not be to everyone\u2019s tastes, but their response is simply - \u201cfuck \u2018em\u201d.\nIn addition to the hectic schedule and life-band balance, Louis is an avid artist holding regular showcases, but notes that whether he is cutting lino or painting, this side of his life is kept secluded, \u201cLino cutting is a very time-consuming art form, requires a lot of attention and I find myself doing it alone\u201d says Louis. His art form though does cross over to band-life, with Louis designing all album art, posters and merchandise and states that the creative process can take time to think up ideas and sometimes his work can get so out of control he has to go into hiding, but he calls it \u201cmeditative and an escape\u201d and likes the process itself over the end result.\n\nWhen they aren\u2019t busy playing shows, cutting footage for films or designing some form of artwork, Oli and Louis return to their roots, the ocean. Though they love being close to the CBD, sometimes the inner-city pressure means they need to get back to the freedom that the ocean can give, Oli tells \u201cyou can be working in the dirt and grind of the city just behind you, but out there on the waves the world is yours\u201d.\n\nLime Cordiale received no airplay from triple j, FBI or commercial radio with the release of their debut album \u201cPermanent Vacation\u201d in Oct 2017, but this essentially underground band was in no need of the tastemaker radios support. Lime Cordiale were happy touring Australia, brewing a strong following along the way. With the release of their single \u201cDirt Cheap\u201d (Nov \u2013 18) the band exploded to the charts of triple j, then after only 3 short months the single placed #86 on triple j\u2019s infamous Hottest 100 countdown.\n\nIn Feb 2019, Lime Cordiale released their latest single \u201cMoney\u201d to accompany their fast selling tour of the same name. The extensive run of shows includes Melbourne, New Zealand and Sydney, and will continue in April to Tasmania, Adelaide, Western Australia and regional New South Wales. So far selling out every show (bar one) they\u2019ve performed (14/20 sold out) and over 5300+ tickets sold.

She produced her second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, a critical success that included her hit single \"Nothing Compares 2 U,\" a song written by Prince.

Can a song be so intensely personal that it somehow manages to reach beyond itself towards something universal? With this record, Dylan turned the American Songwriter into a definite vocation, a job that\u2019s core responsibility was the nearly impossible task of simply and honestly singing your own story, and somehow mysteriously manage to speak for all of us.\n\nWhile Caroline Spence may not look like one of the road-hardened troubadours of America's past, with the release of Spades & Roses, the young songwriter from Charlottesville Virginia proves she is every bit as serious. Having won numerous songwriting awards from industry mainstays like the Kerrville Folk Festival and American Songwriter Magazine, and garnered nods and admiration from both Miranda Lambert and her fellow writers in the Nashville underground, Caroline has delivered a record to meet the expectation: Quite simply, 11 songs of gorgeous Americana that remind us of why we fell in love with the genre in the first place.\n\nIt\u2019s is a rare but unmistakable authenticity and emotional resonance that can't be faked, all delivered from a voice that somehow manages to be both ethereally pristine and yet profoundly raw and human-- a disarming union of self-assuredness and vulnerability that runs throughout the record. Under the guidance of Producer Neilson Hubbard, \"Spades and Roses\" strips away all of the sonic barriers that might stand between Caroline and her listener, allowing her fragile melodies and first person confessionals to do their work-- reaching out and empathizing, providing a soundtrack to our own hidden stories. Every song on the record--whether pop or meditative, glib or heartbreaking-- asks the essential question of whether or not the listener can recognize himself.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a song like \"Southern Accident,\" a strikingly personal and heartbreaking account of the lingering effects of her parents divorce on her own search for love and commitment, or \"Softball,\" an extended anthemic metaphor for the all-to-real injustices of the gender gap in modern life, Spades and Roses is Caroline's unflinching testimony and reminder as to why songs are important: It\u2019s about paying attention. It's about whether you can take a handful of chords and find those still points of peace and clarity and joy amidst the basic confusion, struggles, and emotional wreckage of our everyday lives.

That 2008 release, with its gorgeously melodic writing and improvising and deft use of indie-rock, electronica and hip-hop elements, established Parks as one of the most gifted and original young voices in jazz. \u201cThis is the natural successor to that record,\u201d says the New York-based artist, 34. \u201cIt\u2019s taking the ideas of that project and doubling down on them\u2014fully committing to that direction.\u201d\n\nLittle Big also marks the recorded debut of the intuitive working group that gives the album its title (and which takes its name from a fantastical novel by John Crowley\u2014a favorite book of Parks and, the pianist notes, Wayne Shorter). Parks handled the production duties, with engineering by Daniel Schlett (whose credits include The War on Drugs and Ghostface Killah). The album was mixed by both Schlett and Grizzly Bear bassist/producer Chris Taylor, the latter of whom Parks met in a Seattle big band at the age of 10. \u201cWe put a lot of time and care into the way this record sounds, and the result\u201d\u2014simultaneously crystalline and warm, postmodern and natural\u2014\u201cmakes me really happy,\u201d Parks adds.\n\nAfter experimenting with various lineups and sessions, Parks landed on three musicians ideally suited for this atmospheric, genre-bending new work. \u201cThis feels like a real band, one that will be around for a while,\u201d he says. Greg Tuohey is the longest-running member, a guitarist who places taste and tone ahead of chops-focused bravado\u2014or, as Parks puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s chasing Miles Davis\u2019 phrasing with Jimi Hendrix\u2019s attitude.\u201d On electric bass is David \u201cDJ\u201d Ginyard Jr., a left-handed player with a distinctively lyrical approach and an aptitude for seeing the bigger musical picture. \u201cHe really understands what the bass does, and he thinks super compositionally,\u201d Parks says, noting how some of Ginyard\u2019s basslines have become integral to the songs. Anchoring the unit is Tommy Crane, a forward-looking, stylistically resourceful drummer who brings both explosive creativity and a producer\u2019s knack for precision. \u201cHe has a very unique ability to internalize and commit to the particular heartbeat of each song,\u201d Parks explains, \u201cbut always with this vital and elastic human element, which is rare to hear in combination with the kinds of grooves we\u2019re exploring.\u201d\n\nTogether they interpret a panoramic set of Parks\u2019 original compositions\u2014from the 21st-century fusion of \u201cKid,\u201d to the odd-metered studio jam \u201cProfessor Strangeweather,\u201d to the trip-hop ambiance and folkish melody of \u201cBells.\u201d The psychedelic \u201cAquarium\u201d\u2014\u201cprobably the sexiest tune on the album,\u201d Parks says, chuckling\u2014conjures up the trippy, sultry neo-soul vibe of Meshell Ndegeocello, before Tuohey offers a solo that channels Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood. \u201cDigital Society\u201d somehow manages to evoke Afrobeat, bluegrass and Aphex Twin. \u201cLilac\u201d is, as Parks describes it, \u201ca solo-piano pop tune.\u201d The leader\u2019s \u201csecret favorite\u201d cut, \u201cDoors Open,\u201d seeks inspiration in late Talk Talk and the \u201cearnestness\u201d of Brian Blade & the Fellowship Band. That closing track is \u201cdefinitely not afraid to go straight for your heart,\u201d Parks says with a laugh.\n\nA prodigal talent raised outside of Seattle, Parks moved with his family to study at the Manhattan School of Music when he was 16. Two years later, on the recommendation of a teacher, NEA Jazz Master Kenny Barron, he was invited to join trumpet great Terence Blanchard\u2019s band. That tenure began the relationship with Blue Note that would yield Invisible Cinema, released when Parks was just 24. In The Guardian, John Fordham called the album \u201ca real independent vision,\u201d adding that \u201cParks is a fast-rising star.\u201d In the September 2008 issue of JazzTimes, Parks was named a \u201cNew Jazz Visionary\u201d alongside current giants like Esperanza Spalding, Robert Glasper and Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah. Over the ensuing decade, Parks certainly made good on that early promise. He was an essential presence in Kurt Rosenwinkel\u2019s band, including on the guitarist\u2019s well-received double album from 2012, Star of Jupiter. As a member of the supergroup James Farm, also featuring saxophonist Joshua Redman, bassist Matt Penman and drummer Eric Harland, Parks put out two celebrated albums on Nonesuch. In 2013 he released his first disc as an ECM Records artist, Arborescence, which DownBeat\u2019s J.D. Considine called \u201ca forest-invoking solo-piano effort marked by wonderfully detailed narratives and a harmonic palette worthy of Ravel.\u201d Find the Way, an ECM trio session with bassist Ben Street and drummer Billy Hart, followed last year and garnered equally enthusiastic reviews.\n\nOn Little Big, Parks taps into the lessons he\u2019s absorbed throughout those far-reaching experiences, while also progressing some of the au courant sounds he investigated on Invisible Cinema. \u201cThis feels like the most personal record I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d he says. What\u2019s more, the album reflects his worldview, an outlook in which optimism and inclusion supersede politics. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot out there right now to protest against, and it feels like it\u2019s the artist\u2019s duty to create music that reckons with the issues of the day. Nonetheless, this is not a protest record. It\u2019s not against anything; it\u2019s much more for something. What we\u2019re aiming to do is blend genres and ideas in an open and fluid way, so that structure and freedom work together to serve the larger concept of the song. It\u2019s a way of working together that feels representative of the kind of world I could imagine many of us might want to live in.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "149 7th St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Margaret Glaspy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8587088.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.991761, 40.673627], "Date": "Wed Apr 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-15", "Genre": "Rock, Indie Rock, Alternative", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "The Bell House", "moreBioInfo": "\u2018Devotion\u2019 is a very different record from the last.

The limitless combined talents of blues harmonica virtuoso and sly, soulful singer Estrin, guitar mastermind Kid Andersen, keyboard wizard Lorenzo Farrell and endlessly creative drummer Derrick \u201cD\u2019Mar\u201d Martin take Estrin\u2019s inventive, original songs to new and unexpected places. On stage, the band\u2019s ability to deliver an unpredictable, no-holds-barred show is unmatched.\n\nNow, Rick Estrin & The Nightcats return with their fourth studio album, Contemporary. With the band kicking everything up a notch, Estrin and the Nightcats explore some different sounds, instrumentation and grooves, while maintaining the trademark Nightcats style. Produced by Andersen and Estrin and recorded at Andersen\u2019s now-famous Greaseland Studio in San Jose, California, Contemporary delivers twelve surprising, wise-cracking, foot-stomping songs, including nine by Estrin (one co-written with Andersen), one each by Andersen and Farrell, and one obscure Bobo Jenkins cover. From the noir-ish romp I\u2019m Running to the hilarious title track to the sardonic Resentment File (co-written with Estrin\u2019s friend of over 50 years, Joe Louis Walker), Contemporary packs a modern blues punch. According to Estrin, \u201cRecording at Greaseland, we all had so much fun and were so relaxed, the genius ideas just started pouring in from all sides. I really expect this record to blow some minds.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Estrin\u2019s celebrated songwriting and spectacular harmonica playing, he and the band are among the most entertaining and colorful showmen around. Estrin\u2019s flashing harmonica solos, quick wit and signature hipster-cool look, Andersen\u2019s off-the-cuff guitar pyrotechnics, Farrell\u2019s mighty organ and piano work and D\u2019Mar\u2019s dynamic drumming bring instant fun to their live performances. \u201cPeople don\u2019t go out to see people who look like themselves,\u201d says Estrin. \u201cThey want to see something special. I was schooled in this business to be a showman, and that\u2019s what you get when you come to see us perform. We know how to put on a show. I feel sorry for anyone who has to follow us.\u201d\n\nEstrin was schooled by some of the very best blues musicians. While still a teen, he was tutored by San Francisco\u2019s famous musician (and pimp) Fillmore Slim. He was mentored by Oakland\u2019s legendary Rodger Collins, and gigged with blues stars Lowell Fulson and Z.Z. Hill. Estrin moved to Chicago when he was 19 to work with Windy City bluesmen Johnny Young, Eddie Taylor, Sam Lay and John Littlejohn, and even jammed with Muddy Waters. He returned to California and continued to hone his craft. By the time he joined forces with guitarist Little Charlie Baty and formed Little Charlie & The Nightcats in 1976\u2014a band he would front for the next 30 years\u2014Estrin was a seasoned performer with plenty of talent and a newfound knack for writing killer original songs.\n\nUpon Baty\u2019s retirement from touring in 2008, Estrin recruited high-flying guitar wunderkind Christoffer \u201cKid\u201d Andersen and formed Rick Estrin & The Nightcats. The band quickly became a worldwide favorite with blues fans as well as critics and radio programmers. \u201cKid\u2019s a fearless nut on the guitar,\u201d says Estrin. \u201cHe\u2019s really the only guy who could fit in with us.\u201d With an uninhibited style that perfectly meshed with Estrin\u2019s wildly imaginative songs, the new band charged out of the gate. Billboard called them \u201cfabulous, remarkable and original.\u201d\n\nSince the 2009 release of Rick Estrin & The Nightcats\u2019 celebrated Alligator Records debut, Twisted, the 2012 follow-up One Wrong Turn, 2014\u2019s crowd-pleasing You Asked For It...Live!, and 2017\u2019s Groovin\u2019 In Greaseland, the band has toured the world, earning high praise and standing ovations everywhere they go. The Chicago Sun-Times said, \u201cThese are serious musicians having a hotter than hot good time. It\u2019s tough to stay in your seat when Estrin and his musical cohorts get cooking.\u201d They\u2019ve performed at festivals and concert stages from San Francisco to Chicago to New York, and everywhere in between, plus tours of the United Kingdom, Norway, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Poland, Australia, Israel and recently Estonia and Russia. The band\u2019s worldwide popularity helped Estrin win five Blues Music Awards, including two nods for Song Of The Year (1994 and 2018), Best Instrumentalist\u2014Harmonica (2013) and Traditional Blues Male Artist Of The Year (2018). The full band, Rick Estrin & The Nightcats, won the highly coveted 2018 Blues Music Award for Band Of The Year.\n\nAccording to Estrin, \u201cContemporary is the most fully realized expression of who Rick Estrin & The Nightcats really are and what we\u2019re capable of as a band. With the group\u2019s help, everything I envisioned for the songs got turned up a notch, with everyone getting more and more inspired.\u201d This is modern blues at its most potent and powerful, with phenomenal musicianship and lyrics that cut with a wink and nod. According to the UK\u2019s Blues & Rhythm, \u201cRick Estrin & The Nightcats have crafted an instantly identifiable sound. They serve up insightful, original blues combined with tough rock\u2019n\u2019 roll. This band is superb.\u201d\n\nRick Estrin (harmonica, vocals)\nRick Estrin was born in San Francisco, California in 1949, and grew up fiercely independent. As a 10-year-old boy, he made his way to the tough Market Street area and befriended many of the neighborhood characters. When he was 12, his older sister gave him a copy of Ray Charles\u2019 The Genius Sings The Blues, and he became infatuated with the music. Albums from Jimmy Reed, Champion Jack Dupree, Mose Allison, Nina Simone and others soon followed. By the time he was a teenager, Estrin had immersed himself in the urban, African-American culture surrounding him. He got his first harmonica at age 15, and by age 18 was proficient enough to begin sitting in at black clubs around the city. He first jammed with blues master Lowell Fulson and immediately was hired to open five shows for R&B giant Z.Z. Hill. He worked five nights a week for almost a year with guitar legend Travis Phillips in a band fronted by famed pimp/bluesman Fillmore Slim (who was the centerpiece of the acclaimed Hughes Brothers documentary American Pimp). Slim introduced Estrin to singer Rodger Collins, the man who would become Rick\u2019s first real musical mentor. Collins schooled Rick on the finer points of songwriting and show business. At 19, Estrin relocated to Chicago and worked with some of the city\u2019s best bluesmen. He met and jammed with the legendary Muddy Waters, who told Rick, \u201cYou outta sight, boy! You got that sound! You play like a man!\u201d Muddy wanted Estrin to go on the road with him, but Estrin missed Muddy\u2019s phone call and it never happened. Estrin eventually moved back to the Bay Area, met guitarist Charlie Baty and formed Little Charlie & The Nightcats. With Charlie\u2019s retirement from touring in 2008, Rick brought in guitar virtuoso Kid Andersen and formed Rick Estrin & The Nightcats.\n\nEstrin cites Sonny Boy Williamson II, Percy Mayfield and Detroit bluesman Baby Boy Warren as his major songwriting influences. His work on the reeds is deep in the tradition of harmonica masters Sonny Boy Williamson II and Little Walter Jacobs, while at the same time pushing that tradition forward with his innovative songs. And his sly and soulful vocals are the perfect vehicle for driving those songs home.\n\nKid Andersen (guitar)\nChristoffer \u201cKid\u201d Andersen was born in Telemark, Norway. A blues fan since childhood, Andersen fell in love with the music of Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, Junior Watson, and the Kings (B.B., Albert and Freddie). By the time he was 18, he was backing all the American blues stars who came through Norway, including Homesick James, Nappy Brown and Willie \u201cBig Eyes\u201d Smith. He moved to California when he was 21. Once in the U.S.A., Andersen earned a green card as an \u201cAlien of Extraordinary Ability.\u201d Andersen released four solo albums before joining blues harmonica legend Charlie Musselwhite\u2019s band in 2004, a gig that lasted until he joined Rick Estrin & The Nightcats in 2008. In addition to being an expert multi-instrumentalist (guitar, bass, keyboards, percussion), Kid\u2019s talents as engineer and producer keep his now-famous Greaseland Studio fully booked. Winner of the 2017 Keeping The Blues Alive Award, Greaseland has been featured in The San Jose Mercury News as well as on NPR. At Greaseland, Kid has produced, engineered (and many times played on) albums by artists including Tommy Castro, Nick Moss, John Nemeth, Wee Willie Walker and Finis Tasby, as well as all five Rick Estrin & The Nightcats CDs.\n\nLorenzo Farrell (piano, organ)\nLorenzo Farrell was born in Lexington, Kentucky, and grew up in Bloomington, Indiana, where he started playing piano at age five. During his high school years in California, he discovered jazz and made the switch to upright acoustic bass. After high school, Farrell took several years off from his music career to earn a degree in Philosophy from the University of California at Berkeley, and study religion in Delhi, India. Since returning to the San Francisco Bay Area, he has been a highly sought-after multi-instrumentalist, having returned to piano and mastered the organ in recent years. A Nightcat since 2003, Lorenzo has also had the opportunity to perform and/or record with many other artists, including Wee Willie Walker, Elvin Bishop, Finis Tasby, Jackie Payne, Andy Santana, Terry Hanck and Little Charlie Baty\u2019s Organ Grinder Swing.\n\nDerrick \u201cD\u2019Mar\u201d Martin (drums)\nDerrick \u201cD\u2019Mar\u201d Martin is simply a force of nature. D\u2019Mar is a musician, producer, songwriter, singer, educator, entertainer and motivational speaker. He traveled the world for 17 years as the drummer for the legendary Little Richard. D\u2019Mar has also worked with a number of other artists including Dorothy Moore, Bobby Rush, Vasti Jackson, Ali Ollie Woodson (The Temptations), Big Jack Johnson, Carla Thomas, Billy Preston, Roy Gaines, Mitch Woods, Jackie Payne, Syl Johnson, Bob Margolin and Tutu Jones.

He\u2019s traveled the world, played stages in historic clubs, in massive stadiums and at cultural landmarks, recorded a solo album, appeared on national television and performed for two sitting U.S. presidents.\n\nHis collaborations range from pop idols to jazz legends, and the list reads like a lineup for the best New Orleans Jazz Fest ever. He\u2019s worked with Stevie Wonder, Quincy Jones, Alicia Keys, The Jonas Brothers, Wyclef Jean, Justin Bieber, Diddy, Natalie Cole, James Ingram, Wynton Marsalis, Ravi Coltrane, Chris Botti along with many, many more. (See Artists.) And to think\u2026 so little of that might have been possible if he\u2019d gotten his wish 21 years ago.\n\nWhen the music teacher at Seattle\u2019s Sacajawea Elementary School led a musical instrument presentation for 4th graders in the school library, young Jumaane, then 9 years old, was immediately drawn to the French Horn and asked to play the instrument. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take this instead,\u201d she replied, explaining that the school had no French Horns. Jumaane \u201csettled\u201d for the trumpet and his life was never the same.\n\nIt took some time to build a foundation. \u201cFor the first few years I was horrible,\u201d he admits, \u201cand when I would practice, my mom would make me go outside in the yard because she didn\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d But Jumaane was a quick learner and a voracious student. From his earliest experiences, he established a career-long aptitude toward absorbing anything that would make him a better musician and person.\n\nBy 16, while most kids are content with getting a driver\u2019s license, Jumaane was on a plane for the first time headed to Europe. As a member of the Roosevelt High School Jazz Band under the direction of Scott Brown, he spent three weeks performing at such events as the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland and the North Sea Jazz Festival in Den Hague. He was also able to see many jazz greats in concert. The tour was a defining experience. After that, Jumaane recalls, \u201cI was hooked on music and becoming a great musician myself.\u201d Back in the States, thirsty for more knowledge (and the rush of adventure), he started sneaking backstage at shows to talk to musicians, soaking in an extracurricular education of his own design.\n\nOnly a few years later, Jumaane was living in New York, attending New School University on scholarship. Classrooms were his secondary education as New York\u2019s many Jazz clubs offered a live and lively education. He made connections in the jazz scene by catching shows and performing at jam sessions.\n\nWhile Jumaane was headlining his first gig in New York City he met legendary jazz drummer Rashied Ali, who happened to live a few blocks from the club. Mentored by the great John Coltrane, Rashied in turn became Jumaane\u2019s mentor and a true father figure to the young musician and man. Ali kept him grounded, but taught him to accept the boundless potential of music. He coached him to acquire as much knowledge as he could, but to research and come to his own conclusions rather than take anything at face value. They were great lessons from a great man.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t long before another legendary jazz musician would mentor this budding talent. Jumaane was still living in Seattle when he first met Wynton Marsalis. In fact, it was Marsalis who first recommended that he make the big move to the Big Apple. Now, a year into living in New York City, Jumaane was one of 17 musicians (including only 4 trumpeters) invited to join the inaugural class of Jazz Studies at Julliard \u2013 a program developed by Marsalis.\n\nSuddenly the classroom was the place to be. Jumaane immersed himself in trumpet technique, classical repertoire, jazz technique and jazz repertoire, orchestration and arranging from both classical and jazz perspectives, music production, music preparation and even music software notation. Meanwhile, Marsalis took him (and only one other student) on for one-on-one private trumpet instruction through Jazz Studies at Juilliard, a practice he hasn\u2019t engaged in since. That relationship had a profound effect on Jumaane. \u201cWynton is probably the most disciplined person I\u2019ve ever gotten the chance to be around and learn from,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel very fortunate to have him as a mentor to this day.\u201d\n\nGood fortune is only a small part of it, however. Jumaane, by nature recognizes and seeks opportunity. More than that, he strives constantly to earn it. Even before he graduated from Julliard\u2019s four-year curriculum, his hard work paid off with some great professional opportunities.\n\nIn 2002, Marsalis awarded him a scholarship to attend the Academy of Achievement Summit in Dublin, Ireland. The attendees were some of the greatest thinkers alive: world leaders such as Gorbachev and Bill Clinton, Hollywood giants such as James Earl Jones, Nobel Prize winners. Asked the night before the event\u2019s gala finale, Jumaane and a fellow student performed a duet for the event under pressure with no repertoire prepared, \u201copening\u201d for Chuck Berry. One year later, as February was being declared African-American Music Month, Jumaane and the Jazz Museum in Harlem All-Stars performed for George W. Bush in the East Room of the White House.\n\nIn 2005, thanks to the recommendation of a Julliard classmate, Jumaane was invited to audition for Michael Bubl\u00e9\u2019s band. Almost seven years later, Jumaane continues to perform, record, travel and learn as a part of the Bubl\u00e9 family. \u201cThe experience has been what I imagine post-graduate school to be like,\u201d he says. \u201cMichael Bubl\u00e9 is a wonderfully humble, down to earth and extremely generous person who thrives off of his family and friends realizing their own hopes, dreams and goals. It has been truly inspirational working with him.\u201d\n\nFrom touring the world with Bubl\u00e9 to playing the Grammy Awards show with Stevie Wonder and the Jonas Brothers to recording \u201cAs I Am\u201d with Alicia Keys to appearing on the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d soundtrack to scoring and performing music for the film \u201cHandsome Harry,\u201d Jumaane\u2019s accomplishments go on and on. The recordings he\u2019s appeared on have sold more than 25 million copies worldwide, garnered four Grammy nominations and earned three Grammy wins. The TV shows he\u2019s appeared on total an audience of around 100 million viewers.\n\nJumaane has relished, with gratitude, every experience he\u2019s had as a musician, and intends to embrace new opportunities to work with amazing talents. But finally, after years of conceptualizing, the time has come to take a big step forward into the spotlight, to turn his own ideas into reality. In 2010, he entered the studio to begin work on his debut album, \u201cI Only Have Eyes For You.\u201d A celebration of the Great American Songbook with the theme of love and romance, the album includes interpretations of classic tunes full of personal emotion and meaning for Jumaane.\n\n\u201cI imagine that it is very rewarding to see your own project become successful,\u201d he says. \u201cAs the leader, you get back what you put into it.\u201d Now only time will tell how a lifetime of learning and all-star mentorship will pay off.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "289 10th Ave St, New York, NY 10001", "Artist": "DJ Politik ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8635854.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.002675, 40.750051], "Date": "Wed Apr 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-15", "Genre": "Hip Hop, Edm", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Marquee New York", "moreBioInfo": "DJ Politik cut his teeth in the L.A. nightlife scene by sneaking into exclusive Hollywood nightclubs while still in high school.

Usually, when we cannot deal with pollution ourselves, when the dimensions of the product do not allow us to wash it in a machine (carpets are so accurate), and also when the cut and weaving are so complicated that it will be almost impossible to smooth them after an independent washing.\n\nDry cleaning of carpets and upholstered furniture solves two main problems:\n\nIt does not change the shape of the product;\nShe does not crumple it, so there is no need to smooth it.\nIn addition, water can have a negative effect on some types of stains, and instead of removing them, you get only stains.\n\nDry cleaning of furniture and textiles got its name due to the type of cleaner used. Its composition is similar to ordinary powder, but in reality it consists of a huge number of micro-sponges soaked in a cleaning agent. As a result, contaminants of any origin, starting from oily stains and ending with street-household stains, are easily removed from the surface of the fabric.\n\nThe price of dry cleaning is slightly higher than wet, due to the need to use powerful equipment and expensive cleaning products. At the same time, it allows you to remove dirt as delicately as possible without harming the shape, color and durability of the product.\n\nDry cleaning is suitable for luxury furniture, expensive carpets and textiles.\n\nCleaning after disinfestation. Features and nuances\nInsects and pests are a very unpleasant thing in itself. And after disinsection, you can still find them in a dead form for a long time throughout the room. The simplest and most correct solution in such a situation is to conduct a comprehensive cleaning or order the services of a professional cleaning company.\n\nWhat should be done:\n\nWipe with a damp cloth all exposed surfaces in the room, on which particles of insecticidal preparations could remain;\nVacuum the carpet and carpets with a powerful washing vacuum cleaner using deep cleaning products;\nWash or dry-clean all textile items, including bedding, curtains, curtains, covers for upholstered furniture, etc.;\nWash dishes, ceramics, indoor plants and other interior items that were not taken out during disinfestation.\nBut there are some nuances like showed on https://bestcleaneradviser.com. Firstly, if cleaning is carried out immediately after the destruction of insects, then not all places can be processed. Since insecticidal preparations have a prolonged effect, that is, they continue to kill parasites for several days after spraying, it is better not to touch the places where insect egg clutches were found for some time.\n\nSecondly, it is better to completely abandon the use of folk remedies. No matter how reliable you consider the folk method of cleaning, it will not help you get rid of the remnants of aggressive chemistry. As a matter of fact, pest controllers treat the room with poison, so it is unlikely that you can remove it qualitatively using, say, a solution of water with baking soda.\n\nCleaning after disinfestation requires care, accuracy and willingness to pay attention to detail. If you doubt that you can do everything right, it is better not to expose yourself to unnecessary risk and order a professional cleaning immediately after the persecution of insects."}, {"Address": "66 North 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Lime Cordiale ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9055034.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.96168, 40.71925], "Date": "Thu Apr 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-16", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Music Hall of Williamsburg", "moreBioInfo": "Hailing from Sydney\u2019s northern beaches, brothers Oli and Louis Leimbach of Lime Cordiale command legions of dedicated fans with their incredible live set.

That\u2019s the way Texas native Lance Kotara and Colorado belle LeAnna Kaufman live their lives. It was no surprise the two songwriters would find each other in Nashville.

Right away we knew we were onto something special.\u201d\nOn a typical day, you can find the duo in their home studio, writing and laying down a new track.

We\u2019ve honed our craft, and every day we learn something new.\u201d Marked by heart pounding harmonies, prominent guitars, and emotional lyrics and melodies, their collaborative genius is on fire, with over 200 songs already penned. And they were right. It was worth it. In 2016 the duo signed with Nashville\u2019s Number One Group, and their first album with producer Paul Worley is scheduled for release in mid-2017. Their music is making the rounds internationally, garnering airplay in the UK, Ireland, and in Music City, Nashville Tennessee.\nLance knew he wanted to be a musician at a young age. \u201cMusic has been my passion since I started playing the guitar at thirteen,\u201d he said. Growing up in the small town of Beeville, Texas, he saw music as self-expression, and once he started, he couldn\u2019t stop. The desire to play brought Lance to Austin, where he formed a band and played the live scene, sharing the stage with influencers like Snow Patrol, Jars of Clay, and even Vince Neil of Motley Crue. Lance found a love for songwriting and relocated to Nashville to hone those skills and make a name for himself. He was lucky enough to land a major label single with country artist Laura Bell Bundy, and have a song in the 2016 Share a Song/Share a Coke campaign.\nLea says her love for music grew from her days singing alongside her sisters in church. \u201cI was born into an Amish family, and though music wasn\u2019t encouraged, I always dreamed of having my own guitar and singing on stage.\u201d The loss of her father pushed that desire. \u201cDeath has a way of changing your reality and altering your perception on life. It wasn\u2019t until my Dad passed away that I picked up the guitar and started writing my own songs. The first song I ever wrote was about him.\u201d Songwriting opened up a new outlet for creative expression for Lea. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t long before I found myself in Nashville working alongside producer/songwriter Wayne Wilkins, who\u2019s worked with Natasha Bedingfield and Beyonc\u00e9, and since then, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to record with some of Nashville\u2019s finest musicians.\u201d\nThe duo hasn\u2019t forgotten their past but uses the present for inspiration.

Sadly, I attempted violin as a young child and was brutally bad. My parents had some how had me listening to classical music at that time which probably explains the violin attempt. Then a miracle happened\u2026First, the Beatles arrived so, bye bye classical & then my aunt who was buying a new piano (the wealthier end of the family) offered me her old one. I\u2019m 8 1/2 so I was still agreeable to anything so I promised to take lessons and really work at it.\nI lied\u2026After a year and a half I quit\u2026..until I discovered Elton John. That was it! I was determined to be a musician. In the late 70\u2019s I joined a fairly succesful 50\u2019s/60\u2019s band called Slick. I played 6 nights a week and worked full time at a department store as a stock man (person in this politically correct universe). Exhaustion wasn\u2019t considered. I went to gigs with a thermos of tea and lemon since I was always sick. This lasted until the early 80\u2019s. I joined a band called Loose Change which (under my direction) played anything from the 1960\u2019s- whatever was current. That lasted 12 years. Many years of putting my ears in harms way and breathing in way to much bar smoke told me it was time to quit. This was somewhere around 1993/94 (I don\u2019t remember). The next time I played live was in 2004 at my local block party. That\u2019s what I needed to get the itch to play again but, I was working in retail at Sam Ash Music and simply had no time to gig. In 2007 I was offered a better job which offered me a 9-5 existence. The economy turned sour and earning extra cash became a priority. And then it happened\u2026.I walked into a local Italian restaurant called Vera\u2019s Trattoria to pick up a pizza and lo and behold (fancy words ehh?) a piano player was pumping out Jazz licks. Can you imagine? Live music! I decided to approach the owner to see if I could score a gig. He decided to try me the following week. I was hired as a permanent fixture on Saturday nights. Thus The Richie G Review was born. \u201cA one man band Piano/vocals using backing tracks and a voice harmonizer to create a full band sound. My current song list represents over seventy artists including Elton John, Billy Joel , James Taylor, The Beatles and hits from the 1960\u2019s thru today. Over 500 tunes and counting\u2013 Booking email onemanbandrichieg@gmail.com .\u201d I played at Vera\u2019s for 14 months and then a new owner took over. He decided that entertainment was unnecessary. I got to work recording a CD of covers and creating business cards. The hard work paid off! I\u2019m a permanent Wednesday night fixture at the Woodcliff lake Hilton as well as sprinkling in various weekend gigs.\nRidgewood Street Fair 2013-2014\n\n392561_413258562028352_398683286819213_1318553_160572558_nRIDGEWOOD\n\nChapter 2- Ginger Martini was Born Right around St Patty\u2019s Day of 2012, I was performing at the Elm Street Grill in Oakland NJ. I was approached by my soon to be partner Wendy Kelly. I was on the floor wiring up my equipment as she, asked me questions about what I do (kind of music, etc). I was excited believing that I was going to be hired for a private party. During the break, she handed me her card.It turned out she was interested in joining me. I wasn\u2019t looking but, I agreed to see what she sounded like at my rehearsal space (haha my basement). Three songs later I was convinced. We sounded great together.

O'Connor ranked among the most distinctive and controversial popular music stars of the 1990s, the first and in many ways the most influential of the numerous female performers whose music dominated airwaves throughout the decade. Her first album, The Lion and The Cobra, was released in 1987, and its popular and critical acclaim made her a star of pop music. She produced her second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, a critical success that included her hit single \"Nothing Compares 2 U,\" a song written by Prince. O'Connor was as well-known for her political beliefs as for her music (she once shredded a photo of Pope John Paul II on U.S. television), but in recent years she has been less publicly controversial. In 2003 she announced her retirement from the music business. In 2000 released her album \"Faith and Courage\". Another album, Throw Down Your Arms was released in 2005.

Armed with blazing, every-note-matters guitar skills and scores of instantly memorable original songs, Ellis has traveled enough miles, he says, \"to get to the moon and back six times.\" He's released 17 previous solo albums, and has earned his place at the top of the blues-rock world. When asked if he'd consider himself a \"blue-collar\" bluesman, Ellis, in his trademark wit, quips, \"No. I'm part of the no-collar crowd.\" His imaginative songs tell stories of common, shared experiences in uncommon ways, all fueled by his high-octane, infectious, hard-rocking guitar playing. Live, Ellis has captivated and amazed fans in all 50 United States, as well as in Canada, all across Europe, Australia and South America. Vintage Guitar says, \"He delivers blistering blues-rock, soul romps, minor-key blues, and shuffles\u2014and it all sounds great.\" The Chicago Sun-Times says, \"It's hard to overstate the raw power of his music.\"\n\nEllis considers his new album, Ice Cream In Hell, the most raw-sounding, guitar-drenched album of his career. Recorded in Nashville and produced by Ellis and his longtime co-producer Kevin McKendree (John Hiatt, Delbert McClinton), Ice Cream In Hell is a cathartic blast of blues-rock power. Though inspired by all three Kings (B.B., Albert and Freddie), as well by Carlos Santana, Hound Dog Taylor and others, Ice Cream In Hell is pure, unadulterated Tinsley Ellis. The 11 Ellis originals range from the nod to Stax-era Albert King, Last One To Know, to the Peter Green-flavored Everything And Everyone to the Hound Dog Taylor-esqe romp Sit Tight Mama before ending with the hair-raising, slow-burning ballad, Your Love's Like Heroin.

He began studying the piano at the age of eight, and five years later switched to electric guitar. He soon discovered his passion for improvisation and jazz, and during his high school years he began to travel regularly to Tel Aviv to study with Israel\u2019s leading musicians, and to participate in workshops and master classes. At the age of 16 he started performing professionally with jazz bands around the country and leading several projects with his original music. At 19, Yuval wrote an original composition for his hometown\u2019s string quartet and for the renowned Oud and Violin player Yair Dalal. His music was selected by one of Israel\u2019s leading composers and music educators Michael Wolpe, and was performed in concert halls across Israel. Soon afterwards he started studying at The Jerusalem Academy of Music and the Rimon Jazz School in Tel Aviv and participated in various musical projects. In 2005 Yuval moved to Paris. He quickly made his way into the local jazz scene and started playing in Paris clubs and venues. The following year he studied at the Jazz department of the Paris Region Conservatory, graduating two years later. Since 2008 Yuval leads his quintet, the Yuval Amihai Ensemble, with whom he performs music which is strongly influenced by his childhood in Israel. The ensemble has won numerous awards, including the Grand Prize and the 1st composition prize at the \"La D\u00e9fense\" National Jazz Competition in 2009, The 1st prize in the Saint-Germain Jazz festival Contest in Paris (2008), and the 3rd prize in the international jazz competition of Hoeilaart, Belgium.

While meticulously constructed, they also at times involve the freedom of improvisation. The new album was released on February 2013 by Soundbrush Records.\nHe has written music for orchestra, chamber ensembles, string quartet, choir, and solo instruments as piano, violin and cello, being many of his compositions commissioned and premiered by performers like the Kronos Quartet\n-like \"The Cherry Tree\". premiered in Carnegie Hall in February 2008- and the Imani Winds ensemble. Among his recent works he wrote a Solo Violin sonata for Nick Danielson, Solo Piano Works for Krisztina Wajsza, a Cello Concerto for Inbal Segev, piano trios for the Ahn Trio, and an album for two pianos performed by himself and Yana Reznik.\nDue to the nature of his compositions and performance, he was embraced by both New York classical and jazz scenes. He has performed with legendary bassist Eddie Gomez (who introduced Otero as one of the pianists of the new generation) , flautist Dave Valentin, the Arturo O\u2019Farrill Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra, and was featured in the Grammy Award-winning album Funk Tango by reed maestro Paquito D\u2019Rivera, with whom he has also performed at Birdland, Blue Note, and the Caramoor Classical Music Festival.

His brilliant playing bore traces of jazz pianists like Bill Evans and Don Pullen. The resulting synthesis proposed bold new directions for a venerable tradition.\n\"Mr. Otero, a resourceful pianist and composer from Buenos Aires, recently released a darkly ravishing album with the plain but connotative title of \u201cRomance\u201d (Soundbrush).

The expressive drama of tango generally animates his compositions, which also involve aspects of classical chamber music and jazz improvisation.\"Beginning with \"El Circulo Rojo,\" which appears on both recent albums, Mr. Danielson and Mr. Otero locked in tightly, playing a compact melody in sync and then spiraling outward to set up some counterpoint. During one passage in the piece, and on a brisk subsequent composition, there was a faint echo of the dynamic that existed between the pianist Chick Corea and the violinist Jean-Luc Ponty some 30 years ago\u2026\" Nate Chinen, New York Times, February 2008\n\"Otero is a seriously talented pianist, and his orchestrations are equal parts Bernard Hermann and Charlie Parker.

I loved Sergio Mendes\u2019 songs, liked John Hartford on the Glenn Campbell Show and really got into James Taylor and Joni Mitchell who I still consider my two main influences. I also loved the singer-songwriters of the time including Carole King and Laura Nyro and later fell in love with Steely Dan\u2019s music, and just wore out my copy of Hubert Laws\u2019 Rite Of Spring. I was completely self-taught, by llistening to records and playing them over and over, teaching myself tablature from a great James Taylor book and modal tunings from Joni Mitchell\u2019s For The Roses song book. I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit.

The duo steadily made a name for themselves, especially with two of their signature tracks, \u201cVineyard\u201d and their version of the classic \u201cPlease Come to Boston.\u201d They released ten studio albums (two for major label A&M), toured three continents, nine countries, and 45 states - amassing millions of loyal fans along the way . Over the years They have shared the stage with John Mayer, Dave Matthews Band, Matchbox20, Counting Crows, The Wallflowers, Sheryl Crow, Toad the Wet Sprocket - to name a few. After a five-year breakup, the guys reunited in 2002 to test out the waters. They were very warm and city by city, Jack & Cary got back out there to play for grateful fans that thought they would never see them again. The two now have a totally renewed creative vigor, mutual respect and deep gratitude for their fans.\n\nThese good vibes shine through on their 25th anniversary live album \u201cLive 25.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s definitely been a creative time for the duo, and celebrating the past inspires the guys to move forward in new, inventive ways. To freshen up the live show, Jackopierce started creating uniquely intimate \u201cDestination Shows.\u201d These shows are a whole new fan experience where people can enjoy gorgeous scenery, share delicious food & wine and have \u201ccampfire\u201d-type access to their favorite band. It\u2019s a vacation and concert in one. Each Destination Show provides a unique experience dedicated to the local culture: Napa/Sonoma vineyards at sunset, a ranch in Austin Hill Country, high society in Dallas, a two-mile-high a private club in Aspen, amazing history at the Biltmore in NC, a 14,000 square foot hacienda in San Miguel de Allende, MX - and the list goes on. July 27, Jackopierce will host their first 7th Destination Show in Martha\u2019s Vineyard and they\u2019ll be back for their fourth annual Destination Show in San Miguel in April 2020.\n\n\u201cWe have been doing destination events for 10 years now and they have been a huge hit with our fans and have allowed us to make so many great new ones along the way,\u201d said Cary Pierce. \u201cI think these events continue to grow and sell out because people want more than \"just a show\u201d - they want an experience. They want to create lasting memories, explore a new place or visit an old favorite. In some cases, we're offering them a trip of a lifetime.
