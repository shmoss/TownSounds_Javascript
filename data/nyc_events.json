The secret of this success lies within 2 basic characteristics: 1) an amazing roster of musicians and 2) Brian's ideals of having fun with the audience instead of performing to the audience. As other bands come and go, Brian Kirk & The Jirks continually set the standard with tons of experience while thinking outside of the box.\n\nBehind the flashing lights, photoshopped pictures, and fashion trends lies the foundation of live shows: good music. This is where The Jirks shine. Brian has enlisted an all star cast of musicians that play with maturity, originality, accuracy, and pure love of the art form. Along with Brian is the incredible singing of David Pershan & Kristin Grassi and backed by thick vocal harmonies and multiple instrumentation including a 3 piece horn section. BK&J have the ability to play an extremely diverse repertoire of songs complete with killer solos and great groove. This allows the band to walk into virtually any situation and play what's needed, whether it be rock, funk, pop, hip hop, swing, jazz, oldies, or modern songs. Whatever the style, Brian Kirk & The Jirks play it and play it well!\n\nOn top of this musical foundation is a weapon no one else has: Brian Kirk himself! With his hilarious antics and infectious personality, Brian has been gaining fans for almost 20 years! Constant audience interaction is what it's all about with him and this sets Brian apart from most front men. Another unique technique he uses is not writing a set list. Instead Brian calls songs based on the crowd in front of him and more importantly from requests he gets. Fans are treated more like friends and not just spectators. The audience is part of the show and this allows a stronger bond between the band and its fans.\n\nThe diversity, originality, and basic know how of such a seasoned band makes Brian Kirk & The Jirks the ideal band for clubs, weddings, corporate/private functions, or any other situation where you need a fun band to throw a great time!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "140 Stewart Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Megan Thee Stallion", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9196776.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.926398, 40.710569], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Avant Gardner", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Tunnel Reunion Party featuring: Megan Thee Stallion & FUNKFLEX"}, {"Address": "80 N 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249", "Artist": "Zo\u00eb Keating", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9501503.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.961212, 40.718958], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "Genres: Avant-Garde, Post-Rock, Classical Crossover, Instrumental, Minimalism", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "National Sawdust", "moreBioInfo": "Cellist and composer Zo\u00eb Keating is known for both her use of technology - which she uses to sample her cello onstage - and for her DIY approach, releasing her music direct to fans without the help of a record label.\n\n\"Swoon-inducing.

All my father really told me was to do the best I could do with my own style.\"\n\nFor The Desperate Kingdom of Love, C.J. reached back into his father's songbook and recorded a collection of some of the most urgent and heartfelt songs of his career, including \"Bogalusa Boogie\", a tribute to the Clarence Gatemouth Brown, the revered blues legend who died only days after Hurricane Katrina destroyed his home. A eclectic mix of covers like Hank Williams' \"Lost on the River\" and the devastating P.J. Harvey ballad \"The Desperate Kingdom of Love\" add to the somber canvas while Van Morrison's \"Comfort You\" offers healing. But a C.J. Chenier recording, like a traditional New Orlean's funeral, would not be complete without a tremor of hope for the future and a few great dance tunes. C.J. composed several classic songs (with Denise Labrie and Gerard Chenier) for the album including the plaintive \"I've Been Good To You Baby\" and the swinging mea culpa \"Who's Cheatin' Who?\"\n\nInspired by Bob Dylan's 1960's collaboration with The Band, C.J. Chenier sought out an existing working band to back him during these sessions. Rounder Records recording artists The Tarbox Ramblers fit the bill with a combination of tight musical camaraderie from years of touring and a deep knowledge of American roots music history. Augmented by session pianist Joe Deleault, the musicians quickly rehearsed and recorded these songs in the cavernous Room A of Boston's Q Division Studios in the autumn of 2005. Inspired by the 1950's Rudy Van Gelder jazz recordings for Blue Note, and Zydeco albums of Clifton Chenier, the songs were recorded live with everyone playing together in the studio with minimal overdubs.\n\nAside from performing and recording with his own ensemble, C.J. has worked with an impressive array of collaborators, including Paul Simon and The Gin Blossoms. A self-described \"road dog\", C.J. will be touring extensively in North America for 2010.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "572 Cookman Ave, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "flor", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9109888.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00952, 40.21622], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "House Of Independents", "moreBioInfo": "flor draw fearlessness from the strength of their union as friends and bandmates, a D.I.Y. journey, and shared willingness to bring bold pop ambition to alternative music.

Coming from what he describes as a \u201cregular kind of neighborhood\u201d, Bilal was first introduced to music when he attended a small local church. The congregation, made up of mostly family members, became his foremost musical outlet. In his later years, Bilal\u2019s father introduced him to the jazz clubs around the city. It wasn\u2019t until Bilal attended the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts that he really started taking his music seriously, realizing this was the direction he wanted to go with his life. While at the school, Bilal, along with his peers, began to experiment with songwriting and became completely enamored with Jazz. \u201cI wanted to sing Jazz, play Jazz, and write Jazz tunes.\u201d The effect of being immersed into a creative, music infused environment caused the young Bilal to interpret his voice as an instrument especially in the songs he began to write.\n\nAfter high school, Bilal was accepted to the New School for Social Research, a prestigious avant-garde university in New York. While there, he studied Jazz and continued to develop his affinity for songwriting. Bilal was able to experience the nightlife of New York City by frequenting night clubs and gaining a true knowledge of the NYC music scene. While frequenting the famed Wetlands\u2019 Nightclub, he became acquainted with The Roots, Q Tip, Common, Erykah Badu and Mos Def. Bilal would also take part in jam sessions with his New School professors and classmates. It was during one of these sessions that Bilal met Aaron Coleman of the Spin Doctors. The two hit it off and soon private jam sessions in Coleman\u2019s home gave birth to a demo of songs that would land Bilal a record deal with Interscope.\nBilal was moving in the direction he desired and moving fast. He left the New School, focusing on his musical career and began creating music at the famed Electric Lady Studios. At this time, Common was working on his Like Water for Chocolate album at Electric Lady. Bilal, sitting in on the recording sessions, became an integral part of the album. Later sessions with Questlove of The Roots introduced Bilal to J Dilla and sparked a fruitful working relationship between the two. Once the album was near completion, label pressures coerced Bilal into working with more commercially prominent producers like Dr. Dre and Mike City. The album, First Born Second, was released in 2001, displaying a wide range of diverse musicality.\n\nWith a favorable response to his album, Bilal was swept up in what the media referred to a \u201cNeo Soul\u201d movement. Bilal didn\u2019t feel the term fit. \u201cI was trying to come from a Jazz perspective\u2026. trying to write open ended tunes that could go in any direction when played live.\u201d While touring, Bilal and his band started to morph the music into what he describe as a \u201cjazz-fusion/rock type funk.\u201d This musical freedom bled into the songwriting for Bilal\u2019s next project, Love For Sale. This time around, Bilal worked with a myriad of new collaborators, from Sa-Ra to Denaun Porter to Nottz, even gathering a number of his former New School peers to participate. Interscope execs were less than enthused upon hearing the new record. Mysteriously, an unfinished version of the project was leaked.\n\nThe response from audiences and critics worldwide was overwhelmingly positive. For years, label politics prevented any significant progress to occur on a follow-up album. In spite of the setbacks of the last album, Bilal had a dedicated fan base and they wanted more. The encouraging feedback began to re-inspire Bilal to write songs again and he set out to accomplish what he had started in the beginning. Late 2009, Bilal announced his official second album will be released Summer 2010 via Los Angeles based label Plug Research Music. The new music promises to be progressive while still having its roots placed firmly in the jazz traditions that originally inspired Bilal\u2019s music. Bilal describes the new material as \u201cgenre-bending music.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "185 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Tony Mason", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6149106.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988346, 40.722035], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "Genres: Country And Southern Rock, Rock, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall Stage 3", "moreBioInfo": "Among an overwhelming field of percussionists exists well-versed drummer Tony Mason.

Two years and a band name change later, Mason left to pursue an engagement that would do more to stimulate his creative juices. Mason landed with the regionally successful Pull, lending his sticks to their fan-favorite self-titled EP that caused a stir throughout the Midwest.

With a love of music and skateboarding, Lindell formed a few punky garage bands early on while his musical horizons expanded. He listened to the deep blues of Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Jimmy Reed and Albert King before drifting toward the R&B sounds of The Impressions, Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway, soaking up the soul and learning how to craft a song. After performing at bars on the West Coast with a few short-lived bands, Eric formed his own group in 1993. He quickly gained a loyal Northern California audience thanks to countless performances and many late-night jam sessions. Established stars like Charlie Musselwhite and Tom Waits attended his shows, as did overflow crowds of music fans.\n\nWith music on his mind, Lindell headed to New Orleans in 1999, where he quickly discovered the pulsating and dynamic roots scene. He gravitated toward the West Bank dive bars of Gretna and Algiers, where he befriended many older area musicians who helped him get regular work as a performer. Some of New Orleans' finest players, including keyboardist Ivan Neville and drummers Harold Brown (War), Stanton Moore (Galactic) and Johnny Vidacovich (Professor Longhair, Astral Project) often joined him on stage. Galactic bassist Rob Mercurio began sitting in as well, and word of Lindell's immense talents quickly spread around the city. Stars like Branford Marsalis, The Neville Brothers and John Scofield began showing up at his gigs and embracing this fresh California kid's funky music. According to Lindell, \"It's a great feeling to be recognized for your music in New Orleans.\" Since 2003, in addition to his own gigs, Lindell regularly joins forces with Ivan Neville, Moore and Mercurio (when time and schedules permit) and they perform to overflow crowds as Dragon Smoke.\n\n2006's Change In The Weather delighted and surprised music fans hungry for a truly original artist. Lindell's deceptively simple sounding songs, laid back grooves and hook-laden melodies were fueled by guests including Brown, Neville and Moore. Critics across the country went wild, with reviews and features in Relix, OffBeat, Guitar Player, Down Beat, The New Yorker, The New York Press and many other national and regional publications. Singer And Musician magazine put Eric on the cover and many newspaper entertainment sections did the same.\n\n2007's Low On Cash, Rich In Love and 2009's Gulf Coast Highway pushed Lindell farther into the spotlight. Appearances on Late Night With Conan O'Brien and National Public Radio's Mountain Stage solidified his stature as an artist who simply could not be ignored. Many of his songs have appeared in films and television shows, including Boston Legal and Treme. He has collaborated and shared stages with blues and rock luminaries, including John Fogerty, Luther Dickinson and Anson Funderburgh.\n\nWith Revolution In Your Heart, Lindell was more than ready to come home to Alligator. \"The timing is perfect. I'm so excited to get back to focusing on what I do and have such a great team behind me,\" he says. Upon release of the album, Lindell and his band will tour heavily, reuniting with old friends and, as always, earning new fans at every stop. AllMusic declares Lindell a singular talent, saying, \"He plays soulful, funk-drenched, tight and focused grooves. He is a quadruple threat as a solid songwriter, impressive guitarist, affecting singer and harmonica blower. This is music that's deceptively difficult to create. Lindell makes it seem not just easy, but natural.\"", "otherInfo": "Unplugged and Acoustic - The Lonesome World Tour 2020"}, {"Address": "15 Vandam St, New York, NY 10013", "Artist": "Chronicles", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6302171.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.0047, 40.72656], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "Genres: Metal, Progressive Metal", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Huron Club At Soho Playhouse", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Feuding tailors, a cocaine-addicted rabbi and a Jewish woman who joins a fundamentalist Christian sect are just a few of the sometimes poignant, often humorous stories told through music in singer-songwriter Daniel Cainer's Jewish Chronicles.

While the cyclical nature of gardening seems inherent, in some ways, Heynderickx is just beginning. Her debut album, named I Need to Start a Garden out of a search for calm through these waves of uncertainty and upheaval, is out now via Mama Bird Recording Co.\n\nFor the empathetic singer/songwriter, the reasons for seeking such acceptance and understanding stem from a life of paradoxes. Heynderickx grew up in a religious household in Oregon, closely identifying with her Filipino roots, but also straddling multiple cultural identities. Now residing in Portland, her faith is not overt, but her introspection and continued struggle for self-actualization are easily accessible and relatable.\n\nLikewise, the tracks on I Need to Start a Garden reflect these seemingly disparate elements. Through soft acoustic guitar picking and deftly accented trombone sighs, Heynderickx\u2019s music immediately recalls folk music of the '60s and '70s mixed with a love of jazz radio. But Heynderickx\u2019s singing\u2014her vocals that range from sultry to operatic\u2014belie a tenacity in her soul.\n\nIt\u2019s a balance, then, between exposing and protecting herself on I Need to Start a Garden. Heynderickx vacillates between powerlessness (opener \u201cNo Face\u201d) and empowerment (lead single \"Oom Sha La La\"). But her generosity of spirit remains the constant throughout the whole album.\n\nYou can hear that exceptional care in \u201cJo\u201d, as she whispers, \u201cYou tended your garden like heaven and hell / and you built the birds houses to see if it helped at all.\u201d Aware of the birds, the garden, and anyone listening acutely, Heynderickx\u2019s music serves as an invitation for all to join her. Because the beauty of a garden is that while it\u2019s often started for deeply personal reasons, its bounty is best consumed and shared with others.\n\nI Need to Start a Garden was produced, engineered and mixed by Zak Kimball at Nomah Studios in Portland, Oregon. Haley Heynderickx co-produced the album. It was mastered by Timothy Stollenwerk at Stereophonic Mastering in Portland. The record features Lily Breshears (Bass, Keys, Backing Vocals), Denzel Mendoza (Trombone, Backing Vocals), Phillip Rogers (Drums, Percussion, Backing Vocals) and Tim Sweeney (Upright Bass).", "otherInfo": "This Land is Your Land: A Celebration of 80 Years"}, {"Address": "327 Bowery, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Phatt James Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9935542.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.991787, 40.725751], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Grunge", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Bowery Electric", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "15 Vandam St, New York, NY 10013", "Artist": "Chronicle", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8464875.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.0047, 40.72656], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "Genres: Southern Gospel", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Huron Club At Soho Playhouse", "moreBioInfo": "We started out as friends, and now make up the group \"CHRONICLE\".

Founding members, Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell (along with former band mate Dan Peek) met in high school in London in the late 1960s and quickly harmonized their way to the top of the charts on the strength of their signature song \"A Horse With No Name\u201d. America became a global household name and paved the way with an impressive string of hits following the success of their first #1 single. Forty years later, these friends are still making music together, touring the world and thrilling audiences with their timeless sound.\n\nAmerica's journey has found them exploring a wide variety of musical terrain. Their best-known tunes, which also include \"I Need You,\" \"Ventura Highway,\" \"Don't Cross The River,\" \"Tin Man,\" \"Lonely People,\" and \"Sister Golden Hair\" were cornerstones of 1970\u2019s Top 40 and FM rock radio. Yet beyond their impressive catalog of hits, listeners would discover there was always much more to America than surface perceptions. The combination of Gerry Beckley\u2019s melodic pop rock and Dewey Bunnell\u2019s use of folk-jazz elements, slinky Latin-leaning rhythms and impressionistic lyric imagery contrasted well with Dan Peek's more traditional country-rock leanings and highly personal lyrics.\n\nAmerica's albums--six certified gold and/or platinum, with their first greatest hits collection, History, hitting four+ million in sales--displayed a fuller range of the trio's talents than did their singles. Their material encompassed an ambitious artistic swath; from effects-laden rockers to oddball medleys to soul-bearing ballads, America displayed a flawless blend of disparate genres and styles as wide-open as the great American plains.\n\nEnjoying massive success early in their career, America earned their stripes as musical soldiers on the battlefield amidst the excess, craziness and chaos of the 70\u2019s. The trio won the Grammy\u00ae for Best New Artist in 1972 and began working with George Martin and Geoff Emerick in 1974. This successful team went on to record seven albums and several Top Ten hits, including \u201cTin Man\u201d and \u201cSister Golden Hair\u201d.\n\nBy the mid-70s, inter-band conflicts combined with an exhaustive touring and recording schedule exacted its toll on the group. With Peek\u2019s departure from the fold in 1977, his band mates rose to the challenge and carried on as a duo. Shifts in sound and direction, changes in producers and managers, and a renewed dedication to the craft of songwriting helped rocket America to the upper reaches of the pop charts in 1982 with their smash single, \"You Can Do Magic.\" During this tumultuous time in their career, Beckley and Bunnell immersed themselves in their craft, infusing a newfound maturity into their rich body of work. Their growth as singers, songwriters and musicians has continued into the present day as illustrated by landmark releases such as 2000\u2019s Highway 3-disc box set, 2002\u2019s Holiday Harmony, an album comprised of seasonal classics and live showcases, 2007's Here & Now and 2009\u2019s Live In Concert: Wildwood Springs.\n\nFrom their formative years, America has been a band capable of transcending borders with its uplifting music and positive message. Embracing a rainbow of divergent cultures, America\u2019s audiences continue to grow, comprising a loyal legion of first, second and third generation fans, all bearing testament to the group\u2019s enduring appeal. \"I think that the ingredients of the America sound are the basic fundamentals that translate internationally,\" explains Beckley. \"The Italians are huge fans of dance music, but they also love a ballad--they're romantic at heart. It's the same in the Far East. A lot of times in these countries, we see people singing along, and they don't really know what the words mean. Music is truly the international language.\"\n\nIn the midst of their 40th-year anniversary of music making, America continues to evolve while remaining a perennial mainstay on the domestic and international concert circuit and a cornerstone of 70\u2019s Top 40 and FM rock radio. In addition to their classics, America is revisiting their roots as writers and artists. The 40th Anniversary show features songs reflecting some of their song-writing inspirations as well as showcasing their first album America with a very special acoustic set featuring standards such as \"I Need You\" and \"Three Roses\", as well as some never-before-performed deep cuts.\n\nFrom anonymous horses to fast-moving trains, America\u2019s extraordinary four-decade musical legacy of consummately crafted pop/rock songs, trademark lush harmonies and evocative lyrical landscapes will never go out of style.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "217 E Houston St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Last Night*", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10102703.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.986751, 40.722165], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "Genres: Pop Rock, Indie Rock, Pop Punk, Synth Pop, Goth Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Mercury Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "With highly stylized magnetism, Last Night blends modern rock with pure anthemic flare.

While other children dreamt of being astronauts or building rocket ships out of mega blocks, Dan was ready to jam on stage with the greatest of the great.\n\nWhen he got a bit older, he accompanied his brother Michael to Sam Ash music store, where he needed to pick up a saxophone for middle school band. They may have been at the store for his brother, but that day will forever be the one where Dan\u2019s daycare dreams began to grow into a reality.\n\nThere, standing in the guitar department, Dan was encouraged to pick up and strum along to the beat inside his soul, and his passion began to take shape.\n\nAs years passed, Dan became more and more accustomed to the guitar, and fell more and more in love with performing. He surrounded himself with mentors from diverse backgrounds \u2013 Dennis DelGaudio (Billy Joel), Chris Justino (Broadway), Artie Blaurock (Sweet Revenge, Dorian Grey, Needulhed), & Rick Stone (Jazz Guitar at Hofstra University). Each of these amazing talents provided him with a unique perspective on guitar stylings and teachings.\n\nTaking that knowledge to the next level, Dan joined the likes of Indie/Alternative Rock band Face the King (CI Records) and performed across the continental US for a multitude of shows, including a full leg of Vans Warped Tour, Rockstar UPROAR Festival, the main stage at the CBGB Festival in Times Square, NY (with Billy Idol and Jane\u2019s Addiction!), as well as the world\u2019s largest music festival - Summerfest, in Milwaukee, WI.\n\nFace the King was chosen as a National Finalist for the Ernie Ball Vans Warped Tour competition alongside PVRIS, and are three-time winners of the Ernie Ball Battle of the Bands. Their full-length album, \u201cOnce More Is All I Am,\u201d was released in November of 2017.\n\nDan is also collaborating on songwriting and performing with two up-and-coming Alt/Indie groups, Don\u2019t Believe in Ghosts (Forward Thinking Records), and A Second Life. These bands have received high acclaim, as shown by their multiple plays on retail radio playlists and on Spotify, national plays on Sirius XM Radio, and a number of live shows including Bowery Ballroom, The Paramount, NYC Marathon, and an upcoming appearance at the world-famous South By Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, TX.\n\nIn 2017, Don\u2019t Believe In Ghosts released their debut full-length album, \u201cGive it Meaning\u201d, and A Second Life released their first four singles, \u201cCivil War\u201d, \u201cJust Whisper\u201d, \u201cBeautiful Distraction\u201d, and \u201cYou\u2019re Missing From Me\u201d.\n\nTo take a listen to the alt-vibes of Face the King, Don\u2019t Believe in Ghosts, and A Second Life, check them out on Spotify:\n\nFace the King: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Rg22QdAlQc1KrhWuNwGWq\n\nDon\u2019t Believe in Ghosts: https://open.spotify.com/artist/5uLKc9jyRkcyoTNF1JLWe1\n\nA Second Life: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1FJj42V3fVy1sdxs0OgTQ5\n\nAs a session musician, Dan has performed with countless artists from different Genres \u2013 Robbie Rosen (American Idol), MarissaAnn (The Voice), Alessandra Guercio (The Voice), The Frankel Sisters (X Factor), Julia Lambert, Nicoletta Slapo, Sammi Rae Murciano, The 00\u2019s Band, and with Hank Lane Music Productions for weddings in the tri-state area.

Did you ever think that when you found that help, you\u2019d find love as well? Picture Ernie Halter as he stood stranded on a lonely stretch of road in the middle of nowhere. Discouraged, worried, he got a call from a most unexpected source. \u201cA girl whom I had met just once offered her car to me for as long as I needed it. No one had ever done anything that selfless for me. She continues to be my angel, and every day I am thankful for her help \u2026 and her love.\"\n\nThe song he wrote as a thank-you, \u201cAngel,\u201d is one of eleven tracks on his latest release, \u201cFranklin & Vermont,\u201d which features the stories found at the intersection of love and longing. This record chronicles the sometimes painful quest for love and the joy we feel when we finally find it.\n\nFranklin and Vermont is what Halter calls home. These two cross streets in a quiet neighborhood within Los Angeles are \u201ca few miles away and a world apart from my old place in Hollywood. I spend so much time on the road - I wanted the record to carry a bit of home wherever I went.\u201d\n\n\u201cFranklin & Vermont\u201d returns to the heartfelt arrangements and honest delivery of Halter's early material, a collection of songs recorded in his bathroom with, as he describes it, \u201cone mic and one love.\u201d The response was tremendous. \u201cTo this day, people tell me they love the early recordings for that laid back, raw, acoustic vibe, and I wanted \u2018Franklin & Vermont\u2019 to be a studio record with the same soul.\u201d To achieve this, he enlisted engineers Spenser Bishop and Carson Liccardi of MixOne Sound in Mission Viejo, CA, not far from where Halter grew up. There they kept the setting intimate - in addition to his playing most of the instruments on the record, this was also Halter's first self-produced album.\n\nHis songwriting for this record maintains that closeness ntimacy, being heavily influenced by events in his own life and those of people close to him. The feelings experienced upon losing a loved one inspired \u201cGone,\u201d and when Halter posted a live performance of this song on YouTube it quickly racked up over 10,000 views in its first week. \u201cI started getting messages from fans saying how much they connected to the song,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere is no greater reward.\u201d\n\nFor those who realize that sometimes feelings aren\u2019t enough to keep a relationship, Halter has penned \u201cHard To Let A Good Love Go.\u201d \u201cThis Beautiful Ache\u201d features the haunting vocals of Amy Kuney and Tony Lucca and describes the pain and pleasure a memory can bring \u2013 a theme also explored in \u201cAlmost You,\u201d a co-write with Kyler England (The Rescues), Jason Spiewak and Richard Furch. Singing of a love you can't seem to forget, Halter laments, \u201cbest someone else could hope to do / is take second place / be almost you.\u201d When listening to that song, it\u2019s hard not to think of the one who got away.\n\nOnce in love, it is wonderful to find music that describes the journey. The up-tempo \u201cWe Got Love\u201d penned in Nashville with Lady Antebellum guitarist Jason \"Slim\" Gambill is one such song. Along with \u201cAngel,\u201d \u201cCome Home To Me\u201d is a delicate ukulele-led melody co-written when Halter was missing his girl far from home.\n\nAs a special treat Halter has included two cover songs that are part of the soundtrack of his life; Coldplay\u2019s bittersweet \u201cIn My Place\u201d arranged for cello, voice, and ukulele, and an acoustic arrangement of \u201cBlack Coffee In Bed\u201d by Squeeze. \u201cMore than anything, I wanted to make the kind of record I would enjoy listening to,\u201d says Halter. \u201cI covered songs I loved hoping others would love them as well.\u201d\n\nIt is important to Halter that this record not only connects to the listeners, but helps them connect with each other as well. Catalyzing word of mouth in a digital age and making full use of the opportunities presented by the internet, he has built a fan base that includes over half a million followers on Twitter and the number one spot on Amazon.com for a free mp3 sampler consisting exclusively of Halter\u2019s music.\n\nFrom his status as a \u201cdigital troubadour\u201d Halter had taken social networking off the computer and into the music venue. He encouraged fan connections to the point where they tell him they now hang out together before shows, visit one another on vacation, and meet at music festivals - using their mutual love of Halter\u2019s music as a launching pad to form long-lasting friendships.\n\nIf Halter can\u2019t always be there to see the relationships bloom, he\u2019s happy that at least his music can. \u201cI want to be the record you play while you make breakfast, make dinner, make out \u2026 I kept thinking of the songs that made up the soundtrack of my life and wanted to create songs that would help others form theirs.\u201d\n\nAre you looking for love lost? Or are you rejoicing in love found? Either way, the songs of someone who's been where you've been can be heard on \u201cFranklin and Vermont.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Ernie Halter w/ Tony Lucca - Rockwood Stage 3"}, {"Address": "142 E.

They also opened for punk bands The Stranglers and The Motors. They had a hit with the single \"On and On\", and refer to their music as \"Athletic Rock.\"\n\nFormed in Newcastle, England by brothers John and Mark Gallagher, Raven quickly set the pace for the burgeoning metal renaissance in the UK at the time. Raven began creating a sound which was rooted in British hard rock with progressive tendencies and a willingness to take musical chances . The band's highly energized live show and interaction between members developed an image and style of play the band described as \"athletic\". They began wearing guards, helmets and plates from various sports (hockey, baseball,etc...) and incorporating them into the playing of their instruments (for instance, elbow pads were used to strike cymbals for a unique performance angle). Eventually, the band signed with Neat Records, the legendary, low-budget metal label of the Northlands, releasing Wiped Out and Rock Until You Drop within a year's time and making an impressive showing on the UK charts a the time. Sufficient noise was made for the American market to take notice and New Jersey's Megaforce Records signed them, issuing their next recording in the States as All for One. The band came stateside in 1983 and toured extensively with Megaforce bands Metallica and Anthrax, both of whom would gain a place of prominence in the growing thrash metal movement. Manager/Megaforce founder Johnny Zazula believed that Raven were major label material and kept them touring constantly until the big labels noticed. The infamous Live at the Inferno recording was a product of one of those tours. Atlantic Records signed Raven to a worldwide contract after a minor bidding war (major label contracts would follow for Metallica and Anthrax in the following year). The band moved its permanent base from Newcastle to New York.\n\nStay Hard was released in 1984 and proved a minor hit on the strength of single/video On and On. The Atlantic years proved to be less-than-stellar for the band. A drastic shift in a more \"commercial\" direction came at the label's behest, with many diehard fans being alienated by the slick, lightweight production of The Pack Is Back (effectively marketing the band with their weird musical forays and confusing image was likely very difficult). However, the band recorded 2 LPs and the Mad EP before being let go by Atlantic. After touring behind the Life's a Bitch album, Wacko left the band to spend more time with his new wife and family. He would later pursue a career in audio production and engineering, eventually working with jazz greats Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick, Jr. Virginian Joe Hasselvander (ex-Pentagram) took over the drum set and the band dropped the outlandish image for a more conventional \"denim and leather\" look for their 1988 release Nothing Exceeds Like Excess. After the advent of grunge and the dissolution of their record label (Combat Records) led the band to concentrate on continental Europe and Japan, where they retained more of a following. The band recorded and toured until 2001, when a wall collapsed on Mark, crushing his legs. Raven went on hiatus for nearly 5 years while the guitarist rehabilitated. As of 2006, Raven is touring with a new release in the works.\n\n\n2) RAVEN is a Solo project by Terui Toshiyuki (\u7167\u4e95\u5229\u5e78), bassist of BLANKEY JET CITY and ROSSO. In 2003, RAVEN released one album, Kagirinaku aka ni chikai kuro (\u9650\u308a\u7121\u304f\u8d64\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u9ed2), most notably featuring Chiba Yusuke of Thee Michelle Gun Elephant and ROSSO on vocals for most of the tracks.\n\n\n3) Raven is Czech artist and multiinstrumentalist Vladim\u00edr Ku\u010dera (*1966), who's released four albums so far - Bubny a p\u00ed\u0161\u0165aly (1991), Salome a dal\u0161\u00ed p\u00edsn\u011b Karla Kryla (1993), Harmonie (2002) and Kamen\u00ed (2006).\n\n\n4) Raven was an influential band from Buffalo, N.Y., in the 1960s. Raven began as Stan Szelest's backing band in Stan and the Ravens, which featured Tom Calandra on bass and Gary Mallaber on drums. When Stan and the Ravens broke up, Calandra and Mallaber joined a band called The Rising Sons with vocalist Tony Galla, guitarist John Weitz, and pianist/keyboardist Jimmy Calire.\n\nRaven manager Marty Angelo, trying to book gigs for the band outside of Buffalo, met Jimi Hendrix at Steve Paul's Scene in New York City in 1967. Hendrix was so impressed with the tape he heard, that he convinced the club's owner to book Raven.\n\nLater that same year, Angelo sent the same tape Hendrix had heard to Beatle George Harrison. Harrison sent a letter back to Angelo which expressed an interest in signing Raven to Apple Records.\n\n\n5) Raven:\nGenre: Black Metal\nLyrical theme: Misanthropy\nOrigin: Norway\nFormed in: 1993\nLabel: No Colours Records\nLast known line-up:\nRune Vedaa (Forgotten Woods, Joyless)\nothers - unknown\n\nMember(s) of Forgotten Woods involved in this.

Indeed, since he debuted almost two and a half years ago on New York City hip hop station WWPR Power 105.1 FM, Norie\u2019s Sunday night show \u201cAnything Goes-Caribbean Edition\u201d, a vigorous blend of soca, reggaeton, roots reggae and dancehall, accented with a distinctive Brooklyn flavor, consistently tops the ratings for the 8-10 PM time slot according to Arbitron statistics.\nRespectfully referred to as Da Reggae Don, DJ Norie was born to Panamanian parents in Brooklyn, which is often referred to a Jamaica\u2019s 15th parish, due to its concentration of immigrants from reggae\u2019s birthplace. Raised in Brooklyn\u2019s East Flatbush area, Norie became familiar with the music of Shabba Ranks, Super Cat and Ninja Man (dancehall reggae superstars of the late 1980s and early \u201890s) by listening to coveted sound clash cassettes that furthered the popularity of the latest reggae hits and the renown of the era\u2019s premier Jamaican sound systems. \u201cListening to the cassettes of Stone Love, Kilimanjaro and other sounds I thought, I want to be a part of that,\u201d Norie recalled.\nBarely into his teens, Norie began working with a neighborhood sound doing odd jobs such as carrying speakers and other equipment to their various gigs around Brooklyn. He paid close attention to the deejays (or selectors in Jamaican parlance) observing their proficiency in choosing just the right tunes to elicit roaring responses from the crowd and keep them on the dance floor. When the selectors needed to take a break, Norie got the chance to display his burgeoning skills on the wheels of steel; however, these early career-training sessions took place unbeknownst to Norie\u2019s mother. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will get in trouble for saying this now but my mom used to work nights so I used to sneak out to play at these basement parties, and basically that is how I learned to select,\u201d Norie laughingly discloses. \u201cIt was kind of hard in the beginning; they used to line up four or five records, tell me what to play and when I played them, people used to go crazy. So it used to seem like, yeah, I can do this, even though I was scared as s*#t. But I did it anyway and it was a good experience.\u201d\n\nNorie\u2019s fears subsided with repeated stints at the turntables and eventually he was recruited by Spectrum Disco, working with selectors Redds and Super C; as Spectrum\u2019s popularity spread throughout Brooklyn and the greater New York area during the 1990s, so too did Norie\u2019s renown as an intimidating selector. In the late 1990s Super Claude, the founder of Afrique Sound Station, one of the most venerated sound systems in the New York area, recruited Norie to join the set. Alongside Afrique\u2019s remarkable team of selectors, which included Jagga B, Crazy Richie and Super Twitch, Norie\u2019s talents were taken to a wider audience that spanned many states and several countries. \u201cSometimes you have to make a move, enhance yourself and go for you, and Afrique is where my name really started from, its what took me to the level of traveling with the music,\u201d Norie reflects. \u201cI will never forget Spectrum Disco because that is where I came from but Afrique has been in the business for more than 20 years, they set the trend for \u2018nuff sounds and it is a blessing to have been a part of it.\u201d\nNorie has also played on numerous Brooklyn based pirate and Internet stations that exclusively play reggae and Caribbean music (he even started one of his own, My Radio 94.3 FM), a phenomenon indicative of the vast potential for Caribbean music in the New York area. But Norie\u2019s expertise in selecting dancehall also resonated with a mainstream listenership, as he found out when he joined up with (hip hop) DJ Self as one of six deejays comprising a collective called Da Union, which enabled him to take dancehall into several (Manhattan) clubs where it had previously been excluded. This led to a few guest appearances on Power 105.1 FM, and eventually his Sunday night show on the station, which has contributed to his enviable status as America\u2019s most influential radio personality for dancehall reggae. As such, Norie is usually the first to transform a core dancehall anthem into an international hit, which he recently did with Stephen and Damian Marley\u2019s single \u201cJah Army\u201d, featuring Buju Banton.\nNorie is also the personal deejay for Beenie Man, with whom he travels whenever the artist has a show outside of Jamaica and he has also toured with Elephant Man, Bounty Killer, Mavado and Serani. On March 30, 2011 at New York City\u2019s BB King\u2019s nightclub, Norie made history selecting the rhythms for seven time Grammy winner Stephen Marley\u2019s first performance done solely to backing tracks (that is, without his band\u2019s accompaniment); Marley headlined Norie\u2019s two year anniversary party for his Power 105 show, which was also the one year anniversary celebration for his immensely popular monthly live concert series, \u201cAnything Goes\u201d. \u201cStephen was a little hesitant at first, because he never performed to tracks before, but he did it and he was happy about it, so it is a great experience to have under my belt,\u201d Norie shares.\nNorie has recently partnered on several projects with Queens New York based VP Records, the largest independent reggae label in the world. He selects the music at each of VP\u2019s album release parties and the label\u2019s artists are regularly showcased at his \u201cAnything Goes\u201d series. For VP Records\u2019 \u201cReggae Gold 2011\u201d, a collection of the year\u2019s biggest reggae hits, Da Reggae Don provided a vibrant, 35-minute bonus mix CD, rife with artists\u2019 shout-outs to Norie (including 2011 Celebrity Apprentice winner/country superstar John Rich) and customized renditions of popular songs. Additionally, Norie has just started recording artists on his own dancehall rhythms and he plans to release those tracks as part of his own compilation series sometime in the near future.\nEach of Norie\u2019s endeavors is in pursuit of his ultimate goal: expanding the overall popularity of Caribbean music, especially dancehall reggae, the music that inspired his career path almost 20 years ago. \u201cMy radio show has served a lot of purposes; not only did it allow my fans to get to know me but it allowed me to give back to this music game,\u201d Norie explains. \u201cBut I would like to get further in radio, be more than just a deejay because then I can help reggae by impressing upon program directors that New York\u2019s Caribbean population is really an untapped market that no one is paying attention to so why not go out and support it? We don\u2019t have to follow the same trends that everyone has been doing for years and years, we can do things differently, add on and make it much stronger.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "318 W 53rd St, New York City, NY 10009", "Artist": "Stand Up Comedy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617845.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.985669, 40.764451], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Broadway Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1008 Cortelyou Rd, Brooklyn, NY 11218", "Artist": "Nitzan Gavrieli Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9050229.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.96842, 40.639278], "Date": "Sun Feb 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-23", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Bar Chord", "moreBioInfo": "Pianist and composer Nitzan Gavrieli grew up in Ramat Gan, Israel.

Just as comfortable on stage as he is behind the turntables, Cipha has carved out a distinct voice in music and comedy over the past 15 years.\n\nCipha got his first break interning for Wildman Steve and DJ Riz of the Flip Squad. His tireless work ethic and perceptive DJ skills earned him opening slots at legendary NYC nightspots like the Tunnel and the Palladium. Soon after that, Cipha found himself spinning for Lil Kim, Mos Def and Jay-Z on national tours, and rocking private parties & album release galas for superstars like P. Diddy, Eminem and Mariah Carey. Most importantly, Cipha learned how to break new records, helping turn once-unknowns like Sean Paul, 50 Cent, Pitbull, Rick Ross, Rihanna into superstars, and maintain a healthy sense of humor on the mic.\n\nCipha\u2019s ear for talent and club-honed musical instincts also made him a natural A&R executive, a position he has held with labels ranging from Rawkus and Tommy Boy to the Neptunes\u2019 Star Trak imprint with Pharrell Williams, and Roc-A-Fella with Jay-Z. In 2003, he took an even bigger leap into the music industry and began hosting \u201cSucker Free\u201d and \u201cTRL\u201d on MTV. He has also set a goal to take over the Improv comedy world.

Her emotionally disarming performances deceive in their simplicity, often times consisting of nothing more than her voice and a guitar, occasionally accompanied by violinist. Yet, they nevertheless arrest audiences through their quiet, brooding intensity, holding a vulnerability that\u2019s offset by a wintry, gallic allure..\n\nOn any given weekday, you can hear her voice echoing over the Hudson and East rivers. Equipped with only an acoustic guitar, a microphone and a tiny mixer, the French songstress delivers hushed and intimate performances for passengers aboard Spirit Cruises, set against the backdrop of an idyllic Manhattan skyline. Doucet\u2019s set list meanders seamlessly between Top 40 staples like Cindy Lauper and The Week'nd, while discreetly inserting the odd Gallic classic and, of course, a few numbers from her own blooming repertoire. Oddly enough, this sort of eclecticism works, as Doucet\u2019s own style has been informed by her superior command of the pop form.\n\n\nTiphanie Doucet got her start early on in the music and entertainment world. Harp and Ballet were part of her two passions since a very early age, and lead to a professional Dancing and Acting career. A starring role in the film Le b\u00e9b\u00e9 d\u2019Elsa, and later in the Glee-like TV series \"Chante\", gave her popularity in her native France, and the unlikely foundations for what would be a very eclectic musical trajectory. After leaving France, Doucet decided to gamble it all and start fresh in America. The 180 degree turn that her life took left her old life in shambles, bringing her plenty of heartbreak and homesickness that would prove to be a wellspring of musical inspiration. This moment of transition afforded Doucet plenty of material to write her own songs, which she began testing out on street corners, cruises and caf\u00e9s throughout New York and her newly adopted home in Jersey City, New Jersey. The overwhelmingly positive reception was such that she decided to release her own work. She released her first single \"Lucky guy\" with Grammy-nominated producer Jason Agel, whose work can be heard in productions by everyone from Kanye West to Bj\u00f6rk to Beyonce.\n\n\nA year later, she released her debut album \u201cUnder My Sun\u201d, a collection of rustic, yet polished folk numbers produced by David Baron and Simone Felice, who have worked with the likes of Lumineers and Jade Bird. Though Doucet\u2019s influences are prevalent throughout the album, nodding to the likes of Norah Jones, Ingrid Michaelson and Feist, the work is without a doubt a testament to the uniqueness and originality of her voice. The sound is amplified by Felice and Baron's production, which never feels intrusive, but serves as the perfect complement to the singer\u2019s overpowering voice, interjecting only at key moments of emotional revelation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiphanie n'est surement pas inconnue de vous. Elle a commence a 15 ans a la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, quand elle interpr\u00e9tait la fille de Corinne Touzet, dans un premier r\u00f4le plut\u00f4t salu\u00e9 par la critique. A l\u2019\u00e9poque elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 8 ans de conservatoire en musique et danse et continua jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ses 18 ans. A 20 ans elle d\u00e9bute une carri\u00e8re de danseuse professionnelle gr\u00e2ce a Redha qui l'engage comme apprenti sur Romeo et Juliette, apr\u00e8s elle enchaine les shows, plateaux t\u00e9l\u00e9s, tourn\u00e9es. Parmi ses meilleurs exp\u00e9riences, on a pu la voir sur les plateaux de la Star Academy, la tourn\u00e9e de Jenifer ou derri\u00e8re David Guetta, Jonnhy Halliday et m\u00eame Prince, travaillant avec tous les chor\u00e9graphes du moment comme Kamel Ouali, Redha, Mya Frye, Stephane Jarny ou Hakim Ghorab. Comme chanteuse on a pu la voir interpr\u00e9ter \u201cJeanie \u201c dans Hair et bien sur a la TV, meilleure amie de Priscilla dans la s\u00e9rie Chante. A l \u00e9poque elle commence a prendre la musique plus au s\u00e9rieux, rencontre Geoffrey, guitariste, avec qui elle commence a composer et voyager aux Etats Unis : Los Angeles, Nashville, New York. Lors d'un programme court au Musician Institute de Los Angeles, elle s'inscrit a une audition pour l\u2019\u00e9cole AMDA. De retour en France, on lui apprend qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'une bourse de talent ! La voila partie aux Etats Unis, et elle ne reviendra plus. Son dipl\u00f4me en poche elle entame les auditions et commence a travailler. Une com\u00e9die musicale, et m\u00eame un premier r\u00f4le dans une pi\u00e8ce de theatre Off Broadway. Mais la musique est toujours pr\u00e9sente. Elle commence a gratter la guitare, et compose seule son premier EP \u201cBetween us\u201d qu'elle revient enregistrer a Paris. Depuis, elle se consacre a sa musique, elle joue m\u00eame dans la rue, le m\u00e9tro, et a fait plus de 50 concerts a NY, dont la premi\u00e8re partie de Anna Nalick a Brooklyn, une auteur compositeur tr\u00e8s populaire aux Etats Unis, et a Paris aussi ou elle a eu la chance de faire la premi\u00e8re partie d'Arnaud Ducret au casino de Paris au Printemps 2016.\nEn 2017, elle rencontre et enregistre avec le producteur / r\u00e9alisateur Jason Agel, nomin\u00e9 notamment au Grammy Awards pour son enregistrement de la chanson \"All of Me\" par John Legend. Le single \"Lucky guy\" surprend par les m\u00e9lodies m\u00e9lancoliques et relaxantes de Tiphanie, les voix douces et ang\u00e9liques, et les arrangements explosifs de Jason Agel. Apres avoir envoye une demo de chanson en francais, elle attire ensuite l'attention du realisateur Simone Felice ( les Lumineers, Jade Bird... ) Elle debarque a Woodstock et s'enferme avec lui et David Baron dans leur studio au milieu des montagnes de Catskills, le coup de foudre artistique est immediat. L'album est sorti le 10 Aout, comprenant des chansons en Anglais et en Francais.\n\nIl attire la Presse Americaine qui la compare a Norah Jones. En novembre dernier Tiphanie s'est produit au Sunset Jazz Club. Un EP de reprises est prevu pour Mars 2019 avec aussi des versions en Francais des chansons de l'album.\n\n\n\n\nLa p\u00e9pite du jour c\u2019est Tiphanie Doucet et Under My Sun\nPar Charles Chinasky\n\nTiphanie Doucet a une histoire qui ferait un film. Jeune actrice avec Corinne Touzet (oui quand m\u00eame), bourse US, Danse sur le grand journal, com\u00e9die musicale pour finir par se faire rep\u00e9rer dans le m\u00e9tro de New York.

Car Tiphanie a une voix enchanteresse. Elle m\u00e9lange une guitare s\u00e8che folk avec un petit cot\u00e9 soul. C\u2019est une musique \u00e0 faire tomber les \u00e9toiles, en sirotant un petit whisky et en pensant \u00e0 la vie.T\n\n\nPRESS\n\nShaped by her experiences in France, Los Angeles, New York, and her recently adopted New Jersey home alike, Doucet\u2019s new work embraces a folksier, jazz-tinged gentleness. Its subtle warmth instantly feels like home, pervading the senses in a way not dissimilar to Norah Jones or Lucy Rose. Yet, in spite of any similarities you may draw between her and other great songwriters, Doucet\u2019s dreamy vocal quality is markedly distinct, especially in how she tenderly incorporates it into her music to tell stories unique to her own outlook and experiences.\n\nJonathan Frahm \u2022 10 July 2018- For Folk Sake\n\n\"Her vocal performance is compelling in its attention to detail\u2013the ends of lines and the wordless sighs that close the song contain a lot of emotion without going for the big move. If you\u2019re looking for a relaxing summer tune, this is what you\u2019re looking for. Highly recommended.\"\n\nStephen Carradini, for Independant Clauses\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d gotten to know Tiphanie and her sincerity to her work, is obvious to witness. Her dedication to her craft is unconditional. She\u2019s humble, energetic, honest, and she wants to share her music to greater and greater audiences. And in her humble way, she still is seeking Of herself, and About herself \u2013 and we think that contributes profoundly to music making. She wants to be \u2018happy\u2019. Happy with her work, happy with her songs making people happy, and happy with making music an even larger part of her life from a career point of view. She\u2019s come a long way. But she\u2019s a tough gal \u2013 resilient and proud of her accomplishment and the way she\u2019s come through the personal pains in her past. Her heart pushes her to do so.

August 5, 1961, Seattle, Washington)\n\n\nViolinist and composer Mark O'Connor is widely recognized as one of the most gifted contemporary composers in America and surely one of the brightest talents of his generation.\n\nThe New York Times calls his \"one of the most spectacular journeys in recent American music.\"\n\nThe Baltimore Sun and the St. Louis Post Dispatch label him \"genius.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Times describes him as an artist who is \"one of the most talented and imaginative...working in music -- any music -- today.\"\n\nThe Seattle Times says of his music: \"brilliantly original.\"\n\nHis compositions are \"informed and engaging,\" according to the Washington Post.\n\nAn excerpt from a feature in the New York Times eloquently describes Mark O'Connor's tradition-filled past, his stellar present and his future full of promise:\n\n\"The audience was on its feet. I'm certain that at least some of the concert-goers were moved not merely by Mr. O'Connor's solo, as exciting as it was, but by its having come on the heels of the orchestral piece (\"American Seasons\"). They were moved by Mr. O'Connor's journey without maps, cheering for the only musician today who can reach so deeply first into the refined, then the vernacular, giving his listeners a complex, sophisticated piece of early-21st-century classical music and then knocking them dead with the brown-dirt whine of a Texas fiddle.\"\n\nA product of America's rich aural folk tradition, Mr. O'Connor's journey began at the feet of violin masters Texas fiddler Benny Thomasson and French jazz violinist Stephane Grappelli. Along the way, between these two marvelous musical extremes, Mark O'Connor absorbed knowledge and influence from a multitude of musical styles and genres. Now, at age 44, he has melded and shaped these influences into a new American classical music. The Los Angeles Times warmly noted he has \"crossed over so many boundaries, that his style is purely personal.\"\n\nHis first recording for the Sony Classical record label, Appalachia Waltz, was a collaboration with Yo-Yo Ma and doublebassist Edgar Meyer. The works Mr. O'Connor composed for the disc, including its title track, gained worldwide recognition for him as a leading proponent of a new American musical idiom. The tremendously successful follow-up release, Appalachian Journey, received a Grammy Award in February 2001.\n\nViewing Mark O'Connor as a direct cultural descendant of America's 18th century musicians, the producers of the six-part PBS documentary on the American Revolution approached Mark O'Connor to contribute music to their long form work. An album of the music he created, Liberty!, was released on the Sony Classical label in 1997 and features Mr. O'Connor's arrangements of a variety of traditional American music and expansive original orchestral works. Both Yo-Yo Ma and Wynton Marsalis appear as guests on the album.\n\nIn 2000, composer John Williams also called on his expertise and knowledge of the period to contribute solo instrumentalist talents to the Oscar-nominated score of \"The Patriot.\" Mr. O'Connor was invited to contribute to the soundtrack of the upcoming Ron Maxwell film, \"Gods and Generals,\" released in 2003.\n\nMidnight on the Water, a live recording of his solo recital, was released in 1998. It was the album long awaited by legions who have followed Mr. O'Connor's 28-year career and is still today regarded by many as a definitive career work firmly solidified his place as one of America's most significant contemporary musical artists. The CD includes Mr. O'Connor's \"Caprices 1-6,\" increasingly gaining reputation as classic works of the modern violin repertoire. In its review of the disc, Fanfare The Magazine for Serious Record Collectors praised his ability \"to dazzle listeners with things both new and personal,\" noting that \"O'Connor's creative effort... deserves special mention and serious discussion, if not special praise.\"\n\nWith more than 150 performances, his \"Fiddle Concerto No. 1\" has become the most-performed modern violin concerto.\n\nFanfare for the Volunteer, recorded with the London Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Steven Mercurio, was released by Sony Classical in October 1999. At its release, Melinda Bargreen, the Seattle Times' respected classical music critic, described the composition as, \"O'Connor's strongest work thus far,\" calling it \"distinctively American and decidedly O'Connor...\"\n\nIn April 2000, Mr. O'Connor premiered \"The American Seasons: Seasons of an American Life,\" at Troy Savings Bank Music Hall in Troy, N.Y. The work was commissioned to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the hall's concert series. The New York Times said \"... if Dvorak had spent his American leisure time in Nashville instead of Spillville, Iowa, 'New World Symphony' would have sounded like this.\" The American Seasons was recorded with the Metamorphosen chamber orchestra and released in 2001.\n\nFollowing the work's release, a 28-city national tour with Metamorphosen earned universally spectacular reviews. The New York Times said, \"... if Dvorak had spent his American leisure time in Nashville instead of Spillville, Iowa, 'New World Symphony' might have sounded like this.\" Richard Dyer of the Boston Globe called the work \"concise, lyrical and irresistibly rhythmic.\" Wayne Gay of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said, \"The American Seasons is destined to rank among the greatest masterpieces of American music...the first musical masterpiece of the 21st century.\" The work was nationally broadcast New Year's Day 2002 on PBS stations, paired with Vivaldi's \"Four Seasons.\"\n\nIn August 2000, Mr. O'Connor's composition, \"Double Concerto for Two Violins,\" received its premiere with Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg and the Chicago Symphony, Christoph Eschenbach conducting. (In November 2003, Mr. O'Connor and Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg recorded the work with Marin Alsop conducting the Colorado Orchestra. It was released in June 2005.)\n\nIn June 2001, Mr. O'Connor released Hot Swing! a tribute to his great friend and mentor, the legendary French jazz master, Stephane Grappelli. Released on his own OMAC label, the CD was recorded live with Jon Burr on bass and Frank Vignola on guitar. The critical acclaim was unanimous and immediate. The Chicago Tribune called it \"one of the finest discs of his career and one of the greatest jazz violin albums ever.\"\n\nAlso in 2001, Mr. O'Connor was commissioned by the Academy of St. Martin the Fields to create a concerto for violin and orchestra. \"Old Brass\" takes its inspiration from a Beaufort, South Carolina plantation designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nIn 2002, Mr. O'Connor formed a new chamber ensemble, the Appalachia Waltz Trio. The trio performs repertoire Mr. O'Connor created for his Appalachia Waltz and Appalachian Journey recording projects. The Appalachia Waltz Trio released its first album, Crossing Bridges, in 2004 on Mr. O'Connor's OMAC recording label.\n\nIn recent years, as word of his considerable writing talents have spread, Mark O'Connor's compositions are being embraced by a variety of performers. Yo-Yo Ma has recorded the solo cello version of \"Appalachia Waltz\" and frequently performs it in recital. Dance troupes, including Twyla Tharp, the New York City Ballet and Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, are constantly discovering Mr. O'Connor's expressive American music.\n\nThe recipient of numerous commissioning grants, including \"Meet the Composer,\" in 1998, he received a commission from the McKim Fund of Library of Congress for a new violin sonata which he premiered in that year at the Library and was broadcast on National Public Radio. His a cappella \"Folk Mass\" will receive its world premiere in February in New York City, performed by Gloriae Dei Cantores, the choral ensemble that commissioned the piece. In May 2002, he delivered the commencement address and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Public Service Degree from The Sage Colleges in Troy/Albany, N.Y. for his many contributions to music and the cause of music education.\n\nMark O'Connor has appeared at The White House, the Presidential Inauguration Celebration and the ceremonies of Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Games for which he composed \"Olympic Reel.\" He is often featured on major network television shows, and past appearances include \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" \"Great Performances\" on PBS, the \"Kennedy Center Honors\" and America's celebration of Israel's 50th birthday televised on CBS.\n\nMr. O'Connor regularly teaches master classes and has conducted symposia at many schools of music including The Juilliard School of Music, Tanglewood, Aspen, the Berklee College of Music, UCLA, the Eastman School of Music and the Blair School of Music at Vanderbilt University. Mark generously donates his time in support of a number of organizations that promote music education and outreach, including Opus 118, Midori and Friends, Sphinx, and the Music For Life Alliance. He serves on the advisory panel for the selection of the Kennedy Center Honors and is affiliated with Arts4All, a nationally recognized provider of cultural web content. He is founder of the internationally recognized Mark O'Connor Fiddle Camp and Strings Conference. At the Mark O'Connor Fiddle Camp near Nashville, Tennessee and the Mark O'Connor Strings Conference near San Diego, California, Mr. O'Connor assembles a world-class faculty to teach in a number of musical styles. These gatherings routinely draw participants from across the U.S. and Canada, as well as from Europe, South America and Asia.\n\nThe Grammy-winning Mark O'Connor Band is currently tour nationwide.", "otherInfo": "https://www.musicmondays.org/february-2020"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Suliman Tekalli", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6078114.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Mon Feb 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-24", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Carnegie Hall - Weill Music Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Ensemble Connect curates a one-hour multidisciplinary event that invites the audience into the world of improvisation.

Born on a military base in Nogales, Arizona in 1922 and raised in Watts, California, his earliest musical influences came from the church\u2013 choir and group singing\u2013 and from \u201chearing Duke Ellington over the radio when [he] was eight years old.\u201d He studied double bass and composition in a formal way (five years with H. Rheinshagen, principal bassist of the New York Philharmonic, and compositional techniques with the legendary Lloyd Reese) while absorbing vernacular music from the great jazz masters, first-hand. His early professional experience, in the 40\u2019s, found him touring with bands like Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory and Lionel Hampton.\n\nEventually he settled in New York where he played and recorded with the leading musicians of the 1950\u2019s\u2013 Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Art Tatum and Duke Ellington himself. One of the few bassists to do so, Mingus quickly developed as a leader of musicians. He was also an accomplished pianist who could have made a career playing that instrument. By the mid-50\u2019s he had formed his own publishing and recording companies to protect and document his growing repertoire of original music. He also founded the \u201cJazz Workshop,\u201d a group which enabled young composers to have their new works performed in concert and on recordings.\n\nMingus soon found himself at the forefront of the avant-garde. His recordings bear witness to the extraordinarily creative body of work that followed. They include: Pithecanthropus Erectus, The Clown, Tijuana Moods, Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Ah Um, The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, Cumbia and Jazz Fusion, Let My Children Hear Music. He recorded over a hundred albums and wrote over three hundred scores.\nAlthough he wrote his first concert piece, \u201cHalf-Mast Inhibition,\u201d when he was seventeen years old, it was not recorded until twenty years later by a 22-piece orchestra with Gunther Schuller conducting. It was the presentation of \u201cRevelations\u201d which combined jazz and classical idioms, at the 1955 Brandeis Festival of the Creative Arts, that established him as one of the foremost jazz composers of his day.\n\nIn 1971 Mingus was awarded the Slee Chair of Music and spent a semester teaching composition at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In the same year his autobiography, Beneath the Underdog, was published by Knopf. In 1972 it appeared in a Bantam paperback and was reissued after his death, in 1980, by Viking/Penguin and again by Pantheon Books, in 1991. In 1972 he also re-signed with Columbia Records. His music was performed frequently by ballet companies, and Alvin Ailey choreographed an hour program called \u201cThe Mingus Dances\u201d during a 1972 collaboration with the Robert Joffrey Ballet Company.\n\nHe toured extensively throughout Europe, Japan, Canada, South America and the United States until the end of 1977 when he was diagnosed as having a rare nerve disease, Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis. He was confined to a wheelchair, and although he was no longer able to write music on paper or compose at the piano, his last works were sung into a tape recorder.\n\nFrom the 1960\u2019s until his death in 1979 at age 56, Mingus remained in the forefront of American music. When asked to comment on his accomplishments, Mingus said that his abilities as a bassist were the result of hard work but that his talent for composition came from God.\n\nMingus received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Smithsonian Institute, and the Guggenheim Foundation (two grants). He also received an honorary degree from Brandeis and an award from Yale University. At a memorial following Mingus\u2019 death, Steve Schlesinger of the Guggenheim Foundation commented that Mingus was one of the few artists who received two grants and added: \u201cI look forward to the day when we can transcend labels like jazz and acknowledge Charles Mingus as the major American composer that he is.\u201d The New Yorker wrote: \u201cFor sheer melodic and rhythmic and structural originality, his compositions may equal anything written in western music in the twentieth century.\u201d\n\nHe died in Mexico on January 5, 1979, and his wife, Sue Graham Mingus, scattered his ashes in the Ganges River in India. Both New York City and Washington, D.C. honored him posthumously with a \u201cCharles Mingus Day.\u201d\n\nAfter his death, the National Endowment for the Arts provided grants for a Mingus foundation created by Sue Mingus called \u201cLet My Children Hear Music\u201d which catalogued all of Mingus\u2019 works. The microfilms of these works were then given to the Music Division of the New York Public Library where they are currently available for study and scholarship \u2013 a first for jazz. Sue Mingus has founded three working repertory bands called the Mingus Dynasty, Mingus Orchestra, and the Mingus Big Band, which continue to perform his music. Biographies of Charles Mingus include Mingus by Brian Priestley, Mingus/Mingus by Janet Coleman and Al Young, Myself When I Am Real by Gene Santoro, and Tonight at Noon, a memoir by Sue Mingus.\n\nMingus\u2019 masterwork, \u201cEpitaph,\u201d a composition which is more than 4000 measures long and which requires two hours to perform, was discovered during the cataloguing process. With the help of a grant from the Ford Foundation, the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by Gunther Schuller, in a concert produced by Sue Mingus at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989, ten years after Mingus\u2019 death.\n\nThe New Yorker wrote that \u201cEpitaph\u201d represents the first advance in jazz composition since Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cBlack, Brown, and Beige,\u201d which was written in 1943. The New York Times said it ranked with the \u201cmost memorable jazz events of the decade.\u201d Convinced that it would never be performed in his lifetime, Mingus called his work \u201cEpitaph,\u201d declaring that he wrote it \u201cfor my tombstone.\u201d\n\nThe Library of Congress purchased the Charles Mingus Collection, a major acquisition, in 1993; this included autographed manuscripts, photographs, literary manuscripts, correspondence, and tape recordings of interviews, broadcasts, recording sessions, and Mingus composing at the piano.\n\nSue Mingus has published a number of educational books through Hal Leonard Publishing, including Charles Mingus: More Than a Fake Book, Charles Mingus: More Than a Play-Along, Charles Mingus: Easy Piano Solos, many big band charts\u2014 including the Simply Mingus set of big band music charts\u2013 and a Mingus guitar book.\n\nReprinted in part from More than a Fake Book \u00a9 1991 Jazz Workshop, Inc.\n\nLinks to Additional Biographical and Historical Information on the Web\n\nLibrary of Congress\nAn index to the holdings of the Charles Mingus Collection, Music Division of the Library of Congress.\nhttp://www.loc.gov/performingarts/encyclopedia/collections/mingus.html", "otherInfo": "Each time I see him, whenever I think of him, I realize again how uncategorizable the man and his music are.

Chenier was literally born into the musical tradition of southwest Louisiana and Texas Zydeco, a chugging, accordion-led blend of French Creole and African-derived influences. Born the son of great Zydeco king Clifton Chenier, the first Grammy Award winning musician of his genre, C.J. was totally immersed in R&B, funk and jazz from childhood. Despite his family ties, or maybe because of them, C.J. wasn't terribly interested in his father's music as a teenager. A natural player, C.J. won a scholarship to study music at Texas Southern University and spent his college years exploring his own musical style.\n\nComing into adulthood, C.J.'s interest in the music of his ancestors grew and after college graduation he joined his father's legendary Red Hot Louisiana Band on the road. After his father's death in 1987, C.J. assumed leadership of the band. While he continued to develop his personal accordion style, C.J. also gradually began grafting on influences from his boyhood. As C.J. explains, \"I play it the way I play it. All my father really told me was to do the best I could do with my own style.\"\n\nFor The Desperate Kingdom of Love, C.J. reached back into his father's songbook and recorded a collection of some of the most urgent and heartfelt songs of his career, including \"Bogalusa Boogie\", a tribute to the Clarence Gatemouth Brown, the revered blues legend who died only days after Hurricane Katrina destroyed his home. A eclectic mix of covers like Hank Williams' \"Lost on the River\" and the devastating P.J. Harvey ballad \"The Desperate Kingdom of Love\" add to the somber canvas while Van Morrison's \"Comfort You\" offers healing. But a C.J. Chenier recording, like a traditional New Orlean's funeral, would not be complete without a tremor of hope for the future and a few great dance tunes. C.J. composed several classic songs (with Denise Labrie and Gerard Chenier) for the album including the plaintive \"I've Been Good To You Baby\" and the swinging mea culpa \"Who's Cheatin' Who?\"\n\nInspired by Bob Dylan's 1960's collaboration with The Band, C.J. Chenier sought out an existing working band to back him during these sessions. Rounder Records recording artists The Tarbox Ramblers fit the bill with a combination of tight musical camaraderie from years of touring and a deep knowledge of American roots music history. Augmented by session pianist Joe Deleault, the musicians quickly rehearsed and recorded these songs in the cavernous Room A of Boston's Q Division Studios in the autumn of 2005. Inspired by the 1950's Rudy Van Gelder jazz recordings for Blue Note, and Zydeco albums of Clifton Chenier, the songs were recorded live with everyone playing together in the studio with minimal overdubs.\n\nAside from performing and recording with his own ensemble, C.J. has worked with an impressive array of collaborators, including Paul Simon and The Gin Blossoms.

Titled Their Prime, the LP does sound like fucked-up Beatles. It sounds like, somewhere across an \u201880s universe, Lennon and McCartney discovered Can and Neu!, and maybe a little Sonic Youth and XTC along the way. Opening with \u201cLeft,\u201d it demonstrates that timeless knack for dreamy melodies \u2013 chord progressions that sound like they were created in a land far far away. Lyrically, however, it\u2019s imbued with a philosophical longing for answers to questions that have resurfaced for the first time since the explosion of counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\n\u201cWe gave you everything, what\u2019s left?\u201d asks Jo in the refrain. It\u2019s a question about art, about socialism, about the point of life. Considering the heaviness of the record, it\u2019s relieving to find Jo in his home studio in Vancouver (the unceded traditional territory of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations) with a regular tendency to burst into chuckling fits. You could put the laughter down to a nervous energy, and a charming one at that. Despite the fact that he\u2019s crucially aware of the world around him crumbling, he\u2019s not lost sight of his sense of fun. His approach to Their Prime was to create a collage record of everything he\u2019s inspired by. The last track \u201cPlaces Please\u201d he says is his attempt of trying to make Grouper dine out with Frank Ocean, whereas \u201cUndemo\u201d is This Heat versus Leonard Cohen. \u201cI was trying to infuse different sounds I thought could really work,\u201d he explains. \u201cLike, what if Nick Drake fronted Swans?\u201d I suggest Nick Drake might struggle in that role. He laughs again.\n\nOn the West Coast, Jo has been part of the DIY music scene since his late teens. Initially it was just him and his high school best friend Elliot Langford against the world. They were the \u201cfreaky music weirdos\u201d and they began their own band projects. Jo was pretty sure that it would be two of them riding into the sunset \u2013 or maybe the gloom \u2013 together. Personal circumstances and the phenomenon of the late 20s return of Saturn (for those who believe in astrology) got in the way. Their band Spr\u00efng called it a day. That\u2019s where the life of Jo Passed began. The idea of a band dynamic is far more appealing to Jo than solo projects, and the current incarnation of Jo Passed feels like its most robust yet.\n\nJo, along with his friend and drummer Mac Lawrie, moved across the country from Vancouver to Montreal. The two would play shows in Montreal and eventually tour the far right corner of North America. Upon Jo\u2019s return to the west coast, multi-instrumentalist Bella B\u00e9b\u00e9 officially joined the band in January of 2016, expanding Jo Passed from trio to a full quartet. Multimedia artist Megan-Magdalena Bourne began working with Jo Passed on a video project for the song \u201cRage\u201d (from the Out EP). This creative partnership would eventually lead to her taking on the role of bassist for the band.\n\nWhen not geeking out over The Zombies, or Nirvana, or Johann Sebastian Bach\u2026 Bella, Mac, and Megan have worked with Jo to realize the live experience of Their Prime, following two Jo Passed EPs titled Up and Out. Tonight is their first ever show as a foursome, and Jo is pumped.\n\n\u201cA project like this was never supposed to happen for me,\u201d he says, still surprised. \u201cSpr\u00efng was falling apart and was turning into something resembling my project, which was never the point of that band. Then I started to get this really bad insomnia and it culminated in me starting Jo Passed. The second I finished one song my insomnia went away.\u201d Jo needed a functional channel to pour his excess energy into. He\u2019s always been fidgety, writing songs from a young age, reared as a classical pianist, then learning guitar in his mid teens. \u201cJo Passed has been the first thing where I know that if I funnel all my energy into just being a songwriter, it\u2019ll be better for my health. It wasn\u2019t a career choice. It was survival.\u201d\n\nUpon Jo\u2019s return to Vancouver from Montreal, he\u2019d found a completely different way of existing. He admits to still having a love/hate relationship with Vancouver, and that\u2019s documented extensively in \u2018Their Prime\u2019, but it wasn\u2019t till moving to Montreal that he was afforded the informed perspective to re-investigate his identity as a Vancouver-based artist. Having spent his whole life here as the child of two dance choreographers, he has a very unique and informed perspective but is very quick to recognize the privileges his upbringing have granted him. In fact, his parents\u2019 leased studio space (KW Studios) allowed him to split the creation of \u2018Their Prime\u2019 between his own living space and a proper room. Sticking to his DIY approach he engineered and produced the album himself.\n\nGrowing up, he saw many facets of Vancouver \u2013 the gentrification, the poverty, the reality check he\u2019d have when he considered his family\u2019s struggles compared with those of Indigenous communities. He channeled his political and social awareness into the music communities he found when he was 18.\n\n\u201cThis album is my concept record of dealing with the idea of calling Vancouver home. There are struggles with the border, cost of living, space\u2026\u201d Jo shares a home with many others, and it doubles down as a venue, of which there\u2019s a dearth of sustainable venues in Vancouver. \u201cThere\u2019s this big question mark where even people in Vancouver are like, \u2018What is this city?\u2019\u201d\n\nTheir Prime is a record about identity and the loss of time that happens as a direct consequence of being in the city with nowhere to rent, no time outside of employment and no realistic expectations to live up to. It encompasses that fear of being beyond the glory years, the most creatively fruitful period of one\u2019s life. Those years were lost to contemporary struggles for working relationships, home, identity and space. \u201cIt\u2019s me owning my worst nightmare,\u201d he admits. \u201cA lot of the Jo Passed project has been about confronting fears. I was afraid to move away from Vancouver to Montreal on my own. Afraid to leave musical relationships I had. Afraid to bare the full responsibility of a project. I\u2019ve been putting out records and not ones anyone\u2019s necessarily heard. Being open about those fears is a good way of dealing with them. You end up at this point where you hit 30 and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh what happened? Am I done? Did I not activate my main creative energy?\u2019 It\u2019s a ridiculous idea but 30 feels a little like 1000 in rock n roll terms.\u201d You can hear the frustrations and the jitters in the crashing loud-and-quiet motifs throughout the album\u2019s twelve tracks, which offer up a patchwork quilt of sound, similar to Faust\u2019s IV or Fugazi\u2019s Red Medicine.\n\nThe first half of the record begins with the most doom-laden themes. \u2018Left\u2019, \u2018MDM\u2019 and \u2018Glass\u2019 are particularly end-of-the-world-y. \u201cThe songwriting was finished the day Leonard Cohen died, which was two days after Trump\u2019s victory, so there\u2019s a lot of that energy in the record,\u201d he says. The lyrics are troubled with a lack of purpose, a search for what even matters in art now, whether there\u2019s any way to impact still. \u201cI was trying to not get too grandiose in political statements and re-centre them in my own experiences,\u201d he says. \u201cGlass\u201d moves around the idea of a lack of belonging, a crisis of self: \u201cI\u2019m just a tenant in my birthplace\u201d sings Jo. \u201c\u2018Glass\u201d is pointed at Vancouver. I\u2019m a guest here. I\u2019m trying to encapsulate the experience of what it\u2019s like. I relate it to a slow regurgitation of a body: you\u2019re gradually being repulsed out of something sick, but you\u2019re fighting to be swallowed into it. I\u2019m asking \u2013 What\u2019s a home? Can you just buy one?\u201d\n\nOn the more celebratory tip comes \u201cUndemo,\u201d which is a song about communities of show goers and DIY music scenes. \u201cKilling times in the end times together,\u201d sings Jo. \u201cMusic scenes live under the guise of environmental collapse, neo-liberalism and Trumpism, yet we go and play music to each other. It\u2019s amazing existing in these communities. It\u2019s been life saving! You can get into this moralist guilt and think, if we\u2019re gathering here shouldn\u2019t we be forming activist groups? In my early 20s I felt a lot more of that righteousness. But there\u2019s two sides to all that. There\u2019s fighting the bad and there\u2019s also defending the good, ie, playing music in safe spaces and supporting each other creatively.\u201d\n\nPhysical spaces are so important in our social media-obsessed world. \u201cFacetook\u201d is a comment on that, whereas \u201cMillennial Trash Blues\u201d (a tongue-in-cheek poke at Bob Dylan) makes direct reference to this concept of the \u201csnowflake generation\u201dvia lyrics about snowflakes lying on the ground. \u201cWe\u2019re a bunch of unique snowflakes but it\u2019s actually the snowflakes of a burning trash fire.\u201d In as much as there\u2019s matter-of-fact depictions of harsh realities, there\u2019s also a sense of hope. None more so than on \u201cRepair,\u201d which was written the day of Trump\u2019s election. It combines soft melodies with walls of chaos. \u201cI was trying to make something that encourages fixing. We\u2019re losing track of that,\u201d adds Jo. Playing it live has proven itself to be particularly cathartic.\n\nIt\u2019s touring Their Prime and hearing people\u2019s reactions to it that are most at the forefront of Jo\u2019s mind right now. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019ve put all my negativity into a place and now I\u2019m lighting it on fire as a way of releasing it\u201d Indeed sometimes you have to banish the bad vibes to get to the great ones.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "131 W 3rd St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Jimmy Cobb", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-74.00074, 40.730839], "Date": "Mon Feb 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-24", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Blue Note Jazz Club", "moreBioInfo": "In a career spanning nearly six decades, drummer Jimmy Cobb has proven to be a master of every musical situation. One of jazz\u2019s definitive accompanists, Cobb made his name in support of such giants as Dinah Washington, Cannonball Adderley, Miles Davis, Wes Montgomery and Sarah Vaughan, and on literally hundreds of studio sessions. As the drummer on Davis\u2019 legendary album Kind of Blue, Cobb may be the most frequently heard (if not the best known) drummer in jazz history; and as part of the legendary Davis rhythm section with pianist Wynton Kelly and bassist Paul Chambers, he created a manner of swinging in the modern idiom that remains the gold standard for rhythmic inspiration.

By working clubs, dances, concerts and the shows that were featured in movie theaters, your growth was shaped. The way I play the cymbal, for instance, is something I heard from a guy who came through Washington.

Chenier was literally born into the musical tradition of southwest Louisiana and Texas Zydeco, a chugging, accordion-led blend of French Creole and African-derived influences. Born the son of great Zydeco king Clifton Chenier, the first Grammy Award winning musician of his genre, C.J. was totally immersed in R&B, funk and jazz from childhood. Despite his family ties, or maybe because of them, C.J. wasn't terribly interested in his father's music as a teenager. A natural player, C.J. won a scholarship to study music at Texas Southern University and spent his college years exploring his own musical style.\n\nComing into adulthood, C.J.'s interest in the music of his ancestors grew and after college graduation he joined his father's legendary Red Hot Louisiana Band on the road. After his father's death in 1987, C.J. assumed leadership of the band. While he continued to develop his personal accordion style, C.J. also gradually began grafting on influences from his boyhood. As C.J. explains, \"I play it the way I play it. All my father really told me was to do the best I could do with my own style.\"\n\nFor The Desperate Kingdom of Love, C.J. reached back into his father's songbook and recorded a collection of some of the most urgent and heartfelt songs of his career, including \"Bogalusa Boogie\", a tribute to the Clarence Gatemouth Brown, the revered blues legend who died only days after Hurricane Katrina destroyed his home. A eclectic mix of covers like Hank Williams' \"Lost on the River\" and the devastating P.J. Harvey ballad \"The Desperate Kingdom of Love\" add to the somber canvas while Van Morrison's \"Comfort You\" offers healing. But a C.J. Chenier recording, like a traditional New Orlean's funeral, would not be complete without a tremor of hope for the future and a few great dance tunes. C.J. composed several classic songs (with Denise Labrie and Gerard Chenier) for the album including the plaintive \"I've Been Good To You Baby\" and the swinging mea culpa \"Who's Cheatin' Who?\"\n\nInspired by Bob Dylan's 1960's collaboration with The Band, C.J. Chenier sought out an existing working band to back him during these sessions. Rounder Records recording artists The Tarbox Ramblers fit the bill with a combination of tight musical camaraderie from years of touring and a deep knowledge of American roots music history. Augmented by session pianist Joe Deleault, the musicians quickly rehearsed and recorded these songs in the cavernous Room A of Boston's Q Division Studios in the autumn of 2005. Inspired by the 1950's Rudy Van Gelder jazz recordings for Blue Note, and Zydeco albums of Clifton Chenier, the songs were recorded live with everyone playing together in the studio with minimal overdubs.\n\nAside from performing and recording with his own ensemble, C.J. has worked with an impressive array of collaborators, including Paul Simon and The Gin Blossoms. A self-described \"road dog\", C.J. will be touring extensively in North America for 2010.", "otherInfo": "CJ Chenier"}, {"Address": "881 7th Ave, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "Lucy Crowe", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9161478.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.980276, 40.764881], "Date": "Mon Feb 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-24", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Stern Auditorium / Perelman Stage at Carnegie Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Beethoven the boisterous humorist, heaven-storming revolutionary, and all-embracing humanist appear in his last two symphonies.

As a leader, he\u2019s recorded four critically acclaimed albums; his most recent release, Art of the Arrangement (Artistshare, 2017), is rapidly garnering critical acclaim, earning a 4 Star review in the November 2017 issue of Downbeat Magazine.\n\nBeavers currents leads a multi-faceted and active career touring, recording, producing and engineering for top New York City and world artists. Always a strong advocate for music education, he can be seen teaching an extensive number of annual masterclasses and workshops in Mexico and Colombia, and at his studio in New York City with the New York Jazz Workshop.", "otherInfo": "Special Performance\nGrammy Award Winner Doug Beavers \"Titanes del Tromb\u00f3n\"\nFebruary 24, 2020, 9p\n\nfeat.

Instrumentations now veer more towards electro-pop, but her storytelling and heartfelt lyricism is still every bit as cerebral. Jaffe\u2019s voice was featured in the Disney Pixar short The Blue Umbrella scored by Jon Brion. She can also be heard in the Occulus virtual reality short Dear Angelica and has recently composed music for Never Goin\u2019 Back, which premiered 2018 at Sundance. She\u2019s toured the US and Europe multiple times, performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! And shared the stage with Norah Jones, Patty Griffin, Erykah Badu, Metric, Chelsea Wolfe, Midlake, Blitzen Trapper and Cyndi Lauper to name a few. She\u2019s been featured on NPR, Jaffe also has a writing partnership with hip-hop producer S1 And the duo\u2019s first collaboration, \u201cBad Guy,\u201d appears on Eminem\u2019s Grammy Award winning MMLP2.\n\nJaffe\u2019s newest release, SMUT, follows the July release of her companion EPs This is Better Pt.1 & This is Better Pt. 2, which ultimately saw Jaffe embrace the grieving process of an intense heartbreak. SMUT on the other hand, was born from the newfound freedom, confidence, and self-exploration Jaffe found at the hands of being single.\n\nThe writing of the two \u201cThis is Better\" EPs was DEEPLY cathartic for me. Outside of my family and my friends, creating in the studio with (producer) Aaron Kelley and writing those songs propelled me to the light at the end of the tunnel. Before those eps came out, I found myself, once again, in a very different head space.\n\nI was having a lot of fun being single again. I hadn\u2019t been single since my mid-twenties. I was traveling a lot. I was living alone for the first time in my adult life.\u201cSMUT\u201d is another group of songs that were written to capture this time. The title came about in the middle of recording it all though. My girlfriend\u2019s roommate got this voicemail from a stranger years ago that ended up in my inbox THANK GOODNESS. It was a lil\u2019 shooting star that I had to catch so I asked if Aaron and I could sample it. And in the making of that track, I just thought SMUT was such a satiating word. A word that feels good to say but carries some raunch with it. \u2013 Sarah Jaffe\n\nWith stand-out tracks like \u201cSmall Talk\u201d and \u201cImportant,\u201d SMUT leans into more upbeat territories \u2013 the spatial and ambient electronics are ever-present, but the melodies, lyrics and instrumentation across the EP are uplifting and energized. After teaming up on This is Better Pt.1 and Pt.2, Jaffe and Dallas-based producer Aaron Kelley continue to evolve their collaborative sound, utilizing vocal samples as instruments and letting cascading synth lines drive the rhythm on SMUT. Press outlets have already taken notice of the duo\u2019s unique production and ability to encapsulate raw emotion and heartbreak, with NYLON stating Jaffe\u2019s music is the \u201cSelf-Care Reminder We Need\u201d and Refinery29 saying it \u201cnails the feeling.\u201d", "otherInfo": "RSVP annieo@standardhotels.com"}, {"Address": "116 E 27th St, New York, NY 10016", "Artist": "James Shipp", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6027289.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983746, 40.742276], "Date": "Tue Feb 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 AM", "Venue": "Jazz Standard", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Playing vibes and percussion with this Grammy-nominated band at one of the best venues to see jazz in New York City."}, {"Address": "3505 Hampton Rd, Oceanside, NY 11572", "Artist": "Limestone Flowerchild", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9772481.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.654327, 40.624956], "Date": "Tue Feb 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-25", "Genre": "Genres: Jam Rock, Blues, Gospel", "Time": "11:00 AM", "Venue": "South Shore Craft Brewery", "moreBioInfo": "A prism of countercultural colors, the music of Limestone Flowerchild echoes spiritual canon with the grace of the bards.

Being in a band is hard. Making it work for 20 years? That is really, really hard.\n\nThis has certainly been the case for Louisville, KY-based metal band FLAW. The band has seen multiple line-up changes over the years, however the core of Chris Volz's vocals has remained as the creative driving force and is poised to re-emerge on the strength of their finest set of recordings to date. The band has signed a deal with Pavement Entertainment, and is set to release Divided We Fall on August 19, 2016.\n\nFLAW\u2019s story began with the independent release of home-grown albums American Arrogance (1996), Flaw (1998) and Drama (2000). It was the songs on these recordings that garnered the attention of Universal Republic Records, who signed the band and released the break-through Through The Eyes in 2001. The offering topped the Billboard \"Heatseekers\" chart, largely fueled by the singles \"Payback\" and \"Whole.\" The band then followed-up with an album entitled Endangered Species via Republic in 2004, but soon thereafter the band went through personnel changes and ended their relationship with the label. The band\u2019s tumultuous relationship with themselves, and their label, were reflected in their songs. It was the life and energy captured in these songs that propelled the band forward. It was always FLAW fans\u2019 connection to their songs that carried the band on. \u201cWe would not be where we are today without our hardcore fans,\u201d says Volz. \u201cThe Flaw Family is the backbone of everything we do, and we cannot wait to get out and tour in support of this new record\u201d.\n\nFLAW a band that is re-emerging on the strength of renewed focus and energy, and that energy is captured on the lead single from \u201cDivided We Fall\u201d, a song called \u201cLive and Breathe\u201d that is a vessel of raw human experience and emotion.

Chenier was literally born into the musical tradition of southwest Louisiana and Texas Zydeco, a chugging, accordion-led blend of French Creole and African-derived influences. Born the son of great Zydeco king Clifton Chenier, the first Grammy Award winning musician of his genre, C.J. was totally immersed in R&B, funk and jazz from childhood. Despite his family ties, or maybe because of them, C.J. wasn't terribly interested in his father's music as a teenager. A natural player, C.J. won a scholarship to study music at Texas Southern University and spent his college years exploring his own musical style.\n\nComing into adulthood, C.J.'s interest in the music of his ancestors grew and after college graduation he joined his father's legendary Red Hot Louisiana Band on the road. After his father's death in 1987, C.J. assumed leadership of the band. While he continued to develop his personal accordion style, C.J. also gradually began grafting on influences from his boyhood. As C.J. explains, \"I play it the way I play it. All my father really told me was to do the best I could do with my own style.\"\n\nFor The Desperate Kingdom of Love, C.J. reached back into his father's songbook and recorded a collection of some of the most urgent and heartfelt songs of his career, including \"Bogalusa Boogie\", a tribute to the Clarence Gatemouth Brown, the revered blues legend who died only days after Hurricane Katrina destroyed his home. A eclectic mix of covers like Hank Williams' \"Lost on the River\" and the devastating P.J. Harvey ballad \"The Desperate Kingdom of Love\" add to the somber canvas while Van Morrison's \"Comfort You\" offers healing. But a C.J. Chenier recording, like a traditional New Orlean's funeral, would not be complete without a tremor of hope for the future and a few great dance tunes. C.J. composed several classic songs (with Denise Labrie and Gerard Chenier) for the album including the plaintive \"I've Been Good To You Baby\" and the swinging mea culpa \"Who's Cheatin' Who?\"\n\nInspired by Bob Dylan's 1960's collaboration with The Band, C.J. Chenier sought out an existing working band to back him during these sessions. Rounder Records recording artists The Tarbox Ramblers fit the bill with a combination of tight musical camaraderie from years of touring and a deep knowledge of American roots music history. Augmented by session pianist Joe Deleault, the musicians quickly rehearsed and recorded these songs in the cavernous Room A of Boston's Q Division Studios in the autumn of 2005. Inspired by the 1950's Rudy Van Gelder jazz recordings for Blue Note, and Zydeco albums of Clifton Chenier, the songs were recorded live with everyone playing together in the studio with minimal overdubs.\n\nAside from performing and recording with his own ensemble, C.J. has worked with an impressive array of collaborators, including Paul Simon and The Gin Blossoms. A self-described \"road dog\", C.J. will be touring extensively in North America for 2010.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "601 Main St, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "The Extensions", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8929438.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.021569, 40.193983], "Date": "Tue Feb 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-25", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Power Pop, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Saint", "moreBioInfo": "The Extensions are the Asbury Park equivalent of Fleetwood Mac to Buckingham Nicks and The Hold Steady to Lifter Puller.

With a love of music and skateboarding, Lindell formed a few punky garage bands early on while his musical horizons expanded. He listened to the deep blues of Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Jimmy Reed and Albert King before drifting toward the R&B sounds of The Impressions, Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway, soaking up the soul and learning how to craft a song. After performing at bars on the West Coast with a few short-lived bands, Eric formed his own group in 1993. He quickly gained a loyal Northern California audience thanks to countless performances and many late-night jam sessions. Established stars like Charlie Musselwhite and Tom Waits attended his shows, as did overflow crowds of music fans.\n\nWith music on his mind, Lindell headed to New Orleans in 1999, where he quickly discovered the pulsating and dynamic roots scene. He gravitated toward the West Bank dive bars of Gretna and Algiers, where he befriended many older area musicians who helped him get regular work as a performer. Some of New Orleans' finest players, including keyboardist Ivan Neville and drummers Harold Brown (War), Stanton Moore (Galactic) and Johnny Vidacovich (Professor Longhair, Astral Project) often joined him on stage. Galactic bassist Rob Mercurio began sitting in as well, and word of Lindell's immense talents quickly spread around the city. Stars like Branford Marsalis, The Neville Brothers and John Scofield began showing up at his gigs and embracing this fresh California kid's funky music. According to Lindell, \"It's a great feeling to be recognized for your music in New Orleans.\" Since 2003, in addition to his own gigs, Lindell regularly joins forces with Ivan Neville, Moore and Mercurio (when time and schedules permit) and they perform to overflow crowds as Dragon Smoke.\n\n2006's Change In The Weather delighted and surprised music fans hungry for a truly original artist. Lindell's deceptively simple sounding songs, laid back grooves and hook-laden melodies were fueled by guests including Brown, Neville and Moore. Critics across the country went wild, with reviews and features in Relix, OffBeat, Guitar Player, Down Beat, The New Yorker, The New York Press and many other national and regional publications. Singer And Musician magazine put Eric on the cover and many newspaper entertainment sections did the same.\n\n2007's Low On Cash, Rich In Love and 2009's Gulf Coast Highway pushed Lindell farther into the spotlight. Appearances on Late Night With Conan O'Brien and National Public Radio's Mountain Stage solidified his stature as an artist who simply could not be ignored. Many of his songs have appeared in films and television shows, including Boston Legal and Treme. He has collaborated and shared stages with blues and rock luminaries, including John Fogerty, Luther Dickinson and Anson Funderburgh.\n\nWith Revolution In Your Heart, Lindell was more than ready to come home to Alligator. \"The timing is perfect. I'm so excited to get back to focusing on what I do and have such a great team behind me,\" he says. Upon release of the album, Lindell and his band will tour heavily, reuniting with old friends and, as always, earning new fans at every stop. AllMusic declares Lindell a singular talent, saying, \"He plays soulful, funk-drenched, tight and focused grooves. He is a quadruple threat as a solid songwriter, impressive guitarist, affecting singer and harmonica blower. This is music that's deceptively difficult to create. Lindell makes it seem not just easy, but natural.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "10 W Front St, Red Bank, NJ 07701", "Artist": "Tymaresmusic", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8547641.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.065755, 40.35227], "Date": "Tue Feb 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Downtown", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "66 North 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Grayscale", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9189592.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.96168, 40.71925], "Date": "Tue Feb 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-25", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Alternative, Pop Punk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Music Hall of Williamsburg", "moreBioInfo": "Since forming in 2011, when its band members were only in high school, the Philadelphia-based quintet\u2014composed of vocalist Collin Walsh, guitarist/vocalist Dallas Molster, guitarist Andrew Kyne, bassist Nick Ventimiglia and drummer Nick Veno\u2014has emerged quickly from the Philadelphia punk scene, establishing a solid fan base and sharing stages with the likes of Cute Is What We Aim For, Knuckle Puck, Neck Deep, Seaway, and more.

In 2008 Bluhm released her first album, Toby\u2019s Song and with its release put together her band The Gramblers. Nicki went on to release her second effort Driftwood (2012) establishing her and the band as a nationally touring act. While playing shows around the country she and the band decided to pass the time and long drives filming what became their viral \u201cVan Sessions\u201d covering nostalgic songs of their past. In the aftermath, Bluhm and The Gramblers became headliners, touring constantly throughout North America, including festivals like Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, Newport Folk and Telluride Bluegrass.\n\nThe band continued to record and put out two albums including their self titled Nicki Bluhm and The Gramblers (2013) and their most recent effort Loved Wild Lost (2015), launching them on an extended US tour and their debut European tour. The Chicago Tribune wrote \u201cNicki has filled a void in music with her brand of vintage-tinged rocking country soul \u2013 music that\u2019s like an enchanting friend you\u2019ve known for a short while, but feels like you\u2019ve known forever.\u201d\n\nAt the completion of their 2016 Loved Wild Lost tour, Nicki was asked to join the The Infamous Stringdusters in support of their album Ladies and Gentlemen. That project led to a collaboration with Ryan Adams at Telluride Bluegrass, Newport Folk and on Stephen Colbert\u2019s The Late Show. Nicki has also had the honor of singing with musicians including Warren Haynes and Gov\u2019t Mule, Karl Denson, Boz Scaggs, Anders Osborne, Bonnie Raitt, Phil Lesh, Jackie Green, and many others.\n\nIn early 2017, inspired by the current US political climate, Nicki wrote a song called \u201cRemember Love Wins\u201d. She recorded and released it, with an accompanying video, in a seven-day burst of creative energy. It received a nod from Rolling Stone saying: \u201c\u2018Remember Love Wins\u2019, like Pete Seeger singing \u2018We Shall Overcome,\u2019 hits not just on the struggle ahead, but our ability to eventually come out on the right side of history.\u201d Most recently, Nicki was the voice of Sarah on the tender duet \u201cNo Wrong Way Home\u201d in the short animated film Pearl, which was nominated for an Oscar.\n\nNicki\u2019s future holds new songs, recordings and many more performances as a solo performer, as a guest vocalist and with The Gramblers. Both on record and in her live performances, she will continue to explore new directions, touching her listeners with her smoky vocals and dynamic stage presence.\n\nStay tuned for the next chapter\u2026", "otherInfo": "ft.

One of jazz\u2019s definitive accompanists, Cobb made his name in support of such giants as Dinah Washington, Cannonball Adderley, Miles Davis, Wes Montgomery and Sarah Vaughan, and on literally hundreds of studio sessions. As the drummer on Davis\u2019 legendary album Kind of Blue, Cobb may be the most frequently heard (if not the best known) drummer in jazz history; and as part of the legendary Davis rhythm section with pianist Wynton Kelly and bassist Paul Chambers, he created a manner of swinging in the modern idiom that remains the gold standard for rhythmic inspiration. For all his achievements, however, Jimmy Cobb\u2019s contribution has too often been taken for granted, which is why he is the perfect subject to help launch the new Honors Series from Marsalis Music.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of music coming through Washington, D.C. when I was growing up,\u201d Cobb notes in explaining the development of his style, \u201cand as a working musician you had to play in a whole lot of situations. By working clubs, dances, concerts and the shows that were featured in movie theaters, your growth was shaped. The way I play the cymbal, for instance, is something I heard from a guy who came through Washington. It\u2019s not exactly how he played it, of course; it\u2019s how I heard it.\u201d\n\nWhat Cobb heard \u2013 a lean, assertive beat that drives a band without calling attention to itself \u2013 shaped some of the most influential music of the \u201850s and \u201860s. His stints with Cannonball Adderley (1956-7), Miles Davis (1958-63) and the cooperative trio with Wynton Kelly and Paul Chambers that worked both on its own and in support of Wes Montgomery (1963-8), as well as countless recordings by a who\u2019s-who of jazz greats, confirmed his mastery in the small-group format.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "599 Johnson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Sharkswimmer", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.923155, 40.709325], "Date": "Tue Feb 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-25", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Elsewhere - Zone One", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Elsewhere is intended to be a safe space to enjoy music, art, expression, and free play.

Whether performing with his own quartet or supporting Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett on tour, Newman\u2019s expert trumpeteering and effervescent stage presence reignited a big band scene in New York City, and has since enticed a new generation of jazz fans across the globe. The Verve Recording artist continues to reign at his weekly residency in New York, as well as appear on television programs and in special performances across the United States and Europe.\nNewman is known for his impeccable horn playing and rendition of romantic favorites. But what sets him apart is his ability to command a room not only with his musical talent, but as a bandleader who makes each person in the audience feel as if they are a part of his performance. His fusion of music playing and easy going banter captures the vivacity of great bandleaders of the past. This exuberance is evident on Newman\u2019s 2016 debut album, Eyes on the City, which pays tribute to his musical journey in New York.\nAlong with his Quartet, fellow musicians from Cincinnati\u2019s College-Conservatory of Music, Newman has allured audiences during his residencies at some of New York\u2019s most iconic venues. His first foray into creating an old school big band night was at the elegant Duane Park for \u201cAfter Dark,\u201d a jazz and burlesque revue on the downtown scene in Tribeca. \u201cAfter Dark\u201d lead to a weekly residency at the legendary Oak Room at The Plaza Hotel, a venue steeped in history which was frequented by the likes of Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli and countless others over its one hundred year history. Newman and his Quartet played each Wednesday to a mixed crowd seeking a slice of history, welcoming Lady Gaga as a surprise guest, until the venue closed in 2011. Currently, Newman performs every Tuesday and Thursday, as bandleader in a residency at Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel, and select Friday nights at NYC\u2019s legendary Rainbow Room with his orchestra.

The Jack Daniel\u2019s partnership in 2012, which launched the brand\u2019s Sinatra Select premium Tennessee Whiskey, brought Newman alongside Frank Sinatra Jr. himself, in a performance in Cannes, France.\nBrian married burlesque star, Angie Pontani of the World Famous Pontani Sisters in February 2013, with whom he most notably performs in connection with Pontani\u2019s New York Burlesque Festival and Burlesque-a-Pades shows.

As children of the 80s and 90s, they witnessed first-hand the rise of personal computers, the invention of the Internet, and the emergence of a global community. As adults, they also bore witness to the global cultural shifts that happened after 9/11, and then faced the financial crisis of 2008 as they were beginning to build their careers, families, and livelihoods. In the modern age of music, TNL straddles the divide between analogue and digital in their minds, hearts, and bodies. And their songs are also about straddling a line between youth and adulthood; they write about becoming an adult in the modern age, navigating waters that stretch into an ever-expanding universe.\n\nSonically, TNL is a unique blend of guitar-driven songs, layered with intricate piano, pop-rock vocals, and powerful yet sophisticated drums. It\u2019s American heartland rock for the modern era, for Gen Xers who miss guitars in Top 40 music, who identify with the familiar echoes of 1960s girl groups, and who seek out today\u2019s rootsy indie-rock.\n\nTNL was founded by songwriters Liza Zitelli Grabowski and Jon Ryan Grabowski, who began playing together in New York City in 2009. When childhood friend Paul began to join them for shows around NYC in 2010, along with Zitelli siblings Diana and Andrew, TNL was born.\n\nIn 2013, TNL independently produced and released their first EP, Less Radio (recorded at Sweet Sounds Studios in NYC). Less Radio is a rock record that expresses the inspirations and frustrations of the city and its satellites. Navigating urban and suburban landscapes, the characters of Less Radio are always in motion\u2014on stages and subways in \u201cSkyline Blues\u201d and \u201cTime Out, New York,\u201d on ghostly trains in \u201cPenn Station,\u201d and on lonely highways in \u201cDead End Rock.\u201d They even move in and out of the nostalgic past in \u201cCharlotte Arms\u201d and the dystopian, radio-less future of the haunting title track.\n\nThe blog RockNYC Live and Recorded named Less Radio #22 best album of 2013 and the song \u201cTimeout, New York\u201d as the #16 best song released in 2013. Blog founder and NYC music critic Iman Lababedi wrote, \u201cImagine Ronnie Spector fronting the E Street Band singing Springsteen-Goffin-King songs, and you will have an idea of what they are going for...It is like they are the last band in town writing new, young, classic rock worth a damn.\"\n\nWith the additions of Nick, Petros, Colin, and Amy over the next few years, TNL expanded its sound and released its first LP, Signals, on Feb 24, 2017. Recorded at Water Music Studios in Hoboken, NJ, Signals is a collection American stories set in the new millennium, as told by characters who consider the redeeming powers of community, love, music, and spirituality. The 8-song LP features an American heartland-rock sound\u2014lush and spirited piano, powerful yet sophisticated drums, and driving guitar and bass, with crisp vocals and harmonies.\n\nIn his review of the Signals, Jersey Beat music blogger Joe Wawrzyniak wrote, \u201cThe robust vocals project a winning blend of strength and vigor. The harmonic arrangements boast everything from meaty guitar riffs to rousing horn lines to mighty rolling drums. Whether it's the fist-pumping anthem \u2018American Summer\u2019 or the tremendous headlong rush of \u2018Into the Night,\u2019 there's plenty to relish on this hugely enjoyable album.\u201d\n\nA record-release show for Signals was held on Feb 25, 2017, at the legendary Maxwell's in Hoboken, to a sold out crowd.\n\nTNL\u2019s next full-length release is planned for 2020, with singles from the new record being released in late 2019. On October 25, 2019, TNL released \u201cHow It All Went Down,\u201d the first single from the forthcoming 2020 release. \u201cHow It All Went Down\u201d is a powerful, up-tempo rock song driving guitars, a powerful rhythm section, crisp vocals and harmonies, and lush piano. It touches on themes of loss, motherhood, and storytelling, working towards a cathartic emotional ending.\n\nWith Grammy-nominated Chris Badami producing the new material, with mastering by the renowned Scott Hull of Masterdisk, TNL looks to help carry on the story of American songwriting in the millennial age.", "otherInfo": "Come celebrate Mardi Gras with us at the wonderful Hat City Kitchen!"}, {"Address": "702 Union St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Drew Anderson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8760724.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.980048, 40.676115], "Date": "Tue Feb 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-25", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Union Hall", "moreBioInfo": "A native of Richmond, Virginia, Drew began playing the trumpet at the tender age of 6.

Within a year, she was playing outside of Yugoslavia and opening shows for American blues icons like Junior Wells. By 1998, her band was doing 100 shows annually and appearing regularly on Yugoslavian television. Her debut CD, Hometown, provided a first glimpse of her talents as a singer and guitarist.\n\nIn 1999, Ana relocated to the Netherlands to study jazz guitar. She quickly became a fixture on the Dutch blues scene and soon ventured into neighboring Germany. With Comfort to the Soul (2003), Popovic took her burgeoning career to the next level, she delivered another diverse package of blues, rock, soul and jazz. The album makes one thing clear.

He began his musical journey at the age 12, playing saxophone, flute and drums, and eventually, exclusively drums. He played mostly jazz all through his teens. After earning a BA in History from Wagner College in 1973, and after studying with Jack DeJohnette, Bob Moses and Steve Haas he moved to NYC in 1975 to pursue his musical career. From 1975 to 1984 Baratta played gigs in and around NYC and other locales. Some of his bandmates and associations were with John Stubblefield, Joe Ford, Frank Strozier, Hal Galper, Mike Richmond, Saheb Sarbib, Dennis Irwin, Vernon Reid, Billy Bang, Jack Wilkens, Ryo Kawasaki, Jessica Hagedorn and the Gangster Choir, Guilherme Franco, Pe De Boi, Cyro Baptista, and a very memorable one day hit with Hank Mobley and then Johnny Hartman.\n\nIn 1984, Baratta decided to dramatically alter paths, and pursued a career in movie production. \"Money was tight, the gigs were hard to come by, and I was getting married and wanted to raise a family. It was just time for a very tough decision that had to be made. I looked back many times and terribly missed the joy in playing and the camaraderie with the musicians. It was a total about face, but I have no regrets, except missing the live performance.\"\n\nSince working on his his film, Desperately Seeking Susan in 1984, Baratta has worked on over 50 movies, first as a Location Manager, then Unit Production Manager, and for the past 15 years as a Co-Producer and Executive Producer. A small sampling of his films is Martin Scorsese\u2019s soon-to-be-released The Irishman, Dr.Strange, The Wolf of Wall Street, five Spiderman movies,Too Big To Fail, Taking Pelham 123, Across the Universe, Donnie Brasco, Working Girl, and Big. Currently he is Executive Producing Romeo, a film staring Joaquin Phoenix. For a full listing of Baratta's film credits, visit IMDb: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0053102\n\nDuring the past 33 years of movie making it never prevented Baratta from regularly listening to and attending music at most all the clubs in NYC and festivals elsewhere. As best he could, he tried to maintain relationships with his past bandmates and stay up on the jazz scene. However, with the exception of the occasional one nite gig every few years, Baratta essentially remained on the sidelines when it came to performing. Then a very fortuitous event occurred.\n\nAn opportunity presented itself in the fall of 2016 that changed everything. He decided to return to his roots and main love and began performing music again, while continuing to produce films. From December 2016 to the present he has played with Eric Alexander, Vincent Herring, Walter Blanding, Marcus Printup, Bruce Harris, Gerald Cannon, Bill O\u2019Connell, Emmett Cohen, Jeb Patton, Steve Ash, Chris Pattishal, Mike LeDonne, Ray Gallon, Danny Nimmer, Jerry Weldon, Rogerio Bocatto, Paul Bollenback, Dave Stryker, Mike Goetz, Essiet Essiet, Yoshi Waki, and many others.

Sadly, I attempted violin as a young child and was brutally bad. My parents had some how had me listening to classical music at that time which probably explains the violin attempt. Then a miracle happened\u2026First, the Beatles arrived so, bye bye classical & then my aunt who was buying a new piano (the wealthier end of the family) offered me her old one. I\u2019m 8 1/2 so I was still agreeable to anything so I promised to take lessons and really work at it.\nI lied\u2026After a year and a half I quit\u2026..until I discovered Elton John. That was it! I was determined to be a musician. In the late 70\u2019s I joined a fairly succesful 50\u2019s/60\u2019s band called Slick. I played 6 nights a week and worked full time at a department store as a stock man (person in this politically correct universe). Exhaustion wasn\u2019t considered. I went to gigs with a thermos of tea and lemon since I was always sick. This lasted until the early 80\u2019s. I joined a band called Loose Change which (under my direction) played anything from the 1960\u2019s- whatever was current. That lasted 12 years. Many years of putting my ears in harms way and breathing in way to much bar smoke told me it was time to quit. This was somewhere around 1993/94 (I don\u2019t remember). The next time I played live was in 2004 at my local block party. That\u2019s what I needed to get the itch to play again but, I was working in retail at Sam Ash Music and simply had no time to gig. In 2007 I was offered a better job which offered me a 9-5 existence. The economy turned sour and earning extra cash became a priority. And then it happened\u2026.I walked into a local Italian restaurant called Vera\u2019s Trattoria to pick up a pizza and lo and behold (fancy words ehh?) a piano player was pumping out Jazz licks. Can you imagine? Live music! I decided to approach the owner to see if I could score a gig. He decided to try me the following week. I was hired as a permanent fixture on Saturday nights. Thus The Richie G Review was born. \u201cA one man band Piano/vocals using backing tracks and a voice harmonizer to create a full band sound. My current song list represents over seventy artists including Elton John, Billy Joel , James Taylor, The Beatles and hits from the 1960\u2019s thru today. Over 500 tunes and counting\u2013 Booking email onemanbandrichieg@gmail.com .\u201d I played at Vera\u2019s for 14 months and then a new owner took over. He decided that entertainment was unnecessary. I got to work recording a CD of covers and creating business cards. The hard work paid off! I\u2019m a permanent Wednesday night fixture at the Woodcliff lake Hilton as well as sprinkling in various weekend gigs.\nRidgewood Street Fair 2013-2014\n\n392561_413258562028352_398683286819213_1318553_160572558_nRIDGEWOOD\n\nChapter 2- Ginger Martini was Born Right around St Patty\u2019s Day of 2012, I was performing at the Elm Street Grill in Oakland NJ. I was approached by my soon to be partner Wendy Kelly. I was on the floor wiring up my equipment as she, asked me questions about what I do (kind of music, etc). I was excited believing that I was going to be hired for a private party. During the break, she handed me her card.It turned out she was interested in joining me. I wasn\u2019t looking but, I agreed to see what she sounded like at my rehearsal space (haha my basement). Three songs later I was convinced. We sounded great together. A week later, we had 50 plus songs ready for prime time. She joined me at The Paris Inn in Wayne NJ. Ever since we perform around 50% of my gigs together and get an incredible response. Wendy started a seasoned veteran of the Broadway, Standard, and Country Genres. She has since dragged me into her country word as I dragged her into my pop/rock world.

Jos\u00e9 Parl\u00e1: It\u2019s Yours is organized by guest curator Manon Slome.\n\nWhile celebrating Parl\u00e1\u2019s roots in the hip-hop energy of the Bronx, this series of paintings address the suffering caused by redlining policies, the waves of displacement imposed by gentrification, and structural racism. It\u2019s Yours encourages viewers to question ownership in New York\u2019s rapidly changing neighborhoods.\n\nParl\u00e1\u2019s work is deeply connected to experimentation and innovation to conjure complex memory abstractions as he challenges traditional painting methods. The rich building up of surface and Parl\u00e1's signature gestural line resemble the layers of city walls, reflecting the movement and textures of neighborhoods, the marks and traces people leave behind, and the energy and challenges of the streets. In addition to large-scale paintings in the museum\u2019s gallery, the exhibition features Parl\u00e1\u2019s sketchbooks and drawings from age ten to seventeen as well as site specific responses in the lobby and outdoors that seek to integrate the museum with the city.\n\nBorn in Miami to Cuban parents, Parl\u00e1 began painting on walls in Miami at ten years old, signing his work with the nickname \"Ease.\" Supporting himself by designing album covers and concert fliers for hip-hop artists, he moved to the Bronx after studying painting at the Savannah College of Art & Design and Miami Dade College: New World School of the Arts. The title of the exhibition, It\u2019s Yours, is borrowed from a song by the influential Bronx rapper T La Rock, who assured his fans that his work would continue to be about and for them no matter what. In a similar manner, Parl\u00e1 acknowledges the powerful forces that shaped him as an artist and offers this work back to the Bronx in tribute: It\u2019s Yours.\n\nThe exhibition is curated by Manon Slome Co-Founder and Board President of No Longer Empty where she is Curator at Large. Slome's curatorial work has a keen curatorial imperative to further arts for communities beyond institutional confines and to make art accessible to all. She has been working with the Jos\u00e9 Parl\u00e1 for over fifteen years\n\nA fully integrated and multi-disciplined program for youth and families will be developed alongside the exhibition to reflect the rich cultural diversity of the Bronx and its many influences on Parl\u00e0\u2019s work. The artist will also work with the museum's after school programs to develop a mural on a plot adjacent to the museum. A catalogue by Damiani Editore will be produced in conjunction with the exhibition.

Immersed in music and the arts at an early age, they nurtured their unique artistic leanings in close quarters both literally and psychologically. The concept of duality emerged in their work as they began confronting their individual identities. The girls are opposites in nature and temperament yet are connected by that inexplicable emotional bond only shared by twins. In addition, the concept of home and questions related to a sense of belonging come to the forefront as they navigate their multiracial background. While away at school on the East Coast, Michelle honed her songwriting producing a solo LP, La Luna , in her first year and in a subsequent flurry of creativity, wrote the bulk of the 2011 album Flags & Boxes mostly during her last semester. Armed with a full album of distinguished songs,Their first single to radio was the full band edit of Caught produced by Khris Kellow (Christina Aguilera), mixed by Mario Luccy (RealSongs) and mastered by Randy Sharp (Dixie Chicks). MACEDO received massive radio play both all across the country and internationally. Separating for extended lengths of time while they attended different colleges on the East Coast helped them establish separate identities that are apparent when they perform. This lends an exciting artistic tension to their accomplished show. The two decided to sing and write together because of their natural chemistry, the way their similar voices blend and the instinctive, seamless communication that had always been part of their musical lives. PAPER DOLL is based on the soulful tones of Michelle\u2019s grand piano integrated with their breathtaking vocal harmonies. The sound is heavily based on their live shows which include cello, violin and organ. Paper Doll features a live and raw sound that one rarely hears in today\u2019s music. Every instrument adds a layer of texture to the soothing vocal blends that Michelle and Melissa provide. Specializing in the harmonies, the duo was able to work as a conducive creative team. The upcoming full length album \"Ghost Town\" features the immeasurable creative growth of the duo since their last EP was released. The theme of a mystical creative utopia reflects the musical chemistry the girls are lucky enough to experience. All twelve songs (written by Michelle & Melissa) were engineered and produced by MJ Denton. Keyboards, drums, synths & organ parts were played and arranged by Khris Kellow (Christina Aguilera) and Ken Christianson. The truly one of a kind LP was mixed by Eric Milos at Clearlake Recording Studios. Macedo could not be more excited to share their new sound with the world. It should surprise no one that the album has been pronounced a virtual certainty to propel Michelle & Melissa into the first rank of modern female singers and songwriters, and Macedo, the group that they so capably lead, to the top of playlists the world over. \"Ghost Town\" Out Now http://apple.co/2ob7Tn3 Twitter / Instagram :: @MacedoMusic Soundcloud.com/MusicMacedo YouTube.com/MacedoEntertainment", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "185 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Michael Brunnock", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8204510.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988346, 40.722035], "Date": "Wed Feb 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-26", "Genre": "Genres: Acoustic Folk Rock Alternative", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall Stage 3", "moreBioInfo": "http://www.michaelbrunnock.com/?page_id=219 http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/michaelbrunnock4 http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/every-step/id484364952?uo=4 \"'Every Step' is a very positive uplifting song perfect for escaping. If 'Every Step' is an indication to the quality of Michael Brunnock's new album 'The Orchard' I'll predict it'll be one of my most listened to albums of 2012.\" ~ Peter Nagle, 2uibestow Michael Brunnock possesses an extraordinary voice, and his songs mine the profound. So it's not surprising that David Byrne cast him to sing the role of an Irish musician on the brink of success whose voice guides Sean Penn through an emotional journey of self-discovery in This Must Be the Place (2012). The score by Byrne with lyrics by Will Oldham (Bonnie Prince Billy) called for a distinctive vocalist, which Brunnock is. Brunnock's sense of himself and his roots is deeply evident on The Orchard (2012 Araglin Records) A collection of gorgeously crafted songs that embrace a breadth of vision. Featuring guest performances from Glen Hansard (Swell Season), Julia Stone, Ari Hest and Joe Sumner, the album is Brunnock's third since Live in New York (2009) and So I Do (2007). Mixed by triple Grammy winner Patrick Dillett, The Orchard is due for release in February 2012. His exquisite rendering of Down by the Araglin pays homage to the grandfather (also named Michael Brunnock) whose singing of this and other local ballads captivated those gathered around the fire in the family's kitchen. The younger Brunnock has learned his craft well, deftly weaving fine lyric with powerful melody in a song like Man Overboard in which an emigrant's material success is contrasted with the treasure left behind. In Untouchable, with Glen Hansard on guest vocals, Brunnock asks what it means to be a man, a warrior, a father; to live free in the modern world: Am I man enough to taste flesh burned to the bone? Gameboy hero, as I kill from a drone. Powerful melodies and angelic harmonies are driven by a strong personal vision on Song of the Lark, Every Step and Soft, White and Indigo. Brunnock's remarkable voice shines throughout, drawing the listener in with an authentic vision and Irish soul. Brunnock established his solo career when he relocated to New York City a decade ago, having performed through the 90s in Ireland with the bands Little Palace and The Van Winkles as well as with Dead Can Dance's Brendan Perry. Since then he has toured extensively in the States, opening for the Frames and The Swell Season on recent sold out American tours, and has appeared on TV shows such as FOX 5's 'Fearless Music'. \"Acoustic, folk, and Irish are all words that have been used to describe Michael's music and while not necessarily wrong, they hardly scratch the surface.\" GiantStep.net \"I am so envious of people who can write like that\" \u2014 Roddie Cleere, The Irish Music Show, WLRFM \"[He has] an absolutely gorgeous quality to [his] voice. It's beautiful. It's really softand gentle but it rips your heart apart. I have to say it's gorgeous.\" \u2014 Edwina Grace, The Edwina Grace Show, KCLR \". . .A truthful and a heart-filled soul.

He takes his first music lessons and after studying under Andre Villeger for 3 years he wins the Esprit Jazz Festival Competition in Paris and is endorsed by Selmer saxophones (2006) A year later he enters the Conservatoire National Sup\u00e9rieur de Musique de Paris where his horizons broaden under the influence of peers and mentors such as Riccardo Del Fra and Francois Theberge. He soon understands the necessity to go to the roots of Jazz and in 2009 he is granted a Fulbright Scholarship to study at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary music on a merit scholarship.\n\nIn New York, the dream of meeting and playing with his idols becomes true and Yacine gets to learn from Chris Cheek, Donny Mc Caslin, Reggie Workman and with countless musicians who inspire him daily. But New York also exposes him to a myriad of different musics. Soon he is part of ex Fela Kuti' drummer Jojo Kuo' Afrobeat Collective, of late Cameroonian singer Martino Atangana's African Blue Note, of Haitian Kompa legends Tabou Combo. In their musics, he finds a deep echo to his North African roots and the Bikutsi rhythms from Cameroon become reminiscent of the trance rhythms and musics from Tunisia.\n\nThese influences urge him to find his own identity and his explorations of Cameroonian dance rhythms lead to the creation of the band AJOYO, a mystic brew of African tradition, jazz and soul. Yacine signs the music and lyrics of a repertoire that celebrates life, love and justice. The album is released in 2015 on Ropeadope Records and played on radios throughout the world from New Yorks' WNYC to French RFI, London's Jazz FM, National radio in Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria...\n\nIn the meantime, Yacine continues to play as a sideman both in the jazz repertoire with the likes of Sheila Jordan, Theo Bleckman and Becca Stevens and for various projects such as Japanese singer/songwriter Senri Oe (3 albums for Sony Japan).\n\nIn 2014 he is part of an intimate band picked by producer and arranger Robert Sadin to accompany Opera legend Placido Domingo on his remarkable record Encanto Del Mar. Yacine is featured both as a soloist and arranger of the Andalucian standard Lamma Bada and gets the chance to work closely with Ira Coleman, Mark Feldman, Rhani Khridja, Chico Pinheiro and Bridget Kibbey. This is also where he meets cellist Vincent Segal and gets the idea to explore the tunisian Stambeli repertoire with Vincent on cello and drummer Nasheet Waits.\n\nIn 2015 this project is granted the French American Jazz Exchange. The trio album will be recorded and released in 2017 with the French label Accords Croises.\n\nConcurrently to his activities as a performer and a composer, Yacine teaches song-writing at the French Heritage Language Program. In 2014 he is commissioned to compose a Musical telling the story of underserved French speaking African and Haitian communities in the USA. The show Amidou & Toya was premiered in NY in May 2014.

The roots of Karma for Cheap also drink up the sounds of his Southern California childhood spent listening to The Beatles, and its rocked up, Brit Pop influenced, Beatles-Bowie-Badfinger vibes underscore a departure. The album boldly reimagines these vintage sounds, pushing the boundary of what can be considered Americana. With Karma, Tasjan establishes himself as an artist who not only evolves over time, but isn\u2019t afraid to risk reinventing himself from one record to the next. He states, \u201cI needed this album to have a sense of adventure and mystery, to feel a little shaky and dangerous at times - something that wasn\u2019t the obvious choice in terms of what people already like about what I do. I\u2019ve come to realize that I\u2019m a searcher, which means I\u2019m going to be searching forever.\u201d Today, Rolling Stone Country premiered the song \u201cIf Not Now When,\u201d the lead off track from Karma for Cheap. They state \"'Working some holes in your shoes, trying to get over the news,' Tasjan sings before breaking into a riff that evokes classic Beatles guitar work like that of 'I Want You (She's So Heavy).' 'It's nothing but a reason to lose.' Tasjan's no closet Beatles fan - the Fab Four shaped his youth and inspired him to be an artist - and it's no accident that Karma For Cheap conjures up the John Lennon classic 'Instant Karma!' either. Here, Tasjan lets those influences, along with a background in glam-rock bands like Semi Precious Weapons and New York Dolls, form something dreamy and determined, anchored in experimental and psychedelic rock & roll.\" Hear it HERE. Karma for Cheap will be available across digital retailers, on compact disc, standard black vinyl, and limited edition Red & Orange split colored vinyl available at Independent Retailers on August 31, 2019.\n\n\u201cThe sound of the new record is a little more rough and ready, more raw than anything I\u2019ve done before,\u201d Tasjan says. \u201cSeems like a good time for it. We\u2019re living in a pretty raw feed right now, and a lot of these new songs reflect that.\u201d He continues, \u201cMusic for me is a comfort thing. And I\u2019m trying to sing about all of this to remind myself not to get caught up in the game. There are a lot of people out there carrying the burden of this weird, twisted world we\u2019re living in at the moment on their shoulders. So I tried to write a record that offers some comfort, encouragement and hope to those people, as much as it\u2019s possible to be hopeful right now.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Aaron Lee Tasjan w/ Johnny Gallagher - Rockwood Stage 2"}, {"Address": "801 Seneca Ave, Queens County, NY 11385", "Artist": "NEW MYTHS", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9180050.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.905269, 40.701504], "Date": "Wed Feb 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-26", "Genre": "Genres: Grunge, Pop, Synth Pop, Rock, Post Punk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Planet X", "moreBioInfo": "A New York power trio with a rock/synth-punk/pop sensibility, NEW MYTHS is the collaboration of Brit Boras (guitar/lead vocals), Rosie Slater (drums/vocals), and Marina Ross (bass/vocals).

OK, I definitely do that once in a while, but I don\u2019t consider myself an intense person.\u201d\n\nBridgers grew up in the rose-colored city of Pasadena, attending the prestigious Los Angeles County High School for the Arts to study music. From an early age, she found encouragement from a close-knit artistic community of friends and family to follow her dreams, and at school she forged relationships that would teach her as much about her craft as her classes.\n\n\u201cI think most of my musical education had to do with being around a ton of teenagers who listened to music all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cAt school I had classical training for my voice, but I think being surrounded by people who were really enthusiastic about art and going to concerts all the time was the real education.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met Carla Azar of Autolux \u2013 and she showed me Elliott Smith for the first time, which was my first personal connection to music that one of my parents hadn\u2019t showed me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt seemed so different from anything I\u2019d listened to before. It is so personal, so intense.\u201d Bridgers\u2019 work would be heavily influenced by Smith\u2019s sparse lyrics and subdued emotional style, in addition to that of her other favored singer-songwriters like Joni Mitchell, Tom Waits, and Leonard Cohen.\n\n\u201cLos Angeles is interwoven into my music inherently,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily try to reference it, but because I\u2019m pulling from experience it just appears. A lot of shit goes down wherever you may grow up.\u201d After graduating from high school, Bridgers spent a year gigging around the city, playing as often as she could, making mistakes and learning while on her feet. \u201cI\u2019ve always been very appreciative of the LA thing,\u201d she says.\n\nBut of course the truth is that the unique ingredient at play, the calling card that has drawn all this interest and intrigue, is simply Bridgers\u2019 music itself. Her powerful, lilting voice and her haunting, introspective songs light the torch that shows the way, and are what have inspired artists like Ryan Adams to produce her 2015 single, or Julien Baker to bring her on tour in 2016, as well as John Doe and Conor Oberst to sing with her on her debut album. There is a delicate balance to her work, a dance between veiled narratives and earnest emotions, between whispers and shouts. And according to Bridgers, everything you hear has arrived by feeling; her music is what comes when she is at her most honest, without specific intention, and she aims to be in her songs the person she is in the world.\n\nStranger in the Alps opens with the one-two punch of \u201cSmoke Signals\u201d and \u201cMotion Sickness,\u201d a pair of songs that highlight Bridgers\u2019 abilities. The former, a gorgeous, ethereal tune guided by sparse electric guitar and sweeping strings, toes the line between weary and wistful, using specific anecdotes from its singer to tell its tale. The style highlights the strengths of Bridgers\u2019 unique lyric writing perspective: there are overt references to lost idols, canonical pop songs and actual incidents, but her stories unfold through precise, evocative imagery sung in her subtle, confessional style. The latter is perhaps the most upbeat moment on the album and was written on her baritone guitar and discusses a problematic relationship from her past. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m getting more focused when I write,\u201d she says. \u201cMy songs are super personal.\u201d\n\n\u201cScott Street\u201d is a song inspired by East Los Angeles where Bridgers now lives. \u201cKiller\u201d is a song originally appearing on her Adams-produced single but is re-recorded here by the album\u2019s producer, Tony Berg, with John Doe singing alongside Bridgers. That song in particular inspired her to be more honest in her approach. \u201cI wanted to be more genuine with my lyrics, and to me that meant being self-deprecating or a little more self-aware, and not using words that just sounded pretty,\u201d she says. \u201cI had an epiphany that I can be honest with myself and with other people when I\u2019m writing.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Conor Oberst joins her for the duet \u201cWould You Rather,\u201d a singer chosen for his unmistakable voice. A Mark Kozelek cover, \u201cYou Missed My Heart,\u201d ends the album. As with any singer\u2019s debut, the songs here comprise a wide swath of Bridgers\u2019 life, dating from the oldest, \u201cGeorgia,\u201d which she calls the most different-sounding on the LP, to the opening pair, which were written after the recording process had already begun. Berg and co-producer Ethan Gruska worked with Bridgers to record in on-and-off stretches in between tours over 2016 at Berg\u2019s studio in Brentwood. She went into the studio with the majority of the material written, however \u201cSmoke Signals\u201d and \u201cMotion Sickness\u201d were written in a cabin in Idaho, while Bridgers was waiting for a tour to begin. The pair were the last songs written for the LP.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to be too lo-fi, too hi-fi, too self-serious, too disingenuous\u2026I feel pretty confident that I\u2019m finding my voice,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted the album to completely represent who I am and these songs are representative of what I set out to do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "6 Delancey St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Aly & AJ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9271544.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.993383, 40.720353], "Date": "Wed Feb 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-26", "Genre": "Genres: Indie Pop, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bowery Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "It's not surprising time is a theme continually revisited by musical sisters Aly & AJ.

Namely, the former still leaves the guy just enough wiggle room to happily say \u201cyes\u201d when legends (and friends) on the level of Ray Wylie Hubbard or the Flatlanders need a can-do guitar man for a sold-out theater engagement. Or, say, when fellow A-list Austin sideman \u201cScrappy\u201d Jud Newcomb \u2014 the MVP co-producer of Sleeping Dogs \u2014 finds out he can\u2019t make it to a very special Johnny Nicholas gig in Hawaii, and asks \u201cPlank\u201d if he\u2019d be up for subbing for him. Who in their right mind is going to say no to that?\n\nPlankenhorn still selectively takes those kinds of calls not because he gets them, but because he\u2019s earned them. For the better part of the last 17 years, ever since he first moved to Texas with nothing to his name but a Geo Prism, $100, seven guitars and the generous hospitality of Ray and Judy Hubbard, the gifted multi-instrumentalist from Columbus, Ohio has busted ass to prove himself not just able and willing, but above all worthy of playing with the best of the best. And the reason so many song poets like Hubbard and Joe Ely like having Plank at their side is not just because of his prodigious chops on all things stringed (especially those played with a slide), but because of his intuitive knack for knowing when to hold back, always allowing the singer room to land a lyric and go for the proverbial kill. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the skill set I learned very early on: \u2018When in doubt, layout,\u2019\u201d Plankenhorn explains with a chuckle. \u201cThat joke about knowing when not to play? It's true.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, that particular skill \u2014 along with myriad other lessons in the finer points of songcraft that he\u2019s picked up from sharing stages with the masters \u2014 has come to greatly inform Plankenhorn\u2019s own music over the years. But it\u2019s never been more apparent than it is on Sleeping Dogs. Make no mistake: Plank plays a lot of guitar on the album, along with pedal steel, piano, upright bass and seemingly anything else he could lay his hands on during the sessions at the Zone recording studio just outside of Austin. But in stark contrast to SoulSlide, which by his own admission was by design a showcase for his custom-designed lap slide guitar, a patented \u201cFrankenstein\u201d beauty he calls \u201cthe Plank,\u201d Sleeping Dogs is first and foremost all about the songs.\n\n\u201cThe Plank guitar came from me wanting to mix together the two worlds of bluegrass dobro and the sacred steel tradition, and my whole last album was dedicated to that one instrument \u2014 to get it out there,\u201d he says. \u201cSoulSlide also really helped put me on the map as a solo artist, which is why I\u2019ve moved on to focusing more on doing my own thing and only doing a side gig once in a while when I really want to, with people that I really respect. But now, with Sleeping Dogs, I wanted to take a bigger look at how the whole world of music is available to me; it\u2019s not about just one guitar or sound, but rather about using all of the instruments I play and bringing all of my influences together \u2014 and about really wanting to bring my songwriting to the forefront.\u201d\n\nTo that end, there are no covers on the new album, but half of the songs were born out of co-writing sessions with a handful of his longtime friends including his co-producer (and bandmate in Austin\u2019s the Resentments) Newcomb, Gabriel Rhodes, Miles Zuniga, Jon Dee Graham, and of course Hubbard \u2014 the \u201cWylie Llama\u201d of Americana/Texas music, who Plankenhorn still credits as his personal gateway to the whole scene. \u201cPretty much everyone I\u2019ve ever played with is like, one degree of separation away from Ray,\u201d he marvels with a laugh. It was also Hubbard who set Plankenhorn straight years ago when he doubted his own merits as a songwriter.\n\n\u201cI had just started out playing some of my own songs at these little acoustic gigs, but I remember telling him, \u2018Ray, I don't think I should be doing this \u2014 I\u2019m just a side guy.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Where\u2019s your proof? Are people coming to your shows? Are people listening to your songs? Yes? Well, there\u2019s your proof.\u2019\u201d\n\nNaturally, the song Plankenhorn and Hubbard cooked up together, a satisfyingly greasy howler called \u201cTooth and Nail,\u201d just happens to be all about the not-for-the-timid troubadour path and the discipline of songwriting, without so much as a grain of sugar to sweeten the pot. \u201cWe had already written a good portion of the song when he came back to me and said, \u2018It\u2019s like an old cat having kittens / You just crawl under the porch and do it,\u2019 which is a very Ray line,\u201d Plankenhorn says. \u201cBut what\u2019s cool is there were other lines where his wife, Judy, was like, \u2018Ray must have written that,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Ha, no, that was me!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the Hubbard-certified gnarled blues of \u201cTooth and Nail\u201d is just one of a handful of different styles Plankenhorn makes his own on Sleeping Dogs. Both the hurricane Harvey-inspired \u201cFurther to Fall\u201d (co-written with Rhodes) and the closing \u201cHeaven on Earth,\u201d Plankenhorn\u2019s awestruck tribute to his wife\u2019s transcendent love of nature, hit the same deep, soulful notes that defined his last album (with that trusty Plank guitar put to especially righteous use on the latter song). But there\u2019s also \u201cThis Guitar,\u201d a disarmingly folky, listening-room-ready paean to the workhorse acoustic Martin that\u2019s been his go-to writing guitar ever since it was anonymously gifted to him not long after he first moved to Texas. And perhaps most surprising of all (even to Plankenhorn himself), there\u2019s even a few free-spirited ventures into buoyantly catchy, unabashedly poppy rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\n\u201cI had already recorded a few rhythm tracks before this, but the day that Scrappy first came to the studio was also the day that Tom Petty died \u2014 and somehow, everything just kind of shifted that day,\u201d he says. \u201cNot on the entire album, but for a good portion of it, there were discussions of like, \u2018What would Mike Campbell do on this guitar part?\u2019 And out of that, some of the songs like \u2018Sleeping Dogs\u2019 and \u2018I Don't Know Anything\u2019 really changed and moved into more of a roots-rock thing. Which wasn\u2019t something I was expecting \u2014 I mean, it came out of nowhere \u2014 but I loved it.\u201d\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be the last happy surprise, either. The stately, hymn-like \u201cHoly Lightning,\u201d an arresting co-write with Newcomb and Zuniga (of Fastball fame), actually almost didn\u2019t make the final cut. \u201cI had started that one myself but just really wasn\u2019t digging it, so I took it to Miles and Scrappy in the studio, and between the three of us we completely reworked it from scratch over a couple of hours,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut even then I still wasn\u2019t entirely about it. But then Scrappy sent the demo to Patty Griffin, and she goes, \u2018I want to sing on this!\u2019 As soon as she said that, I was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m definitely putting it on the album now!\u2019\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, \u201cHoly Lightning\u201d is now one of his favorite songs on the record. Not that there\u2019s a single track that he\u2019s not proud of on Sleeping Dogs, which is a testament both to the positive experience he had recording it and the confidence he feels going forward into the next stage of his career. And should he even find himself second-guessing his conviction on that solo sojourn, well, he\u2019s already written his own anthem to sing his way through the doubt.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote \u2018Sleeping Dogs,\u2019 I got this image of sleeping dogs lying, and how I need to let shit go,\u201d he explains. \u201cI literally took a lot of things that I\u2019m really bad at or think I\u2019m really bad at, and told myself, \u2018If I sing this for a year or two on tour, it may make me better at these things; maybe I won\u2019t take stuff personally, won\u2019t let things get me down.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Maybe somebody else will hear this song and maybe it will help them, too.\u2019 And I really like that idea: I like the idea of writing songs that have a little moral imperative to them.\u201d\n\nSome would call that a sense of purpose. Or, as Hubbard put it best to Plankenhorn way back at the start of his journey, \u201cThere\u2019s your proof.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1120 Manhattan Ave, New York, NY 11222", "Artist": "Insect Ark", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9329904.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.955172, 40.736777], "Date": "Wed Feb 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-26", "Genre": "Genres: Ambient Metal, cinematic doom, Experimental, doom, psychedelic doom metal", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Saint Vitus Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Evoking visions of dripping and lurching horror films, outer space travel, and gritty noir textures, NYC-based instrumental band Insect Ark uses delay-drenched lap steel guitar, distorted bass & synths, and acoustic and electronic drums, creating a sonic mural both uncomfortably intimate and icy cold.\n\nTheir latest LP \u201cMarrow Hymns\u201d was released on Profound Lore Records, Spring 2018.

Melanie is poised to enlighten new generations about what it means to sing with both passion and eloquence, to write at once with intelligence and emotion, and to inspire through song\u2026 and nobody does this better than Melanie.\n\nOthers learned this that night at Woodstock, where as a New York kid barely known outside of the coffeehouse circuit in Greenwich Village, she sang her song \"Beautiful People\" and inspired the first panorama of candles and cigarette lighters ever raised at a concert event. That, in turn, moved the young singer to write \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain\"), which sold more than one million copies in 1970 and prompted Billboard, Cashbox, Melody Maker, Record World, and Bravo to anoint her as female vocalist of the year. Her single \"Brand New Key,\" an infectious romp about freedom and roller skates, topped the charts in 1971.\n\nAnd so her story began.\n\nWith guitar in hand and a talent that combined amazing vocal equipment, disarming humor, and a vibrant engagement with life, she was booked as the first solo pop/rock artist ever to appear from the Royal Albert Hall to Carnegie Hall, the Metropolitan Opera House, and later opened the New Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Sydney Opera House, and in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where she was invited to perform on many occasions as delegates greeted her performances with standing ovations.\n\nThe top television hosts of all time -- Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson, and Dick Cavett -- battled to book her. (After her stunning performance on his show, Sullivan goggled that he had not seen such a \"dedicated and responsive audience since Elvis Presley.\")\n\nAccolades rolled in, from critics (\"Melanie's cult has long been famous, but it's a cult that's responding to something genuine and powerful -- which is maybe another way of saying that this writer counts himself as part of the cult too,\" wrote John Rockwell in The New York Times) as well as peers (\"Melanie,\" insisted jazz piano virtuoso Roger Kellaway, \"is extraordinary to the point that she could be sitting in front of us in this room and sing something like 'Momma Momma' right to us, and it would just go right through your entire being.\")\n\nIn the years that followed Melanie continued to record, continued to tour.\n\nUNICEF made her its spokesperson; Jimi Hendrix's father introduced her to the multitude assembled for the twentieth anniversary of Woodstock. Her records continued to sell -- more than eighty million to date. She's had her songs covered by singers as diverse as Cher, Dolly Parton, and Macy Gray. She's raised a family, won an Emmy, opened a restaurant, written a musical about Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane\u2026\n\nShe has, in short, lived a rare life. But all of it was just a prelude to what's about to come.\n\n\"For the first time, I'm not afraid to voice exactly what I feel. I used to feel that I didn't want to say too much, but now I can say anything. I feel like a person who's never been heard. Maybe people think they've heard me, but they never really have. I'm a new artist who is having so much fun with my voice -- a person shouldn't be allowed to have so much fun. I'm the woman I wanted to be when I was sixteen and going for Edith Piaf. It's me -- I'm back.\"\n\n(Written by Robert L.

A lot of his songs are influenced by bands in the city\u2019s thriving punk scene, yet when he\u2019s holding court at some of the informal open mics he organizes with other musicians, he explores the more heartfelt side of his artistry via the acoustic guitar (and sometimes the ukulele and mandolin).\nBradshaw\u2019s worlds collide powerfully on his upcoming debut full length album, Twine, whose recently released lead single is \u201cOur First Date,\u201d a jangling and infectious pop/rocker about the explosive, unexpected excitement that can happen immediately with the right person \u2013 and the importance of letting go and surrendering to that feeling. Many of the 12 tracks on the album are about the ins and outs, ups and downs of romance, with Bradshaw negotiating through some intense relationships (with one in particular driving the narrative of many of the tunes) to figure out what works best for him.\nHe named the collection after the gently hypnotic closing song \u201cTwine\u201d \u2013 which features his cool falsetto voice \u2013 because he feels that the songs tie together in many ways. That tune in particular describes the feeling of hanging from a thread, knowing a relationship is about to end, yet enjoying every moment of potential beauty until that happens. \u201cAfter being the lead singer in several previous bands where I was limited as a writer and performer to specific genres and audiences, the songs on my first solo album are kind of my bare bones, naked emotion,\u201d Bradshaw says.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this common thread throughout where I feel like I\u2019m reflecting and questioning why some relationships worked out and others didn\u2019t. It\u2019s definitely cathartic.

In 2015, Margo Price was a country underdog just trying to keep enough gas in the tank to get to the next gig, but by the end of 2016, she was one of the genre's most celebrated new artists and a ubiquitous presence on late night television and at major festivals around the world. It's the kind of year most musicians can only dream of, and the arrival of Price's spectacular sophomore album, \"All American Made,\" proves that she hasn't taken a moment of it for granted. Delivering on the promise of her debut and then some, the record finds Price planting her flag firmly in the soil as a songwriter who's here for the long haul, one with the chops to hang with the greats she so often finds herself sharing stages with these days.\n\n\"People have started asking me, 'Now that you're having success, what are you going to write about?'\" Price recounts with a laugh. \"A lot of what I wrote on my debut came out of my struggles in the music business, but we don't have any shortage of material now. I'm just excited to finally have an audience and know that people are going to listen to our songs.\"\n\nA prolific writer with a knack for candid self-reflection, Price has never had to look too far for inspiration, and on 'All American Made,' she and her songwriting partner/husband, Jeremy Ivey, continue to depict the trials of everyday life with unflinching honesty, painting poetically plainspoken portraits of men and women just trying to get by. Highs and lows, long nights and hard days, wild women and cocaine cowboys, politics and sexism, it's all in there, singularly filtered through Price's wry, no-bullshit perspective. Throughout the album, her contemporary take on classic sounds is at once familiar and daring, an infectious blend of Nashville country, Memphis soul, and Texas twang that tips its cap to everyone from Waylon and Willie (who makes a guest appearance) to Loretta and Dolly, all while flipping a middle finger to the cookie-cutter pop that dominates modern country radio. Rich with swirling pedal steel, honky-tonk rhythms, and Price's stop-you-in-your-tracks vocals, 'All American Made' is deeply reverent of tradition even as it challenges conventions, a nuanced exploration of conflicted emotions for our deeply conflicted times.\n\nFar from overnight, Price's recent meteoric rise is the product of more than a decade of hard work and sacrifice. While she'd long been one of East Nashville's best-kept-secrets, she burst onto the international scene with the 2016 release of her first solo album, 'Midwest Farmer's Daughter.' The record debuted in the Top 10 on Billboard's Country Albums chart and graced Best-Of lists everywhere from Entertainment Weekly to NPR Music, who called it \"the hard-won arrival of an artist who feels like she's always been here.\" Vulture described Price as \"one of the most compelling country talents to come out of Nashville in recent memory,\" while Pitchfork hailed the album as \"a potential classic,\" and Rolling Stone praised its \"amazingly vivid songcraft.\" Price solidified her next-big-thing status with stellar performances on Saturday Night Live, Colbert, Fallon, CBS This Morning, Seth Meyers, A Prairie Home Companion, and more, in addition to taking home Emerging Artist of the Year honors at the Americana Music Awards and winning The American Music Prize for the year's best debut album. She shared stages and bills with Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, and Chris Stapleton among others, and her compelling story-years of toil in the Nashville trenches, the loss of her family's farm and the tragic death of her infant child, a brush with the law, selling her car and pawning her wedding ring to afford studio time, signing to Jack White's Third Man Records as the label's first country artist-was recounted in glowing profiles everywhere from the NY Times Magazine and the New Yorker to Morning Edition and Fader.\n\nWhen it was time to record the follow-up, Price and her band headed back to Memphis, TN, where they'd cut 'Midwest Farmer's Daughter' on a shoestring budget. Instead of returning to Sun Studios, though, they moved down the street to the larger Sam Phillips Recording studio, which the legendary producer opened in 1960 when his own skyrocketing success necessitated more space.\n\n\"We recorded live again because that's really how I like to work,\" Price explains. \"We'd get in around ten or eleven each morning, and then after about twelve hours of recording, we'd all start yelling for tequila, take a shot, and then just keep going.\"\n\nThat spirited, energetic atmosphere infuses even the record's darkest moments with a potent sense of vitality. On the uptempo album opener \"Don't Say It,\" Price dishes out sardonic wordplay over smoking hot guitar, while the pedal-steel and fiddle-fueled \"Weakness\" toes the line between sobriety and mayhem, and the tender \"Learning To Lose\" finds her living out a country music fantasy as she duets with Willie Nelson.\n\n\"We'd gotten to know him a bit from playing shows together and I idolized the hell out of him,\" says Price. \"I didn't know there were people like that, who'd achieved such massive stardom but remained so down to earth.\"\n\nOld school country may be the album's most obvious touchstone, but Price and her band incorporate 60's and 70's R&B into many of the arrangements here, fusing two of Tennessee's greatest musical exports. The funky \"Do Right By Me\" shimmies and grooves with Gospel legends The McCrary Sisters helping out on backing vocals, and the driving \"A Little Pain\" gets an assist from sweeping orchestration by Memphis legend Lester Snell (the man responsible for the string arrangements in \"Shaft\").\n\n\"Sometimes you feel like you've got to please everybody, but ultimately you should be the one you're worrying about taking care of,\" Price says of the inspiration behind the song. \"I wrote it pretty quickly just thinking about being on the road and trying to keep it together while you're burning the candle at both ends.\"\n\nThey say write what you know, and there are few things Price knows better than the road and the myriad of obstacles facing women who make their living on it. On \"Pay Gap,\" she laments the financial state of gender inequality (\"why don't you do the math? / Pay gap, pay gap / Ripping my dollar in half,\" she sings), and \"Wild Women\" looks at the hypocrisies of what's expected from male musicians compared to their female counterparts.\n\n\"There's a definite double standard,\" says Price, \"but I think if you're out there long enough, you stop giving any fucks and you just want to call it out. I get asked questions in interviews that no man would be asked, and if I'm assertive about what I want for me and my band, I get called a 'diva.' That song is really about the judgment I get from people who act like women shouldn't be out on the road. Girls should be encouraged to follow their careers and their dreams just as much as men.\"\n\nThe album closes with an intimate, acoustic rendition of \"All American Made,\" a song which calls to mind \"Born In The USA\" with its patriotic-sounding title and far more troubled lyrics.\n\n\"We actually wrote that song during the Obama administration,\" says Price, \"but it really altered meaning for me on the day Trump was elected. That song embodies the good and the bad in the ugly in this country. America is so beautiful to me, but it's in a really hard spot right now. I feel like I was one of the first and only country artists to speak out so openly against Trump, and I had a lot of people tell me I shouldn't be giving my opinion, but as far as I'm concerned, there's not a lot of doubt about the difference between right and wrong.\"\n\nThat candor is part of what makes 'All American Made' such a powerful follow-up release. Price could have taken her moment in the spotlight as an opportunity to homogenize and chase a slicker, more polished sound built for radio and arenas, but instead, she doubled down on the grit and the truth in her music. It's honesty that brought her to this remarkable moment, and honesty that will continue to carry her into the future. How much higher will Margo Price's star rise? Only time will tell, but just remember, a lot can change in a year.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "17 N Broadway, Tarrytown, NY 10591", "Artist": "Clare Maloney", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9947186.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.85775, 41.07904], "Date": "Wed Feb 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-26", "Genre": "Genres: Opera, Vocal Music, Musical Theater, Rock, Jam Bands, Classic Vocals, American Song, Cabaret, Folk, Singer, Songwriter, Soul, Psychedelic Rock", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Tapp", "moreBioInfo": "Raised on Rock and Roll, trained in Opera, and singing it all - internationally acclaimed musician, Clare Maloney, has spent the last decade making a name for herself as an in-demand concert artist at venues all over the world, including tours on the East and West Coasts, and performances throughout Europe and Asia.

The three-time Grammy winner has continued to exercise and expand his skills as an instrumentalist, a composer, and the head of Marsalis Music, the label he founded in 2002 that has allowed him to produce both his own projects and those of the jazz world's most promising new and established artists. The New Orleans native was born into one of the city's most distinguished musical families, which includes patriarch/pianist/educator Ellis and Branford's siblings Wynton, Delfeayo and Jason. Branford gained initial acclaim through his work with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and his brother Wynton's quintet in the early 1980s before forming his own ensemble. He has also performed and recorded with a who's-who of jazz giants including Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Herbie Hancock and Sonny Rollins. Known for his innovative spirit and broad musical scope, Branford is equally at home on the stages of the world's greatest clubs and concert halls, where he has performed jazz with his Quartet, one of the leading small ensembles of the past two decades; classical music as a guest soloist with numerous chamber and symphony orchestras; and his own unique musical approach to contemporary popular music with his band Buckshot LeFonque. His nearly two dozen recordings in these various styles have received numerous accolades, with his most recent CD, the Grammy-nominated Braggtown, acknowledged as his quartet's greatest recorded achievement to date. Marsalis' previous disc, Eternal, also received a Grammy nomination as well as virtually universal inclusion in lists and polls for the best jazz recording of 2004. Marsalis' playing on the DVD Coltrane's `A Love Supreme' Live in Amsterdam also received a Grammy nomination for best instrumental jazz solo, while the disc received awards for music and video excellence from the DVD Association. Marsalis is also dedicated to changing the future of jazz in the classroom. He has shared his knowledge at such universities as Michigan State, San Francisco State, Stanford and North Carolina Central, with his full quartet participating in an innovative extended residency at the latter campus. Beyond these efforts, he is also bringing a new approach to jazz education to jazz students and jazz listeners in colleges and high schools through Marsalis Jams, an interactive program in which leading jazz ensembles present concert/jam sessions in mini-residencies that have visited campuses in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Southwest. Branford's diverse interests are also reflected in his other activities. He spent two years touring and recording with Sting, and was the musical director of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno for two years in the 1990s. He has collaborated with the Grateful Dead and Bruce Hornsby, acted in films including Throw Mama from the Train and School Daze, provided music for Mo' Better Blues and other films and hosted National Public Radio's syndicated program Jazz Set. Among the most socially conscious voices in the arts, Marsalis quickly immersed himself in relief efforts following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. He is the honorary chair of the New Orleans Habitat for Humanity effort to rebuild the city, and together with his friend Harry Connick, Jr. conceived the Habitat Musicians' Village currently under construction in the city's historic Ninth Ward. Whether on the stage, in the recording studio, in the classroom or in the community, Branford Marsalis represents a commitment to musical excellence and a determination to keep music at the forefront.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "80 E Ridge Rd, Ridgefield, CT 06877", "Artist": "Altan", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.49241, 41.28225], "Date": "Wed Feb 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-26", "Genre": "Genres: Celtic, International", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ridgefield Playhouse", "moreBioInfo": "Altan are an Irish folk and traditional music group, who formed in Gweedore, County Donegal in 1987.

One of jazz\u2019s definitive accompanists, Cobb made his name in support of such giants as Dinah Washington, Cannonball Adderley, Miles Davis, Wes Montgomery and Sarah Vaughan, and on literally hundreds of studio sessions. As the drummer on Davis\u2019 legendary album Kind of Blue, Cobb may be the most frequently heard (if not the best known) drummer in jazz history; and as part of the legendary Davis rhythm section with pianist Wynton Kelly and bassist Paul Chambers, he created a manner of swinging in the modern idiom that remains the gold standard for rhythmic inspiration. For all his achievements, however, Jimmy Cobb\u2019s contribution has too often been taken for granted, which is why he is the perfect subject to help launch the new Honors Series from Marsalis Music.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of music coming through Washington, D.C. when I was growing up,\u201d Cobb notes in explaining the development of his style, \u201cand as a working musician you had to play in a whole lot of situations. By working clubs, dances, concerts and the shows that were featured in movie theaters, your growth was shaped. The way I play the cymbal, for instance, is something I heard from a guy who came through Washington.

He has said that he is of Choctaw descent, and he was born in a region originally inhabited by the Choctaw. However, in a 2005 interview[citation needed], he said his mother had told him he was actually Cherokee.\n\nHis family considered it normal to play music, with his father playing guitar and harmonica, his mother playing piano, and a relative who was a one-man band. At the age of three, Musselwhite moved to Memphis, Tennessee. When he was a teenager, Memphis experienced the period when rockabilly, western swing, electric blues, and some forms of African American music were combining to give birth to rock and roll. The period featured legendary figures such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash, as well as minor legends such as Gus Cannon, Furry Lewis, Will Shade, Royal Bell, Memphis Willie B., Johnny Burnette, Red Roby, Abe McNeal, and Slim Rhodes. Musselwhite supported himself by digging ditches, laying concrete and running moonshine in a 1950 Lincoln. This environment was Musselwhite's school for music as well as life, and he acquired the nickname \"Memphis Charlie.\"[citation needed]\nIn true bluesman fashion, Musselwhite then took off in search of the rumored \"big-paying factory jobs\" up the \"Hillbilly Highway\", legendary Highway 51 to Chicago, where he continued his education on the South Side, making the acquaintance of even more legends including Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, Sonny Boy Williamson, Buddy Guy, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, and Big Walter Horton. Musselwhite immersed himself completely in the musical life, living in the basement of, and occasionally working at Jazz Record Mart (the record store operated by Delmark Records founder Bob Koester) with Big Joe Williams and working as a driver for an exterminator, which allowed him to observe what was happening around the city's clubs and bars. He spent his time hanging out at the Jazz Record Mart at the corner of State and Grand and the nearby bar, Mr. Joe's, with the city's blues musicians, and sitting in with Big Joe Williams and others in the clubs, playing for tips. There he forged a lifelong friendship with John Lee Hooker; though Hooker lived in Detroit, Michigan, the two often visiting each other, and Hooker serving as best man at Musselwhite's wedding. Gradually Musselwhite became well known around town.\n\nIn time, Musselwhite led his own blues band, and, after Elektra Records' success with Paul Butterfield, he released the classic[citation needed] Stand Back! album in 1966 on Vanguard Records (as \"Charley Musselwhite\"), to immediate and great success. He took advantage of the clout this album gave him to move to San Francisco, where, instead of being one of many competing blues acts, he held court as the king of the blues in the exploding countercultural music scene, an exotic and gritty figure to the flower children. Musselwhite even convinced Hooker to move out to California.\n\nSince then, Musselwhite has released over 20 albums, as well as guesting on albums by many other musicians, such as Bonnie Raitt's Longing in Their Hearts and The Blind Boys of Alabama's Spirit of the Century, both winners of Grammy awards. He also appeared on Tom Waits' Mule Variations and INXS' Suicide Blonde. He himself has won 14 W. C. Handy awards and six Grammy nominations, as well as Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Monterey Blues Festival and the San Javier Jazz Festival in San Javier, Spain, and the Mississippi Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts.\n\nIn 1979, Musselwhite recorded The Harmonica According to Charlie Musselwhite in London for Kicking Mule Records, intended to go with an instructional book; the album itself became so popular that it has been released on CD.\n\nUnfortunately, Musselwhite, as with many of his peers, fell victim to alcoholism; by his own admission[citation needed], he had never been on stage sober until after he stopped drinking entirely in 1987.\n\nIn 1990 Musselwhite signed with Alligator Records, a step led to a resurgence of his career.\n\nOver the years, Musselwhite has branched out in style. His 1999 recording, Continental Drifter, is accompanied by Quarteto Patria, from Cuba's Santiago region, the Cuban music analog of the Mississippi Delta. Because of the political differences between Cuba and the United States, the album was recorded in Bergen, Norway, with Musselwhite's wife ironing out all the details.\n\nMusselwhite believes the key to his musical success was finding a style where he could express himself. He has said, \"I only know one tune, and I play it faster or slower, or I change the key, but it\u2019s just the one tune I\u2019ve ever played in my life. It\u2019s all I know.\"[1]\n\nHis past two albums, Sanctuary and Delta Hardware have both been released on Real World Records.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "183 W 10th St, New York, NY 10014", "Artist": "Noam Wiesenberg", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8255961.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.002722, 40.734367], "Date": "Wed Feb 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-26", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "10:30 PM", "Venue": "Smalls Jazz Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Noam Wiesenberg - Bass\nPhilip Dizack - Trumpet\nImmanuel Wilkins - Alto\nMichael King - Piano\nKweku sumbry - Drums"}, {"Address": "185 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Durieux", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8531474.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988346, 40.722035], "Date": "Wed Feb 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-26", "Genre": "Genres: R&b, R&b Soul, Alternative, Soul, Rnb-soul, Alternative, R&b/soul", "Time": "11:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall Stage 3", "moreBioInfo": "Durieux is a singer songwriter from the Bronx, NY, often describing his sound as a blend of \"Alternative Rock, Funk, and R&B/Soul\".

Her emotionally disarming performances deceive in their simplicity, often times consisting of nothing more than her voice and a guitar, occasionally accompanied by violinist. Yet, they nevertheless arrest audiences through their quiet, brooding intensity, holding a vulnerability that\u2019s offset by a wintry, gallic allure..\n\nOn any given weekday, you can hear her voice echoing over the Hudson and East rivers. Equipped with only an acoustic guitar, a microphone and a tiny mixer, the French songstress delivers hushed and intimate performances for passengers aboard Spirit Cruises, set against the backdrop of an idyllic Manhattan skyline. Doucet\u2019s set list meanders seamlessly between Top 40 staples like Cindy Lauper and The Week'nd, while discreetly inserting the odd Gallic classic and, of course, a few numbers from her own blooming repertoire. Oddly enough, this sort of eclecticism works, as Doucet\u2019s own style has been informed by her superior command of the pop form.\n\n\nTiphanie Doucet got her start early on in the music and entertainment world. Harp and Ballet were part of her two passions since a very early age, and lead to a professional Dancing and Acting career. A starring role in the film Le b\u00e9b\u00e9 d\u2019Elsa, and later in the Glee-like TV series \"Chante\", gave her popularity in her native France, and the unlikely foundations for what would be a very eclectic musical trajectory. After leaving France, Doucet decided to gamble it all and start fresh in America. The 180 degree turn that her life took left her old life in shambles, bringing her plenty of heartbreak and homesickness that would prove to be a wellspring of musical inspiration. This moment of transition afforded Doucet plenty of material to write her own songs, which she began testing out on street corners, cruises and caf\u00e9s throughout New York and her newly adopted home in Jersey City, New Jersey. The overwhelmingly positive reception was such that she decided to release her own work. She released her first single \"Lucky guy\" with Grammy-nominated producer Jason Agel, whose work can be heard in productions by everyone from Kanye West to Bj\u00f6rk to Beyonce.\n\n\nA year later, she released her debut album \u201cUnder My Sun\u201d, a collection of rustic, yet polished folk numbers produced by David Baron and Simone Felice, who have worked with the likes of Lumineers and Jade Bird. Though Doucet\u2019s influences are prevalent throughout the album, nodding to the likes of Norah Jones, Ingrid Michaelson and Feist, the work is without a doubt a testament to the uniqueness and originality of her voice. The sound is amplified by Felice and Baron's production, which never feels intrusive, but serves as the perfect complement to the singer\u2019s overpowering voice, interjecting only at key moments of emotional revelation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiphanie n'est surement pas inconnue de vous. Elle a commence a 15 ans a la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, quand elle interpr\u00e9tait la fille de Corinne Touzet, dans un premier r\u00f4le plut\u00f4t salu\u00e9 par la critique. A l\u2019\u00e9poque elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 8 ans de conservatoire en musique et danse et continua jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ses 18 ans. A 20 ans elle d\u00e9bute une carri\u00e8re de danseuse professionnelle gr\u00e2ce a Redha qui l'engage comme apprenti sur Romeo et Juliette, apr\u00e8s elle enchaine les shows, plateaux t\u00e9l\u00e9s, tourn\u00e9es. Parmi ses meilleurs exp\u00e9riences, on a pu la voir sur les plateaux de la Star Academy, la tourn\u00e9e de Jenifer ou derri\u00e8re David Guetta, Jonnhy Halliday et m\u00eame Prince, travaillant avec tous les chor\u00e9graphes du moment comme Kamel Ouali, Redha, Mya Frye, Stephane Jarny ou Hakim Ghorab. Comme chanteuse on a pu la voir interpr\u00e9ter \u201cJeanie \u201c dans Hair et bien sur a la TV, meilleure amie de Priscilla dans la s\u00e9rie Chante. A l \u00e9poque elle commence a prendre la musique plus au s\u00e9rieux, rencontre Geoffrey, guitariste, avec qui elle commence a composer et voyager aux Etats Unis : Los Angeles, Nashville, New York. Lors d'un programme court au Musician Institute de Los Angeles, elle s'inscrit a une audition pour l\u2019\u00e9cole AMDA. De retour en France, on lui apprend qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'une bourse de talent ! La voila partie aux Etats Unis, et elle ne reviendra plus. Son dipl\u00f4me en poche elle entame les auditions et commence a travailler. Une com\u00e9die musicale, et m\u00eame un premier r\u00f4le dans une pi\u00e8ce de theatre Off Broadway. Mais la musique est toujours pr\u00e9sente. Elle commence a gratter la guitare, et compose seule son premier EP \u201cBetween us\u201d qu'elle revient enregistrer a Paris. Depuis, elle se consacre a sa musique, elle joue m\u00eame dans la rue, le m\u00e9tro, et a fait plus de 50 concerts a NY, dont la premi\u00e8re partie de Anna Nalick a Brooklyn, une auteur compositeur tr\u00e8s populaire aux Etats Unis, et a Paris aussi ou elle a eu la chance de faire la premi\u00e8re partie d'Arnaud Ducret au casino de Paris au Printemps 2016.\nEn 2017, elle rencontre et enregistre avec le producteur / r\u00e9alisateur Jason Agel, nomin\u00e9 notamment au Grammy Awards pour son enregistrement de la chanson \"All of Me\" par John Legend. Le single \"Lucky guy\" surprend par les m\u00e9lodies m\u00e9lancoliques et relaxantes de Tiphanie, les voix douces et ang\u00e9liques, et les arrangements explosifs de Jason Agel. Apres avoir envoye une demo de chanson en francais, elle attire ensuite l'attention du realisateur Simone Felice ( les Lumineers, Jade Bird... ) Elle debarque a Woodstock et s'enferme avec lui et David Baron dans leur studio au milieu des montagnes de Catskills, le coup de foudre artistique est immediat. L'album est sorti le 10 Aout, comprenant des chansons en Anglais et en Francais.\n\nIl attire la Presse Americaine qui la compare a Norah Jones. En novembre dernier Tiphanie s'est produit au Sunset Jazz Club. Un EP de reprises est prevu pour Mars 2019 avec aussi des versions en Francais des chansons de l'album.\n\n\n\n\nLa p\u00e9pite du jour c\u2019est Tiphanie Doucet et Under My Sun\nPar Charles Chinasky\n\nTiphanie Doucet a une histoire qui ferait un film. Jeune actrice avec Corinne Touzet (oui quand m\u00eame), bourse US, Danse sur le grand journal, com\u00e9die musicale pour finir par se faire rep\u00e9rer dans le m\u00e9tro de New York.

Car Tiphanie a une voix enchanteresse. Elle m\u00e9lange une guitare s\u00e8che folk avec un petit cot\u00e9 soul. C\u2019est une musique \u00e0 faire tomber les \u00e9toiles, en sirotant un petit whisky et en pensant \u00e0 la vie.T\n\n\nPRESS\n\nShaped by her experiences in France, Los Angeles, New York, and her recently adopted New Jersey home alike, Doucet\u2019s new work embraces a folksier, jazz-tinged gentleness. Its subtle warmth instantly feels like home, pervading the senses in a way not dissimilar to Norah Jones or Lucy Rose. Yet, in spite of any similarities you may draw between her and other great songwriters, Doucet\u2019s dreamy vocal quality is markedly distinct, especially in how she tenderly incorporates it into her music to tell stories unique to her own outlook and experiences.\n\nJonathan Frahm \u2022 10 July 2018- For Folk Sake\n\n\"Her vocal performance is compelling in its attention to detail\u2013the ends of lines and the wordless sighs that close the song contain a lot of emotion without going for the big move. If you\u2019re looking for a relaxing summer tune, this is what you\u2019re looking for. Highly recommended.\"\n\nStephen Carradini, for Independant Clauses\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d gotten to know Tiphanie and her sincerity to her work, is obvious to witness. Her dedication to her craft is unconditional. She\u2019s humble, energetic, honest, and she wants to share her music to greater and greater audiences. And in her humble way, she still is seeking Of herself, and About herself \u2013 and we think that contributes profoundly to music making. She wants to be \u2018happy\u2019. Happy with her work, happy with her songs making people happy, and happy with making music an even larger part of her life from a career point of view. She\u2019s come a long way. But she\u2019s a tough gal \u2013 resilient and proud of her accomplishment and the way she\u2019s come through the personal pains in her past. Her heart pushes her to do so. And in our eyes, that passion is something that we can\u2019t help but DIG about her. Kudos, Tiphanie.

At the age of nine, he was studying drums under the leadership of master drummers Rudy Collins, Andre Strobert and Walter Perkins at the New Muse music school in Brooklyn, New York. By the age of thirteen, Taru started to perform professionally with his father Roland Alexander\u2019s quintet (Roland Alexander-tenor saxophone, Kiani Zawadi-trombone, Hilton Ruiz-piano, Paul Brown-bass). At the same time, he started to study drums with Justin DiCioccio at the La Guardia Music & Art High School in New York.\n\nWhile still studying at the age of sixteen, Taru recorded his first album as a sideman accompanying Fred Ho Afro-Asian Ensemble on the Black Saint record label. Soon after, he established himself at the New York jazz scene and became one of the soughs after drummers. He also toured the US with the Moe Better Blues Band & The Drums of Fire bands.

His family comes from a long line of musicians known as Ntontas (\"players of horns\") and his mother is a vocalist and choir director. He and his siblings were introduced to blues, jazz and African traditional music early in life.\n\nMr. Sitson is a pioneer of a new generation of multi-culturally influenced African musicians who are integrating into their musical styles their own exciting yet bewildering welter of \"in-between\" living experiences (north/south, tradition/modernity, 20th/21st century). His daring musical project combines in a most innovative way jazz, gospel, blues and traditional African polyphonies, polyrhythms and melodies. By freely combining his trademark vocal acrobatics with a breathtakingly creative command of oral and body percussions and miscellaneous effects, Mr. Sitson forged an eloquent vocabulary capable of communicating far beyond any limits of language or custom. Through his vocal wizardry, he stunningly creates an endless range of sounds and atmospheres. Sitson's seamless four- octave range travels from a soulful, resonantly masculine tenor with woodwind-like overtones to a high-soaring, nearly genderless spiritual wail, a feat that recalls Brazil's Milton Nascimento, another deep-rooted yet restlessly protean, jazz-inflected shape-changer.\n\nGino Sitson's four-octave vocal range plus his skills as a composer and arranger put him in high demand for recording sessions and for commercials and radio / television jingles (Danone, Dim, Peugeot, Vahine, etc). The versatile young vocalist performed in a musical and co-composed part of the music (Jeanne et le Gar\u00c3\u00a7on Formidable).\n\nHe has laid down tracks or shared the stage with Manu Dibango, Ron Carter, Papa Wemba, Wally Badarou, John Scofield, Geri Allen, David Gilmore, Haruko Nara, Bobby McFerrin, Frank Wess, Ray Lema, Craig Harris, James Hurt, Antoine Roney, John William, Mario Canonge, Wallace Roney, Brice Wassy, Oliver NGoma, Exile One, Steve Potts, So Why? (Featuring Youssou NDour, Papa Wemba, Wally Badarou, Jabu Khanyile & Bayete, Lourdes Van-Dunem, and Lucky Dube) and La Compagnie Creole, among others.\n\nIn 2008, Mr. Sitson was invited by Bobby McFerrin to join him on a PBS documentary (\"The music instinct: Science & Song\"), to take part in a special project that took place at the Carnegie Hall (\"Instant Opera\"). A member of Chamber Music America, he is regularly engaged for movie scores and commercials. He has appeared several times on TV and also composed music for the noted children's TV show, Dora The Explorer (Nickelodeon). Since 2006, Mr. Sitson is a Cultural Arts ambassador for the city of Miami (Florida).\n\nMeanwhile, his international career continues apace. He has received the \"Parents Choice Silver Medal Honor Award\" in 2004 and was nominated for the RFI Awards 2000. His recent output includes soundtracks to Betrayal (Kevin Ngooh) and Blue Lotus (Dayo Ayodele); jingles for France Television and France 3, and an ongoing collaboration with his German-based brother, vocalist-composer-percussionist-actor Njamy Sitson. Mr. Sitson performed at the Carnegie Hall with his own group in 2008.\n\nAside from musical performances, Gino leads vocal workshops served by his amazing vocal technique, his musical knowledge and his desire to share his love for vocal explorations. Gino has developed workshops for professional as well as non-professional singers, and also for children. A researcher in musicology, his work focuses on music cognition, expressive properties of the voice and the process of transmitting music from the \"black\" diaspora. Among them, he is particularly interested in Gwoka music from Guadeloupe. Mr Sitson earned a PhD in musicology at the Paris-Sorbonne University. He is a UNICEF CAMEROON Goodwill Ambassador and an Associate Researcher at IReMus (Institut de recherche en musicologie: Paris-Sorbonne University , CNRS, BnF, Minist\u00e8re de la culture).\n\nPROFESSIONAL AFFILIATIONS\n\nAmerican Society for Ethnomusicology\nAmerican Musicological Society\nASCAP\nCarribean Studies Association\nChamber Music America\nEthnomusiKa\nIReMus / CNRS\nSACEM\nSociety for Music Perception and Cognition\nSocie\u0301te\u0301 franc\u0327aise d\u2019analyse musicale\nSocie\u0301te\u0301 franc\u0327aise d\u2019ethnomusicologie", "otherInfo": "GINO SITSON'S VoKoCello\nFEATURING:\nGINO SITSON: VOICE, BODY PERCUSSION & COMPOSITIONS\nJENNIFER VINCENT: CELLO & VOICE\nYACOUBA SISSOKO: KORA"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Evan Petruzzi", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9930313.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Singer, Songwriter, Pop", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Evan Petruzzi is a singer/songwriter from Long Island, New York.

In just over a decade he has catapulted his career from Urban Music Director as a student at St. John University\u2019s WSJU radio station to an intern at Elektra Records to one of New York City\u2019s most well-known DJs.\nInfluenced by the legendary talents of Red Alert, Pete Rock, DJ AM\nand Funk Master Flex, to name a few, Commish has found his niche in providing sounds and experiences that are transformational for his fans and clients, alike.

In the time before and after, Butler\u2019s been relentlessly on the road performing at everything from stadiums to state prisons. With a rocked out electric and a heartbreaking live acoustic version being released simultaneously (February 19th), Butler\u2019s latest single \u2018Tell Lucy That I Love Her\u2019 is ripped straight from the experience of performing over 150 shows in correctional facilities across the United States. Moreover, the new single exemplifies how Butler\u2019s music shines a light into some of the darkest corners of our world. He paints vivid pictures of pain and truth while exposing the glimmers of hope that only exist in those raw moments where redemption is born.\n\nThat skillful storytelling has led Butler to some unlikely venues. Shortly after the release of his debut album Reckless Son in 2016, he wrote and performed \u2018Just One\u2019, the original song for the feature length and nationally distributed documentary Generation Found - A film about teens struggling with substance abuse and special schools supporting their path to recovery. Suddenly at the center of a growing national movement, in November of 2016 Matt was invited to play a concert for the incarcerated population \u201cbehind the walls\u201d of Albany County Jail. Following a glowing response, word of the show quickly spread and requests to perform at other facilities culminated in an entire \u2018Behind the Walls\u2019 Tour of state prisons across Ohio. Afterwards, he was named a \u20182017 Leader In Mental Health Awareness\u2019 by The National Alliance On Mental Illness (NAMI). Deeply inspired by these experiences, Butler established the Just One Foundation(501c3) in 2018 which brings art with a mission and a message into underserved communities.\n\nMatt kicked off 2020 by releasing the David Bendeth (Paramore, Bruce Hornsby) produced anthem \u2018Like A River\u2019 - a track inspired by the chance to be of service that exists in each moment of everyday life. As he continues to record, Butler\u2019s new music draws heavily on the stories of people he\u2019s met on the road and behind the walls. With accessible writing and relatable characters, upcoming singles like \u2018Justice or Mercy\u2019 and \u2018Been Gone So Long\u2019 can\u2019t help but stir compassion in a listener. Each song has a transcendent quality that shows us how universal our struggles and experiences can really be.\n\nTo date, Butler has now performed in more than 30 correctional facilities across 11 states and continues this work alongside his regular touring. He\u2019s a staple figure at New York City\u2019s famous \u2018Rockwood Music Hall\u2019 and performs in venues as diverse as local high schools, yoga centers and spiritual retreats. He\u2019s also gained recognition as a sought after keynote speaker (with guitar in hand, of course).", "otherInfo": "Join us at The Collective School Of Music where Matt will give a presentation on his past 3 years of DIY touring that's included over 100 shows in jails and prisons across the country - plus a special screening of Matt's latest mini documentary!

A year later he was enrolled in music lessons, starting on piano and eventually picking up the sax, and by middle school was playing in state symphonic bands, touring with classical horn trios, and singing his heart out any chance he could get.\n\nUltimately Kevin found his place in the jazz and blues scene in highschool and college, while also exploring his talents as a guitar player. By the time he graduated from George Washington University, Daniel had played in two quartets, four high school orchestras, two jazz and blue bands, one bluegrass band, one punk ska group, and even sang tenor in an acapella group. But it was his move to New York City in 2013, and a sudden and unexpected tragedy, that put Kevin on the path towards his eventual solo career.\n\nThat winter, during a dinner party in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Kevin received a phone call from his sister that would change everything. His mother and stepfather, adventure-seekers and amateur pilots, had been flying back from their mountain house in western North Carolina when their plane had crashed, killing both of them. Daniel\u2019s life was turned upside down, his family torn apart and the world forever changed. During his return to North Carolina to help with family business, and while reliving his parent\u2019s lives through photos, essays, and family stories, Kevin wrote over a dozen songs, all fueled by the grief of losing his parents as well as the celebration of the large lives they were known for. From those songs six were chosen to record, including one written specifically for Kevin\u2019s parent\u2019s memorial service.\n\nThe result of those recordings was FLY, Kevin Daniel\u2019s inaugural EP. The six-song project was recorded in 2014 in Brooklyn and embodies the depth of Daniel\u2019s emotions during a time of supreme distress. Southern sounds of banjo and country-loving three-part harmonies were backed by rock riffs and pop lyrics, which spoke true to life and the celebration of living. \u201cI always knew I wanted to record my own music, and a life spent being in other people\u2019s bands had prepared me to lead my own, both in the studio and on the stage. It was losing my parents that gave me the kick in the ass to finally do it\u201d, says Daniel. The EP is available on all digital outlets as well as on 12-inch opaque blue vinyl.\n\nKevin Daniel recently finished his second EP, Myself Through You, which was recorded at Degraw Sound in Brooklyn, NY, and produced, engineered, and mixed by Ben Rice. Kevin gathered together a host of talented, professional musicians from all backgrounds for the project, which resulted in a richly recorded blend of genres and instruments. \u201cWhen I started thinking about this EP, I knew I wanted to get some of the best musicians I know in the studio. With Ben\u2019s help we created a space where people could come in, lay down their own version of the parts, and create something unique to them as well as the record,\u201d says Kevin.\n\nFeaturing instrumentation as diverse as pedal steel guitar, flugelhorn, and bluegrass banjo, the songs on Myself Through You deliver sublime lamentations of the country-tinged Americana Daniel has created over the last few years. The EP\u2019s title track Myself Through You\u2019 is Daniel\u2019s attempt to take a subjective look at his own life. \u201cI often find myself trying to take a step back and see life from someone else\u2019s eyes,\u201d says Kevin. \u201cThis song came into being at a time where I was really struggling to understand someone else\u2019s point of view. I think we all struggle with that daily.\u201d\n\nFollowing the release of Myself Through You in early 2018 Kevin Daniel will look to tour throughout the US, taking a full band, and explosive live performance to his soon to be new fans.", "otherInfo": "Kevin Daniel & The Bottom Line help Pancakes & Whiskey put on an EPIC local showcase!"}, {"Address": "125 East 11th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Magic Giant", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7570833.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.989166, 40.731661], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Folk Revival", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Webster Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Called \"the most festive band in the festival circuit,\" MAGIC GIANT has smashed charts with top 40 singles, amassed over 60M streams, and been named one of \u201c10 Artists You Need to Know\u201d by Rolling Stone.\n\nDebuting only two years ago with their LP In The Wind, MAGIC GIANT, came out of the gates swinging, with TV appearances such as the Today Show, and Billboard singling them out as one of \u201c10 Awesome Bands\u201d playing Coachella.

With a love of music and skateboarding, Lindell formed a few punky garage bands early on while his musical horizons expanded. He listened to the deep blues of Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Jimmy Reed and Albert King before drifting toward the R&B sounds of The Impressions, Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway, soaking up the soul and learning how to craft a song. After performing at bars on the West Coast with a few short-lived bands, Eric formed his own group in 1993. He quickly gained a loyal Northern California audience thanks to countless performances and many late-night jam sessions. Established stars like Charlie Musselwhite and Tom Waits attended his shows, as did overflow crowds of music fans.\n\nWith music on his mind, Lindell headed to New Orleans in 1999, where he quickly discovered the pulsating and dynamic roots scene. He gravitated toward the West Bank dive bars of Gretna and Algiers, where he befriended many older area musicians who helped him get regular work as a performer. Some of New Orleans' finest players, including keyboardist Ivan Neville and drummers Harold Brown (War), Stanton Moore (Galactic) and Johnny Vidacovich (Professor Longhair, Astral Project) often joined him on stage. Galactic bassist Rob Mercurio began sitting in as well, and word of Lindell's immense talents quickly spread around the city. Stars like Branford Marsalis, The Neville Brothers and John Scofield began showing up at his gigs and embracing this fresh California kid's funky music. According to Lindell, \"It's a great feeling to be recognized for your music in New Orleans.\" Since 2003, in addition to his own gigs, Lindell regularly joins forces with Ivan Neville, Moore and Mercurio (when time and schedules permit) and they perform to overflow crowds as Dragon Smoke.\n\n2006's Change In The Weather delighted and surprised music fans hungry for a truly original artist. Lindell's deceptively simple sounding songs, laid back grooves and hook-laden melodies were fueled by guests including Brown, Neville and Moore. Critics across the country went wild, with reviews and features in Relix, OffBeat, Guitar Player, Down Beat, The New Yorker, The New York Press and many other national and regional publications. Singer And Musician magazine put Eric on the cover and many newspaper entertainment sections did the same.\n\n2007's Low On Cash, Rich In Love and 2009's Gulf Coast Highway pushed Lindell farther into the spotlight. Appearances on Late Night With Conan O'Brien and National Public Radio's Mountain Stage solidified his stature as an artist who simply could not be ignored. Many of his songs have appeared in films and television shows, including Boston Legal and Treme. He has collaborated and shared stages with blues and rock luminaries, including John Fogerty, Luther Dickinson and Anson Funderburgh.\n\nWith Revolution In Your Heart, Lindell was more than ready to come home to Alligator. \"The timing is perfect. I'm so excited to get back to focusing on what I do and have such a great team behind me,\" he says. Upon release of the album, Lindell and his band will tour heavily, reuniting with old friends and, as always, earning new fans at every stop. AllMusic declares Lindell a singular talent, saying, \"He plays soulful, funk-drenched, tight and focused grooves. He is a quadruple threat as a solid songwriter, impressive guitarist, affecting singer and harmonica blower. This is music that's deceptively difficult to create. Lindell makes it seem not just easy, but natural.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "143 Christopher Columbus Dr, Jersey City, NJ 07302", "Artist": "Psilocybe", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10136463.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.044798, 40.719936], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Rhythm, Grind", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "JC Studios", "moreBioInfo": "This metal quartet uses pop structures, melds together get down grooves with ruthless melodies, and adds a dash of punk spunk.", "otherInfo": "When you look to start a revolution and have a hell of a birthday party while doing it you look to your friends and you look to your family.

I loved Sergio Mendes\u2019 songs, liked John Hartford on the Glenn Campbell Show and really got into James Taylor and Joni Mitchell who I still consider my two main influences. I also loved the singer-songwriters of the time including Carole King and Laura Nyro and later fell in love with Steely Dan\u2019s music, and just wore out my copy of Hubert Laws\u2019 Rite Of Spring. I was completely self-taught, by llistening to records and playing them over and over, teaching myself tablature from a great James Taylor book and modal tunings from Joni Mitchell\u2019s For The Roses song book. I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit. Other long term members include drummer Ray Levier and keyboardist Peter Vitalone, both of whom have been with KJ since\u201998 and \u201899. I am always interested in stretching myself and performing my music in different ways. The Lucky 7 recordings feature some wonderful pairings of great players that I don\u2019t always get to tour with but who have appeared in with me at The 55 and are wonderful friends too.\nKJ manages between 120-140 performances a year. New music, places to play and new festivals are what she\u2019s about these days \u201c\u2026 so we can keep on performing for new audiences. I can\u2019t stop, this is what I do.\u201d\n\nA crowd pleaser whose music is impossible to classify but very easy to enjoy, KJ Denhert is in her own special category.", "otherInfo": "The KJ's Jazz Project is comimg to town New Jersey with Joe Strasser, drums Adam Armstrong bass and Tim Regusis keys!!

I loved Sergio Mendes\u2019 songs, liked John Hartford on the Glenn Campbell Show and really got into James Taylor and Joni Mitchell who I still consider my two main influences. I also loved the singer-songwriters of the time including Carole King and Laura Nyro and later fell in love with Steely Dan\u2019s music, and just wore out my copy of Hubert Laws\u2019 Rite Of Spring. I was completely self-taught, by llistening to records and playing them over and over, teaching myself tablature from a great James Taylor book and modal tunings from Joni Mitchell\u2019s For The Roses song book. I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit. Other long term members include drummer Ray Levier and keyboardist Peter Vitalone, both of whom have been with KJ since\u201998 and \u201899. I am always interested in stretching myself and performing my music in different ways. The Lucky 7 recordings feature some wonderful pairings of great players that I don\u2019t always get to tour with but who have appeared in with me at The 55 and are wonderful friends too.\nKJ manages between 120-140 performances a year. New music, places to play and new festivals are what she\u2019s about these days \u201c\u2026 so we can keep on performing for new audiences.

Sadly, I attempted violin as a young child and was brutally bad. My parents had some how had me listening to classical music at that time which probably explains the violin attempt. Then a miracle happened\u2026First, the Beatles arrived so, bye bye classical & then my aunt who was buying a new piano (the wealthier end of the family) offered me her old one. I\u2019m 8 1/2 so I was still agreeable to anything so I promised to take lessons and really work at it.\nI lied\u2026After a year and a half I quit\u2026..until I discovered Elton John. That was it! I was determined to be a musician. In the late 70\u2019s I joined a fairly succesful 50\u2019s/60\u2019s band called Slick. I played 6 nights a week and worked full time at a department store as a stock man (person in this politically correct universe). Exhaustion wasn\u2019t considered. I went to gigs with a thermos of tea and lemon since I was always sick. This lasted until the early 80\u2019s. I joined a band called Loose Change which (under my direction) played anything from the 1960\u2019s- whatever was current. That lasted 12 years. Many years of putting my ears in harms way and breathing in way to much bar smoke told me it was time to quit. This was somewhere around 1993/94 (I don\u2019t remember). The next time I played live was in 2004 at my local block party. That\u2019s what I needed to get the itch to play again but, I was working in retail at Sam Ash Music and simply had no time to gig. In 2007 I was offered a better job which offered me a 9-5 existence. The economy turned sour and earning extra cash became a priority. And then it happened\u2026.I walked into a local Italian restaurant called Vera\u2019s Trattoria to pick up a pizza and lo and behold (fancy words ehh?) a piano player was pumping out Jazz licks. Can you imagine? Live music! I decided to approach the owner to see if I could score a gig. He decided to try me the following week. I was hired as a permanent fixture on Saturday nights. Thus The Richie G Review was born. \u201cA one man band Piano/vocals using backing tracks and a voice harmonizer to create a full band sound.

He decided that entertainment was unnecessary. I got to work recording a CD of covers and creating business cards. The hard work paid off!

I was approached by my soon to be partner Wendy Kelly. I was on the floor wiring up my equipment as she, asked me questions about what I do (kind of music, etc). I was excited believing that I was going to be hired for a private party. During the break, she handed me her card.It turned out she was interested in joining me. I wasn\u2019t looking but, I agreed to see what she sounded like at my rehearsal space (haha my basement). Three songs later I was convinced. We sounded great together.

Namely, the former still leaves the guy just enough wiggle room to happily say \u201cyes\u201d when legends (and friends) on the level of Ray Wylie Hubbard or the Flatlanders need a can-do guitar man for a sold-out theater engagement. Or, say, when fellow A-list Austin sideman \u201cScrappy\u201d Jud Newcomb \u2014 the MVP co-producer of Sleeping Dogs \u2014 finds out he can\u2019t make it to a very special Johnny Nicholas gig in Hawaii, and asks \u201cPlank\u201d if he\u2019d be up for subbing for him. Who in their right mind is going to say no to that?\n\nPlankenhorn still selectively takes those kinds of calls not because he gets them, but because he\u2019s earned them. For the better part of the last 17 years, ever since he first moved to Texas with nothing to his name but a Geo Prism, $100, seven guitars and the generous hospitality of Ray and Judy Hubbard, the gifted multi-instrumentalist from Columbus, Ohio has busted ass to prove himself not just able and willing, but above all worthy of playing with the best of the best. And the reason so many song poets like Hubbard and Joe Ely like having Plank at their side is not just because of his prodigious chops on all things stringed (especially those played with a slide), but because of his intuitive knack for knowing when to hold back, always allowing the singer room to land a lyric and go for the proverbial kill. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the skill set I learned very early on: \u2018When in doubt, layout,\u2019\u201d Plankenhorn explains with a chuckle. \u201cThat joke about knowing when not to play? It's true.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, that particular skill \u2014 along with myriad other lessons in the finer points of songcraft that he\u2019s picked up from sharing stages with the masters \u2014 has come to greatly inform Plankenhorn\u2019s own music over the years. But it\u2019s never been more apparent than it is on Sleeping Dogs. Make no mistake: Plank plays a lot of guitar on the album, along with pedal steel, piano, upright bass and seemingly anything else he could lay his hands on during the sessions at the Zone recording studio just outside of Austin. But in stark contrast to SoulSlide, which by his own admission was by design a showcase for his custom-designed lap slide guitar, a patented \u201cFrankenstein\u201d beauty he calls \u201cthe Plank,\u201d Sleeping Dogs is first and foremost all about the songs.\n\n\u201cThe Plank guitar came from me wanting to mix together the two worlds of bluegrass dobro and the sacred steel tradition, and my whole last album was dedicated to that one instrument \u2014 to get it out there,\u201d he says. \u201cSoulSlide also really helped put me on the map as a solo artist, which is why I\u2019ve moved on to focusing more on doing my own thing and only doing a side gig once in a while when I really want to, with people that I really respect. But now, with Sleeping Dogs, I wanted to take a bigger look at how the whole world of music is available to me; it\u2019s not about just one guitar or sound, but rather about using all of the instruments I play and bringing all of my influences together \u2014 and about really wanting to bring my songwriting to the forefront.\u201d\n\nTo that end, there are no covers on the new album, but half of the songs were born out of co-writing sessions with a handful of his longtime friends including his co-producer (and bandmate in Austin\u2019s the Resentments) Newcomb, Gabriel Rhodes, Miles Zuniga, Jon Dee Graham, and of course Hubbard \u2014 the \u201cWylie Llama\u201d of Americana/Texas music, who Plankenhorn still credits as his personal gateway to the whole scene. \u201cPretty much everyone I\u2019ve ever played with is like, one degree of separation away from Ray,\u201d he marvels with a laugh. It was also Hubbard who set Plankenhorn straight years ago when he doubted his own merits as a songwriter.\n\n\u201cI had just started out playing some of my own songs at these little acoustic gigs, but I remember telling him, \u2018Ray, I don't think I should be doing this \u2014 I\u2019m just a side guy.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Where\u2019s your proof? Are people coming to your shows? Are people listening to your songs? Yes? Well, there\u2019s your proof.\u2019\u201d\n\nNaturally, the song Plankenhorn and Hubbard cooked up together, a satisfyingly greasy howler called \u201cTooth and Nail,\u201d just happens to be all about the not-for-the-timid troubadour path and the discipline of songwriting, without so much as a grain of sugar to sweeten the pot. \u201cWe had already written a good portion of the song when he came back to me and said, \u2018It\u2019s like an old cat having kittens / You just crawl under the porch and do it,\u2019 which is a very Ray line,\u201d Plankenhorn says. \u201cBut what\u2019s cool is there were other lines where his wife, Judy, was like, \u2018Ray must have written that,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Ha, no, that was me!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the Hubbard-certified gnarled blues of \u201cTooth and Nail\u201d is just one of a handful of different styles Plankenhorn makes his own on Sleeping Dogs. Both the hurricane Harvey-inspired \u201cFurther to Fall\u201d (co-written with Rhodes) and the closing \u201cHeaven on Earth,\u201d Plankenhorn\u2019s awestruck tribute to his wife\u2019s transcendent love of nature, hit the same deep, soulful notes that defined his last album (with that trusty Plank guitar put to especially righteous use on the latter song). But there\u2019s also \u201cThis Guitar,\u201d a disarmingly folky, listening-room-ready paean to the workhorse acoustic Martin that\u2019s been his go-to writing guitar ever since it was anonymously gifted to him not long after he first moved to Texas. And perhaps most surprising of all (even to Plankenhorn himself), there\u2019s even a few free-spirited ventures into buoyantly catchy, unabashedly poppy rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\n\u201cI had already recorded a few rhythm tracks before this, but the day that Scrappy first came to the studio was also the day that Tom Petty died \u2014 and somehow, everything just kind of shifted that day,\u201d he says. \u201cNot on the entire album, but for a good portion of it, there were discussions of like, \u2018What would Mike Campbell do on this guitar part?\u2019 And out of that, some of the songs like \u2018Sleeping Dogs\u2019 and \u2018I Don't Know Anything\u2019 really changed and moved into more of a roots-rock thing. Which wasn\u2019t something I was expecting \u2014 I mean, it came out of nowhere \u2014 but I loved it.\u201d\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be the last happy surprise, either. The stately, hymn-like \u201cHoly Lightning,\u201d an arresting co-write with Newcomb and Zuniga (of Fastball fame), actually almost didn\u2019t make the final cut. \u201cI had started that one myself but just really wasn\u2019t digging it, so I took it to Miles and Scrappy in the studio, and between the three of us we completely reworked it from scratch over a couple of hours,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut even then I still wasn\u2019t entirely about it. But then Scrappy sent the demo to Patty Griffin, and she goes, \u2018I want to sing on this!\u2019 As soon as she said that, I was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m definitely putting it on the album now!\u2019\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, \u201cHoly Lightning\u201d is now one of his favorite songs on the record. Not that there\u2019s a single track that he\u2019s not proud of on Sleeping Dogs, which is a testament both to the positive experience he had recording it and the confidence he feels going forward into the next stage of his career. And should he even find himself second-guessing his conviction on that solo sojourn, well, he\u2019s already written his own anthem to sing his way through the doubt.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote \u2018Sleeping Dogs,\u2019 I got this image of sleeping dogs lying, and how I need to let shit go,\u201d he explains. \u201cI literally took a lot of things that I\u2019m really bad at or think I\u2019m really bad at, and told myself, \u2018If I sing this for a year or two on tour, it may make me better at these things; maybe I won\u2019t take stuff personally, won\u2019t let things get me down.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Maybe somebody else will hear this song and maybe it will help them, too.\u2019 And I really like that idea: I like the idea of writing songs that have a little moral imperative to them.\u201d\n\nSome would call that a sense of purpose. Or, as Hubbard put it best to Plankenhorn way back at the start of his journey, \u201cThere\u2019s your proof.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1626 Broadway, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "Sugar Sammy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9615967.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.984131, 40.760952], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Carolines On Broadway", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Sugar Sammy is a superstar in Canada and one of the hottest comedians on the international circuit.

Melanie is poised to enlighten new generations about what it means to sing with both passion and eloquence, to write at once with intelligence and emotion, and to inspire through song\u2026 and nobody does this better than Melanie.\n\nOthers learned this that night at Woodstock, where as a New York kid barely known outside of the coffeehouse circuit in Greenwich Village, she sang her song \"Beautiful People\" and inspired the first panorama of candles and cigarette lighters ever raised at a concert event. That, in turn, moved the young singer to write \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain\"), which sold more than one million copies in 1970 and prompted Billboard, Cashbox, Melody Maker, Record World, and Bravo to anoint her as female vocalist of the year. Her single \"Brand New Key,\" an infectious romp about freedom and roller skates, topped the charts in 1971.\n\nAnd so her story began.\n\nWith guitar in hand and a talent that combined amazing vocal equipment, disarming humor, and a vibrant engagement with life, she was booked as the first solo pop/rock artist ever to appear from the Royal Albert Hall to Carnegie Hall, the Metropolitan Opera House, and later opened the New Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Sydney Opera House, and in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where she was invited to perform on many occasions as delegates greeted her performances with standing ovations.\n\nThe top television hosts of all time -- Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson, and Dick Cavett -- battled to book her. (After her stunning performance on his show, Sullivan goggled that he had not seen such a \"dedicated and responsive audience since Elvis Presley.\")\n\nAccolades rolled in, from critics (\"Melanie's cult has long been famous, but it's a cult that's responding to something genuine and powerful -- which is maybe another way of saying that this writer counts himself as part of the cult too,\" wrote John Rockwell in The New York Times) as well as peers (\"Melanie,\" insisted jazz piano virtuoso Roger Kellaway, \"is extraordinary to the point that she could be sitting in front of us in this room and sing something like 'Momma Momma' right to us, and it would just go right through your entire being.\")\n\nIn the years that followed Melanie continued to record, continued to tour.\n\nUNICEF made her its spokesperson; Jimi Hendrix's father introduced her to the multitude assembled for the twentieth anniversary of Woodstock. Her records continued to sell -- more than eighty million to date. She's had her songs covered by singers as diverse as Cher, Dolly Parton, and Macy Gray. She's raised a family, won an Emmy, opened a restaurant, written a musical about Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane\u2026\n\nShe has, in short, lived a rare life. But all of it was just a prelude to what's about to come.\n\n\"For the first time, I'm not afraid to voice exactly what I feel. I used to feel that I didn't want to say too much, but now I can say anything. I feel like a person who's never been heard. Maybe people think they've heard me, but they never really have.

Drawing from a vast wellspring of American musical traditions, the singer/pianist/composer/bandleader has created a large and accomplished body of work and employed a vast array of stylistic approaches. Throughout this period, Hornsby has maintained the integrity, virtuosity and artistic curiosity that have been hallmarks of his work from the start.\n\nHornsby and his band The Range's first album The Way It Is (1986) was steadily and slowly building in popularity in the U.S. when in August the title track exploded on BBC Radio One in England, then Europe, the rest of the world and finally in the United States. The record went on to sell three million records, the band played Saturday Night Live and opened for Steve Winwood, John Fogerty, Huey Lewis, the Grateful Dead and the Eurythmics before becoming headliners on their own tour supported by Crowded House.\n\nSoon Hornsby was being approached regularly to collaborate with a broad range of musicians and writers, a demand that continues to this day. He has played on records for Bob Dylan, Robbie Robertson, Bonnie Raitt (piano on her iconic \"I Can't Make You Love Me\"), Willie Nelson, Don Henley, Bob Seger, Squeeze, Stevie Nicks, Chaka Khan, Charlie Haden, Jack DeJohnette, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Justin Vernon (of Bon Iver), Leon Russell, Chris Whitley, Warren Zevon, Bernie Taupin, Brandon Flowers (of the Killers), Cowboy Junkies, Shawn Colvin, Bela Fleck, Randy Scruggs, Hillary Scott, the Wild Magnolias, Clint Black, Sara Evans, Clannad and many more. He has worked on his own records with Ornette Coleman, Jerry Garcia, Eric Clapton, Sting, Elton John, Mavis Staples, Phil Collins, Pat Metheny, Branford Marsalis, Wayne Shorter and Justin Vernon, among others. Along with his early collaborator, brother Jonathan Hornsby and latter-day partner Chip deMatteo, Bruce has co-written songs with Robert Hunter (the great Grateful Dead lyricist), Robbie Robertson, Don Henley, Leon Russell, Charlie Haden, Chaka Khan, and Jack DeJohnette. His songs have been recorded by another broad array of artists including Tupac Shakur (his iconic \"Changes\"), Akon, E-40, Chaka Khan, Don Henley, Leon Russell, Willie Nelson, Mase, Randy Scruggs, and Robbie Robertson.\n\nOver the years Hornsby has successfully ventured into bluegrass, jazz, classical, and even electronica, reflected on acclaimed releases like two projects with Ricky Skaggs- Ricky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby (2007) and the live Cluck Ol' Hen (2013), the jazz trio album Camp Meeting (2007) with Jack DeJohnette and Christian McBride, and \"Solo Concerts (2014), a stylistic merging of traditional American roots music and the dissonance and adventure of modern classical music. This latter-day interest has led to an orchestral project spearheaded by Michael Tilson Thomas featuring this new music; the first performance occurred in January 2015 with Tilson Thomas' New World Symphony, and the latest concert with more new material came in February 2017 with the University of Miami graduate orchestra.\n\nHis three Grammy wins (along with his ten Grammy losses!) typify the diversity of his career: Best New Artist (1986) as leader of Bruce Hornsby and the Range, Best Bluegrass Recording (1989) for a version of his old Range hit \"The Valley Road\" that appeared on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's Will The Circle Be Unbroken Volume Two, and a shared award with Branford Marsalis in 1993 for Best Pop Instrumental for \"Barcelona Mona\", a song written and performed for the 1992 Olympic Games.\n\nThe sales stats and breadth of his collaborations (including being sampled many times by rap/hip-hop artists) speak volumes about Hornsby's unique fusion of mainstream appeal and wild musical diversity. His albums have sold over eleven million copies worldwide. Harbor Lights (1993) won the Downbeat Reader's Poll Album of the Year in 1994. Tupac Shakur co-wrote a new song over \"The Way It Is\" music called \"Changes\"; it was a major worldwide hit in 1998, selling 15 million copies. In 2006 his 4 CD set Intersections was selected as one of the best boxed sets of the year by the New York Times. His song \"Levitate\" was selected in 2011 by Sports Illustrated as one of the top 40 sports songs of all time. The most recent record from Bruce and his current band The Noisemakers, which includes Sonny Emory on drums, JV Collier on bass, JT Thomas on keyboards, Ross Holmes on fiddle & mandolin and Gibb Droll on guitar, Rehab Reunion (a collection featuring Bruce on the Appalachian dulcimer) entered the Billboard album chart at 101 upon release in 2016, marking his tenth album appearance on the venerable chart over a thirty-year period. In 2016 the annual Rolling Stone \"Hot List\" selected Bruce as \"Hot Surprise Influence\", citing his influence and inspiration on such modern artists as Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) and Ryan Adams.\n\nThroughout the years Hornsby has participated in several memorable events: the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame opening concert in September 1995 (with the performance included on the concert album), Farm Aid IV and VI, the Telluride Bluegrass Festival (many times), the Newport Jazz Festival (2007), New Orleans Heritage and Jazz Festival (1997 and 2011), Woodstock II (1994), Woodstock III (1999, with the band's performance included on the concert album), and the Bonnaroo Festival (2011). Hornsby, solo and with Branford Marsalis, has performed the National Anthem for many major events including the NBA All-Star game, four NBA Finals, the 1997 World Series Game 5, the night Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's all-time consecutive game streak, and the soundtrack to \"Baseball: A Film By Ken Burns\". Most recently he was a special guest of Bon Iver for their set at the Coachella festival in April 2017.\n\nBruce's long involvement with the Grateful Dead began when the group asked him to open two shows in Monterey, CA in the spring of 1987. Bruce and the Range continued to open shows for the Dead in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and after the tragic death of Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland the band asked him to play with them. He started winging it with them with no rehearsal for five nights at Madison Square Garden in September 1990,, and played more than 100 shows with them until March 1992. He continued to sit in with the band every year until Jerry Garcia passed away in 1995. He played in the first post-Dead band \"The Other Ones\" in 1998 (the album The Strange Remain chronicles that tour) and 2000. Bruce reunited with the band for the 50th Anniversary Fare Thee Well concerts in June and July 2015 at Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, CA) and Soldier Field (Chicago). He appears on seven Grateful Dead records including Infrared Roses and View From The Vault II.\n\nBruce has been part of many tribute records including two Grateful Dead collections, the original Deadicated (1991) and the recent massive compilation curated by the band The National entitled \"Day of the Dead\". He recorded \"Black Muddy River\" with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver and Justin's high school band DeYarmond Edison. Other tribute record appearances include Two Rooms- A Tribute To The Songs of Elton John and Bernie Taupin, a Keith Jarrett tribute, a tribute to The Band, a Fats Domino collection, Ricky Skaggs' Big Mon- the music of Bill Monroe, and a Jackson Browne tribute record.\n\nA University of Miami alum, Hornsby has partnered with The Frost School of Music to establish the Creative American Music Program, a curriculum designed to develop the creative skills of talented young artist/songwriters by immersing them in diverse American folk, blues, and gospel traditions that form the foundations of modern American songwriting.\n\nIndeed, Bruce Hornsby's restless musical spirit continues to spontaneously push him forward into exciting new musical pursuits. He's composed and performed for many projects with long-time collaborator, filmmaker Spike Lee including end-title songs for two films, Clockers (1995, with Chaka Khan) and Bamboozled (2001). He contributed music for If God is Willin' And the Creek Don't Rise (2010), Old Boy (2013) and Chiraq (2015), and full film scores for Kobe Doin' Work, Lee's 2009 ESPN Kobe Bryant documentary, 2012's Red Hook Summer, Da Sweet Blood of Jesus (2015), and Lee's film for the NBA2K16 video game (2015). Bruce wrote and performed the end title song \"Set Me In Motion\" for Ron Howard's Backdraft (1991) and a featured song \"Big Stick\" for Ron Shelton's Tin Cup (1996). He's currently working with DeMatteo on a musical entitled SCKBSTD, and contributed music for Disney/Pixar's Planes: Fire And Rescue (2014). Hornsby is also featured onscreen in and contributed music to the Robin Williams/ Bobcat Goldthwaite film World's Greatest Dad (2009), the first (and last!) time he has been asked to \"act\". His latest score, for Spike Lee's Netflix production She's Gotta Have It, was completed Summer 2017.\n\nThree decades after Bruce Hornsby established his global name as the creator of pop hits that defined \"the sound of grace on the radio,\" as a Rolling Stone reviewer once wrote, such projects continue and are consistent with his lifelong pursuit of musical transcendence. \"It's always been about staying inspired, broadening my reach and range of abilities and influences, and exploring new areas\", Hornsby says. \"I'm very fortunate to be able to do that, to be a lifelong student, and to continue to pursue a wide-ranging musical life.\"\n\nDiscography-\nThe Way It Is (1986)\nScenes From The Southside (1988)\nA Night On The Town (1990)\nHarbor Lights (1993)\nHot House (1995)\nSpirit Trail (1998)\nHere Come The Noisemakers (2001)\nBig Swing Face (2002)\nHalcyon Days (2004)\nIntersections (Boxed Set- 2006)\nRicky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby (2007)\nCamp Meeting (2007)\nGreatest Radio Hits (2004)\nLevitate (2009)\nBride of the Noisemakers (2011)\nSoundtrack- Red Hook Summer (2012)\nCluck Ol' Hen- Skaggs-Hornsby Live (2013)\nSolo Concerts(2014)\nThe Essential Bruce Hornsby (Sony Collection- 2015)\nRehab Reunion (2016)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "167 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Pinkie", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/168660.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988702, 40.72133], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Slipper Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "A wild and scandalous rock'n'roll experience, featuring the hottest aerialists, circus, and burlesque performers in NYC."}, {"Address": "2 6th Ave, New York, NY 10013", "Artist": "Jeffery Miller", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9014226.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.004911, 40.719153], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Hip-Hop, Soul, R&B", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Django", "moreBioInfo": "At the age of 15, New Orleans bred trombonist, singer-songwriter Jeffery Miller first performed at Carnegie Hall as a guest on the Preservation Hall Jazz Band.

The band's line-up was solidified with the addition of percussionist Domingo \"Sunny\" Ortiz and keyboard player John \"JoJo\" Hermann and Duane Trucks on drums.\n\nOver three decades have past since forming their original line-up in 1986, Widespread Panic is still hungry to be the best band they can be, every single night, for their loyal fan base. Their accomplishments over that time are well-documented. During their impressive run, the band has released 12 studio albums (including Street Dogs) and 43 live albums, selling more than 3 million copies as one of the most successful touring acts in the world. Widespread Panic has broken attendance records at major venues throughout the country, including a staggering 48 sold-out shows at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado.

Whether performing with his own quartet or supporting Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett on tour, Newman\u2019s expert trumpeteering and effervescent stage presence reignited a big band scene in New York City, and has since enticed a new generation of jazz fans across the globe. The Verve Recording artist continues to reign at his weekly residency in New York, as well as appear on television programs and in special performances across the United States and Europe.\nNewman is known for his impeccable horn playing and rendition of romantic favorites. But what sets him apart is his ability to command a room not only with his musical talent, but as a bandleader who makes each person in the audience feel as if they are a part of his performance. His fusion of music playing and easy going banter captures the vivacity of great bandleaders of the past. This exuberance is evident on Newman\u2019s 2016 debut album, Eyes on the City, which pays tribute to his musical journey in New York.\nAlong with his Quartet, fellow musicians from Cincinnati\u2019s College-Conservatory of Music, Newman has allured audiences during his residencies at some of New York\u2019s most iconic venues. His first foray into creating an old school big band night was at the elegant Duane Park for \u201cAfter Dark,\u201d a jazz and burlesque revue on the downtown scene in Tribeca. \u201cAfter Dark\u201d lead to a weekly residency at the legendary Oak Room at The Plaza Hotel, a venue steeped in history which was frequented by the likes of Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli and countless others over its one hundred year history. Newman and his Quartet played each Wednesday to a mixed crowd seeking a slice of history, welcoming Lady Gaga as a surprise guest, until the venue closed in 2011. Currently, Newman performs every Tuesday and Thursday, as bandleader in a residency at Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel, and select Friday nights at NYC\u2019s legendary Rainbow Room with his orchestra. Brian also routinely appears for special live performances with a diverse array of musical acts, which have included Tony Bennett, Jose Feliciano, Stevie Wonder, Mark Murphy, Dierks Bentley, Willie Nile, Molly Ringwald, David Loeb, Steve Wynn\u2019s Orchestra, Ray Benson\u2019s Asleep at the Wheel and Tommy London.\nNewman\u2019s personal style, which meshes classic suits, vintage tattoos and rock-n-roll, has attracted commercial brands such as Jack Daniel\u2019s, Marc Jacobs and Tiffany & Co., who have collaborated with Newman for special events and performances. The Jack Daniel\u2019s partnership in 2012, which launched the brand\u2019s Sinatra Select premium Tennessee Whiskey, brought Newman alongside Frank Sinatra Jr. himself, in a performance in Cannes, France.\nBrian married burlesque star, Angie Pontani of the World Famous Pontani Sisters in February 2013, with whom he most notably performs in connection with Pontani\u2019s New York Burlesque Festival and Burlesque-a-Pades shows.

We live in an era where it is too easy to tune out, and let indifference and discouragement numb us,\u201d says NYC-based and Cleveland-born rocker Dan Miraldi. Love Under Fire began as an interruption. Miraldi was ready to complete his fourth full-length album; the songs were written and demoed. The first single was released. But then November 9th hit, and his plans changed. Miraldi explains: \u201cThe current political climate compelled me to put my typical type of songs temporarily aside and instead write and record Love Under Fire.\u201d Musically, the EP is driven by big bone-rattling rock anthems. Lyrically, the singer digs deep and discusses current social and political issues, providing his listeners with six stellar modern protest songs. Love Under Fire\u2019s first single, \u201cThe Sweet Sound of Protest,\u201d focuses on anti-fascism. It\u2019s loud and brash, just as a song about such things should be. \u201cI wanted to go on record as to where I stand politically and socially,\u201d Miraldi says. \u201cMy goal is to uplift and unite people in nonviolent action and in anti-complacency.\u201d \u201cNo Words\u201d grapples with shootings that have become all-too-normal throughout the US, and the current state of gun legislation. Miraldi makes his stance loud and clear. \u201cFear is a Powerful Drug\u201d continues with a journey, venturing through despair and fear and eventually ending with hope. Fear is a powerful drug, but it\u2019s got nothing on love. The creation of \u201cName of Love\u201d spans quite a bit of time, originally started when Miraldi was a teenager in Ohio. His music career began in his teens, playing playing Cleveland rock clubs with bands like the Cherry Flavored Elevator and Exit Suburbia. Realizing the same problems that concerned him as a teenager are still relevant -- war, religious and political extremism, environmental concerns and guns -- he re-recorded the song for the EP. Miraldi released the full-length solo album Sugar & Adrenaline in 2012, working with Grammy-nominee Dave Douglas (Relient K). The album received airplay on over 140 FM stations, and supported by a 50-date national tour. He released a pair of EPs, the acoustic Freewheelin\u2019 and the electric Devil At Our Heels in 2013, recording the with Chris Grainger (Wilco, Sixpence None The Richer, Switchfoot) for the latter. Miraldi and his band performed at SXSW in both 2013 and 2014, preceding his move to New York. In 2015, Miraldi released his third full-length album Chaos, Destruction & Dancing, expanding beyond the retro-flavored power-pop and gritty rock and roll that first brought him success by blending in modern elements of indie-pop. The record pleased both fans and critics. Miraldi toured behind the album, playing shows from coast to coast in the US and by also performing in Europe. The album\u2019s track \u201cJunkie Friend\u201d earned the singer-songwriter his second recognition from the John Lennon Songwriting Contest, as a finalist in the \u201cBest Folk Song\u201d category, following previous recognition for \u201cThe Holy Roller Stone Revival\u201d as a finalist in the \u201cBest Rock Song\u201d in 2010. In the past 10 years, he has shared the bills with likes of J. Roddy Walston & the Business, Nelly, Wiz Khalifa, the Wailers, Wild Feathers, the Trews, Wally Bryson of the Raspberries, Beatle offspring James McCartney, Family of the Year, Welshly Arms, Ari Hest, Blackalicious, the Cool Kids, Fiery Furnaces, and even Wang Chung. Love Under Fire continues Miraldi\u2019s evolution in music, offering loud rock and roll with tinges of the indie-pop that\u2019s infiltrated his sound. Though the album found Miraldi branching out beyond his comfort zone, he says: \u201cThis is not business as usual. This is not the fun-time power-pop-rock album I set out to make. Love Under Fire is the loud rock and roll record I needed to make.\u201d Straight-up Rock N Roll", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "599 Johnson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Haleek Maul", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.923155, 40.709325], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Elsewhere - Zone One", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Elsewhere is intended to be a safe space to enjoy music, art, expression, and free play.

Bucky Pizzarelli calls him \u201ca damn good guitarist.\u201d He believes jazz is music that should make the heart race, the blood pump, and the feet move. Towards that end, Rasmussen founded the Boardwalk Jazz Band, New York\u2019s only 21 piece band to feature four different vocalists and almost entirely original music.\n\nBorn in 1990, Rasmussen entered a world where jazz seemed reserved more for intellectuals than real people. Picking up the guitar at age 10, he spent more time learning Stevie Ray Vaughan and Eric Clapton than working his way through the Real Book. While his passion for rock and blues never waned, his eclectic taste and exploratory spirit never stopped looking for new music to learn; soon enough he was practicing Joe Pass and Yardbird alongside Slowhand under the watchful eye of Andrew Light. A great guitarist in his own right, Andrew introduced PJ to the wide world of jazz. He has never looked back, studying Jazz Performance at William Patterson University and leading groups that have included Scott Robinson, Rich Perry, Jim Ridl, Steve Davis, and a host of others.\n\n\u201cAn American Christmas\u201d was the Boardwalk Jazz Band\u2019s first national television broadcast. Filmed at the City Winery in NYC, the special was available in over 90% of homes across the country, anchored by WCBS ch. 2 and airing Christmas day. The show, which also featured special guest Bucky Pizzarelli, was immediately renewed and is now an annual special.\n\nThe success of \u201cAn American Christmas\u201d also led to \u201cSounds of Summer,\u201d which aired locally on WABC ch. 7 as well as about 100 other stations across the country. It is also now an annual broadcast.\n\nIn six short years since bursting onto the jazz scene with \u201cAdventures and Flight\u201d and his follow up top 20 album \u201cAnother Adventure,\u201d PJ Rasmussen has garnered exceptional praise. JazzTimes named Adventures in Flight \u201cone of the best debut releases of 2013,\u201d and All About Jazz declares: \u201cRasmussen\u2019s arranging is stellar, his horn charts precise and engaging.\u201d AXS named \u201cAnother Adventure\u201d one of the top albums to introduce jazz to non-jazz fans, calling the music \u201capproachable, credible, and delightful.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "146 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Stonefield", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9011129.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.963479, 40.7101], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Baby's All Right", "moreBioInfo": "BENT (2019)StonefieldFrom practicing in their family shed as teenagers in rural Australia, to touring the world with Fleetwood Mac, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, King Tuff, and King Gizzard, it\u2019s been a strange trip for the four Findlay sisters. As Stonefield, they\u2019ve got three albums and thousands of miles under their belts, plus plenty of perspective on what it\u2019s like to fight to make a place for themselves, and tell their own story.\n\nWritten largely on the road in America earlier this year, the songs on BENT are filled with reference and reflection--the kind that comes from months spent far from home, living on four wheels. The surreal isolation of trudging through white-out snow and snaking down deserted highways served as the perfect backdrop for the band to look inward, taking stock of the journey they\u2019ve taken thus far as musicians, and as people. \u201cIt\u2019s a culmination of experiences, emotions,and stories collected over time,\u201d explains lead singer and drummer Amy Findlay, \u201cA growth of honest, raw, energy that has been burning within us and waiting for its moment.\n\n\u201dRecorded in just five days with Joe Walker and Stu Mackenzie from King Gizzard at their studio in Melbourne, the album is almost 100% live. Besides being an impressive feat and the flexing of a confident band operating at the height of their powers, that immediacy lends the album a distinct, crackling energy--thunder, lightning, and muscle-bound horsepower. \u201cSleep\u201d opens the album with guitars covered in five inches of sludge and distortion and something that sounds like a far-off siren, or the high-pitched howling of the wind. It serves as a warning, a call to arms,kicking things off with a next-level version of the massive, unholy racket the band has become known for over the course of their last three albums.\n\nThe sonic inspiration taken from listening to Black Sabbath, Beak, Deep Purple, The Alan Parsons Project, and Mike Oldfield inject BENT with its sternum-shaking heaviness and ever-present swagger, but also its exploratory fearlessness--letting the songs loose to twist and turn, sticking to no one\u2019s rules but their own. Take the proggy, keyboard-soaked intro at the top of \u201cPeople,\u201d or the cheeky combination of tinnitus-inducing hard rock and hip-shaking boogie at thecore of \u201cDead Alive.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t make me think I\u2019ve lost control / I know exactly what you said / Don\u2019tmake me think it\u2019s in my head,\u201d Amy sings during the latter, keeping the lyrics as defiant as the music.\n\n\u201cThe album is about our own experiences and stories,\u201d explains Amy, \u201cSongs about the fear of walking home alone at night, stories of what it\u2019s like being an all-female band and the power of supporting one another.\" With that being the lyrical subject, the music that came out is definitely our heaviest.\u201d It\u2019s clear that darker thoughts were on the Findlay sisters\u2019 mind-- \u201cRoute 29,\u201d with its suspenseful synth intro was inspired by the creepy The Route 29 Stalker podcast the band was listening to as they drove the namesake road on their way to a gig with King Tuff, and the cascading synth line and slinky restraint of the hi-hat on \u201cIf I Die\u201d can only distract so much from the song\u2019s terror-stricken lyrics.\n\nIt\u2019s on the album\u2019s last two songs that the band makes their strongest statement, using \u201cShutdown\u201d to explore the doubt and search for validation that comes from moving and working within an industry that often makes the band feel like outsiders, lacing lines like \u201cIs it easy for you living / When you don\u2019t have to prove your meaning\u201d in between a battle-cry chorus and detonations of guitar and keyboard. And \u201cWoman\u201d takes it to the edge with a chorus of \u201cI am enough / I am woman,\u201d spelling it out for anyone that hasn\u2019t been paying attention.\n\nBENT has all the chills and spills you would expect from an album that mines inspiration from some of the darker experiences of being misrepresented, belittled, and underestimated. By taking control of the narrative, and pumping it up with stack-blowing, guitar hero riffs and razor-edged vocals, it becomes an album of power, control, and confidence--projected in the face of a world that too often forces the opposite.\n\nStonefield are:\nAmy Findlay: Drums/Vocals\nHannah Findlay: Guitar\nSarah Findlay: Keys\nHolly Findlay: Bass", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "131 MacDougal St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Uri Gurvich", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7919602.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00003, 40.730695], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Bar Next Door", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Uri Gurvich Trio at Bar Next Door w/ Edward Perez & Francisco Mela"}, {"Address": "The Bronx, NY", "Artist": "Jimmy McDonald", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7960592.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.80185, 40.815303], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Standup Comedy", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Bronx (TBA)", "moreBioInfo": "Jimmy McDonald toured the north east as a musician for several years before dropping the guitar and becoming a full on stand up comic.

The audience, however, is too busy dancing to the one-man acts layered guitar riffs, foot stomping percussion, blues harmonica, and emotionally charged lyrics to even think about looking away.\nThe New Jersey native is able to emulate the sound of a full rock band with his percussive fingerstyle approach to the acoustic guitar and an array of effects pedals. Kenny has even customized a vintage red suitcase which has been dubbed \u201cThe Big Red Suitcase\u201d to use as a kick drum, which has appeared with him on stage for over a decade of live performances.\nHis debut appearances at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park paved the way for Kenny\u2019s developing one-man band show and led him into the national touring circuit and beyond. Over years of honing his craft on the road, Kenny caught the attention of one of his guitar idols, Mickey Melchiondo, a.k.a. Dean Ween from WEEN. Melchiondo recently asked Kenny to tour opening up for his new band, The Dean Ween Group, and has gained him new fans around the United States. Kenny has also been spreading his music internationally with multiple tours throughout Europe and performances in SE Asia to raise awareness about unexploded bombs. In recent years he has shared the stage with the likes of John Butler Trio, Keller Williams, WEEN, The Dean Ween Group, Leon Russell, John Hammond Jr., New Riders of the Purple Sage and John Kadlecik (Further & Dark Star Orchestra). In January of 2016, The Eagles of Death Metal released Kenny\u2019s version of \"I Love You All The Time\" as a part of their Pay it Forward Campaign to raise money for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.\nOn his latest self-titled release, Kenny teamed up with three-time Grammy Winning Producer Justin Guip (Sound engineer for Levon Helm and current touring drummer for Hot Tuna) to create a record that expanded on his signature one-man band sound. The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks. With an influential voice that lies somewhere between Neil Young and Jack White, Kenny delivers clear and concise visions of dynamic musical deliverance. Combining a deep dive into tone, originality and believability, he ushers the listener into his brand new living room of roots riddled rock and roll.\nNever going for the standard attack, he flies far from the 12-bar blues, three-chord rock and Americana stereotype to land some place between a rock and a new place. The album illustrates a highly skilled writer who utilizes the same down-home approach in his music as he does with his day-to-day interactions with others. It\u2019s a combination that will continue to see Kenny reach exciting new levels as he helps future fans \u201csee the light\u201d of his musical message.\nTo hear his full discography, watch recent videos, and check out upcoming tour dates visit www.KeithKenny.com\n(Excerpt from John Pfieffer & Jessica Smith of The Aquarian Weekly)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "487 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "Damien Lemon", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.981649, 40.685861], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "EastVille Comedy Club - Brooklyn", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Janeane Garofalo, Damien Lemon, Corinne Fisher, No Two Drink Minimum -"}, {"Address": "17 Eastern Pkwy, Brooklyn, NY 11238", "Artist": "Anthony Atamanuik", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.968082, 40.673238], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Murmrr", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "New Media Touring Welcomes Trump Vs.

Back in the late 00s, Britt Reagan (guitar), Tim Hassler (fiddle), Titus Tompkins (drums/percussion), and Ben Quinn (mandolin) began playing music together at the University of Evansville in Indiana. As theater students, they often collaborated to score plays with music. Through these experiences, they quickly learned that their tastes, talents, and friendship formed a four-part harmony and they began writing their own material, culminating in an early collection of songs, \u201cRise and Shiner\u201d. After graduating, the group dispersed across the country, before reuniting in NYC.\n\nIn NYC, the group started busking all over the city, in parks and on subway platforms. Gigs soon followed and Mark Spitznagel (Rusty Guns) joined the band, bringing his virtuosic banjo style, which complemented the band\u2019s increasingly traditional repertoire. Highlighting their love of old time and bluegrass, as well as their raucous busking personality, the band paired up with Erik Samuelson (Three Crown Studio) to release their first 7-song EP, \u201cThe Good Morning Nags\u201d.\n\nThe band grew once more when Pete O\u2019Neill (Mama Juke, CC & The Boys, and more) brought his dynamic bass lines and rhythmic genius into the mix. With the current 6 members, the band turned its sights on recording a full-length album of original material. After an exciting songwriting process and a successful crowdfunding campaign, The Good Morning Nags returned to Three Crown Studio to record with Erik Samuelson.

With both eyes on the future and the blues in his blood, 20-year-old guitarist, vocalist and songwriter Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram is set to take the music world by storm with the long-awaited release of his debut album, KINGFISH, on Alligator Records. Sprung from the same earth as so many of the Delta blues masters, Kingfish comes bursting out of Clarksdale, Mississippi, just ten miles from the legendary crossroads of Highways 61 and 49. A student of the Delta's musical history, he is acutely aware of the musicians and the music that emerged from his corner of the world. \"I do think I have an old soul, that I've been here before,\" he says. \"I'm moving forward with one foot in the past.\"\n\n\"You don't see too many kids into blues music,\" says the nascent star. \"In my town, every kid wants to be a rapper \u2013 I wanted to do something no one else was doing.\" And although he grew up near the crossroads where Robert Johnson allegedly cut a deal with the devil, Kingfish insists he didn't do any of that to make his guitar howl the blues. \"I just practice all the time,\" he says, \"that's the only deal I made, and it's with myself.\"\n\nRecorded in Nashville and produced by two-time Grammy winner Tom Hambridge (Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi, Joe Louis Walker), KINGFISH showcases Ingram's blistering, raw and inspired guitar playing, soulful, deep vocals and songwriting. He tells stories with his solos, channeling the spirits of all the past masters while the music he makes is his own. He co-wrote eight of the album's 12 tracks. \"A lot of folks know me for my covers,\" he says. \"That's why it's important for me to release original music.\" The first radio single, Outside Of This Town, is a fierce statement of purpose \u2013 both musically and lyrically \u2013 from this rising star. The songs range from autobiographical (Been Here Before, Before I'm Old) to humorous (Trouble), and from white hot (It Ain't Right) to slow and searing (Love Ain't My Favorite Thing). His friend and mentor, Buddy Guy, adds vocals and guitar on Fresh Out while another friend, Keb Mo, brings his warm, conversational voice to Listen, and adds his rhythm and resonator guitars to six tracks.\n\nAlligator Records president Bruce Iglauer considers Kingfish a natural fit for the blues and roots label. \"At the age of 20, Kingfish is one of the most exciting and passionate young artists I've seen in many years. He's creating new music that feels like blues but doesn't copy what's ready been done. His roots are firmly in the Mississippi Delta, and you can hear that raw Delta honesty in his playing and singing. His guitar work is technically dazzling, but it's all about the emotions of the song and moving the audience. He's perfectly capable of crowd-pleasing shredding, but his music is remarkably mature. He knows which are the important notes, the notes that tell the story and grab the audience, and he leaves out the extraneous ones. He sings with the intensity and directness of a seasoned blues artist. He venerates the blues masters of the past and present but is eagerly making his own statement, inspired by the music they created. I'm watching him become a young, visionary blues giant. He has an amazing future ahead of him, and I'm proud that he's joined the Alligator family.\"\n\nKingfish is equally thrilled to have his debut album come out on Alligator, \"I never thought this would happen. I've been waiting to release my first record for such a long time. To have it come out on Alligator is a really great thing.\"\n\nBorn to a musical family near Clarksdale, Mississippi on January 19, 1999, Christone Ingram fell in love with music as a small child. There was always music playing around the house. His family sang (and continues to sing) at their family church. His mother, Princess Pride, is first cousin to country music legend Charley Pride. Christone starting hitting drums at age six and at nine he picked up the bass. Around this time his mother enrolled him in a program at the Delta Blues Museum. At age 11, he got his first guitar and quickly mastered it. The young prodigy soaked up music from Robert Johnson to Lightnin' Hopkins, from B.B. King to Muddy Waters, from Jimi Hendrix to Prince. Before long he could play like them all, but all the while he kept developing his own sound and style.\n\nChristone first stepped on stage at the age of 11 at Clarksdale's famous Ground Zero Club, playing behind one of his mentors, Mississippi blues icon Bill \"Howl-N-Madd\" Perry. Perry gifted the young musician with a new stage name, Kingfish. The young bluesman performed at the White House for Michelle Obama in 2014 as part of a delegation of young blues musicians from the Delta Blues Museum. By age 16 he was turning heads and winning awards, including the 2015 Rising Star Award, presented by The Rhythm & Blues Foundation.\n\nFunk music superstar Bootsy Collins began sharing Kingfish's YouTube videos \u2013 some with millions of views each \u2013 online, telling his followers \"this is how a child can influence others.\" Rapper The Game did the same. Christone's appeal beyond blues was immediate. He appeared on The Rachael Ray Show as well as The Steve Harvey Show. He was cast in season two of the Netflix program Luke Cage after the series lead producer saw one of his videos. Two of his cover songs appear on the show's soundtrack album, which immediately introduced him to a young audience who had never heard the blues before. Kingfish recently performed in an NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert with rap legend Rakim, who also appeared in Luke Cage.\n\nKingfish has shared stages with Buddy Guy, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Robert Randolph, Guitar Shorty, Eric Gales and many others. He has befriended rock stars from Nikki Sixx to Dave Grohl. Since graduating high school, Kingfish has continued his life on the road. He has performed at festivals around the country, including stops at the Chicago Blues Festival, the Beale Street Music Festival in Memphis, the Bonita Blues Festival in Florida, The Waterfront Blues Festival in Portland, on the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise, at Austin's Antone's and at San Francisco's famed Biscuits & Blues. He's performed in Europe multiple times, including appearances at the Moulin Blues Festival in the Netherlands and the Blues Heaven Festival in Denmark.\n\nIn addition to making music and touring the world, Kingfish donates his time and talent to two causes important to him. Through his work with various local Blues In The Schools programs, he visits with students around the country while he's on tour. \"It's important to teach kids about blues and music and give them another forum to express themselves.\" He's also an official ambassador for United By Music North America, a program helping people with developmental challenges, such as autism, to express themselves through music. \"Treat everybody right and anybody can do anything,\" says Kingfish.\n\nWith the release of KINGFISH and a major tour in the works (featuring dates with both Vampire Weekend and Buddy Guy), Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram is ready to blaze a trail with the blues torch that's been passed to him. With his eye-popping guitar playing and his reach-out-and-grab-you-by-the-collar vocals, Kingfish delivers each song with unmatched passion and precision. Steeped in the rich, vivid history of the blues, he's driven by his burning desire to create contemporary music that speaks to his generation and beyond. Kingfish is a real life 21st century bluesman who is inspired by the music of Robert Johnson, but dreams of one day collaborating with Kendrick Lamar and soul-funk bassist Thundercat. \"My core is blues,\" he says, \"but it's important for me to create a sound and style that is uniquely my own. I have a lot to say, so please stay tuned.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "161 Mamaroneck Ave, White Plains, NY 10601", "Artist": "Smooch Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10064485.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.76457, 41.02769], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "freebird kitchen and bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Matt Crossett and Mike Cesario of the amazing Soul/Funk group Smooch bring you a night of amazing music at Freebird Kitchen and Bar in White Plains, NY."}, {"Address": "140 Merrick Rd, Amityville, NY 11701", "Artist": "Jamie Dull", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10052609.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.4175, 40.6712], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Heavy Metal, Alt Country, Psychedelic, Stuff, Funk, Smooth Adult Contemporary, Groove, Jam Bands, EDM, Dreampop, Bluegrass, Soul, Alt Metal, Country, Pop, Rock, Roll", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Revolution Bar & Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "I'm a Chicago based musician, producer, and drum instructor.

Born in Toronto on April 12, 1954, Travers first picked up the guitar just prior to entering his teens, after witnessing a local performance by the great Jimi Hendrix. It wasn't long before Travers was studying the other top rock guitarists of the day (Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, etc.), and paying his dues by playing in bar bands in the Quebec area. His first true touring gig came his way when he hooked up with '50s rock n' roll vet Ronnie Hawkins (best known for performing with a backing cast that would eventually transform into The Band). But Travers' main love was hard rock, so after a year, he packed up his belongings and headed to London. Shortly after touchdown in the U.K., Travers recorded a demo that would land him a recording deal with Polydor and result in the release of his debut, Pat Travers, during the spring of 1976. A performance at England's annual Reading Festival the same year only peaked interest, which resulted in two more releases in 1977, Makin' Magic and Putting It Straight (both of which followed a pre-Iron Maiden Nicko McBrain on drums), before Travers returned to North America and set his sights on the U.S. rock market. Hooking up with a fine backing band comprised of drummer Tommy Aldridge, guitarist Pat Thrall, and bassist Mars Cowling, the new Travers band lineup premiered on 1979's Heat in the Street. This led to Travers' most commercially successful period, resulting in a pair of Top 30 releases, 1979's Live! Go For What You Know (considered by many Travers fans to be his finest hour) and 1980's Crash and Burn. But soon after the dawn of the '80s, bluesy hard rock seemed to quickly fall out of favor amongst the U.S. record buying public, in favor of slickly produced arena rock, and later, MTV-approved bands. As a result, each subsequent Travers release sold less, as his last albums to appear on the U.S. album charts included 1981's Radio Active, 1982's Black Pearl, and 1984's Hot Shot. Unhappy with Polydor, Travers opted to take a break from releasing albums for the remainder of the decade, but continued to tour. Travers' 1990 comeback album, School of Hard Knocks, failed to re-spark interest on the charts, although he continued to issue new studio albums (Blues Tracks, Just a Touch, Blues Magnet, etc.) and archival live sets (King Biscuit Flower Hour, BBC Radio One Live in Concert) throughout the decade. Travers continues to tour and record regularly (playing alongside the likes of Night Ranger's Jeff Watson, Cinderella's Tom Keifer, and Rick Derringer), and in 2001, performed as part of the 'Voices of Classic Rock' tour. Travers emerged from the recording studio once more in 2003, with P.T. Power Trio, a recording that featured covers by the likes of Cream (\"White Room\"), Robin Trower (\"Day of the Eagle\"), and ZZ Top (\"Nasty Dogs and Funky Kings\"), among others.

The talented singer and songwriter was always surrounded by music from an early age. His father is veteran reggae singer Jimmy Riley. Riley has learnt a lot by merely being in the environment of the music business. He caught on very quickly and made his recording debut as a teenager. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved music; I used to deejay but everyone used to encourage me to sing. They used to call me \u201cSingy Singy\u201d because I was always singing,\u201d Riley commented. In 2004, Tarrus released his debut album, Challenges. \u201cI was fortunate to have recorded my debut album with an independent label out of Miami\u201d. The secret to his success is quite simple \u2013 \u201cwhen preparation meets opportunity\u201d, stated a self-assured Riley. \u2018I sing for the people - this is the contribution I can make and after I make a song; it isn\u2019t even mine anymore; it belongs to the people.\u201d Known for his \u2018healing\u2019 music, Tarrus released his sophomore album Parables in 2006 to widespread acclaim and spawned hit singles - \u201cStay With You\u201d, \u201cBeware\u201d, \u201cShe\u2019s Royal\u201d, \u201cLion Paw\u201d, among others. \u201cI worked on Parables with Dean Fraser and I wasn\u2019t surprised at the success it has had, but how fast it all happened\u201d, Riley reflected. \u201cI\u2019ve known Dean a long time and to work with him on something as great and historic as Parables, is an honour\u201d, he also said. \u201cParables was a confidence builder and has set the foundation for everything else that I will bring to my audience\u201d. \u201cI define myself so I make thought-provoking music about Black consciousness and experiences. I want to open people\u2019s minds and let them think. My music isn\u2019t prejudiced towards colour, class, creed or nationality,\u201d he explained passionately. \u201cI target women and children with my music because slavery tampered with the woman\u2019s mind and that\u2019s why I wrote She\u2019s Royal. She\u2019s the head of the household so she has the power to influence the young men and women of tomorrow,\u201d Riley added. Tarrus works with a group of friends on a movement proudly titled BLAKSOIL \u2013 Bredren Living According King Selassie-I Overstanding & Iritical Livity. Through this movement, Riley hopes to further target the consciousness of our women and children. Riley has consistently racked up awards for his work. Among his accolades are Best Singer, Male Vocalist, Cultural Artiste, Song of the Year, and Best Song. Some of the awards institutions which have rewarded Riley include the Youth View Awards, The Star People\u2019s Choice Awards, EME Awards, and the Reggae Academy awards. Said Riley, \u2018I have received awards both locally and internationally. But to be honest, the best award I receive consistently is from the people themselves \u2013 when I can look in their faces and see the impression my music has made \u2013 that is the best award I can ever get\u2019. Nonetheless, Tarrus is the proud holder of CVM\u2019s 15th Anniversary Award, held in February 2009, for the \u2018Most Admired Song in the Past 15 Years\u2019 for the hit, \u201cShe\u2019s Royal\u201d. \u201cThat award really means a lot to me because it was chosen by the people in the streets,\u201d said Riley. In 2009 Riley released his third opus Contagious on Cannon Production. The album was distributed by VP Records. It contained the hits Start Anew, Contagious, Good Girl Gone Bad featuring Konshens and Superman, a cover of a Robin Thicke original. 2010 saw the release of the chart topper Protect the People, which scaled several charts in Jamaica and across the Caribbean. Early 2011 saw the release of the Black History themed Shaka Zulu Pickney which was featured on the Nyabingi rhythm from Bombrush Music. The video for the song which was directed by Storm Saulter was well received upon its release. His interest in educating the youth about Black History resulted in the Tarrus Riley Freedom Writers Competition, which ran on Jamaica\u2019s Irie FM radio station. 2011 also saw the release of videos for hit singles including Come Ova and Never leave I. Both songs have become anthems on Jamaican radio as well as in several Caribbean territories. Riley has performed on several stages around the world. His performances have drawn credible reviews from the media in the Caribbean, North America, the United States and Europe. Riley tours Europe once each year, performing on the major reggae festivals in several European countries. Riley\u2019s most recent high profile performances include the 2011 Jamaica Jazz and Blues Festival, Reggae Sumfest 2010, Betty Wright and Friends in concert in Jamaica, and the Palmyra Foundation\u2019s Fundraising event. Among his accolades in 2011 were the EME Awards (Excellence in Music and Entertainment) for Vocalist of the Year Male and Cultural Artiste of the Year. Riley also copped the 2011 Youth View Award for Cultural Artiste of the Year. Riley released the acoustic album Mecoustic (Soulbeats Records) in 2012. He toured Europe between April and May 2012 to promote the album. In 2013 he walked away with two IRAWMA awards. The Best Male Vocalist, and Most Cultural/Educational Entertainer for 2012. His \u201cGimmie Likkle One Drop\u201d was added to BBC\u2019s 1Xtra\u2019s Official Playlist. This means the song will not only be played during reggae or dancehall segments, but will also be played everyday throughout the day. \u201cThis is a huge accomplishment for reggae music\u201d, says David Rodigan. Shane Brown of Juke Boxx Productions, joined Dean Fraser as core members of the management team in April 2013. According to Fraser \"All we really did was to make a little adjustment and interject Shane into the team\". In February 2014, Tarrus released \u201cLove Situation\u201d The album Love Situation is produced by Dean Fraser for Cannon, assisted by talents such as Shane C Brown of Juke Boxx Productions, Mitchum \u2018Khan\u2019 Chin and Jordan McClure. The project was mixed by Shane C Brown and Romel Marshall and mastered by Grammy award winning engineer Michael Fuller. The tracks Burn My Desire, Dem A Watch, Thank You, Cry No More, Special Occasion and Sail Away featuring the Godfather of Deejays, U Roy are all above average and are testimony to the fact that despite the debauchery and violence that some of Jamaica\u2019s younger entertainers prefer to offer up as \u2018music\u2019, hope is still on the horizon and Reggae is very much alive and kicking. The album also features collaborations with another veteran deejay Big Youth and Mr Checks. To share the same space with Tarrus Riley is to realise that humility and positively are two of his strong attributes. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be good. I am just a different person. I try to be positive. I get my inspiration from the people, the teachings of my mother and father. Inspiration is actually In Spirit Action that\u2019s what the word means,\u201d he said. Reggae music earns billions in US dollars annually but sadly, less than one per cent of that profit finds its way to Jamaica. Riley recognises that much needs to be done in order to repatriate the business of Reggae to the land of its birth. He is of the view that local stakeholders need to invest more in the music in order to gain more benefits and essentially assist in building Jamaica\u2019s economy. \u201cThe mindset has to change. The whole attitude towards music has to change. I don\u2019t think we appreciate what we have. It a career and I take it seriously. When we see others do something we bawl and say they are taking our things but its because they appreciate what we do. Everybody wants to do the right thing,\u201d he said we bawl and say they are taking our things but it\u2019s because they appreciate what we do. Everybody wants to do the right thing,\u201d he said. Riley toured the US promoting the album in February and is back on the road in the US again in June. In August he will tour the United Kingdom and Europe later this year.

He takes his first music lessons and after studying under Andre Villeger for 3 years he wins the Esprit Jazz Festival Competition in Paris and is endorsed by Selmer saxophones (2006) A year later he enters the Conservatoire National Sup\u00e9rieur de Musique de Paris where his horizons broaden under the influence of peers and mentors such as Riccardo Del Fra and Francois Theberge. He soon understands the necessity to go to the roots of Jazz and in 2009 he is granted a Fulbright Scholarship to study at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary music on a merit scholarship.\n\nIn New York, the dream of meeting and playing with his idols becomes true and Yacine gets to learn from Chris Cheek, Donny Mc Caslin, Reggie Workman and with countless musicians who inspire him daily. But New York also exposes him to a myriad of different musics. Soon he is part of ex Fela Kuti' drummer Jojo Kuo' Afrobeat Collective, of late Cameroonian singer Martino Atangana's African Blue Note, of Haitian Kompa legends Tabou Combo. In their musics, he finds a deep echo to his North African roots and the Bikutsi rhythms from Cameroon become reminiscent of the trance rhythms and musics from Tunisia.\n\nThese influences urge him to find his own identity and his explorations of Cameroonian dance rhythms lead to the creation of the band AJOYO, a mystic brew of African tradition, jazz and soul. Yacine signs the music and lyrics of a repertoire that celebrates life, love and justice. The album is released in 2015 on Ropeadope Records and played on radios throughout the world from New Yorks' WNYC to French RFI, London's Jazz FM, National radio in Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria...\n\nIn the meantime, Yacine continues to play as a sideman both in the jazz repertoire with the likes of Sheila Jordan, Theo Bleckman and Becca Stevens and for various projects such as Japanese singer/songwriter Senri Oe (3 albums for Sony Japan).\n\nIn 2014 he is part of an intimate band picked by producer and arranger Robert Sadin to accompany Opera legend Placido Domingo on his remarkable record Encanto Del Mar. Yacine is featured both as a soloist and arranger of the Andalucian standard Lamma Bada and gets the chance to work closely with Ira Coleman, Mark Feldman, Rhani Khridja, Chico Pinheiro and Bridget Kibbey. This is also where he meets cellist Vincent Segal and gets the idea to explore the tunisian Stambeli repertoire with Vincent on cello and drummer Nasheet Waits.\n\nIn 2015 this project is granted the French American Jazz Exchange.

The members were Bryan Abrams, Mark Calderon, Kevin Thornton and Sam Waters.\n\nThe a cappella, pop, and hip hop outfit, whose R&B harmony vocals were offset by mild rap interjections and a post-New Kids On The Block street dance image, were discovered by Kool & The Gang's Robert Bell in 1990.\n\nThe group enjoyed 5 U.S. hit singles from their debut album C.M.B. throughout 1991 and 1992. These were \"I Wanna Sex You Up\" (U.S.#2), \"I Adore Mi Amor\" (U.S.#1), \"All 4 Love\" (U.S.#1), \"Thinkin Back\" (U.S.#16) and \"Slow Motion\" (U.S.#18). \"I Wanna Sex You Up\" was also on the New Jack City soundtrack, and hit number 1 on the UK Singles Charts.\n\nTheir debut album, C.M.B. was released in September 1991, eventually selling over 6 million copies worldwide, and being certified 3x platinum in the United States by the RIAA.\n\nColor Me Badd performed at the 1991 Smash Hits Poll Winners Awards in the UK, winning the Best New Group trophy. In January 1992, they were awarded the Favourite Single, Soul/R&B trophy at the 19th annual American Music Awards, held at the Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles. March 1992 also saw Color Me Badd win the Best R&B / Soul Single, and Song Of The Year, categories at the sixth annual Soul Train Music Awards.\n\nThe group released a remix album in October 1992, titled Young, Gifted and Badd. It contained the hit single \"Forever Love\" (U.S.#15), which was also featured on the Mo' Money soundtrack. However, the album peaked at U.S.#189, which was the first hint of the bubble bursting.\n\nThe group's third album Time & Chance was released in November 1993. A hugely ambitious project, consisting of nineteen new tracks, this album represented a slight shift in musical style for Color Me Badd. Working with top producers including David Foster, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, a more soulful and funky sound had clearly emerged.\n\nAlthough some critics gave it positive reviews, the album did not fare well on the Billboard Album Charts, eventually peaking at #56. With the music industry at the time embracing groups such as Nirvana, Guns N' Roses and Pearl Jam, it was difficult for Color Me Badd to deliver the same success on the singles charts as they had done before.\n\nThe album's title track \"Time & Chance\" peaked at U.S.#23, while its follow-up \"Choose\" also topped out at U.S.#23.\n\nRead More At http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Me_Badd", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "66 North 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "GARZA", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9652225.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.96168, 40.71925], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, Dance, Deep House, Alternative, Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Music Hall of Williamsburg", "moreBioInfo": "GARZA is a collaborative musical experience conjured up by Rob Garza, one-half of the pioneering electronic outfit, Thievery Corporation.

Formed shortly after composer Monte Weber met choreographer and vocalist Claire Cuny at a DIY show in Brooklyn in 2015, the duo pairs music with their unique talents of sound design, wearable technology, modern dance, and non-genre specific songwriting.\nMonte comes from a musical family and began his journey at a young age. His parents ran, and still run, a Brazilian Band in Western, MA. This initially lead him to perform and teach Brazilian percussion. As an adult he went on to study music composition in college and graduate school, first focusing on electro-acoustic composition and then studying at IRCAM where he began designing his Kontrol instrument, a way for Weber to make electronic music more tactile in performance. While Monte continues to compose for ensembles, he has always loved playing in bands but never had the opportunity to mix the two genres until he met Claire. Monte states, \u201cReliant Tom gives me the outlet to explore both pulse driven works while maintaining the other musical elements which I find fascinating - timbre, aleatoric processes, and interactive technologies.\u201d\nClaire started playing music much later in life. Beginning her artistic journey as a ballet dancer in Dallas, she later moved to NYC where she immersed herself in the NYC art scene. She danced in immersive dance companies, sang in multiple bands, performed with theatre companies, and started writing songs. She desired to combine all of these interests of study into one project but hadn\u2019t been able to until she met Monte. Claire explains,\u201cIt is very interesting to work together from our differing backgrounds. Our ultimate goal with Reliant Tom is to be a multi-media performance experience that straddles the line between pop and experimental music - and philosophizing about what that even means, and is that even possible as \"experimental pop\"? It seems like it's an oxymoron. I've learned so much from just trying to navigate this with him.\u201d\nThe music focuses on the themes of pitfalls in digital communication and the general blas\u00e9 nature of modern social interaction - all through the guise of avant-pop/avant-punk influenced musical devices. The band's instrumentation is generally comprised of electric guitar, voice, a hybrid electro-acoustic drum kit, synthesizers, as well as elements of Monte's Kontrol Instrument.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2751 Broadway, New York, NY 10025", "Artist": "Marc Cary", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7302551.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.96831, 40.80131], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz and then some", "Time": "10:30 PM", "Venue": "Smoke Jazz & Supper Club", "moreBioInfo": "Pre-save my new re-work of George Duke's FEEL right here http://bit.ly/GeorgeDukeFeels", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "131 W 3rd St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "YUNA", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9128183.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00074, 40.730839], "Date": "Thu Feb 27 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-27", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, Alternative, Acoustic, Folk Rock", "Time": "10:30 PM", "Venue": "Blue Note Jazz Club", "moreBioInfo": "Singer songwriter, entrepreneur from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

C\u00e9line has been called one of the premier contemporary pop vocalist of the Nineties. She has earned music industry accolades from around the world: Grammy Awards in the US, Juno and Felix Awards in Canada, and World Music Awards in Europe. The entire world has seen C\u00e9line Dion literally transform herself from a gifted pre-adolescent into an international superstar.\n\nBorn in Charlemagne (a small town 30 miles east of Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada), famous for its spinning tops, C\u00e9line is the youngest of 14 children of a highly musical family. Her parents, both musicians, operated a small club, and on weekends, the entire family performed and entertained the local population. From the tender age of 5, C\u00e9line sang with her siblings and quickly acquired the ability to perform live. At the age of twelve, together with her mother and one of her brothers, C\u00e9line composed a French song which would forever alter the course of her life.\n\nThe demo tape containing the song was brought to the attention of Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil, a well respected personal manager. In January 1981, Ren\u00e9 was so taken by the voice of the young C\u00e9line, that he became determined to make her an internationally known talent - he even mortgaged his house to finance the recording of C\u00e9line's debut album!\n\nC\u00e9line began to receive recognition for her talent in 1982, winning the Gold Medal at the Yamaha World Song Festival in Tokyo, along with the coveted Musician's Award for Top Performer. In 1983, she became the first Canadian ever to receive a Gold Record in France.\n\nThe streak of recognition had only just begun.\n\nBy 1988, C\u00e9line had established a strong name for herself in her native province of Qu\u00e9bec, where she was enjoying superstar status, receiving numerous Felix Awards and racking up platinum albums. That same year, C\u00e9line won the prestigious Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin, Ireland, where she performed live before a television audience of 600 million viewers throughout Europe, the USSR, the Middle-East, Japan, and Australia. In Eurovision C\u00e9line represented Switzerland with a song Ne partez pas sans moi.\n\nIn September 1990, C\u00e9line released 'Unison' - her first English-language album and her first for Sony Music - and scored a breakthrough US hit with the Top 5 single \"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\".\n\nC\u00e9line's international breakthrough came when she recorded the title track for the soundtrack to the animated Disney hit movie 'Beauty and the Beast'. The song went to number one and garnered an Academy Award and a Grammy Award. \"Beauty and the Beast\" formed the cornerstone for C\u00e9line's second English language album, called simply 'C\u00e9line Dion'. That album produced four more hit singles including \"Love Can Move Mountains,\" \"Water From The Moon,\" \"If You Asked Me To\" and \"Did You Give Enough Love.\" In Canada, the album went six times platinum and set the stage for an incredible streak of Juno Awards.\n\nOn December 17, 1994, C\u00e9line Dion and Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil were married at Notre Dame Basilica in Montr\u00e9al.\n\nAt this time, the C\u00e9line juggernaut started rolling at a momentous pace in the UK. British fans took extremely well to \"Think Twice,\" a ballad on 'The Colour Of My Love.' For five consecutive weeks, the song and album stood on top of the respective British charts, an achievement not replicated since 1965 and the heyday of The Beatles. \"Think Twice\" remained at number one for two more weeks, surpassing the magic million mark to become only the fourth million-selling single ever in the UK by a female artist.\n\nWith 'D'eux,' C\u00e9line achieved what everyone thought was impossible - introduced French music to the upper reaches of the British charts. The world had truly discovered C\u00e9line Dion.\n\nBlessed with one of popular music's great voices, she has crossed all barriers - even that of language - with her electrifying series of international hits. With her breakneck pace of recording, video shoots, touring and appearing on TV shows and awards specials, it seems like C\u00e9line has time for little else. Not the case when it comes to an important cause. C\u00e9line has used her talents to further the cause of the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. In fact, one of C\u00e9line's most emotional songs (\"Vole,\" from the 'D'eux' album, later translated into English as the song \"Fly,\" which appears on the 'Falling Into You' album) is a touching memorial to her niece, Karine, who was taken from her by this disease.\n\nReleased in March 1996, 'Falling Into You' became the best-selling album released that year; topped the charts in 11 countries, and was voted Album of the Year and Best Pop Album at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony. The album has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide.\n\n'Let's Talk About Love' is the follow-up to C\u00e9line's double Grammy Award-winning album. Recorded in London, New York and Los Angeles, 'Let's Talk About Love' features a host of special guests including some of popular music's greatest vocalists, songwriters, and producers.\n\n'Let's Talk About Love' was released on the same day as the soundtrack of the motion picture 'Titanic'. Both albums featured the much-loved Titanic movie's theme song, \"My Heart Will Go On,\" written by James Horner and produced by James Horner and Walter Afanasieff. \"My Heart Will Go On\" quickly became the wedding song of choice for C\u00e9line's fans.\n\nIn a stunning back-to-back achievement, 'Let's Talk About Love' went on to match the 27 million worldwide sales of its predecessor; 'Titanic' also sold over 27 million copies worldwide. It is the all-time best-selling orchestral soundtrack in recording history. C\u00e9line sang \"My Heart Will Go On\" on the worldwide telecast of the 70th Annual Academy Awards, live from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song -- the second Oscar for a song sung by C\u00e9line Dion, following \"Beauty And The Beast\".\n\nA new French album, 'S'il suffisait d'aimer,' recorded in February 1998, was officially released worldwide on September 8. The first featured single, \"Zora sourit\" received rave responses on the radio all over the world. C\u00e9line first introduced her fans to the album's title track during her Let's Talk About Love World Tour.\n\nC\u00e9line's next album, 'These Are Special Times,' featured sixteen songs for the holiday season, including the Christmas pop classics \"Blue Christmas\" and \"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire)\"; and such traditional religious favorites as \"O Holy Night\" and \"Adeste Fidelis (O Come All Ye Faithful)\". In addition, 'These Are Special Times' produced the No. 1 single \"I'm Your Angel,\" C\u00e9line's duet with R. Kelly, who wrote and produced the song; the Diane Warren-penned title track, \"These Are Special Times\"; and \"The Prayer,\" a duet with Andrea Bocelli.\n\nAlso, in 1998, Dundurn Press released the much anticipated biography: C\u00e9line...The Authorized Biography. After travelling with C\u00e9line and her entourage for over a year and spending hours in one-on-one conversions with the star, Georges-H\u00e9bert Germain recounts the story of one of the world's best loved vocal artists. C\u00e9line and Georges-H\u00e9bert Germain later collaborated once again on C\u00e9line Dion...My Story, My Dream. Released in 2000, C\u00e9line recounts her story in her own words and straight from her heart. The autobiography is an exquisitely detailed portrait of C\u00e9line backstage, on the road, and in the recording studio.\n\n'All The Way...A Decade Of Song' is a collection of C\u00e9line's greatest hits, including her chart-topping hit singles \"The Power Of Love,\" \"Because You Loved Me,\" \"I'm Your Angel,\" and the Grammy and Academy Award-winning classic \"My Heart Will Go On.\" Also included are \"Beauty And The Beast,\" \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\"; and \"If You Asked Me To\".\n\nSeven brand-new songs, were recorded specifically for this collection, including the title song \"All The Way,\" a respectful and loving tribute to one of C\u00e9line's all-time favourite singers, the late Frank Sinatra.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1999, in Montr\u00e9al, C\u00e9line Dion gave her last public performance before beginning a temporary hiatus from show business to enjoy her private life... and improve her golf game!\n\nDuring C\u00e9line's hiatus, a compilation album, 'The Collector's Series...Volume One,' was released in October 2000. Among C\u00e9line's greatest hits and best-loved recordings, the album also includes \"The Power of the Dream\" which C\u00e9line performed at the opening ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games as well as a Spanish version of \"All By Myself\".\n\nBut the greatest joy for C\u00e9line and Ren\u00e9 came with the birth of their son Ren\u00e9-Charles Ang\u00e9lil, born January 25, 2001 at 1:00 AM, weighing 6 lbs, 8 oz. He was baptized six months later on July 25, 2001, in Montr\u00e9al's grand Notre-Dame Basilica.\n\nA new peak in C\u00e9line's spectacular career was reached when she released her new album 'A New Day Has Come' in March 2002, which ended her two-year hiatus. The album entered number one in more than 17 countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, United Kingdom, and the United States within two weeks of its debut. It features new tracks that range from pure 21st century pop, \"A New Day Has Come\" to dramatic ballads \"Have You Ever Been In Love\" and \"I Surrender,\" from breathtaking dance music \"Sorry For Love\" to a pair of pre-rock classics \"At Last;\" and \"Nature Boy.\" Other highlights include \"I'm Alive,\" \"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word),\" and \"Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)\".\n\nThe release of the album was accompanied by a blitz of TV specials, appearances on talk shows and magazine interviews all over the world.\n\nIn March 2003, C\u00e9line began a three-year commitment to appear five nights a week at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, a 4000-seat arena designed for her show. A 90-minute event, A New Day... introduces a new form of entertainment, a fusion of song, performance art, theatrical innovation and state-of-the-art technology. The show was created by Dragone Productions, a team led by Franco Dragone, the creative spirit behind ten of the critically acclaimed productions by Cirque du Soleil.\n\nOn March 25th, to coincide with the opening of A New Day..., C\u00e9line released 'One Heart,' a brand new album featuring an upbeat cover of Roy Orbison's classic \"I Drove All Night\" as its first single. The album also includes songs produced by Ric Wake, Anders Bagge, Kristian Lundin, Peer Astrom, Max Martin, Mark Taylor, Erick Benzi et Humberto Gatica.\n\nOn October 14th of the same year, C\u00e9line released the much anticipated '1 fille & 4 types,' her first French album in five years. Artistic director Jean-Jacques Goldman, the power behind 'D'eux' (1995) and 'S'il suffisait d'aimer' (1998), had come up with an idea to surround her with three different writer-composers who have made their mark on the French music scene: Jacques Veneruso, Erick Benzi and master guitarist Gildas Arzel.\n\nThe voice of one or other of these incomparable artists accompanies C\u00e9line's performance throughout the album, produced by Benzi and guided by Goldman from start to finish. '1 fille & 4 types' debuted as the top selling in Canada, France and Switzerland in its first week of release. The first single, \"Tout l'or des hommes\" also made radio history by establishing the record for becoming the highest charting Francophone single on the National CHR Audience chart in the BDS era in Canada.\n\nOn June 14th, 2004, C\u00e9line's album 'A New Day...Live In Las Vegas' was released into stores worldwide. The album, which includes a behind-the-scenes DVD, features thirteen songs perfomed live on stage from her Las Vegas show A New Day... and two new studio-recorded tracks: \"You and I\" and \"Ain't Gonna Look The Other Way\". The live tracks feature C\u00e9line's most recognizable songs such as \"My Heart Will Go On\" and outstanding renditions including Barbra Streisand's \"If I Could\", Frank Sinatra's \"I've Got The World On A String\" and Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\".\n\nOctober 11th, 2004, C\u00e9line's latest album 'Miracle' officially hit stores worldwide. This is album is all about the love and bond between a mother and her child, something which is precious and cannot be compared. 'Miracle' includes C\u00e9line's newest single which has the same title as the album, and many others including \"Bhram's Lullaby\".", "otherInfo": "Celine Dion"}, {"Address": "10 Lincoln Center Plz, New York, NY 10023", "Artist": "New York Philharmonic", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9616565.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98058, 40.77063], "Date": "Fri Feb 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-28", "Genre": "Genres: Classical", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "David Geffen Hall", "moreBioInfo": "The New York Philharmonic is the oldest active symphony orchestra in the United States.

This haunting track is taken from her upcoming third album, Shaky, a tour de force of Gothic Americana...We love it.\"- Big Takeover ------------------------------------------ Thayer Sarrano is forging her own path into a southern- psych-dreamland, bottling up ghosts and bringing them to life through her ethereal desert rock hymns. The tones tremble and bend, layered in swirling atmospherics of a place that is melancholic and haunting, yet bursting with heavenly light. With her latest release, Shaky, The Athens, GA multi-instrumentalist sounds, more than ever, like where she is from. She grew up in a seminary/the swamp in southern, coastal Georgia. Classically trained as a child, awakened by Grunge in the 90s, with chanting forever in her subconscious, she had always written instrumental compositions and poetry. Songwriting came when she landed in the vibrant musical community of Athens, GA and began to collaborate with friends to form her own band, as well as establish herself as a studio/touring session player (Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven, T. Hardy Morris, of Montreal, Dave Marr, David Barbe, many more). Debut album, King was released in 2009 dubbing her \u201cThe new Queen of Shoegaze\u201d - Americana UK. The sparse and raw album was recorded live in her living room in one day. Her follow up LP, Lift Your Eyes to the Hills , (2012), enters more complex arrangements and features the single \u201cThe Bend,\u201c written for Groninger Museum, The Netherlands, leading to consistent European touring. The record was produced by Thayer and Hank Sullivant (Kuroma, MGMT), and was an independent release as a charitable campaign for Nuci\u2019s Space\u2019s teenage rock camp, \u201cCamp Amped,\u201d of which Thayer is passionately affiliated. \u201cFeaturing heavily spiritual themes, it could have collapsed under it\u2019s own weight, but \u2018Hill\u2019s manages to maintain a startling lightness of being.\u201c -Flagpole Magazine. Now, with Shaky, we see Sarrano at her bravest and most vulnerable. Written in an unstable period of much loss, Shaky is still a record of grace and perseverance. The honest, painted lyrics weave the mystical with personal experiences. We start to believe these seemingly abstract visions are really happening, and in this other world we see pictures we can relate to. Pictures of dissolving relationships in \u201cCrease\u201d, \"your memory unties my cells/ it breaks the line from your heart to mine\u2026\u201d Of the elusive in title track, \"I trace your echo I follow your lead/ you\u2019re shaky shaky but you settle me.\u201d Of the search for something greater in \u201cGlimpses,\u201d \u201cthere\u2019s a world at the same time as this one/it\u2019s bright it trembles it glistens,\u201d and of the beautiful ether in \u201cLost Art,\u201d \u201ctheir hands are open, call to the wild/ layer landscapes, breaking the sky/ I remember them from when I was a child/ it\u2019s the same little image from inside my eyes\u2026\u201c Dovetailing the thick twang of the country with the airy, echoing, spacious feeling of an empty church, Sarrano has carved out a pocket in which her otherworldly music has room to breathe.

Their array of catchy songs, top-notch musicianship, flashy outfits, dance steps, and stage presence has been noticed, making a massive impression gaining cult followings throughout the East Coast and parts of Europe.\n\nMilo Z's biggest asset is the bands leader and frontman Milo Z himself. Milo was born and raised in the lower east side of Manhattan. At an early age he was exposed to the diverse cultural experiences the City has to offer giving Milo his own unique style, spirit, and attitude that has made him a legitimate frontman. Like James Brown- he orchestrates his band into tight polished grooves, he choreographs dance steps, has singles to cue different rhythmic patterns, changes, and horn hits. Like Mic Jagger and Steven Tyler, Milo dances and struts connecting his attitude, sexuality and sensuality to his audience. His connection with the audience is what is so impressive. The band makes the audience part of the show. 'Make them dance, make them sweat, leave them longing for more.' Is the bands motto.\n\nMilo Z is currently is touring throughout the East Coast and Europe. Milo Z is house favorite at resort venues such as; The Wobbly Barn in Killington Vermont, The Snow Barn at Mt Snow Vermont, The Muse in Nantucket, Siros in Saratoga Springs, and the Atlantic Beach Club in Newport Rhode Island. Milo continues to sell out shows in Manhattan (Bands home ground) and has staked a claim in the New Jersey cover scene being the only original band to compete against cover greats; the Nerds and Big Orange Cone. Club owners attribute this to the bands hooky rock songs and jam oriented groovin funky/rock/sole repertoire- enhanced by the dance steps and audience participation (Call out and response) which has been part of Milo's forte.

Music history is filled with stories of the rise and fall of creative personalities, but the Randy Rogers Band is a unique brotherhood fueled by a shared passion for making great music and a strong commitment to each other. That bond forms the foundation for the new music on their latest album Hellbent, a high-octane collection of songs buoyed by the same fearless spirit and sense of camaraderie that has made them one of country\u2019s most compelling bands.\n\nIn a business where bands come and go and membership is often a revolving door, the Randy Rogers Band has been together for more than 17 years. \u201cJust like any other relationship, you have to pick your battles and have respect for each other,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cNone of us know how to do anything else. This is our livelihood. It\u2019s how we take care of our families. Years ago when we were really struggling and wondering how we were going to make it, there were some deep and emotional conversations that we all had with each other about if this is really what we all wanted and the decision was made a long time ago. The answer was yes then and the answer is still yes now. It\u2019s something we all believe in. This is our life\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nThe culmination of their musical journey thus far can be heard on Hellbent.\n\n\u201cCreatively we all bring something different to the table and you can hear it in the records,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cYou can hear people\u2019s personalities in the records.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that blend of unique personalities that have fueled the Randy Rogers Band\u2019s success for nearly two decades.\n\n\u201cOur bass player, Johnny Chops, has this way of writing. It\u2019s a little old school, a little Waylon-esque if you will. His lyrics aren\u2019t necessarily anything like mine. They are a little bit more vague and more interpretive,\u201d Rogers says, bragging on his bandmate. \u201cWhat Brady Black adds to our makeup is his sensibility on stage, his appearance, his energy, his unique way that he plays the fiddle. He\u2019s a crowd pleaser.\u201d\n\n\u201cLes Lawless, our drummer, has played on hundreds of albums with many different artists. He\u2019s kind of the human metronome. He\u2019s a solid drummer. I can\u2019t recall a mistake he\u2019s ever made on stage. He\u2019s just a rock. Geoffrey Hill [guitar, vocals] is a very talented musician. He\u2019s a great singer, a great harmony singer. Most of our sound as a band is because of Geoffrey and his unique vocals and the way he blends his vocals with my vocals.\u201d\n\nOf course, the lineup wouldn\u2019t be complete without longtime member Todd Stewart. \u201cThere isn\u2019t an instrument that Todd can\u2019t play and he sings well,\u201d Rogers enthuses. \u201cOnstage he\u2019s playing guitar on one song, mandolin on the next one, fiddle on the next one and a piano on the next one and a B3 on the next one. He\u2019s a key part of our band because he fills up all those spots musically that no one else can do like him. It\u2019s fascinating to watch him switch between every song.\u201d\n\nThat dynamic musical chemistry has taken the Randy Rogers Band beyond the competitive music scene in their native Texas to build a national fan base with sold out shows across the country. The band has become skilled at capturing that live energy and passion on their albums and Hellbent is a perfect example. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this process long enough to know that we wanted this record to be perfect and complete so we kept writing and went back in and we recorded again,\u201d Rogers reveals.\n\n\u201cIt is important, especially in today\u2019s day and age, not to put out content just for the sake of content. People see through that and it\u2019s a big mistake young artists make just to put a video or a new song out just to have something to talk about. There is a lost art to making an entire album, being a cohesive unit and have it be something that you can stand up and play. We have to record songs we can play live. Ninety nine percent of the income we share is because we\u2019re playing a show, so those songs can\u2019t be throwaway songs.\u201d\n\nThe first single, \u201cCrazy People,\u201d is a relatable tune that paints a picture of strict parents that weren\u2019t always so straight-laced. \u201cI did not write that song, however, I did live that song, and that\u2019s why I cut it,\u201d Rogers says with a chuckle.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard it, I could imagine that my parents weren\u2019t always fanatically religious. As a young kid, I definitely wasn\u2019t comfortable around neon signs or around restaurants where they were serving alcohol. I just thought that was something very, very bad and that\u2019s what was instilled in my head. It was very, very much a sin, so I was a little freaked out when I was a kid. It\u2019s nothing against my parents. Both me and my brother turned out just fine, but I just think there was this sense of over protection and security and a lot of that was based around the church. So the first thing I did when I turned 16 was tried everything.\u201d\n\nAnother highlight on the album is \u201cYou, Me and a Bottle,\u201d penned by Rogers. \u2018I love love songs, and that song is a carefree kind of love song about kind of getting lost with your significant other,\u201d Rogers says.\n\n\u201cThe troubles of the world and stresses of the week fade when you are with that one special person. That all disappears. That\u2019s kind of the feel-good song on the album I think and the prettiest love song on the record.\u201d\n\nOn the other end of the emotional spectrum, \u201cAnchors Away\u201d is about a man who can\u2019t commit and keeps running from love. \u201c\u2018Anchors Away\u2019 is a very sad song,\u201d Rogers admits. \u201cThe chorus says, \u2018Anchors away, works like a charm, first sign of danger, I pull the alarm,\u2019 and the lyrics that really get to me are, \u2018I don\u2019t want to leave, I don\u2019t know how to stay.\u2019 That lyric to me really paints the picture of somebody who doesn\u2019t know how to love and doesn\u2019t know how to love someone back. Out of all the lyrics on the album, that lyric might be the most poignant lyric because a lot of times people sabotage themselves and relationships they are in because they don\u2019t know any better because they\u2019ve seen their parents do it or they are just in a cycle repeating the same mistakes. I think that\u2019s a lot of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWine in a Coffee Cup\u201d paints an interesting portrait of a high-powered career woman. \u201cWomen have roles in the workplace that are very different than they were maybe 50 years ago,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cThere are a lot of CEOs, CFOs, a lot of presidents and vice presidents. Huge companies are run by women. It\u2019s an interesting fact that nobody is perfect and my idea of that song was a CEO of a company walking in every day and everybody thinks she has everything together and her life is perfect, but in all actuality she is like everybody else. She\u2019s struggling with something. It could be her relationship, home life or family, but even the most successful people have flaws, so that was my take on it. It\u2019s a nod to women and the fact that they are, in this day in age, hopefully treated as equals in the workplace but here\u2019s this girl that\u2019s running the company and she\u2019s coming in buzzed every day. That song isn\u2019t about someone I know personally. It\u2019s about the culture and the environment we live in now. I guarantee that that song is happening somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cHell Bent on a Heartache\u201d is a song Rogers first heard and fell in love with on Guy Clark\u2019s album My Favorite Picture of You. \u201cI love that album start to finish and that song was my favorite song. Chris Stapleton and his wife, Morgane, wrote that with Guy Clark and I had no clue,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were in the studio the week Tom Petty died and on that track especially there is this kind of Heartbreaker kind of feel to that song. It\u2019s produced in a way that Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers would have done it. The influence definitely shines through on this album, especially on that track.\u201d\n\nIn recording Hellbent, the Randy Rogers Band worked with producer Dave Cobb (Chris Stapleton, The Oak Ridge Boys, Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell) and recorded at the legendary RCA Studio A. \u201cA large part of the country really enjoys the records that he\u2019s made over the last 10 years and obviously I was paying attention to that,\u201d Rogers says.\n\n\u201cI was noticing the albums I was listening to, and they were produced by him, so I called him up and asked if we could meet for lunch. I\u2019d never worked with him before, so it was a very exciting going into RCA and meeting him and the team. We\u2019re very thankful for that opportunity and getting to record in Studio A. So many people whether it be Dolly Parton or George Strait have recorded in that room, so it was a bit of hallowed ground. It was a little overwhelming as well. There\u2019s pictures all over the walls there of people who recorded. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nRecording Hellbent is just the latest chapter in the Randy Rogers Band\u2019s thriving career. In addition to being a gifted vocalist, insightful songwriter and talented musician, the band\u2019s founding member is also well known in music industry circles for his business savvy. He graduated from college with a degree in PR and is one of those rare musicians who has great executive skills too.\n\nRogers is co-owner of several Texas venues including Cheatham Street Warehouse in San Marcos, Texas where George Strait began building a fan base in his early career. Rogers is also a partner in Big Blind Management with Robin Schoepf and steers the careers of Red Shahan and Parker McCollum.\n\nRogers seems to have a unique talent for seeing around corners. It\u2019s what drove him to take his band outside of Texas and develop fans on both coasts, even when the initial investment was risky. \u201cI\u2019m left brain and right brain,\u201d the Cleburne, Texas native says. \u201cI\u2019m a very organized person and I can also see six months from now. I\u2019m always thinking a step ahead and it wears my wife out because I\u2019m talking about booking my life months from now. My brain is always spinning and thinking about what is coming next instead of really sitting in a moment. That\u2019s a good thing and sometimes it\u2019s a bad thing that I can never really turn my brain off.\u201d\n\nRogers is also a big fan of collaboration and has partnered with friend Wade Bowen on the infectious Hold My Beer projects and joined forces with Lone Star legend Robert Earl Keen as the Stryker Brothers. He recently joined Lyle Lovett, Willie Nelson and Jerry Jeff Walker to sing on Michael Martin Murphey\u2019s Austinology album.\n\nThough Rogers is prone to eagerly explore other musical avenues, the core of his creative adventure continues to be the Randy Rogers Band. For Rogers, Hellbent was the perfect name for the album, and not just because it comes from one of his favorite songs.\n\n\u201cThe album is named Hellbent and isn\u2019t necessarily for \u2018Hell Bent On a Heartache.\u2019 We\u2019re in it for the long haul. We\u2019re lifers,\u201d he says with a grin.\n\n\u201cThis is obviously our way of life. This isn\u2019t some Johnny-come-lately group of guys. We\u2019re like an oak tree. We\u2019re not going anywhere. We\u2019re not hinged on whether our next single will be a No.1. We\u2019re not hinged on an album topping the charts. We have a great and loyal fan base and we do things right. When we play our shows, people expect to have a great night and to go home satisfied. As long as we keep doing that, no change in the industry, no record deal or anything like that can make or break this band.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Texas Independence Day Show"}, {"Address": "198 Broadway, Amityville, NY 11701", "Artist": "Heal.", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.41742, 40.67899], "Date": "Fri Feb 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Amityville Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Such Gold at Amityville Music Hall on Friday February 28th"}, {"Address": "127 E 23rd St, New York, NY 11226", "Artist": "Lez Zeppelin", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6299266.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.984987, 40.739781], "Date": "Fri Feb 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-28", "Genre": "Genres: Girl Groups, British Bands, Classic Blues, Classic Rock, Cover, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Gramercy Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "LEZ ZEPPELIN, the New York City-based all-girl band has gained worldwide critical acclaim for the musicianship, passion and gender-bending audacity they bring to the music of Led Zeppelin. Founded in 2004 by New York guitarist, Steph Paynes, It wasn\u2019t long before the group\u2019s reputation for playing Zeppelin\u2019s music with a kind of passion and force beyond anyone\u2019s expectations began to attract major interest from press and industry. In June, 2005, Chuck Klosterman wrote an article for SPIN magazine that featured Lez Zeppelin as a leading protagonist in a trend of all-female hard rock \u201ctribute\u201d bands. He referred to the group \u201cthe most powerful all-female band in rock history\u201d and described the rise of bands like Lez Zeppelin as a \u201ckind of multilayered cultural phenomenon.\u201d The fortunes and notoriety of the group surged after this and Lez Zeppelin became provocative subject for the news media across the world. Stories about the group appeared in the Times of London, whose journalist called the band \u201cthe best new band I\u2019ve seen all year, no question;\u201d Reuters and CNN.com, which ran a front page feature that called the group so \u201celectrifying\u201d they are \u201cdriving club audiences to a frenzy.\u201d The group also appeared as part of a major feature on CBS Good Morning, which ran nation-wide, as well as on many other local TV news spots in New York (ABC, WB) and across the country. In April 2007, after extensive touring in the US and Europe the band released its first album, Lez Zeppelin, which was produced by Eddie Kramer, renowned for his work as recording engineer on several of Led\u2019s albums \u2013 most notably, Led Zeppelin II, Physical Grafitti and The Song Remains the Same. In the wake of this release, the band was invited as the first \u201ctribute band\u201d to ever appear at a series of major rock festivals including the Download Festival (formerly Donnington Park) in the UK; Rock-Am-Ring and Rock-Im-Park in Germany; and at the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. However, it was an announcement in February of 2008, that Lez Zeppelin would take the stage at the Bonnaroo Festival that sparked a worldwide media storm. Several major press organizations, including the Associated Press, Billboard, NME, the Chicago Sun Times and more, reported mistakenly that LED Zeppelin \u2013 in the wake of their historic reunion at the O2 in London -- would headline the festival, an embarrassing gaff that had to then be corrected, turning the announcement of Lez Zeppelin\u2019s appearance into headline news across the world. Lez Zeppelin became a much-anticipated highlight of the festival, headlining opening night with a blistering set for an audience of 20,000 people. Throughout 2008, the group continued to tour heavily in the U.S. and in the late fall made its first visit to Japan to promote the release of the debut record, which had sold nearly 7,000 copies the first few months after release. In March 2009, Lez Zeppelin was invited to India by a major network media task force to headline The Concert for Mumbai, a benefit organized to buy ambulances, which were sorely lacking in the aftermath of the terrorist bombings in Mumbai. Again, Lez Zeppelin held the unique distinction of being the first American group of its kind to take part in an event of this magnitude. Following a three-month tour of the US, the band headed back into the studio to start on a second album, which would take the group back to where it all began \u2013 Led Zeppelin\u2019s 1969 debut. The band solicited the help of producers Perry Margouleff and William Wittman, who approached the project with two main musical intentions: to remain true to the sounds and textures of the \u201cvinyl\u201d version of the record and capture that \u2018tight-but-loose\u2019 intensity in the moment. Recording at Margouleff\u2019s Pie Studio\u2019s, a world class analog facility, the band employed all of the same vintage equipment used by Led in 1968 \u2013 from the \u201950s era Les Paul and Telecaster, to the Supro amp, 60\u2019s era compressor, Hammond organ and Fuzzbender stomp box -- working fastidiously to recreate the incredibly complex layers of the album with a dedication that has never before been demonstrated by any band of this type in the history of the rock world. Lez Zeppelin is set to launch a full-length tour of Europe, the United States and Japan in early 2011 to support LEZ ZEPPELIN I, and to continue to deliver a musical experience that not only exceeds expectations, but serves as the authentic female counterpart to one of the greatest rock groups of all time.

That 2008 release, with its gorgeously melodic writing and improvising and deft use of indie-rock, electronica and hip-hop elements, established Parks as one of the most gifted and original young voices in jazz. \u201cThis is the natural successor to that record,\u201d says the New York-based artist, 34. \u201cIt\u2019s taking the ideas of that project and doubling down on them\u2014fully committing to that direction.\u201d\n\nLittle Big also marks the recorded debut of the intuitive working group that gives the album its title (and which takes its name from a fantastical novel by John Crowley\u2014a favorite book of Parks and, the pianist notes, Wayne Shorter). Parks handled the production duties, with engineering by Daniel Schlett (whose credits include The War on Drugs and Ghostface Killah). The album was mixed by both Schlett and Grizzly Bear bassist/producer Chris Taylor, the latter of whom Parks met in a Seattle big band at the age of 10. \u201cWe put a lot of time and care into the way this record sounds, and the result\u201d\u2014simultaneously crystalline and warm, postmodern and natural\u2014\u201cmakes me really happy,\u201d Parks adds.\n\nAfter experimenting with various lineups and sessions, Parks landed on three musicians ideally suited for this atmospheric, genre-bending new work. \u201cThis feels like a real band, one that will be around for a while,\u201d he says. Greg Tuohey is the longest-running member, a guitarist who places taste and tone ahead of chops-focused bravado\u2014or, as Parks puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s chasing Miles Davis\u2019 phrasing with Jimi Hendrix\u2019s attitude.\u201d On electric bass is David \u201cDJ\u201d Ginyard Jr., a left-handed player with a distinctively lyrical approach and an aptitude for seeing the bigger musical picture. \u201cHe really understands what the bass does, and he thinks super compositionally,\u201d Parks says, noting how some of Ginyard\u2019s basslines have become integral to the songs. Anchoring the unit is Tommy Crane, a forward-looking, stylistically resourceful drummer who brings both explosive creativity and a producer\u2019s knack for precision. \u201cHe has a very unique ability to internalize and commit to the particular heartbeat of each song,\u201d Parks explains, \u201cbut always with this vital and elastic human element, which is rare to hear in combination with the kinds of grooves we\u2019re exploring.\u201d\n\nTogether they interpret a panoramic set of Parks\u2019 original compositions\u2014from the 21st-century fusion of \u201cKid,\u201d to the odd-metered studio jam \u201cProfessor Strangeweather,\u201d to the trip-hop ambiance and folkish melody of \u201cBells.\u201d The psychedelic \u201cAquarium\u201d\u2014\u201cprobably the sexiest tune on the album,\u201d Parks says, chuckling\u2014conjures up the trippy, sultry neo-soul vibe of Meshell Ndegeocello, before Tuohey offers a solo that channels Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood. \u201cDigital Society\u201d somehow manages to evoke Afrobeat, bluegrass and Aphex Twin. \u201cLilac\u201d is, as Parks describes it, \u201ca solo-piano pop tune.\u201d The leader\u2019s \u201csecret favorite\u201d cut, \u201cDoors Open,\u201d seeks inspiration in late Talk Talk and the \u201cearnestness\u201d of Brian Blade & the Fellowship Band. That closing track is \u201cdefinitely not afraid to go straight for your heart,\u201d Parks says with a laugh.\n\nA prodigal talent raised outside of Seattle, Parks moved with his family to study at the Manhattan School of Music when he was 16. Two years later, on the recommendation of a teacher, NEA Jazz Master Kenny Barron, he was invited to join trumpet great Terence Blanchard\u2019s band. That tenure began the relationship with Blue Note that would yield Invisible Cinema, released when Parks was just 24. In The Guardian, John Fordham called the album \u201ca real independent vision,\u201d adding that \u201cParks is a fast-rising star.\u201d In the September 2008 issue of JazzTimes, Parks was named a \u201cNew Jazz Visionary\u201d alongside current giants like Esperanza Spalding, Robert Glasper and Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah. Over the ensuing decade, Parks certainly made good on that early promise. He was an essential presence in Kurt Rosenwinkel\u2019s band, including on the guitarist\u2019s well-received double album from 2012, Star of Jupiter. As a member of the supergroup James Farm, also featuring saxophonist Joshua Redman, bassist Matt Penman and drummer Eric Harland, Parks put out two celebrated albums on Nonesuch. In 2013 he released his first disc as an ECM Records artist, Arborescence, which DownBeat\u2019s J.D. Considine called \u201ca forest-invoking solo-piano effort marked by wonderfully detailed narratives and a harmonic palette worthy of Ravel.\u201d Find the Way, an ECM trio session with bassist Ben Street and drummer Billy Hart, followed last year and garnered equally enthusiastic reviews.\n\nOn Little Big, Parks taps into the lessons he\u2019s absorbed throughout those far-reaching experiences, while also progressing some of the au courant sounds he investigated on Invisible Cinema. \u201cThis feels like the most personal record I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d he says. What\u2019s more, the album reflects his worldview, an outlook in which optimism and inclusion supersede politics. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot out there right now to protest against, and it feels like it\u2019s the artist\u2019s duty to create music that reckons with the issues of the day. Nonetheless, this is not a protest record. It\u2019s not against anything; it\u2019s much more for something. What we\u2019re aiming to do is blend genres and ideas in an open and fluid way, so that structure and freedom work together to serve the larger concept of the song. It\u2019s a way of working together that feels representative of the kind of world I could imagine many of us might want to live in.\u201d", "otherInfo": "paris_monster w/ Chris Morrissey - Rockwood Stage 2"}, {"Address": "64 N 9th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249", "Artist": "Knuckle Puck", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8017648.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.95987, 40.720886], "Date": "Fri Feb 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-28", "Genre": "Genres: Pop Punk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Rough Trade NYC", "moreBioInfo": "Despite its title, the second album from Knuckle Puck isn\u2019t a reinvention; rather, Shapeshifter is the sound of the Chicago-based pop-punk band taking their best qualities and honing them to make them even sharper.

Sadly, I attempted violin as a young child and was brutally bad. My parents had some how had me listening to classical music at that time which probably explains the violin attempt. Then a miracle happened\u2026First, the Beatles arrived so, bye bye classical & then my aunt who was buying a new piano (the wealthier end of the family) offered me her old one. I\u2019m 8 1/2 so I was still agreeable to anything so I promised to take lessons and really work at it.\nI lied\u2026After a year and a half I quit\u2026..until I discovered Elton John. That was it! I was determined to be a musician. In the late 70\u2019s I joined a fairly succesful 50\u2019s/60\u2019s band called Slick. I played 6 nights a week and worked full time at a department store as a stock man (person in this politically correct universe). Exhaustion wasn\u2019t considered. I went to gigs with a thermos of tea and lemon since I was always sick. This lasted until the early 80\u2019s. I joined a band called Loose Change which (under my direction) played anything from the 1960\u2019s- whatever was current. That lasted 12 years. Many years of putting my ears in harms way and breathing in way to much bar smoke told me it was time to quit. This was somewhere around 1993/94 (I don\u2019t remember). The next time I played live was in 2004 at my local block party. That\u2019s what I needed to get the itch to play again but, I was working in retail at Sam Ash Music and simply had no time to gig. In 2007 I was offered a better job which offered me a 9-5 existence. The economy turned sour and earning extra cash became a priority. And then it happened\u2026.I walked into a local Italian restaurant called Vera\u2019s Trattoria to pick up a pizza and lo and behold (fancy words ehh?) a piano player was pumping out Jazz licks. Can you imagine? Live music! I decided to approach the owner to see if I could score a gig. He decided to try me the following week. I was hired as a permanent fixture on Saturday nights. Thus The Richie G Review was born. \u201cA one man band Piano/vocals using backing tracks and a voice harmonizer to create a full band sound. My current song list represents over seventy artists including Elton John, Billy Joel , James Taylor, The Beatles and hits from the 1960\u2019s thru today. Over 500 tunes and counting\u2013 Booking email onemanbandrichieg@gmail.com .\u201d I played at Vera\u2019s for 14 months and then a new owner took over. He decided that entertainment was unnecessary. I got to work recording a CD of covers and creating business cards. The hard work paid off! I\u2019m a permanent Wednesday night fixture at the Woodcliff lake Hilton as well as sprinkling in various weekend gigs.\nRidgewood Street Fair 2013-2014\n\n392561_413258562028352_398683286819213_1318553_160572558_nRIDGEWOOD\n\nChapter 2- Ginger Martini was Born Right around St Patty\u2019s Day of 2012, I was performing at the Elm Street Grill in Oakland NJ. I was approached by my soon to be partner Wendy Kelly. I was on the floor wiring up my equipment as she, asked me questions about what I do (kind of music, etc). I was excited believing that I was going to be hired for a private party. During the break, she handed me her card.It turned out she was interested in joining me. I wasn\u2019t looking but, I agreed to see what she sounded like at my rehearsal space (haha my basement). Three songs later I was convinced. We sounded great together. A week later, we had 50 plus songs ready for prime time. She joined me at The Paris Inn in Wayne NJ. Ever since we perform around 50% of my gigs together and get an incredible response. Wendy started a seasoned veteran of the Broadway, Standard, and Country Genres. She has since dragged me into her country word as I dragged her into my pop/rock world.

The final chorus had some technical imperfections, and he figured he could improve on the performance once his heart settled down. Producer Dwight Baker, one-half of the Austin-based duo The Wind and The Wave, wouldn\u2019t let Abbott retouch it. \u201cI was actually crying my eyes out during that last chorus, and that\u2019s why there\u2019s a couple of notes in the beginning of that section that don\u2019t really explode like normal,\u201d Abbott says. \u201cDwight was like, \u2018We\u2019re keeping that. That\u2019s real.\u2019\u201d Real is the operative word for Front Row Seat, a 16-track song cycle that represents the most ambitious and emotionally challenging project yet for JAB, a highly melodic six-piece ensemble that\u2019s managed to keep a foot in both the Texas music scene and the national country world. The band won four times during the inaugural Texas Regional Radio Awards behind an upbeat brand of country that still leans on classic instrumentation \u2013 particularly banjo and fiddle \u2013 to effect a raucous, roof-raising attitude. The band has lobbed three singles onto the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart \u2013 including \u201cOh, Tonight,\u201d the first charted track to feature Grammy-winning Kacey Musgraves \u2013 and nabbed a Top 10 album with the 2012 release Small Town Family Dreams and reached No. 12 with the 2014 EP Tuesday Night. But Front Row Seat steps beyond the band\u2019s honky-tonk inclinations for a more personal journey as the album traverses the emotional course of Abbott\u2019s first marriage and subsequent divorce. It was not his original intention to depict his private life in a public way, but as he wrote the songs for Front Row Seat, beginning before the split actually occurred, he naturally mined his emotional life for a set of songs that were profoundly honest and revealing. It was only as they began recording the material at Baker\u2019s Matchbox Studios outside of Austin, that they realized they had the germ of a tangible plot. \u201cWe started looking at the music we\u2019d done and had a whole bunch of other songs that we really loved and we were like, \u2018Man, we could put this together and make a really neat story out of it,\u201d fiddler Preston Wait recalls. \u201cEspecially with the song \u2018Front Row Seat,\u2019 we basically just made it kind of like you\u2019re watching a movie and it\u2019s your front row seat to this life.\u201d Owing to that silver-screen character, JAB employed screenwriting technique by assembling the project with the five elements of plot structure: the exposition, or beginning; an inciting incident; the climax; a falling action (in this case, a breakup); and the resolution. The story begins with \u201cWhile I\u2019m Young,\u201d in which a college-aged Abbott lives a typically carefree existence, spending much of his discretionary income in bars and living for the moment, an ideal that\u2019s captured authoritatively in the anthemic \u201cLive It While You Got It.\u201d As the album progresses, he meets a woman who commands his attention for more than one evening, finding himself by track 7, \u201cCrazy Things,\u201d mulling what it is that would make a woman who\u2019s dang-near perfect fall for someone so flawed. By the time the album concludes, his once-ideal relationship has turned sour, and the two are no longer one. The fracture becomes apparent through the resignation of \u201cBorn To Break Your Heart,\u201d and he discovers in \u201cGhosts\u201d that all the memories that once lived with such passion and revelry continue to haunt his memory, taunting him with whispers of a past he can never reclaim. As Front Row Seat closes with \u201cAnonymity,\u201d Abbott sings a spare dirge with acoustic guitar and fiddle, fantasizing that he could return to the start of the relationship and live it out right. \u201cWhen you\u2019re moving on from somebody, even once you\u2019ve accepted it, you just feel alone,\u201d Abbott observes. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason the acoustic track ends the album.\u201d Even though Front Row Seat represents an ode to a failed relationship, it also marks what Abbott expects to be the beginning of a new phase for JAB. One of Texas\u2019 best party bands, the group evolved heavily in the process of making the album. The players fully committed to a darker sound and gave even more prominence to Wait\u2019s fiddle and Austin Davis\u2019 banjo, highlighting the trad-country elements in the lineup while still infusing the influence of multiple genres in its sonic drama. \u201cWhen you get to the end of this album, you see a band that grew up before your eyes \u2013 like literally front to back, a band that sonically changed,\u201d Abbott says. \u201cYou never want to make the same album multiple times, and you never want to sound the same your entire career. You know, you look at The Beatles and you look at all these other great bands, they tweaked their sound over time, and I think you\u2019re gonna start to see us do that a little bit more.\u201d While JAB is truly a group, the name is centered on Abbott \u2013 the lead singer, primary songwriter and band namesake \u2013 with good reason. He is a determined force of nature, and his ability to lead \u2013 to, in essence, turn something small into something much bigger \u2013 has been a hallmark of the band since its inception. That start came in the mid-2000s when Abbott and frat brother Davis showed up for a few informal gigs at the Blue Light Live in Lubbock, Texas. \u201cWe played two open-mic nights, and we had two songs, no band. Just him and me,\u201d Davis recalls. \u201cI walk in the back, and Josh is talking to the owner and the manager about doing a live record there. And I\u2019m thinking, \u2018We don\u2019t even have a band.\u2019 His thing was, \u2018We\u2019ll get to that later.\u2019 He\u2019s always thought that way. I\u2019ve played in other bands but never saw anybody else with that kind of confidence.\u201d Wait and drummer Edward Villanueva showed up a year and a half later, and in short time, JAB\u2019s first single \u2013 \u201cTaste,\u201d self-released on Pretty Damn Tough Records \u2013 found a home on Texas radio stations. Bass player James Hertless and lead guitarist Caleb Keeter came on board circa 2010, and the lineup has stabilized for the past five years. \u201cAny movie you see about a band, it\u2019s like five or six kids that are best friends,\u201d Wait says. \u201cGrowing up, that\u2019s kind of what you think it\u2019s gonna be like. I found that in this group.\u201d The friendship is built on constant touring. Texas alone keeps the band steadily employed, but Abbott and crew have built a wider concert base that includes such iconic venues as Nashville\u2019s Exit/In, Chicago\u2019s Joe\u2019s Bar, Washington D.C.\u2019s 9:30 Club, Denver\u2019s Grizzly Rose and Los Angeles\u2019 Troubadour. The audience has grown in part because of the singability and relatability of the Abbott Band\u2019s material, which has always held something of an everyman appeal. As personal as Front Row Seat is, the album has a ring of familiarity. Nearly everyone has messed up a relationship or had their heart broken. It\u2019s practically a rite of passage, and Abbott\u2019s willingness to tear down the walls and bare his heart lifts the project to a new level of connection with the band\u2019s growing audience. \u201cI know there\u2019s going to be a natural reflection on me and how the album mirrors my life,\u201d Abbott concedes. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to think that this is really a story that is so common that everyone relates to it and that it\u2019s not just about me. Hopefully people can listen to it and feel like it\u2019s about them.\u201d It\u2019s about the band, too. Villanueva used a bigger drum kit in recording Front Row Seat, laying a little more power underneath. And Wait and Davis take a more prominent role in the sound, heightening the country and bluegrass sides of the group without harming its modern texture. \u201cWhen we come up with parts, it\u2019s difficult because it\u2019s not standard bluegrass, like Flatt & Scruggs,\u201d says Davis. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do something different. It pushes you to try and make something new.\u201d There\u2019s certainly plenty new in Front Row Seat for Josh Abbott Band. The ethereal lyrics in \u201cAutumn\u201d and \u201cAnonymity\u201d are a starting place as Abbott\u2019s songwriting challenges country\u2019s tendency toward literal interpretations and storylines. The band also works for the first time with Carly Pearce, who provides a powerhouse female presence on \u201cWasn\u2019t That Drunk.\u201d Assembling the project as a concept album with a distinct storyline is another new approach for JAB. The tormented lead single, \u201cAmnesia\u201d \u2013 with its snarling guitar solo and artsy, unsettling intro \u2013 is yet another new technique. Those wrinkles in JAB\u2019s development demonstrate the band\u2019s willingness to explore new turf, tapping musical character that might have gone unexpressed in its earlier projects. But people don\u2019t build character during the easy times. It comes when they\u2019re tested by the hurts and pitfalls that accompany any successfully lived life. Abbott, as the leader of the band, is emerging from one of his toughest tests to date. He and the band used an ultra-honest approach to the hard times to take the next step as it moves into its future. \u201cThe whole band embraced this project and really committed to not only make it sound incredible but sound different and better,\u201d Abbott says. \u201cIt\u2019s more mature than anything we\u2019ve done in the past.\u201d More mature because it\u2019s so honest. And so real. The brand new album \"Until My Voice Goes Out\" is now available!

Squeeze's lineup in the 1980s also featured the lead vocals of Paul Carrack, who was one of the lead singers of Ace - whose hit \"How Long?\" reached #3 in the U.S. charts and also a vocalist with Mike & The Mechanics as well as a solo artist.\n\nSince the release of their last album, 1998's Domino, no new Squeeze material has been produced. Glenn and Chris have each subsequently embarked on solo careers, with South East Side Story released in 2006 containing a number of reworked Squeeze tracks.\n\nIn 2007 Glenn and Chris announced that they were reforming Squeeze for some concerts in the USA and Britain.

Singing from the time he could talk and playing the guitar since the age of five, John Oates was destined to be a musician. Born in New York City, his family moved to a small town outside of Philadelphia, PA in the early 1950's, a move that would change the course of his life. Soaking up the sounds of the 60\u2019s, John was influenced by the Nascent folk scene, bluegrass, delta blues, and ragtime guitar styles while also immersing himself in R&B legends such as Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, The Temptations, Curtis Mayfield, as well as Smokey Robinson and the Miracles. One of his biggest mentors was his guitar teacher Jerry Ricks, who had spent time on the road with Mississippi John Hurt and Son House introducing John to the music of Doc Watson and Reverend Gary Davis, passing down their signature finger and flat picking styles. John Oates met Daryl Hall while attending Temple University in Philadelphia, PA. The two began collaborating and playing music together, marking the beginning of their historic partnership. Since the formation in the early 70's Hall & Oates have gone on to record 21 albums, which have sold over 80 million units making them the most successful duo in rock history. They have scored 10 number one records, over 20 Top 40 hits and have toured the world for decades. Their involvement in the original \"Live Aid\" concert and the groundbreaking \"We Are The World\" charity recording have further established them as legendary artists who have personally and through their music, stood the test of time. In addition to their numerous American Music, MTV awards, and multiple Grammy nominations, in 2005 they were inducted into the American Songwriters Hall of Fame and in May of 2008 were presented the prestigious BMI Icon Award for their outstanding career achievement in songwriting. In April 2014 Hall & Oates were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Since embarking on a long awaited solo career in 1999 John has recorded five solo albums including Phunk Shui, 1000 Miles of Life, Mississippi Mile, a live album called The Bluesville Sessions, and most recently Good Road To Follow, which features collaborations with Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic, Vince Gill, Nathan Chapman, Jim Lauderdale, and more. In January 2015 John released his latest project Another Good Road (Warner/Elektra), a DVD docu-concert that premiered on Palladia Music Channel. Recorded live in a Nashville studio in one session, the video features some of Music City\u2019s finest musicians and singers as well as rare, seldom seen footage of John\u2019s family ranch in Colorado, a glimpse into his world behind the music. John is a diverse musician and songwriter active in Nashville community and beyond. Founded in 2010, he was the creator and executive producer for the \u201c7908 the Aspen Songwriters Festival\u201d at the historic Wheeler Opera House in Aspen, CO. In 2013, John teamed up with Jim James (My Morning Jacket) to curate the Bonnaroo Super Jam with special guests Britney Howard, Billy Idol, R. Kelly, Larry Graham and the Preservation Hall Jazz band. He is currently writing a memoir to be released via St. Martin\u2019s Press in 2017. When not touring with his solo show or with Daryl Hall, John, his wife Aimee and their son Tanner divide their time between Nashville, TN and their rescue ranch in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, along with dogs, emus, peacocks, llamas and alpacas. \u2714 Verified Official John Oates Facebook Page", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "152 Metropolitan Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11249", "Artist": "Carson McHone", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8944207.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.96214, 40.715906], "Date": "Fri Feb 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-28", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Alternative Country, Country", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Skinny Dennis", "moreBioInfo": "Years before Rolling Stone was praising Carson McHone's rule-breaking roots music, the Austin, Texas native played weeknights in local bars like The White Horse, keeping dancers dancing and drinkers drinking. With her 21st birthday still in the distance, McHone entertained late-night crowds bearing witness to the good times and bad decisions that fill a busy bar. It was a rare, raw education. She pumped her music full of details from an early adulthood spent in the company of the heartbroken and high-toleranced. In 2015, McHone released Goodluck Man which earned her a cover story in The Austin Chronicle as well as the support of local icons like Ray Wylie Hubbard, who said she \"writes songs like her life depends on it.\" Then she hit the road, touring the U.S. (and beyond) with acts like Shakey Graves, Gary Clark, Jr., and Joe Pug. Her writing style widened and her music evolved.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when I wanted to champion traditional country,\u201d says McHone, \u201cmostly because I wasn\u2019t hearing it in what was being called \u2018country\u2019. I think a lot of roots influenced artists feel the need to defend tradition in this way. Today though, I want to do more with the form, push myself past where I understand it to be.\u201d\n\nDark, driving and evocative, 2018's Carousel captures this period of remarkable growth, shining a light not only on McHone's honky-tonk roots, but on her development as a modern, alt-country storyteller. It features newly written songs and updated versions of tracks that first appeared on Goodluck Man, pushing traditional sounds and themes into a modern context.\n\nPlaying an instrumental role in the process was Mike McCarthy, the now Nashville based, award-winning producer behind albums for Spoon, Patty Griffin, and Heartless Bastards. McCarthy is well versed in country music but his work is definitely not defined by the genre, which made him the perfect candidate for McHone\u2019s new record.\n\nCarousel is a latter-day record inspired by diverse sources like Dylan, the Velvet Underground, and American novelist Thomas Wolfe, unconcerned with flying the flag of old-school country. It wears its eclecticism proudly, with McHone singing each song in a voice that is worldly-wise and woozily gorgeous.\n\nCarousel kicks off with \"Sad,\" a song about the fraught relationship one develops with darkness, but it\u2019s a fast-moving, high-energy song driven forward by fiddle, electric guitar, and pedal steel. This track sets the stage for an album that tackles edgy subjects without losing its bright melodies. McHone creates her own rule book switching between tempos on \"Lucky\", offsetting the acoustic guitar of \"Spider Song\" with the medieval swell of a harmonium, and fills the piano ballad, \"How 'Bout It,\" with a mix of torch-song twang and late-night, jazz-club melancholia. Originally recorded back in 2015 as a deep-cutting, slow-moving waltz, \u201cGentle\u201d reappears on Carousel as an anthemic tribute to a love gone cold, with McHone exploring the tension between what we know and what we feel, then honoring a relationship\u2019s fleeting existence rather than despairing it\u2019s demise.\n\nThe lyrics are confessional and intensely autobiographical. On \u201cDram Shop Gal\u201d - one of several Goodluck Man tracks to receive a modern makeover \u2013 McHone takes a hard look at the ways in which her worldview has been shaped (for better and for worse) by her many hours in a barroom.\n\n\u201cI was a kid when I landed those residencies,\u201d she says of her days at The Hole in The Wall, where she began playing Friday happy hour as a 16-year-old, and The White Horse, where she eventually took over the coveted Thursday night residency. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even old enough to be in those bars and they became a home to me. It\u2019s a dark thing when a bar becomes your home.\u201d\nMcHone explains that Carousel embraces where she's come from and establishes where her musical interests are leading. \u201cThe art I\u2019m making would be lacking if I were to stick to a specific genre. Carousel is more modern, which is where my interests lie these days, and where my writing is taking me. At the end of the day, it has to be the song that dictates.\u201d\n\nGrowing up, McHone rode her horse bareback along the side streets of south Austin, weaving through traffic and empty parking lots to find space to \"open up\". For any motorist driving past, she must've been a wonderfully unusual sight to behold: a messy-haired young woman riding down the street, bridging the country and the city, the past and the present, the Wild West and modern Austin.\nMcHone\u2019s 2018 release builds a similar bridge. Purposeful, pointed, and poignant, Carousel is a compelling ride.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "484 Union Ave, New York, NY 11211", "Artist": "Ben Seretan", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.951617, 40.714994], "Date": "Fri Feb 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Union Pool", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f\u3030\ufe0f"}, {"Address": "50 Stirling Rd, Warren, NJ 07059", "Artist": "Bryan Hansen Band", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9224747.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.470873, 40.642739], "Date": "Fri Feb 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-28", "Genre": "Genres: Blue Eyed Soul, Funk, Adult Alternative, R&B, soul, Alternative Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Stone House at Stirling Ridge Restaurant and Events", "moreBioInfo": "Bryan Hansen Band is an adult alternative rock band located in New Jersey.

His list of achievements includes over 2 million albums sold, three Grammy nominations and a sold out Houston Astrodome.\n\nBut after releasing six albums in eight years, sending singles like \"Wave on Wave\" and \"Let Me\" up the charts, touring with powerhouses like Kenny Chesney and Keith Urban and dealing with accusations of \"selling out,\" the meat grinder of mainstream stardom proved to be too much. He was spent.\n\n\"I felt so much pressure during the years I was with the big record labels to put out a record almost every year,\" he explains. \"There was a constant loop of having to be creative with new music, and that's just not my style. I like it to happen when it happens.\"\n\nNow, after breaking the cycle for a three-year recharge, Green is back in his comfort zone and playing by his own rules again. His is new independent album Home is his first set of originals in several years, and directly speaks to the hardcore fans that have been with him since the beginning.\n\nFeaturing a mature country sound that is both modern and exposes his roots for all to see, his new tunes are full of ringing acoustic guitars, slippery steel and dobro, wailing fiddles and heartfelt, personal lyrics, making Home the return to form many fans have been waiting for.\n\n\"I'm very comfortable with this record, it came out exactly as I wanted it,\" Green says.\n\nProduced by the all-star team of Jon Randall Stewart, Justin Pollard and Gary Paczosa, the album captures some of the unbridled energy of his first three self-released projects.\n\n\"It's not too over-the-top produced, and it's not bare bones,\" says Green. \"It grooves well, you can turn it up or you can leave it down. It\u2019s a very comfortable spot.\"\n\nOf 13 new songs, Green co-wrote seven with big names like Scooter Carusoe, Liz Rose and Chris Stapleton, while six more were pulled from A-listers like Jessi Alexander, Brett and Jim Beavers, Chuck Cannon, Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne.\n\nThe album begins with the title track, boldly tackling the singer's contentious mainstream rise and any lingering naysayers right off the bat. Green doesn't regret taking his shot at the big time -- and says he had a lot of fun doing it -- but he does understand why some fans felt left out in the cold.\n\n\"I was blind to the game, I sang the wrong songs, and disappeared for way too long,\" he sings. \"But I've finally found my way home.\"\n\n\"That song was very, very easy to write,\" he says. \"I was writing with Patrick Davis for a couple of days here in Ft. Worth, and that song was really fast, just because I could hear those lines so easy -- 'Yeah it was fun, we were drunk as sailor's sons' -- we were heroes in our hometown, we were all those things.\"\n\nWith that out of the way, Green gets down to business, laying out a series of songs aimed straight toward his core fan base in the Lone Star state, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.\n\nThe album's first single, \"Girls From Texas,\" is a prime example, and also features the first of Home's stellar guest appearances. A sugary, grown-up lullaby that explains why Texan girls are just a little bit better than the rest, the track spent 10 weeks on top of the Texas Music chart. Green calls recording the song face-to-face with Lyle Lovett a highlight of the whole project.\n\n\"That\u2019s a Jon Randall song,\" he explains. \"He sent it to me and I\u2019ll never forget it. I was on the plane coming home from Louisiana, and he goes 'What do you think about this?' and I literally had chills all over my body. I was like 'I\u2019ll cut that son of a gun right now!'\"\n\n\"While I Was Away,\" the project's second single, will strike a chord with anyone who leaves his or her family behind to travel for work. Written by Zane Williams, it's a tearjerker of the highest caliber -- one that even Green has trouble getting through.\n\n\"It's just such a ringing truth,\" says the father of two. \"Everyone says 'That got me. This thing made me cry. God dang, why'd you have to do that?'\"\n\nFor lighter fare, Delbert McClinton and Lee Roy Parnell guest on \"May the Good Times Never End.\" With a twisting, generation-spanning storyline, it features a hot-rod beat and Parnell's burning slide guitar, as well as McClinton' rabble-rousing vocals and harmonica.\n\n\"Break It Back Down\" speaks to Green's new outlook on life and music, while \"No One Here But Us\" brings in Sarah Buxton to tell a steamy tale of desperate romance. Meanwhile, \"Right Now\" is a broken-hearted duet with Sheryl Crow that tells the unflattering-but-true story of Green dumping his now-wife on Valentine's Day.\n\n\"I was 22 years old and she was 21, I was ready to move on from Texas Tech and get to Austin and whatever was next,\" he says. \"It was the biggest mistake of my life, but at the same time it paid off, because once I realized it was a mistake, I knew our love was the real thing.\"\n\nAnd finally, \"Good Night In New Orleans\" ends the project on a high note, featuring a celebratory storyline and Louisiana-native Marc Broussard for added Cajun authenticity.\n\n\"I kind of have a standard rule to start and finish strong,\" Green laughs. \"The story behind it is great, and everything about that song is cool and fun and funny to me. Everybody around here loves a trip to New Orleans.\"\n\nAccording to Green his time off was very much needed, but even though he always intended to return, it still feels like a risk.\n\n\"There's a lot of fear, of course, and a lot of 'Is anybody interested? Has the landscape changed so much that I can't have an impact?'\" he admits. \"It's a mix of excitement and fear, but it\u2019s a welcome challenge.\"\n\nMainstream country may have changed, but Green is back in his groove, back to loving and making music on his own terms and happier than ever. And that's a recipe for a comeback of epic proportions.\n\n\"I think I'm having the best year of my life,\" he says. \"I feel happy and I feel smarter now. I look back and I wish I could go back in time and tell myself to slow down a little bit, but the truth is life is just enjoying the passing of time, as James Taylor says. There's a lot of drama and there's mistakes and you've gotta get through all of it to get to what you're looking for.\"\n\nWhat he was looking for was right at Home all along.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "4 Pennsylvania Plz, New York City, NY 10001", "Artist": "KT Tunstall", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9080626.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.99, 40.75], "Date": "Fri Feb 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-28", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, Acoustic, Pop Rock, Acoustic pop, Rock, Singer, Songwriter, Folk Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Madison Square Garden (Supporting Daryl Hall & John Oates)", "moreBioInfo": "LA-based Scotch Yeller.

I loved Sergio Mendes\u2019 songs, liked John Hartford on the Glenn Campbell Show and really got into James Taylor and Joni Mitchell who I still consider my two main influences. I also loved the singer-songwriters of the time including Carole King and Laura Nyro and later fell in love with Steely Dan\u2019s music, and just wore out my copy of Hubert Laws\u2019 Rite Of Spring. I was completely self-taught, by llistening to records and playing them over and over, teaching myself tablature from a great James Taylor book and modal tunings from Joni Mitchell\u2019s For The Roses song book. I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit. Other long term members include drummer Ray Levier and keyboardist Peter Vitalone, both of whom have been with KJ since\u201998 and \u201899. I am always interested in stretching myself and performing my music in different ways. The Lucky 7 recordings feature some wonderful pairings of great players that I don\u2019t always get to tour with but who have appeared in with me at The 55 and are wonderful friends too.\nKJ manages between 120-140 performances a year. New music, places to play and new festivals are what she\u2019s about these days \u201c\u2026 so we can keep on performing for new audiences. I can\u2019t stop, this is what I do.\u201d\n\nA crowd pleaser whose music is impossible to classify but very easy to enjoy, KJ Denhert is in her own special category.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "183 W 10th St, New York, NY 10014", "Artist": "Ted Chubb", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8557608.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.002722, 40.734367], "Date": "Fri Feb 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-28", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Smalls Jazz Club", "moreBioInfo": "Ted Chubb began his career performing in his native Ohio with mid-west legends, B3 organist Bobby Floyd and saxophonist Gene Walker.

On the third album \u201cThe Wave\u201d by Nashville based Los Colognes, they succeed just this - in breaking through the con\ufb01nes of everyday pop song lyricism to tell a sort of holistic story. It\u2019s not a concept piece, but it\u2019s a brooding and still joyful song cycle \ufb01lled with philosophical rumination, effortless hooks, inspiring musicianship, and expansive arrangements. It\u2019s an album perfectly suited of the current zeitgeist of unease and hope.\n\n\u201cThe Wave\u201d is an album about archetypes and about the everyday. There are allusions to the Great Flood, to Plato\u2019s Cave, to Poe, to the hero\u2019s quest so iconically de\ufb01ned by Joseph Campbell. There are recurring metaphors about the water, about the vastness of the ocean and the delicate balance between riding the wave and being pulled under. There is struggle, there is dread, there is hope, there is ultimately the knowledge only gained by a journey. It\u2019s an album\nabout attempting to gain acceptance with the \ufb02ow of adulthood, life in the music business, the changing awareness that only time and maturity can hand to someone.\n\nGuitarist/singer Jay Rutherford opines in the album\u2019s initial single , \u201cFlying Apart\u201d \u2018Nobody believed/We\u2019re all just hoping/Floating down streams\u201d. It\u2019s a song that repeatedly invokes the wave metaphor of the album\u2019s title while churning through its own sonic sea of\nshimmering keyboards and guitars anchored by drummer Aaron Mortenson. The music evokes any of the best moments of late seventies or mid eighties FM radio while never being weighed\ndown by the specter of in\ufb02uence. Los Colognes are a young band who have managed to forge their own sound while channeling the best sonic worlds of the decades past.\n\nUnlike the live approach used to record the group\u2019s previous records, \u201cThe Wave\u201d was built from the ground up so to speak and with attention to each track, each part. There is a certain economy of space in the songs that feels deliberate while never ceasing to be warm and\ninclusive. Guitar and keyboard lines drift off each other in between lyrical exchanges while Mortenson propels the beat, sometimes meditative, sometimes driving. Each song passes into another with a thoughtful pause- a passing keyboard chord, a drone, a bit of noise, a breath before the next re\ufb02ection. Like any fully realized album, there is a cyclical wholeness to it that beckons the listener not just to hear it in its entirety from the outset, but to hit \u2018play\u2019 again or lift the needle as soon as the last chord of \u201cCan You Remember?\u201d subsides.\n\nRutherford sings on \u201cCan You Remember?\u201d - \u2018When you were young/there was a \ufb02ood/ almost drowned\u2019, but with the understanding that the journey didn\u2019t end in tragedy, we didn\u2019t drown, we are still navigating the waters and with new perspective. The journey to \ufb01nish the recording of \u201cThe Wave\u201d was its own quest of sorts for Rutherford and Mortenson, a more deliberate process of creation and craft that shows a band becoming fully aware of its voice and its vision. As current events in the world breed anxiety and unease, as the accelerating paces of the hyper information age make it yet harder to deliver contemplative messages in the arts, and as we all struggle to accept the uncertainty and mystique of \u2018living in the moment\u2019, Los Colognes have given us a singular collection of quietly anthemic tunes, held together by philosophical re\ufb02ection and damn \ufb01ne rock and roll chops.

Liberio didn\u2019t always think that a career in music was possible, but he does now.

Often performing a mix of originals and covers, Liberio looks beyond Top 40 and searches for songs both new and old that have the same feel. He also knows his strengths, and blends these songs to fit his aesthetic while maintaining the [core] of each song. An avid music listener, he enjoys blending genres and describes his music as \u201cAdele meets EDM with a hip hop beat\u201d.\n\nLiberio is now known for using a loop pedal and building a band around himself, but it wasn\u2019t always that way. After building a band for a gig but the players not working out long-term, he took inspiration from Ed Sheeran\u2019s approach to a live show. He bought a loop pedal and began learning how to integrate it into his gigs, often sharing with concert-goers how he builds his backing band: himself.\n\nTaking inspiration from a wide variety of musicians and songwriters has helped Liberio create his unique sound. Artists like Billy Joel, Whitney Houston, Chris Cornell, and Adam Levine have inspired him in different ways, and he\u2019s used that to write music that stands out.\n\nHe\u2019s currently working on an EP of originals, \u201cDichotomy\u201d, that he is producing himself.

In the late \u201880s she relocated to Los Angeles, where she gained recognition on late night TV as the house drummer for the Arsenio Hall Show, then again in the late \u201890s as the drummer on the Quincy Jones late night TV show, VIBE, hosted by Sinbad.\n\nIn 1989, Carrington released a GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated debut CD on Verve entitled Real Life Story, which featured Carlos Santana, Grover Washington Jr., Wayne Shorter, Patrice Rushen, Gerald Albright, John Scofield, Greg Osby, and Hiram Bullock. Other solo CDs include 2002\u2019s Jazz is a Spirit, which features Herbie Hancock, Gary Thomas, Wallace Roney, Terence Blanchard, Kevin Eubanks, and Bob Hurst, and 2004\u2019s Structure, a cooperative group which features Adam Rogers, Jimmy Haslip and Greg Osby. Both CDs were released on the Europe-based ACT Music label and enjoyed considerable media attention and critical acclaim in the European and Japanese markets.\n\nCarrington\u2019s production and songwriting collaborations with artists such as Gino Vannelli, Peabo Bryson, Dianne Reeves, Siedah Garrett, Marilyn Scott have produced notable works as well, including her production of the Dianne Reeves GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated CD, That Day, as well as Dianne Reeves GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning CD, Beautiful Life, in 2014.\n\nCarrington has performed on many recordings throughout the \u201880s and \u201890s thru today. Notable examples of her work include Herbie Hancock\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning CD Gershwin\u2019s World, where she played alongside Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder. She has toured in many of Hancock\u2019s musical configurations (from electric to acoustic) and is featured on his Future2Future DVD.\n\nAfter a hiatus from the U.S. recording scene as a solo recording artist, Carrington returned in 2008 with More To Say... (Real Life Story: NextGen). Joining her was an impressive all-star cast of jazz and contemporary jazz instrumentalists, including George Duke, Everette Harp, Kirk Whalum, Jimmy Haslip, Greg Phillinganes, Gregoire Maret, Christian McBride, Danilo Perez, Patrice Rushen, Robert Irving III (who also serves as co-producer), Chuck Loeb, Dwight Sills, and legendary vocalists Les McCann and Nancy Wilson.\n\nCarrington released The Mosaic Project in 2011, her fifth recording overall and first on Concord Jazz. The critically acclaimed CD, which won a GRAMMY\u00ae Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album, gathered a myriad of voices and crystallized them into a multi-faceted whole that far outweighed the sum of its parts. She produced the 14-song set which included some of the most prominent female jazz artists of the last few decades: Esperanza Spalding, Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Sheila E., Nona Hendryx, Cassandra Wilson, Geri Allen and several others. Carrington said the emergence of so many great female jazz instrumentalists over the last couple of decades is what made an album like The Mosaic Project possible.\n\nIn 2013, Carrington released Money Jungle: Provocative in Blue, her much anticipated homage to Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus and Max Roach, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of their iconic 1963 Money Jungle album. The recording featured Gerald Clayton and Christian McBride, with guests Clark Terry, Lizz Wright, Herbie Hancock and others. Carrington made history when she became the first woman to win a GRAMMY\u00ae Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album.\n\nOn August 7, 2015, Carrington releases The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL. Like its predecessor, the album presents Carrington leading a rotating cast of superb female instrumentalists and vocalists that includes Oleta Adams, Natalie Cole, Paula Cole, Lalah Hathaway, Chaka Khan, Chant\u00e9 Moore, Valerie Simpson, Nancy Wilson, Jaguar Wright and Lizz Wright, as well as saxophonist Tia Fuller, trumpeter Ingrid Jensen; bassists Meshell Ndegoecello and Linda Oh; and keyboardists Geri Allen, Patrice Rushen and Rachel Z.\n\nOn The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL, Carrington juxtaposes her salute to female artists by paying homage to various male artists who have either influenced her professionally and/or informed her musicality, such as Nick Ashford, George Duke, Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra, Luther Vandross and Bill Withers. \u201cWhenever I do something that celebrates women, I never want it to feel like it\u2019s something that excludes men,\u201d she explains. \u201cOn this record, I consciously wanted to celebrate the various relationships women have with men either through original songs of mine or cover songs by male composers and song writers.\u201d The male presence and perspective on The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL is even more realized by Billy Dee Williams, who contributes insightful spoken-word interludes through the disc.", "otherInfo": "Andra Day BJ the Chicago Kid Jon Batiste Leon Bridges Mumu Fresh Rapsody Talib Kweli Angelique Kidjo Urban Bush Women Dolores Huerta Eve L.

The blasting, scathing yet melodic black metal savagery of opener \"Black Sun Horizon\" and \"Way Of The Storm\" are very much built to destroy, while wielding a poignancy that is undeniable - both of which stand in strong contrast to the uncomfortable post-punk squall of \"Underneath\" that showcases Hill's Nick Cave/Ian Curtis-esque singing voice, while the likes of the throbbing \"Saturnalian\" and unnerving tribal thunder of \"Walk With Me In Nightmares\" stand in categories all of their own. While every track on The Grand Annihilation stands separate from those around it, it is still a cohesive collection, and at no point do the stylistic twists and turns undermine its coherence. \"If you've been following Tombs, you probably know to expect the unexpected, and I always strive to present a full range of emotion on everything with the band's name on it,\" Hill explains. \"That said, this is a very dark and introspective record that digs deep into the common ideas of mortality, infinity and cosmic mysteries.

The seven-track collection marks a stylistic shift from their previous LPs. It\u2019s an evolution that sees the band embracing a sleeker, shinier, even DANCIER version of themselves \u2013 a cosmic disco of the body and the soul, still anchored in the groove, but ascending to the stars. The thing is, their sound isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s evolved. Since their last LP, Circles has undergone a transformation internally. It\u2019s a tale of life, death and rebirth, of love and loss, of shedded skin and new beginnings. But let\u2019s start with the new album, shall we?\n\nRecorded by legendary engineer Jim Scott (Wilco, Rolling Stones, Tom Petty) at his studio in Valencia, CA, this new collection began with\u2026a drum machine. The Sequential Circuits Drumtraks\u2122 from 1983, to be specific. The Circles band members\u2014guitarist Neal Casal (Chris Robinson Brotherhood, Ryan Adams), bassist Dan Horne (Cass McCombs, Jonathan Wilson), keyboardist Adam MacDougall (Black Crowes) and drummer Mark Levy\u2014were searching for a sound, something more upbeat than previous releases. Cue the Drumtraks\u2122. \u201cThe built-in beats on it are actually pretty janky,\u201d says Horne. \u201cBut we knew we wanted to make more of a dancey, groove-driven album that would translate live, to give our shows a more high-energy feel.\u201d Drawing inspiration from P-Funk, Herbie Hancock\u2019s Head Hunters, and Beastie Boys\u2019 slinky instrumentals, the band used the Drumtraks\u2122 driving rhythms as the foundation for each song.\n\nAlbum opener \u201cBabyman\u201d makes it clear the Circles Around The Sun ride is headed in a new direction, closer to Air\u2019s Moon Safari than the psych-jazz odyssey of their previous LPs, Interludes for the Dead (2015) or Let It Wander (2018).\n\nAn origin story, for context: in 2015 Justin Kreutzmann, son of Grateful Dead drummer Bill, invited Casal to compose the intermission music for the Dead\u2019s Fare Thee Well concerts, a victory lap celebrating their final shows. Neal assembled the guys, recorded five hours of jams, and was surprised to find an eager audience and label support from Rhino Records. And Circles Around the Sun was born.\n\nOn epic disco jammers \u201cDetroit Dos\u201d and \u201cLand Line Memories,\u201d MacDougall\u2019s sizzling analog keyboards (like the Minimoog Model D and phaser-soaked Clavinet) echo vintage library music and 1978\u2019s crate digger fave Black Devil Disco Club by Bernard Fevre. \u201cThis band was never something I thought would get done to a click,\u201d says MacDougall. \u201cBut we all talked about it being more of a fun record, so we hung some mirror balls and played a bunch of dance music!\u201d\n\nAs it happens, Circles\u2019 new sound was created partly by design, but also partly by tragic circumstance. On August 26, 2019, a week after laying down his tracks for Circles Around the Sun, founder Neal Casal committed suicide. He left behind a note for the group, asking for them to continue in his absence\u2014to continue recording, touring, and playing together. They\u2019ve chosen to honor his wishes. \u201cOur mission is to extend Neal\u2019s musical legacy,\u201d says drummer Levy. \u201cHe was a classy dude and had a regal vibe about him. The other side of it is the mental health legacy. Maybe there are people out there in the same sort of darkness Neal was in, who can hear us and say we can work positively on multiple fronts in his memory.\u201d\n\nIn this metamorphosis, Circles Around the Sun spans both heartbreak and hope. Doors close; windows open; new directions extend themselves in mysterious ways. But sometimes you know it\u2019s real from the first beat. It just clicks. We\u2019ll see you on the dancefloor, at the festival, at the next jam session, where everyone comes together and all is forgiven. It\u2019s just how Neal would want it. It\u2019s Circles Around The Sun.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "10 Columbus Cir, New York, NY 10023", "Artist": "Isaiah J.

The right vocalist can make you fall in love at first listen, elicit tears, or bring you back to a different era altogether. A microphone and a stage remain the only necessities. That holds true for New York-based singer and songwriter Morgan James. On her full-length debut for Epic Records, Hunter, she casts an unbreakable spell with a powerhouse voice equally inspired by smoky soul, swaggering R&B, theatrical swing, and a virtuosic classical poise.\n\nThe Idaho native discovered her passion for music early on and pursued it\nwholeheartedly at the prestigious Juilliard School. While in the midst of the institution's rigorous academic program, she soon realized that her path would diverge from the classical world. \"I didn't want a career in opera, but Juilliard still shaped me,\" she confesses. \"The traditional training really made me a disciplined singer. I carry that with me to this day.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Morgan spent the next few years facing the proverbial struggles of being a young artist in New York. Low on money, she bounced back and forth between bartending and restaurant gigs while fighting to survive. Immersed in classic sixties and seventies soul records, she concurrently experienced a pivotal revelation. \"Out of that frustration came this other voice,\" she says. \"It was my true voice, and I feel like I discovered it in the middle of so much hardship just trying to be heard. I embraced who I was at that very moment.\"\n\nSoon, she would be heard in a big way. In 2008, Morgan booked her first Broadway show\u2014appearing in The Addams Family alongside Nathan Lane, as well as in prominent and leading roles in Wonderland, Godspell (Turn Back, O Man), and Berry Gordy's Motown The Musical as Teena Marie. The latter set the stage for her to\nproperly launch her solo career. Gordy recognized the vocalist's immense talent, and introduced her to Doug Morris and L.A. Reid, opening the door for a deal with Epic Records in 2012.\n\nAround the same time, Morgan booked a landmark show at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, where she paid tribute to Nina Simone with a set of songs that were closely associated with the legendary artist. The incendiary show was recorded and released as the critically acclaimed Morgan James Live on Epic Records. It also proved to be the perfect segue for her first studio album, released in June of 2014.\n\n\"I always knew to make a neo-soul pop record,\" Morgan says. \"The foundation is all real ingredients, and those roots of soul and R&B are pretty strong. It's the culmination of my musical life up to this point. The painful songs are straight out of a bad relationship with someone from my past. The joyful moments are wonderful memories. It's all coming from me. I've lived every one of these stories, and I love the genres I'm representing. It's one point-of-view\u2014mine.\"\n\nThe title track and album opener \"Hunter\" boasts a seductive hook with cinematic noir flair. Flaunting the singer's immense delivery and dynamic presence, it's an undeniable and classy come-on that proves as animalistic as it does magnetic. \"From a woman's perspective, it's such an empowering and sexy song,\" she smiles. \"It totally makes me feel like a warrior! Music is so sensual and life-affirming. That's what I look for. You don't often see a girl take this position, and that's what I love about it!\"\n\nMorgan assumed co-writing duties on eight of the collection's fourteen tracks and even performed all of her own background vocals and harmonies. From the empowering farewell of \"Fed Up On You\" to the mournful rumination of \"You Never Lied\", she continually bares it all\u2014both emotionally and musically. \"I sing like I'm never going to sing ever again,\" Morgan affirms. \"I wanted to capture that power and passion every time. At some moments, it might sound flawless; at others, it might sound like it's going to break. I'm revealing something about myself with\nevery song. You've got to do that. My favorite artists, whether Joni Mitchell or Michael Jackson, are and were, always honest.\"\n\nThere's a unique structure to the album. The first five songs boast electronic elements, while the last six don't have any. \"There's a gradient of the record that goes down,\" she says. \"By the time you get to the last song, it's just piano and voice. It starts with a song about power and ego, and it ends on one about surrender and selflessness. I have all of that in me. Maybe we all do.\"\n\nUltimately, her honesty permeates everything that Morgan James does, and it's why you'll always remember her voice. \"I want people to walk away from this album feeling fulfilled. That's the way it used to be. Often, I think I'm from another time,\u201d she says, her voice trailing off. \u201cI just want to bring back the power of the singular legacy voice.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "234 Starr St, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Nickodemus", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9782507.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.922471, 40.705626], "Date": "Fri Feb 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-02-28", "Genre": "Genres: Colorful Dance-floor Sounds From The Planet!", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Turk's Inn", "moreBioInfo": "Nickodemus has 4 albums. \"ENDANGERED SPECIES\" 2005, \"SUN PEOPLE\" 2009, \"MOON PEOPLE\" 2012, \"A LONG ENGAGEMENT\" 2018 as well as 10 \"Turntables on the Hudson\" compilations to date on his self-owned WONDERWHEEL Recordings label.\n\nFrom being a resident DJ & producer of the Turntables on the Hudson parties since 1998, Nickodemus has been a steady force on the music scene for over 20 Years.
