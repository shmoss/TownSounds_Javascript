Mike is also an active recording artist of original material, folk music, cross-cultural collaborations, and he has an ongoing project to record all of the Bach cello suites in acoustically glorious bathrooms of famous concert halls, via BachInTheBathroom.com. As one of the first wave of cellists to adopt a strap in order to stand and move while playing, Mike was the first standing cellist to perform at Carnegie Hall, using a cello strap of his own design, called the Block Strap, a performance which the NY Times called \"Breathless ... Half dance, half dare.\"\n\nAs a music educator, Mike is passionate about emphasizing creativity and collaboration, leading to the founding of the Mike Block String Camp in 2010. MBSC provides players of all backgrounds the opportunity to learn from a world-class faculty in a variety of styles, and supports the exploration and development of the artistic voice of each student. Mike is also the founding Director of the Silkroad Global Musician Workshop, bringing together musicians from around the globe, and he created the online Multi-Style Cello School at ArtistWorks.com, with an extensive library of instructional videos.

He\u2019s on a mission to be a passionate voice defining the sound of Jazz in this age while also bringing street cred to the trombone with a bold, tight sound.\n\nBorn into the musical world (Mom Sherry Finzer is an international flutist), Finzer developed a fascination for the music of Duke Ellington and found himself, in high school, performing at the annual Essentially Ellington competition of Jazz at Lincoln Center. It was then that he decided to pursue a life in music himself. His budding talent was recognized by Wycliffe Gordon who began a life-long mentorship by writing four pieces for the young Finzer while he attended the Eastman School of Music. Nick went on to get his masters at Juilliard\u2019s prestigious Jazz program where he was mentored by the trombone legend Steve Turre.\n\nIn 2011 Nick was the winner of the Eastern Trombone Workshop\u2019s National Jazz Trombone Competition and was a finalist in the 2010 International Trombone Association\u2019s Carl Fontana Jazz Trombone Competition.\n\nIn January of 2013 Nick released his recording debut as a bandleader and composer with \u201cExposition\u201d (Outside In Music). Two tracks appearing on the album garnered Finzer a pair of accolades: The prestigious American Society of Composers and Performers (ASCAP)\u2019s Herb Alpert Award for young composers (2013 & 2015)\n\nIn 2014, Nick composed a new album-length work, \u201cThe Chase.\u201d Nick's sophomore album debuted in July of 2015 on Origin Records to rave reviews, a feature article in Downbeat Magazine, and peaked at #6 on the JazzWeek Charts.\n\nFamed trombonist and mentor Wycliffe Gordon called Finzer \u201ca new voice [in] the pantheon of upcoming trombone greats in the making\u201d and added \u201cNick's CD is a glowing example of things to come.\u201d\n\nWhen away from NYC, Finzer can be found touring the globe not only with his own projects, but as part of YouTube sensation, Scott Bradlee\u2019s Postmodern Jukebox. Finzer has joined the group on television, in viral videos with millions of views, and on tours across North America, Australia, New Zealand and Europe.\n\nFinzer has performed at top Jazz clubs and concert halls with Wynton Marsalis\u2019 Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, Lucas Pino\u2019s No Net Nonet, Ryan Truesdell's Gil Evans Project, Bob Stewart\u2019s Double Quartet, Frank Wess, Terrell Stafford, Lewis Nash, the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, Walt Weiskopf, Slide Hampton, Frank Kimbrough, Carl Allen, Steve Turre and many more.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "157 Montague St, Brooklyn, NY 11201", "Artist": "The Cactus Blossoms ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8935702.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.993095, 40.694581], "Date": "Fri Apr 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-17", "Genre": "Indie, Americana, Rockabilly, Country Western, Folk, Country", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "St. Ann & the Holy Trinity Church", "moreBioInfo": "Blood Harmony. Whether it\u2019s The Beach Boys, Bee Gees or First Aid Kit, that sibling vocal blend is the secret sauce in some of the most spine-tingling moments in popular music. The Cactus Blossoms \u2013 Minneapolis-based brothers Page Burkum and Jack Torrey \u2013 offer compelling evidence that this tradition is alive and well, with a deceptively unadorned musical approach that offers \u201ccreative turns of phrase, gorgeous harmonies, and an ageless sound\u201d (NPR All Things Considered), not to mention spine tingles aplenty. Their 2016 debut You\u2019re Dreaming, a stunning and transporting collection of original songs, earned high praise from Rolling Stone and Vice Noisey, tour stints with Kacey Musgraves and Lucius, and a perfectly cast performance on the third season of David Lynch\u2019s Twin Peaks. Now their unlikely rise continues with new album Easy Way, to be released on their own label Walkie Talkie Records.\n\nWhile many bands would have been content to stick with the winning formula of their debut, the Blossoms refused to repeat themselves. If You\u2019re Dreaming celebrated their vintage country and rock influences, Easy Way reveals a songwriting style that has changed, evolved, and gotten more modern. Dan Auerbach, another artist who knows from bedrock influences, co-wrote two songs on the album. \u201cDan\u2019s love for songwriting was inspiring, just the kick in the pants we needed to start writing again after being on the road,\u201d says Page.\n\nThe brothers\u2019 decision to produce the new album themselves no doubt led to the new sound. \u201cWe wanted the freedom to experiment with our own weird ideas,\u201d says Jack, \u201cWe used to joke that the working title album should be Expensive Demos.\u201d As they crisscrossed the nation on tour, the brothers would stop through Alex Hall\u2019s Reliable Recorders studio in Chicago to chase the new sound they were after. The result joins together what would otherwise be distant corners of the American songbook. Both the traditional twang of Chicago pedal steel guitarist Joel Paterson (Devil in a Woodpile, The Western Elstons) and the primal wail of free jazz saxophonist Michael Lewis (Bon Iver, Andrew Bird) are at home on the album.

A mix of power pop, raging guitars and strong melodies, it gained ground in the press, social media and on radio including WDHA 105.5FM, one of the biggest rock stations in New Jersey. The band toured heavily throughout 2013 into 2014 in support of the album culminating in a 10 city East Coast tour in October 2014. The tour kicked off with Lost Romance being chosen as one of only a handful of bands to play ReverbNation's showcase at the CBGB Festival 2014 in NYC and ended up taking the band as far south as Florida.\n\n2014 also saw the recording of Lost Romance's first full length album. Going back to basics, the new tracks were recorded at LR bassist Dan Haag's (The Astrojet, Benzos, Jody Porter & The Black Swans) basement studio on four track cassette.

Still, Couvares is determined to age gracefully in an increasingly crestfallen era of draconian politics and disenchantment on his upcoming release, When This All Ends (out April 24), mixed by Charlie Stavish (Jenny Lewis, Interpol, Weezer) and mastered by Robin Schmidt (The 1975, The Japanese House, Ben Howard).\n\nWhen This All Ends is a coming of age tale for Couvares, who plans to keep exuberance intact but yearns to jettison reckless abandon and feckless joy, now a 26-year-old working-class citizen; and while he may not be The Only Living Boy in New York, he\u2019s not impervious to loneliness. Swallowing the dregs that remain of youthful naivet\u00e9, the unassuming crooner yields wistful, spirited coos akin to Ezra Koenig and Morning Benders era Chris Chu. Through character-driven exploits of the heart and semi-autobiographical accounts, Couvo\u2019s lyrics take precedence, though his big-hearted choruses on songs like \u201cStill Hanging On\u201d and \u201cGloria Steinem\u201d remain unaffected, and equally poignant.\n\nOn \u201cStill Hanging On,\u201d Couvares manages to wax humor alongside poetry, by capturing an awestruck revelation - the field noise of a would-be laureate outside of Roberta\u2019s Pizza & Bakery on Moore Street, who exclaims, \u201cWait, wait, wait - but also - we can do takeaway,\u201d as if struck by a bolt of lightning. Although Brooklyn is quite the bitter pill at times, Couvares invites all of his high school friends from Manchester, CT inside the studio to wrangle warmth and nostalgia on the chorus of \u201cStill Hanging On\u201d; the first half of the track presents minimal instrumentation, with caj\u00f3n, a charming piano cadence, acoustic and electric guitar balladry and soothing vocals, only to give rise to a bigger and jazzier arrangement, replete with a Clarence-esque sax solo, a full drum kit, and the aforementioned chorus of dear friends.\n\n\u201cTo all my friends that I grew up with, who I don\u2019t see anymore/To all those nights when we had no idea what it was that we were living for/You know those days are over/We\u2019re all just getting older/And I know those years are gone/My dreams, they\u2019ve been a little bent and bruised/But they\u2019re still hangin\u2019 on.\u201d\n\n\u201cGloria Steinem\u201d sedates the listener with sizzling auxiliary percussion, ethereal guitar swells, rapturous saxophone, and another big chorus that presupposes the taxing journey and romantic interest of a rich girl who exhibits a duality in the spirit of Roxanne Gay\u2019s Bad Feminist: on one hand, she\u2019s \u201ccoked out of her mind/Lower East Side all the time,\u201d and on the other, the narrator reveals, \u201cShe had this little letter that she wrote when she was seven/To the person she\u2019d become/How she would be a doctor, and a lawyer and a mother, and the president all at once,\u201d illuminating (quite literally) the ridiculous laundry list of gratuitous expectations society places on women, and the letter is - in turn - upended by a zippo lighter. Meanwhile, the narrator explains, \u201cAll she ever wanted was to be Gloria Steinem/ But the gig was already booked.\u201d It\u2019s the story of a rich girl and a poor boy, talking in circles as they try to relate to one another, and all the while, not being ready for any burdensome chapters that come with being an adult in real-time. Then again, who is?\n\n\u201cGoon Squad,\u201d which Couvares describes as \u201cthe heart of the record,\u201d continues the boy-meets-world-and-falls-in-love-with-a-girl, drunk-on-a-Summer-day-in-Brooklyn narrative, with just a dash of spite at the behest of blame, as the unreliable narrator is called out on truths that, perhaps hit too close to home; Couvares also begs the question, how does anyone truly know what\u2019s best for their significant other, as we try, earnestly, not to burst any bubbles, in the name of love? \u201cAnd if I\u2019m another boy like the rest/You\u2019re a question mark in a Summer dress,\u201d Couvares declares.\n\n\u201cThe older I get, the harder it is to feel anything,\u201d says Couvares, and as we all know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Skylarking aside - and when we strip all the trivial pursuits of escapism away from our lives - it\u2019s hard to proclaim what one should focus on when they pore over both socioeconomic status, and even harder to occasionally enjoy one\u2019s adulthood in the ghost of their youth, without first considering what\u2019s left behind, when this all ends.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "149 Westchester Ave, Port Chester, NY 10573", "Artist": "Sheryl Crow ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7560403.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.66549, 41.00139], "Date": "Fri Apr 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-17", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "The Capitol Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "A nine-time GRAMMY AWARD recipient, Sheryl Crow is an American music icon.

I loved Sergio Mendes\u2019 songs, liked John Hartford on the Glenn Campbell Show and really got into James Taylor and Joni Mitchell who I still consider my two main influences. I also loved the singer-songwriters of the time including Carole King and Laura Nyro and later fell in love with Steely Dan\u2019s music, and just wore out my copy of Hubert Laws\u2019 Rite Of Spring. I was completely self-taught, by llistening to records and playing them over and over, teaching myself tablature from a great James Taylor book and modal tunings from Joni Mitchell\u2019s For The Roses song book. I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit. Other long term members include drummer Ray Levier and keyboardist Peter Vitalone, both of whom have been with KJ since\u201998 and \u201899. I am always interested in stretching myself and performing my music in different ways. The Lucky 7 recordings feature some wonderful pairings of great players that I don\u2019t always get to tour with but who have appeared in with me at The 55 and are wonderful friends too.\nKJ manages between 120-140 performances a year. New music, places to play and new festivals are what she\u2019s about these days \u201c\u2026 so we can keep on performing for new audiences.

That\u2019s also been the case since the beginning, when Rogers, multi-instrumentalist Mike Henderson, bass player Mike Fleming, banjo player Richard Bailey, and singer/guitarist Chris Stapleton first convened after a series of songwriting sessions between Henderson and Stapleton. What began as a casual get-together to jam in the late summer of 2005 became a fully committed band that signed with Rounder Records in 2007. They released their eponymous debut album at the beginning of 2008, garnering a GRAMMY\u00ae nomination for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for one of the songs in that set, \u201cBlue Side of the Mountain.\u201d That honor was followed two years later, when they received two more nominations for Reckless, their sophomore set -- one for Best Bluegrass Album and another for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals courtesy of its song \u201cWhere Rainbows Never Die.\u201dWhen Stapleton left the fold for a highly successful solo career in April 2010, the band closed one chapter and began another anew, while literally never missing a beat. Singer/guitarist Gary Nichols, a highly accredited artist in his own right, was brought on-board for the recording of the band\u2019s third album, 2012\u2018s Hammer Down, which subsequently climbed all the way up to number one on the Billboard Bluegrass charts, their highest placement yet. Nevertheless, the real journey had just begun. When Henderson left the band at the end of 2011, musician and producer Brent Truitt was brought in as his replacement. If there was any proof needed that the momentum had been maintained, The SteelDrivers\u2018 highly acclaimed fourth album, 2015\u2018s The Muscle Shoals Recording (featuring guest contributions from Nichols\u2019onetime bandmate Jason Isbell), garnered the group that long elusive GRAMMY\u00ae win with a notable nod for Best Bluegrass Album. In addition, it garnered three IBMA nominations --Album\nof the Year, Song of the Year (for \u201cLong Way Down\u201d), Songwriter of the Year (for Rogers) and Best Liner Notes (for writer Peter Cooper). Still, one more major development was left to come. Nichols departed in August 2017, leaving yet another void the band was left to fill. Once again, the group rose to the challenge, selecting Kentucky native Kelvin Damrell after Rogers\u2018 daughter spotted him singing on a YouTube video. He fit in just fine, and today again, The SteelDrivers\u2019 saga continues unabated. Part of the lure is undoubtably due to the freedom each musician gets to express themselves without any reservation, even as the group maintains the consistency of its sound. Rogers, a former member of the all-star Dead Reckoning music stable, is widely recognized as one of the most versatile and expressive fiddlers on the scene today. Truitt and Bailey are certified string benders who take their respective instruments to new levels of innovation and expertise. Damrell\u2019s vocals and fretwork add a fresh voice to the mix, while Fleming continues to anchor it all with rock solid rhythm and a firm foundation. It\u2019s a sound The Tennessean once described as \u201cGutsy, gritty bluegrass songs.\u201d The Philadelphia Inquirer put it even more succinctly. \u201cYou can call it power-bluegrass or country soul, but whatever you call it, Nashville\u2019s Steeldrivers have bushels of it.\u201dIn fact, The SteelDrivers\u2019 success lies in their consistent growth and ability to reinvent their regimen. It\u2019s also nurtured the various influences that each member brings to the band. With the emphasis on song structure as to parceling out their parameters, elements of Americana, country, blues, rock and soul all enter the equation. Yet their consistent standing at the IBMA awards --which began when they were voted Best Emerging Artist -- testifies to the fact that they\u2019ve been able to maintain a fierce following even while growing their audiences at every interval. The band plays approximately 75 shows a year, including major festival appearances at Bonnaroo, Merlefest, Wintergrass, Bristol Rhythm and Roots and Telluride Bluegrass Festival. It\u2019s their populist approach that finds their devotees -- self-proclaimed \u201cSteelHeads\u201d-- traveling hundreds of miles to see them in repeat performances. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been ten years since our first album,\u201d Rogers muses. \u201cAnd yet, even with all the change and transition, we still have the same joy and enthusiasm that we did in the beginning. Even as the trajectory changes, the story continues to unfold.\u201d\n\n\nThe SteelDrivers are:\n\nRichard Bailey - Banjo\n\nGrammy nominated banjo player, Richard Bailey has recorded with such diverse artists as Al Green and George Jones. Featured in the book Masters of the 5-String Banjo, Bailey has performed with Bill Monroe, Roland White, Vassar Clements, Loretta Lynn, Chet Akins, Larry Cordle, Laurie Lewis, Dale Ann Bradley, and countless others. He has also recorded with Kenny Rogers, Michael Martin Murphy, Johnny Cash, Tammy Wynette, and Ronnie Milsap and has played at Carnegie Hall and on Austin City Limits.\n\n\nMike Fleming - Bass/Vocals\n\nA versatile veteran, Mike Fleming lays down the firm foundation and sings the baritone harmony that rounds out the SteelDrivers\u2019 sound. A self-confessed \u201crecovering banjo player,\u201d Mike has recorded with Holly Dunn, Joy Lynn White, and with groundbreaking singer/songwriter David Olney. In addition to traveling the world during stints with Dunn and Kevin Welch, Mike has appeared on Austin City Limits, Nashville Now, Crook and Chase, and too many Grand Ole Opry shows and festivals to count.\n\n\nBrent Truitt - Mandolin\n\nWith many years of recording touring and producing under his belt, Brent isn't a newcomer to the music scene. Brent has performed with John Hartford, Alison Krauss, Dolly Parton, Dixie Chicks, and James Taylor, and has traveled the globe with James Taylor, Dixie Chicks and Dolly Parton. He has won Grammy awards for his engineering and mixing on tracks from Disney's 'Monsters Inc\" and \"Toy Story II\", and has appeared on Austin City Limits, Hee Haw, Today Show, Saturday Night Live and many more TV appearances.\n\n\nTammy Rogers - Fiddle/Vocals\n\nGrowing up in a family bluegrass band that also included banjo great Scott Vestal, Tammy brings a lifetime of instrumental and vocal experience to the SteelDrivers. She was also in the legendary pre-Union Station bluegrass band Dusty Miller with Barry Bales, Tim Stafford, Adam Steffey, and Brian Fesler. No stranger to the studio, she has recorded with Neil Diamond, Wynonna, Rodney Crowell, Radney Foster, Bill Anderson, Iris Dement, Randy Scruggs, Patty Loveless, Buddy and Julie Miller, Jim Lauderdale, and many more. She has toured the world with Trisha Yearwood, Reba McEntire, Patty Loveless, Maria McKee, and the Dead Reckoners.

While Somna is somewhat of a relatively fresh name to the trance scene, his discography and accolades read that of a seasoned veteran, which comes as no surprise considering his career spans over a decade in the scene under different guises and co-writing / production projects behind the scenes. His singles can be found on a few of the biggest trance labels in the world including Armada Music, Future Sound Of Egypt, AVA Recordings, Black Hole Recordings, Perfecto and Go On Air Recordings.\nAs a performing artist, Somna fuses together traditional mixing with current technologies in a way that creates an atmosphere for fans into a journey of what trance is truly about. His experiences with prior aliases over the years has led to performances at Global Gathering, Creamfields, Coloursfest, Eden (Ibiza), The Arches (Scotland), LoveFest (USA), and shows across Canada, UK, USA, Japan, Spain, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nJust a peek into support from the world\u2019s top trance DJs includes regular premieres on universally popular podcasts such as A State Of Trance, Group Therapy, Corsten\u2019s Countdown, Global DJ Broadcast and more. Recognition from A-list DJs includes Armin Van Buuren, Above & Beyond, Ferry Corsten, Markus Schulz, Paul Van Dyk, Gareth Emery, Andy Moor, TyDi, Lange, Cosmic Gate, Paul Oakenfold, Guiseppe Ottaviani, Heatbeat, Mark Sixma and many more. The abundance of support stands as a true testament to the quality of Somna\u2019s music.\n\nAs a prolific multi-genre producer and engineer, his track alongside Andy Moor \u201cOne Thing About You\u201d featuring Amy Kirkpatrick, reached #1 on Beatport and stayed in the top 10 for three weeks. Adding to Somna\u2019s Beatport success, \u201cOne Thing About You\u201d won the 2015 award for the most streamed trance track on Beatport.\n2015 and 2016 also saw multiple Somna releases reach the top 10 on Beatport, with tracks featuring the likes of Jennifer Rene & Michele C. To mark Lange Recordings\u2019 200th release, Somna was invited to team up with Johnny Yono and Monoverse. The result was \u201cHijackers\u201d, a triple threat labor of love which reached #3 on the Beatport charts. During these years, Somna also made two label debuts (Armada Captivating and Future Sound Of Egypt Excelsior) and joined the trance elite as he had the honor of mixing a 3 disc compilation alongside Andy Moor for AVA Recordings' 10 year anniversary. Coupled by a truly rare triple play on A State Of Trance (episode #791), 2016 was fantastic year for Somna.\n\nHis success carried over into 2017 as Somna showed no signs of slowing down. As one of the few trance artists hitting 100k+ monthly listeners on Spotify, Somna has an average monthly listener base of 140,000+ and the yearly collected data showed a staggering 13.4 million plus minutes streamed for his music on the #1 streaming platform.\n\nWith 2018 only just begun, it's already becoming a powerhouse year for Somna with a new single on Armada's Captivating label as well as hitting the landmark 1 million streams for his single \"Look Back\" on Spotify!\n\nAs the label manager, A&R and co-owner of AVA Recordings, Somna continues to make strides while playing an important role within the scene. His monthly radio show entitled \u201cReanimate Music\u201d broadcasts every second Monday on Afterhours.fm, the #1 trance radio station in the world. The coming year looks nothing short of bright for Somna with forthcoming releases scheduled on Armada Captivating, AVA Recordings and he is delighted to share a plethora of new music with fans in 2018.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "150 Dunellen Avenue, Dunellen, NJ", "Artist": "Sarah Capeles Music Ministry ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10104551.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.462292, 40.595181], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Dunellen Spanish Church", "moreBioInfo": "Basada en New Jersey, Sarah Capeles es una cantante cristiana internacional dedicada a pregonar el evangelio a trav\u00e9s del canto.\n\nSarah Capeles naci\u00f3 en Puerto Rico y vino a los Estados Unidos a la edad de 6 a\u00f1os.

His quadruple-threat reputation as a singer, guitarist, songwriter and performer is unrivaled there, as recognized by the New England Music Awards for Album of the Year, Male Performer of the Year, and Live Act of The Year he has stashed somewhere in his Connecticut home.\n\nOf course, musically tuned-in folks throughout the world have been hearing reports of Viele\u2019s prowess for several years. No Depression might have piqued their curiosity with its praise for his \u201cvivid storytelling.\u201d Or maybe they read about his singing in The Alternate Root, which observed that his \u201cstreet growl\u201d could rivet passersby. Howl Magazine even called his shows \u201ctranscendent\u201d and predicted that his music \u201cwill rattle your bones and penetrate to the core.\u201d\n\nTruth be told, audiences around the country have begun taking notice as Viele plays in further-flung venues. Since his first album, Fall Your Way, dropped in 2015, he\u2019s been called to open for Will Hoge, Blues Traveler, Lee DeWyze, Zach Myers of Shinedown, The Marshall Tucker Band, and in his somewhat wonderstruck words, \u201cartists who have been on my personal playlists for years.\u201d\n\nSo all the pieces are in place to establish Frank Viele as a musical phenomenon far beyond his home base. All that\u2019s needed is a spark to launch this rocket.\n\nThat\u2019s where What\u2019s His Name? comes in; a tour de force of passion, candor and craft. His singing is unforgettable \u2014 rough-edged yet nuanced, straddling that line where poetic interpretation and raw emotion meet. The impressions he made during his early gigs broaden on What\u2019s His Name?. Rugged Americana, deep blues and gut-wrenching soul create a potent new brew on \u201cCigarettes, Throwing Stones, & Lies.\u201d Unlikely elements \u2014 a gentle groove kissed by congas, a milky bass tone and wind chimes \u2014 caress Viele\u2019s anguished romanticism on \u201cIf You Could Only Read My Mind.\u201d Those same sentiments take on an even sharper edge when lashed with earthy like guitar and stirred by churchy harmonies on \u201cTill The Bourbon\u2019s All Gone.\u201d The sting of betrayal turns up the heat even more over a thumping funk groove on the title cut. And one track, \u201cPomegranate,\u201d stands out from anything Viele has done before, thanks to the six strings that augment the reflective lyric, courtesy of arranger/cellist Dave Eggar (Ray Lamontagne/Coldplay/Pearl Jam).\n\nViele had been dividing his schedule between performing, writing and recording on nights and vacation time, which he paid for with a full-time day job. He was fully qualified for both, having graduated as valedictorian from the business school at Marist College, where he minored in music and earned the prestigious Wall Street Journal Award.\n\nMusic, though, was always his destiny. \u201cI grew up working in my family\u2019s restaurant,\u201d he remembers. \u201cInstead of typical chores I would peel carrots and potatoes and wash dishes during the week.There were three pool tables that took quarters, so it was also my job to count the quarters on Saturday mornings. I got to keep one of them when I was done, but I always put that quarter into this old jukebox at the restaurant so I could play Billy Joel\u2019s \u2018The Longest Time.\u2019 To this day, when I hear that song, I can still smell that dank, stale bar smell that comes with the mess from the busy night before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d he adds, \u201cis how I learned what music can do to you.\u201d\n\nHe started playing gigs as the leader of Frank Viele & The Manhattan Project, which sported a horn section and a sizzling mix of soul and jam grooves. With Fall Your Way he switched to working solo, cutting the basics of each song on guitar and then adding instruments one by one, crafting the band around each song.\n\nNow, on What\u2019s His Name?, Frank has taken his experience on the road as a solo artist over the last few years into the studio and you can hear pieces of this artistic journey woven throughout this new collection of songs.\n\n\u201cI wrote most of these songs as I was traveling from gig to gig, in parts of the country I\u2019d never seen before. What I experienced helped feed different elements into my music. I had the honor and pleasure of touring with great songwriters like Zach Myers, who exposed me to a lot of new ideas and approaches to the art of the song. I wrote specifically with the idea of making each song more memorable.\u201d\n\nViele accomplishes his mission on What\u2019s His Name?. Some of the credit goes to the guest artists he welcomed onboard, including Christine Ohlman, lead singer with the Saturday Night Live band who\u2019s also shared the stage with Bruce Springsteen, Brian Wilson, Elvis Costello, Dion and other rock luminaries.

The right vocalist can make you fall in love at first listen, elicit tears, or bring you back to a different era altogether. A microphone and a stage remain the only necessities. That holds true for New York-based singer and songwriter Morgan James. On her full-length debut for Epic Records, Hunter, she casts an unbreakable spell with a powerhouse voice equally inspired by smoky soul, swaggering R&B, theatrical swing, and a virtuosic classical poise.\n\nThe Idaho native discovered her passion for music early on and pursued it\nwholeheartedly at the prestigious Juilliard School. While in the midst of the institution's rigorous academic program, she soon realized that her path would diverge from the classical world. \"I didn't want a career in opera, but Juilliard still shaped me,\" she confesses. \"The traditional training really made me a disciplined singer. I carry that with me to this day.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Morgan spent the next few years facing the proverbial struggles of being a young artist in New York. Low on money, she bounced back and forth between bartending and restaurant gigs while fighting to survive. Immersed in classic sixties and seventies soul records, she concurrently experienced a pivotal revelation. \"Out of that frustration came this other voice,\" she says. \"It was my true voice, and I feel like I discovered it in the middle of so much hardship just trying to be heard. I embraced who I was at that very moment.\"\n\nSoon, she would be heard in a big way. In 2008, Morgan booked her first Broadway show\u2014appearing in The Addams Family alongside Nathan Lane, as well as in prominent and leading roles in Wonderland, Godspell (Turn Back, O Man), and Berry Gordy's Motown The Musical as Teena Marie. The latter set the stage for her to\nproperly launch her solo career. Gordy recognized the vocalist's immense talent, and introduced her to Doug Morris and L.A. Reid, opening the door for a deal with Epic Records in 2012.\n\nAround the same time, Morgan booked a landmark show at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, where she paid tribute to Nina Simone with a set of songs that were closely associated with the legendary artist. The incendiary show was recorded and released as the critically acclaimed Morgan James Live on Epic Records. It also proved to be the perfect segue for her first studio album, released in June of 2014.\n\n\"I always knew to make a neo-soul pop record,\" Morgan says. \"The foundation is all real ingredients, and those roots of soul and R&B are pretty strong. It's the culmination of my musical life up to this point. The painful songs are straight out of a bad relationship with someone from my past. The joyful moments are wonderful memories. It's all coming from me. I've lived every one of these stories, and I love the genres I'm representing. It's one point-of-view\u2014mine.\"\n\nThe title track and album opener \"Hunter\" boasts a seductive hook with cinematic noir flair. Flaunting the singer's immense delivery and dynamic presence, it's an undeniable and classy come-on that proves as animalistic as it does magnetic. \"From a woman's perspective, it's such an empowering and sexy song,\" she smiles. \"It totally makes me feel like a warrior! Music is so sensual and life-affirming. That's what I look for. You don't often see a girl take this position, and that's what I love about it!\"\n\nMorgan assumed co-writing duties on eight of the collection's fourteen tracks and even performed all of her own background vocals and harmonies. From the empowering farewell of \"Fed Up On You\" to the mournful rumination of \"You Never Lied\", she continually bares it all\u2014both emotionally and musically. \"I sing like I'm never going to sing ever again,\" Morgan affirms. \"I wanted to capture that power and passion every time. At some moments, it might sound flawless; at others, it might sound like it's going to break. I'm revealing something about myself with\nevery song. You've got to do that. My favorite artists, whether Joni Mitchell or Michael Jackson, are and were, always honest.\"\n\nThere's a unique structure to the album. The first five songs boast electronic elements, while the last six don't have any. \"There's a gradient of the record that goes down,\" she says. \"By the time you get to the last song, it's just piano and voice. It starts with a song about power and ego, and it ends on one about surrender and selflessness. I have all of that in me. Maybe we all do.\"\n\nUltimately, her honesty permeates everything that Morgan James does, and it's why you'll always remember her voice. \"I want people to walk away from this album feeling fulfilled. That's the way it used to be. Often, I think I'm from another time,\u201d she says, her voice trailing off. \u201cI just want to bring back the power of the singular legacy voice.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Kipani ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10030203.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "Indie Pop", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Kipani is the project of Tiffany Jhingoor- a songwriter currently living in Binghamton, New York.

Hailing from Red Bank, New Jersey, the group was founded by Dave Wyndorf (vocals and guitar), John McBain (guitar), Tom Diello (drums), and Tim Cronin (vocals and bass). The band first went under the name \"Dog of Mystery\" and later \"Airport 75\", before finally settling on \"Monster Magnet\".\n\nIn 1989, Monster Magnet released two demo cassettes; \"Forget About Life, I'm High on Dope\" and \"I'm Stoned, What Ya Gonna Do About It?\". The band's first 'official' release was a self-titled EP from Glitterhouse Records of Germany. In 1991 the band signed with Caroline Records and released their first full length album, the cult classic Spine of God, in 1991. The next release was a bizarre 4 song EP titled Tab which included, among two other marathon length songs, a 32 minute track called \"Tab...\". McBain was fired soon after, due to personality conflicts between himself and Dave Wyndorf. He was replaced by Atomic Bitchwax guitarist Ed Mundell; who holds the position to this day.\n\nThe year 1993 saw the release of the album Superjudge. While the album was released on major record label (A&M Records) and is considered a cult favorite among fans of the band's earlier work, the album did not sell very well. The follow-up, a more pop-influenced album, was Dopes to Infinity had a hit single in \"Negasonic Teenage Warhead\" but still did only slightly better than Superjudge. Wyndorf moved to Las Vegas, Nevada in order to begin working on Powertrip (1998), a breakthrough hit that earned a gold certification. Powertrip saw the band departing from its usual lo-fi, stoner rock fare, and enter into an era with more guitar and heavier drum beats. Guitarist Phil Cavaino joined the band in 1998. \"Space Lord\", the first single, was a major radio hit and the band went on tour with bands like Aerosmith, Metallica and Marilyn Manson. Their last album on A&M Records was God Says No (2000). After this release, Joe Calandra and Jon Kleiman departed the band due to internal conflicts with Wyndorf, and were replaced by Jim Baglino and Bob Pantella respectively. In 2003, Monster Magnet signed to the European label SPV, and in early 2004 released Monolithic Baby! throughout Europe. The U.S. release followed in May on SPV America. In March 2005 Phil Cavaino departed after 7 years service in a split described as amicable by Wyndorf. A followup to Monolithic Baby! was expected in March 2006 to coincide with their European Tour, along with rereleases of Spine of God and Tab, both featuring new artwork and liner notes, however the tour and album release did not go ahead. A DVD is also planned for late 2006.\n\nOn February 27, 2006 Dave Wyndorf overdosed on prescription drugs. His management released the following statement\n\n\"The battle with one\u2019s inner demons is the most personal fight any of us can undertake. The fight is at times a lonely, confusing journey. On the evening of February 27, Dave Wyndorf suffered a set back in his own fight and was hospitalized due to a drug overdose. His full recovery is expected. We ask that all those he has encountered over the years or simply affected by his music to take a moment to think good thoughts of and for him. With the grace of God and those who love him we are all confident that Dave will rebound from this set back and continue to play and make great rock and roll.\"\n\nMonster Magnet's style and material are heavily influenced by 1970s-era space rock bands such as Hawkwind and Captain Beyond. In addition to arranging covers such as Hawkwind's \"Brainstorm\" (Doremi Fasol Latido, 1972), Wyndorf sometimes incorporates elements of space rock staples into his own songs. For instance, the Dopes to Infinity title track borrows some of its lyrics from \"Lord of Light\" (ibid.), and Superjudge's \"Twin Earth\" is a reinterpretation of Captain Beyond's \"Mesmerization Eclipse\" (Captain Beyond, 1972). Monster Magnet's live shows occasionally feature Stacia-esque nude dancers, a fact which has landed them in trouble with the law in some American cities.", "otherInfo": "Monster Magnet"}, {"Address": "45 Main St, Stanhope, NJ 07874", "Artist": "Manticore - a Tribute to ELP ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8728329.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.7085, 40.90277], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "Progressive Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "The Stanhope House", "moreBioInfo": "Rob Shepard - Keys\nBorn a poor sharecropper\u2019s son in the wilds of deepest, darkest Brooklyn, Rob currently resides in lovely, lyrical, Lynbrook, Long Island. A piano student from age 4, Rob has played in many bands (and types of bands) in his 58 odd years. He\u2019s played in innumerable cover bands doing classic rock, funk, R&B & blues. His avocations, however, have always been toward prog & fusion. In recent years, he\u2019s formed several groups, most notably, Morse Code & AfterLife. Morse Code played small venues doing the best of the Dixie Dregs & Steve Morse, King Crimson, Return to Forever, Flash and post-PG Genesis. AfterLife focused on ELP, Yes, Genesis, Rush, Kansas, Saga & UK and was playing small theaters before disbanding in 2008. Rob joined & played with Rael - the Music of Genesis in 2014 recreating the keyboard artistry of Tony Banks. He was with Rael for 3 1/2 years, but after the tragic passing of Keith Emerson & Greg Lake in 2016, Rob felt the need to pay homage to the brilliant legacy of the musical phenomenon, Emerson, Lake & Palmer.\nRob uses a Yamaha S-80, Yamaha S-30 and an Alesis Micron.\n\nGlenn Dove - Percussion\nFrom the moment he struck his first toy drum at age 3, Glenn Dove became obsessed with music. Over 50 years of drumming later, Glenn is a seasoned player with an extensive and prolific music career. Hailing from Queens, NY, Glenn's professional work in the music business began with the popular Long Island rock group, B.B. \"N\" Stars, from 1976-78.\nIn 1978, Glenn joined Ram Jam, known for their internationally-acclaimed hit \"Black Betty\" as well as their Gold-Selling LPs, \"Ram Jam\" and \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Ram,\" on Epic Records. With Ram Jam, Glenn toured the nation playing theaters and arenas while also connecting with the musicians and producers (the quintessential bubblegum-era duo, Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz) who would go on to form Speedway Blvd in 1980.\nSpeedway Blvd released a self-titled LP on Epic Records, which musically consisted of a blend between AOR, new wave, and progressive rock styles. As drummer and a founding member of Speedway Blvd, Glenn worked alongside Dennis Feldman (who worked with Glenn previously in Ram Jam, and would go on to play bass for Balance) and Jordan Ruddess (who would go on to be an iconic member of the pioneering prog-metal act Dream Theater, as well as Liquid Tension Experiment, the Ruddess/Morgenstein Project, and the Dixie Dregs, among others).\nDuring the mid- to late-80's, Glenn explored projects within the evolving new wave genre. In 1984, he founded The Rebekka Frame along with Nicky Garratt (the U.K. Subs) and Perry Michaels, which released an LP, \"Haystacks,\" on Revolver/EMI in 1986. From 1987-89 he played with the new wave group Return to Zero.\nFrom the mid-90's to the present day, Glenn has focused mostly on studio sessions, club-date work, and tribute-band gigs around New York and the Tri-State Area. This notably included AFTERLIFE, a Long Island-based Prog Rock tribute show from 2005-08, and currently includes The Breakfast Club, an 80's Dance cover group that regularly plays around Long Island and the boroughs.\n\nBob Trewhella - Vocals & guitar\nWhen first I arrived on this planet, I was lost, confused, and disoriented. I stumbled through fields, streams, and forests, searching for signs of remotely intelligent life. I stumbled upon a filling station in a rural area, and heard the dulcet tones of Greg Lake's voice singing \"Lucky Man\" emanating from the car speaker of a '61 Studebaker. I new at that moment that I had to continue to bring that brilliance to this world.\nI also like Chinese cold sesame noodles, long walks on a beach, and thunderstorms. My favorite color is blue.\n\nEd Wenzel - Bass\nEd\u2019s love affair with music began at an early age. At 17, his band Albion was discovered by the management of the Fillmore East. This in turn lead to interest from Mercury Records, recording in their Manhattan studios. It also opened the door to great opportunities to see & absorb many other types of music.\nSoon after, Ed went on to form the band Flyer with Cyndi Lauper. They played together for many years & are still friends, as noted in her bestselling book: A Memoir.\nFollowing Flyer, Ed joined Elmo Duncan, playing the after-show parties for Saturday Night Live. He has since played and shared the stage with many world renowned artists such as Mark Farner, Charlie Daniels, Alvin Lee, Roger Earl (Foghat), Hermans Hermits, Andrew Carillo (Joan Osborn), Eliot Lewis (Hall and Oates), Frank Carillo (Peter Frampton) and Golden Earring.\nHe\u2019s currently a member of The Red, White and Blues Band. A well respected, recording blues band with several CD\u2019s to their credit & a reputation allowing them to open for ZZ Top at the Nikon Theater at Jones Beach in 2016.\nIn addition, Ed\u2019s close friendship with noted rock photographer John Belissimo allowed him to be up front or back stage with many famous rock bands, most notably ELP, who left an indelible impression on him.\nSo it is with great pleasure that Ed joins Manticore - a Tribute to ELP and looks forward to seeing many many of you at upcoming shows!!!", "otherInfo": "Manticore will be gracing the stage of the historic Stanhope House, recognized as The Last Great American Roadhouse, for the first time.

Its 11 songs showcase Caudle\u2019s vivid lyrics and foreboding vocals, as well as the work of an A-list cast of musicians. John Jackson of the Jayhawks produced, and guest vocalists include Courtney Marie Andrews, Elizabeth Cook, Gary Louris, and John Paul White.\n\nA large sound emerged from the little cabin, which Johnny Cash built in 1979 as a private sanctuary near his home outside Nashville. It evolved into a recording studio more than a decade later. Since then the rustic structure has hosted sessions by everyone from Loretta Lynn and Emmylou Harris to Jamey Johnson and Todd Snider, as well as Cash\u2019s own work on his acclaimed series of American Recordings. Caudle and Jackson used the space to create a dramatic, compelling record.\n\n\u201cNone of us wore headphones,\u201d Caudle says. \u201cIt was just like we were doing it for the love of music \u2013 it didn\u2019t feel like we were making a record. It felt like I was playing with an incredible group of musicians and making art.\u201d\n\nThat group of musicians on Better Hurry Up includes Mickey Raphael on harmonica (Willie Nelson), Dennis Crouch on bass (Elton John, Leon Russell), Fred Eltringham on drums (Willie Nelson, Sheryl Crow), Russ Pahl on pedal steel (Kacey Musgraves, Dan Auerbach), Laur Joamets on guitar (Sturgill Simpson, Drivin\u2019 N Cryin\u2019), and, on keyboards, Pat Sansone (Wilco) and Rhett Huffman (American Aquarium).

The sound suits the songs, which Caudle wrote after immersing himself in the vintage roots-funk of Leon Russell, J.J. Cale, Dr. John, the Band, and Little Feat. Crouch\u2019s bass work helps establish the new album\u2019s deep grooves. \u201cI thought the bass lines were really important,\u201d Caudle says. \u201cI wanted them to push the songs along, move them in a different way. Dennis had played with Leon and Elton, and I knew that he knew what I was talking about.\u201d\n\nOn Better Hurry Up, Caudle worked with a cowriter for the first time in 2019, teaming up with Natalie Hemby of the Highwomen to write \u201cRegular Riot.\u201d \u201cI got the title from an episode of \u2018The Honeymooners\u2019 I remember watching as a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from a place of self-awareness.

The amount of destruction you can leave behind from simple actions just really struck me.\u201d\n\nOne track has already emerged from Caudle\u2019s Cash Cabin sessions: a cover of the Hank Williams classic \u201cHowlin\u2019 at the Moon.\u201d Rolling Stone Country named it \u201cOne of the 10 Best Country and Americana Songs to Hear Now\u201d upon its release in August 2019, saying \u201cbacked by harmonica ace Mickey Raphael and outlaw country queen Elizabeth Cook, Caleb Caudle revives an old Hank Williams song from 1951, slowing down the tempo to a funky strut and replacing the original\u2019s emphasis on pedal steel guitar with plenty of honking harp.\u201d\n\nBetter Hurry Up follows Caudle\u2019s celebrated 2018 album Crushed Coins. Ann Powers selected that record\u2019s \u201cEmpty Arms\u201d as one of NPR Music\u2019s \u201cSongs We Love,\u201d saying \u201cCaleb Caudle\u2019s sound encompasses the wide expanse of America, as the best country rock always will.\u201d In a review of Crushed Coins for PopMatters, writer Jeff Strowe said \u201cCaudle has recorded an album\u2019s worth of songs that continue to grow in the soul upon each repeated listen.\u201d\n\nWorking at the Cash Cabin in 2019 marked another milestone on Caudle\u2019s musical journey. Besides its rich legacy, the studio had the advantage of being close to home for Caudle: He and Lauren Caudle, his wife and manager, moved to Nashville from their native North Carolina in early 2019. Caudle was raised in the countryside outside Winston-Salem, where both of his parents primed tobacco as young people.\n\n\u201cI grew up in the foothills of the Appalachians, specifically the Sauratown Mountains of Stokes County, North Carolina,\u201d Caudle says. \u201cI spent a lot of time wandering around in the woods making up songs. Sometimes my mom would find my scribblings on the napkins in the pockets of my jeans when she would do laundry.\u201d\n\nHis art teacher in high school, Phil Jones, helped fuel Caudle\u2019s passion for music: \u201cHe allowed me to bring my guitar to class to practice my instrument while the others worked on various pieces of visual art. That class always felt like my sanctuary. It was the most important part of my day. He turned me on to Bob Dylan, whose rawness struck me. He was singing about things that I often thought about but never mentioned. Things like the ways people were struggling and how to react to that, and the ability within ourselves to break cycles.\u201d\n\nCaudle moved to Winston-Salem, got a job in a pizza joint, and started playing around town. His father, a Marine veteran and truck driver, set an example for the kind of life Caudle would lead as a working musician. \u201cI think that really shaped the way I felt about hard work and constant travel,\u201d Caudle says. \u201cIt\u2019s always seemed so normal to me.\u201d\n\nHe gradually expanded his horizons to clubs across the Southeast, all the while learning as much as he could about the music he loved. \u201cI found myself spending hours and hours devouring records and music biographies in my free time,\u201d Caudle says. \u201cI wanted to know where all of the music I loved came from. I needed to know how it was all connected. Genre started to matter less and less to me. I only cared about sincerity. I knew it when I heard it.\u201d\n\nHis musical explorations took him to New Orleans, which enhanced his love for a good groove. \u201cI love good music and good food and I figured they got plenty of both,\u201d Caudle says. \u201cThe rhythm of that city gets deep into you. I started learning how the groove of the song is often as important as the message. You gotta get their minds thinking and their toes tapping.\u201d Unfortunately, living in the Big Easy also encouraged excessive behavior: \u201cI had been drinking for a while at that point, but life on the road really took my weakness and exploited it.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Caudle stopped drinking and returned home to North Carolina. There he met Lauren, and their relationship inspired the songs on Caudle\u2019s 2016 album Carolina Ghost. \u201cI just remember thinking she saved me,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do any of this without her.\u201d Lauren joined him on the road not long afterward. \u201cIt was the best decision we\u2019ve ever made,\u201d Caudle says. \u201cBeing gone for months on end isn\u2019t as bad when you\u2019re together.\u201d\n\nThe Cash Cabin sessions started three days after the couple moved to Music City. Caudle\u2019s parents drove out from North Carolina as the sessions were winding down, and Lauren brought them to the studio on the last day. \u201cI surprised them by letting them know they were all gonna be singing with me on the title track,\u201d Caudle says.\n\nThe song\u2019s message made it an easy choice to be the album\u2019s title track. Caudle calls the song \u201ca call to arms about realizing your purpose and knowing fear of failure doesn\u2019t have a place at the table.\u201d His loved ones joined him to sing, \u201cThe time is running out, so you better hurry up.\u201d \u201cAll of us grew up singing in church, so I felt like they would do a great job on the \u2018Better Hurry Up\u2019 chorus,\u201d Caudle says. \u201cIt felt like a big family singalong. It felt empowering.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Caleb Caudle wanted a down-home, funky sound for his new album. He assembled several Grammy-winning musicians to chase it down in the Cash Cabin, built by Johnny Cash in 1979, a small place with a big history. \u201cIt feels like you\u2019re in the shadow of giants,\u201d Caudle says. He emerged from the shadows with Better Hurry Up. Caudle and producer, John Jackson, used the space to create a dramatic, compelling record. \u201cNone of us wore headphones,\u201d Caudle says. \u201cIt just like we were doing it for the love of music \u2013 it didn\u2019t feel like we were making a record. It felt like I was playing with an incredible group of musicians and making art.\u201d The sound suits the songs, which Caudle wrote after immersing himself in the vintage roots-funk of Leon Russell, J.J. Cale, Dr. John, The Band, and Little Feat.\n\nCaudle's critically acclaimed catalog includes features on Rolling Stone\u2019s \u201c10 New Country Artists You Need To Know\u201d and \u201cThe 10 Best Country and Americana Songs To Hear Now\u201d along with NPR\u2019s \u201cSongs We Love\u201d.

He also released several songs on his own and he has hit #1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart twice. In 1997, he spent a week at the top spot with \"Give It Up\".\n\nVictor returned to #1 twice in 2001 on both April 28 then again on May 5, with \"Are You Satisfied?\" featuring vocals by Deborah Cooper .\n\nHe has also collaborated with other house music producers, one of the most notable including Peter Rauhofer, the first Grammy Award winner in the Dance Music category. Known as \"The Collaboration\" they released a popular multi CD set and several hit single tracks.\n\nContents\n1 Discography\n1.1 Select Remixes\n2 See also\n3 External links\n\n\n\nDiscography;\n\nSelect Remixes;\nAmerican Pie - Madonna\nBeautiful Stranger - Madonna\nDon't Tell Me - Madonna\nFrozen - Madonna\nHollywood - Madonna\nNaughty Girl - Beyonc\u00e9\nPrecious - Depeche Mode\nPush It - Garbage\nRay of Light - Madonna\nStrict Machine - Goldfrapp\nSurvivor - Destiny's Child\n\n\n\u201cIf a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.\u201d\n- Henry David Thoreau\n\n\nThe multi-talented master of musical manipulation has helped redefine the role of the American DJ in recent years, and, in the process, has amassed an impressive array of artistic accomplishments. Equally adept both in the studio and in front of live audiences, Victor is a veritable virtuoso who has inspired, enthralled and entertained legions of sonic savvy devotees around the world. His expertise and imagination transcend conventional expectations allowing him to effortlessly bridge the gap between multiple genres of music and generations of listeners.\n\nIntroduced to New York nightlife at the impressionable age of 15 by his older brother Cesar, Victor quickly developed an intense passion for dance music that would form the foundation for the Brooklyn native\u2019s remarkable career. His first taste of success came less than a decade later when Sire Records\u2019 Seymour Stein signed Program Two, Victor\u2019s techno production partnership, to a record deal in 1991. The relationship fizzled after just one album, though, prompting Victor to reevaluate his musical future.\n\nAfter a self-imposed hiatus during which Victor explored non-musical business ventures, he found his way back to the beat in 1996 when Athena, the woman who would eventually become his wife, encouraged him to return to the studio to create his first solo record, \u201cGive It Up.\u201d This signature hard-house anthem and its explosive follow-up, \u201cBeat Me Harder,\u201d both topped the Billboard dance charts, unleashing the meteoric Calderone phenomenon. Further inspired by New York\u2019s then-thriving club scene, Victor landed gigs spinning at high-profile parties on Fire Island and at legendary NYC nightclubs Limelight and Life, eventually leading to career-defining residencies at both Roxy in New York and Liquid in Miami. Then, just when he thought things couldn\u2019t get any better, Madonna called in 1998 and asked, \u201cSo, do you want to remix my first single? Intrigued by Victor\u2019s innovative musical vision and sophisticated style, Madonna bestowed upon him the ultimate compliment \u2013 the opportunity to remix, \u201cFrozen,\u201d the lead single from her acclaimed \u201cRay of Light\u201d album. \u201cShe, as an artist, understands better than anybody the need to just let people do their thing, and that\u2019s the way she\u2019s worked with me,\u201d Victor proudly explains. \u201cShe just sends me the vocal and she doesn\u2019t give me any guidelines. She just tells me to do my thing.\u201d Victor has since remixed nine other records for Madonna and has established an unprecedented professional and personal rapport with the Grammy-award winning artist.\n\n\n\u201cVictor Calderone is immensely talented and quite amazing. He never fails to come up with fresh ideas. I love his work and I love working with him.\u201d\n- Madonna\n\nThe success Victor achieved through his work with Madonna ultimately led to remix projects for some of the world\u2019s top recording artists, including Sting, Gloria Estefan, Bette Midler, Ricky Martin, Elton John, Destiny\u2019s Child, Cyndi Lauper, k.d.\u2020lang, Information Society. Many of these records reached the top of Billboard\u2019s dance charts courtesy of Victor\u2019s unique remixing talents.\n\nStanding out among the many highlights of his extraordinary career is Victor\u2019s experience working with Sting. Acting on Madonna\u2019s recommendation that he ask Victor to remix \u201cDesert Rose,\u201d the second single from his 1999 \u201cBrand New Day\u201d album, the British rocker not only called Victor to remix the record (something he had never done before with his music), but even went into the studio with him to re-record the vocals to match the remixed song\u2019s new dance-oriented rhythm. The song spent an impressive 80 weeks on the Billboard dance charts including nine consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart.\n\n\n\u201cVictor Calderone is highly energetic and his musical contribution helped introduce \u2018Desert Rose\u2019 to an entirely new audience. I look forward to working with him again.\u201d\n- Sting\n\nFew DJs or producers have achieved the level of success that Victor has so diligently earned, and membership in this elite club definitely has its privileges. Spared from the stress of pounding the pavement in search of work and the proverbial first big break, Victor now enjoys the luxury of carefully choosing each new project from a multitude of exciting offers. This rare creative freedom has also encouraged him to create more of his own original material. Following the success of 1999\u2019s \u201cDo It Properly,\u201d a joint venture with Grammy-winning remixer Peter Rauhofer, featuring C&C Music Factory vocalist Deborah Cooper, Victor once again enlisted Cooper\u2019s dynamic talents in 2001 to record the #1 Billboard mega-hit \u201cAre You Satisfied,\u201d a record he both co-wrote and produced.\n\nWhile it is nearly impossible to capture the essence of a live performance on a 74-minute CD, compilations do allow DJs to portray the music of the moment in a practical format that can reach even the most remote listeners. As part of a multi-record deal with Tommy Boy Music, Victor released his first beatmix CD, \u201cE=VC2,\u201d in 1999. Volume 2 followed in 2001 with sales and popularity of both compilations far exceeding all expectations. A third installment is forthcoming that promises to be darker and more progressive than its predecessors.\n\nVictor\u2019s studio work may have jump-started his career, but it\u2019s his live performances that truly showcase his boundless energy and mastery of the turntables. \u201cDJing is a major release for me; it\u2019s something I need in my life,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt goes hand-in-hand with the production work and the studio work. If you\u2019re going to be producing dance music, you\u2019ve got to be out there playing it and be in the clubs, so it\u2019s very important to me.\u201d\n\nVictor also understands and appreciates the importance of continually evolving as an artist. While he still enjoys remixing and playing select mainstream records, audiences will notice a distinct difference during his future live sets. Relying less on the diva house vocal anthems that dominated many of his past performances, Victor has reinvented his musical style and will now treat listeners to an edgier and more progressive sound. He will also focus on producing more original underground tracks to compliment his latest transformation.\n\nShortly after leaving his three-and-a-half year residency at Roxy in May of 2001 to explore other creative avenues, Victor staged his most ambitious spectacular to date. Dubbed \u201cCaligula: A Roman Orgy\u201d and presented during Gay Pride Weekend in New York City, this massive dance party was held at the Hammerstein Ballroom and featured, among others, performances by Cyndi Lauper, Deborah Cooper and a 50-piece orchestra that played Brainbug\u2019s \u201cNightmare\u201d and Tim Rex\u2019s \u201cRelentless\u201d live for 5,000 appreciative fans. Caligula boldly raised the bar for future events and will now be held annually the last weekend of June.\n\nVictor expanded his r\u00c8sum\u00c8 in 2001 with bimonthly residencies at Stereo in Montreal, Canada and Tribal Sessions in Manchester, England. He also traveled overseas for performances at TLV in Tel Aviv, Israel, Cuvo Paradiso in Mykonos, Greece and L\u2019Enser in Paris, France. He has also arranged the music for the past several Dolce & Gabbana runway fashion shows in Milan, Italy. At home in the United States, Victor spins monthly at Crobar in Miami\u2019s South Beach, occasionally travels for special events around the country and is patiently waiting for the right opportunity to resume a residency in New York City.\n\nDespite his many professional accomplishments, Victor still has some dreams to fulfill, particularly his desire to work on motion picture soundtracks. He is also currently working in the studio with a female vocalist he recently discovered to help develop her burgeoning career while further exploring the down-tempo side of electronic music. Victor\u2019s Sensory Mix of Madonna\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Tell Me\u201d and his Calderone & Quayle Dark Side Mix of \u201cWhat It Feels Like For A Girl,\u201d both experiments in ambient electronica, garnered critical acclaim and impressed Madonna so much that she featured his version of the latter song on her Drowned World Tour.\n\nBecause his talent is so prominent, it is easy to forget that Victor Calderone\u2019s career achievements are also the result of his true spirit of determination, as well as his dedication to perfection and persistence in an ultra-competitive industry. His many years of hard work and monumental success are only overshadowed by his sincerity, modesty, unwavering commitment to his craft and fierce devotion to his countless fans. A profoundly influential and inspirational talent, Victor has entertained millions of people, generously donated to charitable causes and earned the utmost respect of his peers, all while boldly pushing the universal limits of originality and ingenuity.\n\nDuring an earlier interview, Victor summed up his prolific career perfectly when he modestly proclaimed, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the audience and the fans, I wouldn\u2019t exist, so I wouldn\u2019t have any right coming off to anybody like I\u2019m anything special. I\u2019m very grateful for all the support and everything that\u2019s been going on in my life. It\u2019s been amazing and I\u2019m very happy.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Written by Matt Kalkhoff\n\nRemix Credits;\n\nTitle's;\n\nReflections\nBedtime Story\nLow Frequency\nLola's Theme\nThird Dimention\nStrict Machine\nNaughty Girl\nThis Beat Is\nSend your love\nHollywood\nDie Another Day\nRain\nFeeling You\nWork It Out\nSoak Up The Sun\nInsatiable\nAlive\nBring It\nEmotions\nKeep Control\nRunaway Lover\nShine\nRunning\nSurvivor\nBeautiful\nWhat It Feels Like\nFor The Music\nDon\u2019t Tell Me\nIndependent Woman\nMusic\nShackles\nDon\u2019t Want Another Man\nSummer Fling\nAmerican Pie\nFunkin for\nDesert Rose\nYour Eyes\nIf I Want\nBeautiful Stranger\nUnique\nRhythm Is My Bitch\nMetaforce\nJoy and Pain\nWritten in the Stars\nAlright\nAlways You\nPor Ariba Por Abajo\nCubik\nI\u2019m Beautiful\nTell Me\nSky Fits Heaven\nMagalenha\nHoly Waters\nCleopatra Theme\nPush It\nHoplessly Devoted\nRay of Light\nHeavens What I Feel\nHappy\nFrozen\nDance With Me\nKick Up The Volume\nMighty Real\nIt\u2019s Over\nNever Gonna Fall\nIt\u2019s My Time\nGive Me Love\nSky\u2019s The Limit\nK Hole\nMe Confund\nA DJ Saved My Life\nTic Tic Tac\nMake Sweet Music\nHorizons\nTake Control\nBostich\n20,000 HMC\nThere Is No Law\nOolaa\nChime\n\n\nArtist's;\n\nThat Kid Chris\nMadonna\nChus & Ceballos\nShapeshifters\nD-Formation\nGoldfrapp\nBeyoncy Knowles\nSuperchumbo\nSting\nMadonna\nMadonna\nAstrid\nSolange\nBeyonc\u00e9\nSheryl Crow\nDarren Hayes\nKevin Aviance\nSoluna\nDestiny's Child\nSono\nMadonna\nCyndi Lauper\nInformation Society\nDestiny's Child\nMandalay\nMadonna\nColourful Karma\nMadonna\nDestiny's Child\nMadonna\nMary Mary\nDynamix\nk.d. lang\nMadonna\nTowa-Tei\nSting\nElsie Muniz\nOne Plus One\nMadonna\nLisa Unique\nKevin Aviance\nArt of Noise\nM\u00f3a\nElton John\nClub 69\nJennifer Paige\nRicky Martin\n808 State\nBette Midler\nBillie Myers\nMadonna\nSergio Mendes\nAngelique\nCleopatra\nGarbage\nOlivia Newton-John\nMadonna\nGloria Estefan\nTowa Tei\nMadonna\nRon Perkov\nRob Tissera\nByron Stingily\nDollshead\nLisa Stansfield\nSouvlaki\nAlcatraz\nMac Vibe\nSizequeen\nFactor X\nBlacknuss\nCarrapicho\nConnie Harvey\nLakota Hoskila\nBG Prince of rap\nYellow\nMessiah\nMessiah\nOrbital\nOrbital\n\nRecord Label's;\n\n-\nMaverick\nStereo_Productions\nPositiva\nBeatfreak\nMute\nColumbia\nTwisted\nInterscope\nMaverick\nMaverick\nStatrax\nColumbia\nColumbia\nInterscope\nColumbia\nWave\nDreamworks\nColumbia\nGroovilicious\nMaverick\nEdel\nTommy Boy\nColumbia\nV2\nMaverick\nDot Dot Dot\nMaverick\nColumbia\nMaverick\nColumbia\nStar 69\nWarner Brothers\nMaverick\nSony Japan\nInterscope\nInterscope\nElectra\nMaverick\nSony International\nWave\nZTT\nTommy Boy\nRocket Records\nTwisted\nHollywood\nSony International\nUniversal\nWarner Brothers\nUniversal\nMaverick\nEpic\nRed Ant\nMaverick\nAlmo\nPolygram\nMaverick\nEpic\nElectra\nMaverick\nArpee\nMCA\nNervous\nMCA\nArista\nWonder Boy\nAMPM\nEight Ball\nTwisted\nBMG International\nBMG International\nBMG\nEight Ball\nSony Germany\nEpic\nFFRR\nKickin\nKickin\nFFRR\nFFRR\n\n\nvictorcalderone.com/static/index.html\n\nprofile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=116346565\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Calderone", "otherInfo": "elrow RowsAttacks goes to New York!"}, {"Address": "1 US-46, Totowa, NJ 07512", "Artist": "George Lamond ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9065442.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.220482, 40.892463], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "Freestyle, Dance Pop, Salsa, Pop, Tropical", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Cubanelle Restaurant & Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "BAGMUSIC is a music imprint established by the joint collaboration of dance/pop producers and recording artist GEORGE LAMOND.", "otherInfo": "Freestyle night"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Branden & James ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10302115.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "James Clark, Branden James", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Your Living Room", "moreBioInfo": "Welcome to The Official Fan Page of BRANDEN & JAMES!", "otherInfo": "BRANDEN & JAMES bring you The Best Of Broadway right in the comfort of your own living room!

Their 2016 debut You\u2019re Dreaming, a stunning and transporting collection of original songs, earned high praise from Rolling Stone and Vice Noisey, tour stints with Kacey Musgraves and Lucius, and a perfectly cast performance on the third season of David Lynch\u2019s Twin Peaks. Now their unlikely rise continues with new album Easy Way, to be released on their own label Walkie Talkie Records.\n\nWhile many bands would have been content to stick with the winning formula of their debut, the Blossoms refused to repeat themselves.

Dan Auerbach, another artist who knows from bedrock influences, co-wrote two songs on the album. \u201cDan\u2019s love for songwriting was inspiring, just the kick in the pants we needed to start writing again after being on the road,\u201d says Page.\n\nThe brothers\u2019 decision to produce the new album themselves no doubt led to the new sound. \u201cWe wanted the freedom to experiment with our own weird ideas,\u201d says Jack, \u201cWe used to joke that the working title album should be Expensive Demos.\u201d As they crisscrossed the nation on tour, the brothers would stop through Alex Hall\u2019s Reliable Recorders studio in Chicago to chase the new sound they were after. The result joins together what would otherwise be distant corners of the American songbook. Both the traditional twang of Chicago pedal steel guitarist Joel Paterson (Devil in a Woodpile, The Western Elstons) and the primal wail of free jazz saxophonist Michael Lewis (Bon Iver, Andrew Bird) are at home on the album. Just as they did with their debut, the brothers found a voice all their own.", "otherInfo": "duo performance"}, {"Address": "1409 Queen Anne Rd, Teaneck, NJ 07666", "Artist": "Happy Hawthorne ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9818023.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.0048, 40.90166], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "Rock, Pop Punk, Alternative", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Debonair Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "We are Happy Hawthorne, the happiest band of them all.

Like sweat and perfume. Bourbon and salt water. Spanish moss on ruins. A product of her upbringing amidst the canopy of her Lowcountry family tree, Mary-Elaine carries herself as if she had never left the humidity of the coast. But she did. First Washington DC, then Spain, and now Brooklyn. Venturing far from home, time and space removed from her roots have further distilled Mary-Elaine\u2019s distinctly Southern charm.\n\nArriving in New York City in 2013, Mary-Elaine played in venues all over town and surrounded herself with a creative network that would eventually include producer / engineer Thom Beemer. Working together out of Good Child Music Studios, they were joined by Cat Popper (Ryan Adams), Lawson White (My Brightest Diamond, Tony Trischka), JJ Appleton, and Dave Hassell, to make a record as well traveled as it is rooted in the musical traditions of the Southern coast. Her debut album, Hold Still, was released in September 2018 via Good Child Music.\n\nPhoto by Paul Storey\n\nRUBY RAE\nNashville based Ruby Rae writes and performs music that defies easy categorization: a catalogue of influences would include Wanda Jackson, Mazzy Star, and Lori McKenna.

It\u2019s founders, Noah Giglio (Guitar/Vocals), brothers Mike (Bass) and John Hall (Saxophone), AJ Zienowicz (Drums) and Alex Fillimon (Cello) were all long-time high school friends in the late-00s. By the summer of 2009 they had formed the band and found a sound they wanted to pursue; a blend of 90\u2019s Pop/Rock with a contemporary commercial sound.\n\nIn 2010, Running Late recorded and released their debut self-titled EP, \u201cRunning Late\u201d. Shortly after wrapping up their post-release tour, the band replaced Zienowicz for Mark Spelker on Drums, and added Anthony Barretti on Lead Guitar. This new line-up spent the next couple of years writing and performing their new music. In 2014, the band recorded and released their first full length LP titled, \u201cBetter Late Than Never\u201d. Shortly after the release of the LP, guitarist Anthony Barretti left the band. Fortunately for them a friend of the band, Chris Ruzicka, stepped up just in time to play Lead Guitar for the upcoming shows.\n\nFollowing the release of their LP, Running Late got right back to work on their next EP titled, \u201cSummer Solstice\u201d, which was released in the summer of 2015. After a year of shows and tours, the band was ready to undergo a major revamping: dropping guitarist Chris Ruzicka, cellist Alex Fillimon, and replacing Mark Spelker for Pat Fruehling on Drums. The most notable change included the addition of Tessa Drake on lead vocals, while Noah Giglio took on the role of both Lead and Rhythm Guitar.\n\nThis marked a major change in Running Late\u2019s sound, which they boldly showed off on their EP, \u201cComfort vs. Quality\u201d, which was released in the Spring of 2017. However, the band never really found its footing with this line-up, and in early 2018 they replaced Pat Fruehling for Ori Yekutiel on Drums. That same winter, Running Late also replaced Tessa Drake for Lauren D\u2019Imperio on Lead Vocals.\n\nAfter the numerous line-up changes, the band took their time to find their sound and eventually recorded and released their single, \u201cRodeo\u201d, in the summer of 2018. Today, the band is still rooted in their original Neo-90s and Pop/Rock sound, and yet they continue to capture the imagination of thousands of people by performing it with a twist. Running Late\u2019s live shows are known for being very electric; filled with high-energy songs, as well as intimate moments. The band is best known for their original music, but they do like to throw in some crowd-pleasing cover songs from time to time.\n\nIn the spring of 2019, the band added Tre Davis on Keyboard; marking a return to form to a \u201cfull-band\u201d sound after stripping down their line-up in the mid to late 2010s. This year, Running Late is celebrating 10 years of writing, recording, and performing music. Some of the most notable moments for the band include: being selected for the Sony Emerging Artist Showcase (2012), performing alongside Creedence Clearwater Revival at Alive@Five Festival (2014). winning the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 Battle of the Band in Times Square, NYC (2015), headlining the after party for the Stone Pony Summer Stage (2016), and most recently opening for Lifehouse at the QuickChek Festival of Ballooning in 2018.\n\nMoving forward, Running Late has a long list of notable shows coming up (available on RunningLateMusic.com). The band plans to continue writing, recording and performing for many more years to come. In many ways this 10-year anniversary for the band is an affirmation of their commitment to a long-term project. With that, they have started working on their next full-length LP, which is expected for release in the winter of 2020.", "otherInfo": "Stitched in Blue at The Bowery Electric!"}, {"Address": "361 Metropolitan Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Dinah Jane ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9457180.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.955825, 40.714204], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Knitting Factory Brooklyn", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "370 New York Ave, Huntington, NY 11743", "Artist": "Young Nudy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9045229.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.425768, 40.869652], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "Rap", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "The Paramount", "moreBioInfo": "Young Nudy", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "5739 Albany Post Rd, Cortlandt, NY 10567", "Artist": "Kate Skwire and The Cut ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9915287.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.928199, 41.307925], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "Kingston, United States", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Redline Roadhouse", "moreBioInfo": "Kate Skwire fronts this Hudson Valley ensemble, connecting with audiences through her soulful voice, weaving a blend of blues, R&B, soul and rock into a repertoire of originals and stylized covers.

Price is best known as the lead singer and polymath behind the New England-based melancholic folk/pop band Winterpills, but his CV stretches far back into the late 80s and draws on minimalist/jagged art-rock, lo-fi pop, power pop, dance-noise, post-punk, and flowery brit-folk.\n\nPrice\u2019s early years in music were spent partly in collaboration with electronic musician Antony Widoff (who worked with David Bowie, U2, David Torn), a colleague from Bennington College. Price also performed live with Glenn Branca acolyte Jonathan Bepler (Music for Cremaster) while at Bennington and composed several instrumental pieces for dance performances.\n\nPost-Bennington, with Widoff, he formed the upstate NY art-rock quartet Memorial Garage (1986-1989). After recording 2 albums for SF-based Top Records and an unreleased 22 song live album, the band broke up in 1989.\n\nA short-lived collaboration with drummer Jerry Marotta (Elvis Costello, Peter Gabriel, Stevie Nicks), bassist Michael Nunziata and keyboardist Harvey Jones (Ellis Paul, Sara Lee) yielded the release of a 4-song EP titled Weatherless. Price then retreated into his home studio where over the next 6 years he self-released 8 albums of diverse and often devastatingly emotional and confessional rock.\n\nNow relocated to New Hampshire, in 1992, bassist and fan Max Germer (The Fawns, Gentle Hen) approached Price about forming a band based largely on this raw pop material, and The Maggies were born. The band endured several line-up changes, but between 1993 and 2002 released 8 albums and 2 EPs of loud, harmony-based inspired power pop and became regional stalwarts, signing to Jerry Harrison\u2019s short-lived label (GarageBand Records) though larger success eluded them.\n\nAfter The Maggies ended, Price released two more solo albums (13 Songs For Right Now in 2002, and Honey In The Chemicals in 2003, both on Brooklyn-based Listen Here! Records) and toured extensively behind them (with John Wesley Harding and others) until the Winterpills came together in late 2003 with Flora Reed, Dennis Crommett and Dave Hower. The band signed to Signature Sounds in 2004, have released 7 critically lauded albums and toured extensively. The band has made it onto MOJOs Top Ten lists and songs have been featured on many TV shows, including Showtime\u2019s Weeds, NBC\u2019s Grey\u2019s Anatomy as well as as several indie films.\n\nIn 2018, Philip released of a huge amount of this wide-ranging back-catalog material (12 albums total) in preparation for an all-new solo album in fall of 2019, his first solo outing since 2004.\n\nPrice also has collaborated with author Jonathan Lethem, indie rock\nlegend Walter Salas-Humara, and has been in two bands with Fountains of Wayne frontman Chris Collingwood (including his current project Look Park, on Yep Roc).\n\nHis spare, riveting live shows, with his quavering Irish tenor, spidery guitar work and dense wordplay, manage to make intimacy feel massively anthemic, and grinding rock seem like a close-whispered romantic inside joke. - Quynlyn Demitrus", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3001 New St Unit A2, Oceanside, NY 11572", "Artist": "Dysfunktone ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10015288.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.656078, 40.63904], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "Fusion, Jam Bands, Groove, Prog-rock, Funk, Psychedelic Rock", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Barrier Brewing Co.", "moreBioInfo": "Dysfunktone is a group of four best friends who share the passion of expression through music.

As a dual-threat, he\u2019s quickly established himself as one of the most versatile and virtuosic voices of his generation.\n\nHe first made his mark internationally through competitions, winning the Carmine Caruso International Jazz Trumpet Soloist Competition (2011), National Trumpet Competition for Jazz (2010), International Trumpet Guild Jazz Competition (2010), and was most recently a Finalist for the prestigious Thelonius Monk International Jazz Competition (2014). Demonstrating his versatility, he also was a Finalist in two vocal competitions, the Gentlemen Sing Competition (2013) and the Mid-Atlantic Jazz Festival Vocalist Competition (2014).\n\nDelivering on the promise of his early career, he has since recorded albums as a sideman for musicians such as Ulysses Owens Jr., Michael Dease, and Chihiro Yamanaka, the latter on the iconic Blue Note Records label. Sought after as a trumpet soloist, he's played in nearly every major big band, including the Christian McBride Big Band, Mingus Big Band, Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars, Jimmy Heath Big Band, and Bobby Sanabria's Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra. An international touring schedule includes frequent engagements in Japan, Mexico, Russia, and most recently, Italy. When not on the road, he calls NYC home, and remains in-demand at the finest jazz venues in town, leading engagements at Jazz @ Lincoln Center\u2019s \u201cDizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola\u201d, The Blue Note, Birdland, SMOKE, Small\u2019s, Fat Cat & the Iridium to name a few.\n\nHe is featured as a vocalist during Jazz @ Lincoln Center\u2019s upcoming 2016 Concert Series in the Appel Room, as a part of \u201cCrooners\u201d celebrating Bing Crosby, Mel Torme & Nat King Cole.

I don\u2019t always win, but I know when an artist hires me, it\u2019s my job to push them toward greatness, and to get something out of them they didn\u2019t know was there. My personal motto has become, \u2018compromise breeds mediocrity.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis philosophy has shaped the way Foster has approached everything in his more than four decades as a musician, songwriter, composer, arranger, producer, and recording artist. It is the reason why superstars like Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Andrea Bocelli, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Josh Groban, Rod Stewart, and Stevie Wonder have trusted him with their voices and to help them realize their musical dreams.\n\nIndeed, few other songwriters and producers have had their fingerprints on more major moments in all of popular music. Foster has created hit songs and award-winning gold and platinum albums for a diverse array of artists including Earth, Wind & Fire, Natalie Cole, Michael Bolton, Seal, Chaka Khan, Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, Chicago, Hall & Oates, Brandy, \u2019N Sync, Boz Scaggs, and Gloria Estefan; propelled singers who have straddled both pop and classical styles like Andrea Bocelli and Josh Groban, into the mainstream; created culture-defining soundtracks for blockbuster films like The Bodyguard, Urban Cowboy, and St. Elmo\u2019s Fire; and crafted timeless holiday classics, including perennial best-sellers like Josh Groban\u2019s Noel, Michael Bubl\u00e9\u2019s Christmas, Celine Dion\u2019s These Are Special Times, Rod Stewart\u2019s Merry Christmas Baby, and Andrea Bocelli\u2019s My Christmas.\n\nFor his illustrious work, Foster has won 16 Grammy Awards, including three for Producer of the Year, an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe, and racked up three Oscar nominations for \u201cBest Original Song.\u201d In June 2010, he was inducted into the Songwriter\u2019s Hall Of Fame. He has also earned a reputation as a keen spotter of new talent, playing a key role in the discovery and career launches of Celine Dion, Josh Groban, and Michael Bubl\u00e9, the later two he signed to his Warner Music imprint 143 Records. Bubl\u00e9 has called Foster \u201cone of the most brilliant musical minds of our time.\u201d Celine Dion says, \u201cDavid hears things no other person hears,\u201d while Josh Groban credits him with \u201csingle-handedly changing my life.\u201d Says Foster, \u201cI operate under the guiding principle that if I love something, millions of others will love it, too.\u201d\n\nIn 2008 and 2011, Foster stepped out as performer in his own right as the host of \u201cFoster & Friends\u201d \u2014 two star-studded concert events in Las Vegas that celebrate the music from Foster\u2019s unparalleled catalog. The shows were filmed for Great Performance on PBS and Foster\u2019s Hit Man and The Hit Man Returns became PBS\u2019 highest-rated pledge drive shows of the decade. He is also a household name as a performer throughout Asia where he tours annually.\n\nIn 2012 Foster entered a new phase in his career, becoming the chairman of Universal\u2019s Verve Music Group. His mission, he says, is to turn the fabled jazz label (founded in 1956 and home to Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, Ella Fitzgerald, and other jazz luminaires) into the premier label for singing legends and legends in the making. The label\u2019s roster includes Andrea Bocelli, Diana Krall, and Natalie Cole. Foster recently signed Grammy-winning artist Sarah McLachlan and R&B-soul great Smokey Robinson. Foster also has his eye on the next generation of talent, having signed Malaysian singer Yuna and Swedish YouTube sensations Dirty Loops, a virtuoso trio who blend jazz, rock, pop, and dance music into a unique hybrid all their own. \u201cAs a musician, artist, writer and producer, I\u2019ve been on both sides of the glass in the studio,\u201d Foster says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been prepping for this new job for 40 years.\u201d\n\nBorn in Victoria, British Columbia, Foster began studying piano at age four. As the story goes, his mother was dusting the family piano, hit one of the keys, and was shocked when David correctly called out, \u201cThat\u2019s an E!\u201d, thus discovering he had perfect pitch. The son of a maintenance yard superintendent and a homemaker, Foster has chronicled his life in the highly regarded, best-selling autobiography Hit Man. The book is filled with page-turning, eye-opening anecdotes \u2014 from Foster joining Chuck Berry\u2019s band at age 16 to sitting in Paul McCartney\u2019s kitchen talking to him about the day The Beatles broke up.\n\nFoster has made charitable work his life\u2019s other priority. Meeting with a young girl from his hometown who was awaiting a liver transplant had a profound impact and led him to create The David Foster Foundation in 1985. Its mission is to provide financial support to Canadian families with children in need of live-saving organ transplants. In the past two decades, Foster has volunteered his time and talent to over 400 charities, including the annual Muhammad Ali Celebrity Fight Night, The Andre Agassi Foundation, and Carousel of Hope. Tapping into his vast Rolodex of friends and superstar artists, these events have raised millions of dollars for worthy causes. \u201cMy love of music has brought me many rewards, and I feel the need to give back to others less fortunate as often as possible,\u201d Foster says.\n\nIn May 2013, Foster will receive his star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame. It will be located on Vine Street in front of the iconic Capitol Records building, adjacent to the stars of his musical heroes \u2014 John, Paul, George and Ringo \u2014 a thrill for the self-described \u201cbiggest Beatles fan on the planet.\u201d The location is doubly meaningful as Capitol was the label that signed Foster\u2019s band Skylark in 1971. Their hit \u201cWildflower\u201d became a Top 10 hit and launched Foster on his unending road to success.\n\nReflecting upon receiving a star on the Walk of Fame, Foster says, \u201cOne hundred years from now, my great-grandchildren will go, \u2018Hey, there\u2019s my great-grandpa,\u2019 and having a star next to The Beatles \u2026 outside the building where I first got signed \u2026 that\u2019s perfect.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2260 Tillotson Ave, Bronx County, NY 10475", "Artist": "Hollywood Ty HD ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9353259.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.827576, 40.882208], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "Rap, Hip Hop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "The Garage Bar And Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "There are only a few things this R and B, Hop-Hop, singer and songwriter is afraid of, and music isn\u2019t one of them.

Purchase and stream at https://themenzingers.ffm.to/helloexile.\n\nSince forming as teenagers in 2006, The Menzingers have shown their strength as rough-and-tumble storytellers, turning out songs equally rooted in frenetic energy and lifelike detail. On their new album Hello Exile, the Philadelphia-based punk band take their lyrical narrative to a whole new level and share their reflections on moments from the past and present: high-school hellraising, troubled relationships, aging and alcohol and political ennui. And while their songs often reveal certain painful truths, Hello Exile ultimately maintains the irrepressible spirit that\u2019s always defined the band.\n\nThe sixth full-length from The Menzingers, Hello Exile arrives as the follow-up to After the Party: a 2017 release that landed on best-of-the-year lists from outlets like Clash and Noisey, with Stereogum praising its \u201calmost unfairly well-written punk songs.\u201d In creating the album, the band again joined forces with producer Will Yip (Mannequin Pussy, Quicksand), spending six weeks recording at Yip\u2019s Conshohocken, PA-based Studio 4. \u201cThat\u2019s the longest amount of time we\u2019ve ever worked with Will,\u201d notes Barnett. \u201cWe wanted to make sure these stories didn\u2019t get lost in the music, so we kept it to a lot of room sounds with the guitar and bass and drums.\u201d\n\nDespite that subtler sonic approach, Hello Exile still rushes forward with a restless urgency\u2014an element in full force on the album-opening \u201cAmerica (You\u2019re Freaking Me Out).\u201d With its pounding rhythms and furious guitar riffs, the viscerally charged track provides a much-needed release for all those feeling frenzied by the current political climate. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a pretty insane time, where all you can think about every single day is \u2018What the hell is going on with this country?\u2019\u201d says Barnett. \u201cBut as I was writing that song I realized that it\u2019s kind of always freaked me out, especially coming-of-age during the Iraq War. I love so much about America, but I think you can\u2019t deny that there are some people in power who are absolutely evil.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on Hello Exile, The Menzingers turn their incisive songwriting to matters of love and romance, exploring the glories and failures of human connection. A wistful piece of jangle-pop, \u201cAnna\u201d paints a portrait of lovesick longing, complete with dreamy recollections of wine-drunk kitchen dancing. And on \u201cStrangers Forever,\u201d the band shifts gears for a searing tribute to parting ways, backing their spiky guitars with brilliantly barbed lyrics (e.g., \u201cMaybe it\u2019s for the better if we both stay strangers forever\u201d).\n\nAn album fascinated with home and displacement and belonging (or the lack thereof), Hello Exile takes its title from its heavy-hearted centerpiece. With its aching vocals, graceful acoustic guitar work, and beautifully lilting melody, \u201cHello Exile\u201d draws inspiration from Anton Chekhov\u2019s \u201cThe Lady with the Dog\u201d (a short story set in the Black Sea resort city of Yalta). \u201cI grew up in a tiny town that\u2019s essentially a cross between a summer-vacation spot for New Yorkers and a retirement home, so for most of my childhood there were always people coming in and out of my life,\u201d says Barnett, who hails from Lake Ariel, PA. \u201cReading that story made me think of how isolating it felt when my friends would leave to go back to the city at the end of the season, and I\u2019d still just be stuck way out there in the woods.\u201d\n\nIn looking back on the songwriting process behind Hello Exile, Barnett points to the starkly confessional \u201cI Can\u2019t Stop Drinking\u201d to illustrate the band\u2019s commitment to total candor. \u201cWe\u2019ve written so many songs about fun times with alcohol\u2014but the older you get, it\u2019s not always fun anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cWith \u2018I Can\u2019t Stop Drinking,\u2019 I wanted to be completely truthful and get away from glorifying anything. Sometimes it\u2019s tough to look at yourself and at others that way, but it felt important to make it as real as possible.\u201d\n\nWith the band achieving that soul-baring intimacy all throughout the album, Hello Exile emerges as The Menzingers\u2019 most emotionally daring work to date. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been in love with good songwriting and the beauty of taking a song to its fullest potential, but with this album I feel like we\u2019re really becoming the band we\u2019ve always wanted to be,\u201d says Barnett. Not only a creative turning point for The Menzingers, that uncompromising honesty helps fulfill their mission of leaving each listener with a potent sense of solidarity. \u201cA lot of these songs are looking at different life challenges\u2014they\u2019re stories of people at some sort of crossroads,\u201d Barnett says. \u201cWe might not have the answers for anybody, but hopefully the songs will help them to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and know that they\u2019re not alone in whatever tough decisions they\u2019re facing.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "147 Bleecker St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Petite Celine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9451823.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.999227, 40.728321], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "Indie Pop, Pop, World Fusion, Indie, French Pop, Fusion", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "The Bitter End", "moreBioInfo": "Petite Celine is a Franco-American fusion pop artist & multi-instrumentalist based out of Brooklyn, NY. Born to a French Air Force colonel and an American lawyer-gone-psychic-detective, Celine rebelled into the arts, excelling first in acting, working with directors such as Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood by the age of 11.\n\nGrowing up in New York City at an international school for army brats and children of ambassadors and diplomats, Celine\u2019s favorite day of the year was always UN day. In this unique program, all the kids would take the day off from curriculum and show up dressed in the garb of their native cultures, bringing with them food, toys, and art from their motherlands to share. It was there that she first found her love and reverence for world culture.\n\nIn her own right, travelling often between two homelands, Celine got to experience differences in international music first hand. French radio often aired a diverse selection of music, featuring a wide variety of languages - exciting Celine, a multi-linguist herself - while US radio cemented her love for American Pop.\n\nBut it wasn't until college, when Celine found herself homeless with only a small suitcase and the guitar on her back, that she started performing her own compositions. Busking on the streets of Lower Manhattan for strangers, she discovered the awesome power music has to bring people together from all walks of life.\n\nToday, Petite Celine tours regularly with these influences, dressing the stages with her colorful LED art creations and youthful face paint. Petite Celine's music in essence is a celebration of culture: fueled by fusion and uplifted by her love for Pop. It\u2019s the sound of a trip around the world taken by Kimbra, Jain, Sia and No Doubt. This can be heard in a wide variety of collaborations, but most notably on her newly released fusion pop album, Man Made Fire, which incorporates several languages, musical influences and instruments from around the globe.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "21 A Clinton St,, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Mike Brown the REMIX ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9522769.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9864369, 40.7162225], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "Standup Comedy, Improvisation, Comedy", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Caveat", "moreBioInfo": "Mike Brown is a comedian and writer from Harlem, New York.

It\u2019s that music that fills the day to day aspect, a constant familiar sound. It\u2019s hard to talk about, because its corollarly so clearly does not exist in the industrial centers or the so-called \u201cWestern\u201d world. It\u2019s rural music. It\u2019s village music. It\u2019s music for when you don\u2019t have electricity, immediate Youtube access to every recorded sound. It\u2019s music that exists when performance trumps playback. The term village music or rural music might be better, as any claims to it\u2019s authenticity or \u201ctraditionalist\u201d elements would be work apart. In any case, every small village its performers, sometimes traveling about for local festivities (incidentally, I met Alamnou years prior, and only realized it when assembling the record). Such is the case with \u201cLes Filles de Illighadad.\u201d Fatou and Alamnou live in the aforementioned village, a tiny assemblance of mud houses thrown together in the scrubby Sahel of central Niger. I visit in the rainy season (previously), when the countryside is innaudated with still pools of water. Ghostly white egrets perch on half submerged trees, while in the distance tall camels slough there way through the muck. The latter, slow moving and giant, have something almost prehistoric about them in this context. I\u2019m not used to seeing camels in a swamp. The desert is vibrant and green at this time of year, after the rains have parched the otherwise thirsty landscape. The desert here is cyclical, and follows a predictable schedule. Fatou plays an old blue guitar, chipped and dried, slightly bent. The extremes of weather are not easy on musical instruments. She plays a long session, moving seamlessly from one song to another, many covers of of Etran Finatawa whose music is renowned in this part of Niger. Fatou\u2019s guitar playing is measured and calm, and while we record outside under the trees, it is music transformed by context and place. From the vantage of far away, from a computer screen, it is easy to imagine a singular Niger, even a singular Tuareg identity. But there are many lives and many ways of living. The village of Illighadad is a world apart from Agadez, from Niamey \u2013 both major cities in their own right, dense with people, noise, and the trappings of modernity. Fatou\u2019s guitar speaks to a different pace. The days in Illighadad are long, and time is not measured by hours, meetings, or even by the muezzins prayer call \u2013 but by the suns passage, the movement of the animals, and the sound of the crickets.

Purchase and stream at https://themenzingers.ffm.to/helloexile.\n\nSince forming as teenagers in 2006, The Menzingers have shown their strength as rough-and-tumble storytellers, turning out songs equally rooted in frenetic energy and lifelike detail. On their new album Hello Exile, the Philadelphia-based punk band take their lyrical narrative to a whole new level and share their reflections on moments from the past and present: high-school hellraising, troubled relationships, aging and alcohol and political ennui. And while their songs often reveal certain painful truths, Hello Exile ultimately maintains the irrepressible spirit that\u2019s always defined the band.\n\nThe sixth full-length from The Menzingers, Hello Exile arrives as the follow-up to After the Party: a 2017 release that landed on best-of-the-year lists from outlets like Clash and Noisey, with Stereogum praising its \u201calmost unfairly well-written punk songs.\u201d In creating the album, the band again joined forces with producer Will Yip (Mannequin Pussy, Quicksand), spending six weeks recording at Yip\u2019s Conshohocken, PA-based Studio 4. \u201cThat\u2019s the longest amount of time we\u2019ve ever worked with Will,\u201d notes Barnett. \u201cWe wanted to make sure these stories didn\u2019t get lost in the music, so we kept it to a lot of room sounds with the guitar and bass and drums.\u201d\n\nDespite that subtler sonic approach, Hello Exile still rushes forward with a restless urgency\u2014an element in full force on the album-opening \u201cAmerica (You\u2019re Freaking Me Out).\u201d With its pounding rhythms and furious guitar riffs, the viscerally charged track provides a much-needed release for all those feeling frenzied by the current political climate. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a pretty insane time, where all you can think about every single day is \u2018What the hell is going on with this country?\u2019\u201d says Barnett. \u201cBut as I was writing that song I realized that it\u2019s kind of always freaked me out, especially coming-of-age during the Iraq War. I love so much about America, but I think you can\u2019t deny that there are some people in power who are absolutely evil.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on Hello Exile, The Menzingers turn their incisive songwriting to matters of love and romance, exploring the glories and failures of human connection. A wistful piece of jangle-pop, \u201cAnna\u201d paints a portrait of lovesick longing, complete with dreamy recollections of wine-drunk kitchen dancing. And on \u201cStrangers Forever,\u201d the band shifts gears for a searing tribute to parting ways, backing their spiky guitars with brilliantly barbed lyrics (e.g., \u201cMaybe it\u2019s for the better if we both stay strangers forever\u201d).\n\nAn album fascinated with home and displacement and belonging (or the lack thereof), Hello Exile takes its title from its heavy-hearted centerpiece. With its aching vocals, graceful acoustic guitar work, and beautifully lilting melody, \u201cHello Exile\u201d draws inspiration from Anton Chekhov\u2019s \u201cThe Lady with the Dog\u201d (a short story set in the Black Sea resort city of Yalta). \u201cI grew up in a tiny town that\u2019s essentially a cross between a summer-vacation spot for New Yorkers and a retirement home, so for most of my childhood there were always people coming in and out of my life,\u201d says Barnett, who hails from Lake Ariel, PA. \u201cReading that story made me think of how isolating it felt when my friends would leave to go back to the city at the end of the season, and I\u2019d still just be stuck way out there in the woods.\u201d\n\nIn looking back on the songwriting process behind Hello Exile, Barnett points to the starkly confessional \u201cI Can\u2019t Stop Drinking\u201d to illustrate the band\u2019s commitment to total candor. \u201cWe\u2019ve written so many songs about fun times with alcohol\u2014but the older you get, it\u2019s not always fun anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cWith \u2018I Can\u2019t Stop Drinking,\u2019 I wanted to be completely truthful and get away from glorifying anything. Sometimes it\u2019s tough to look at yourself and at others that way, but it felt important to make it as real as possible.\u201d\n\nWith the band achieving that soul-baring intimacy all throughout the album, Hello Exile emerges as The Menzingers\u2019 most emotionally daring work to date. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been in love with good songwriting and the beauty of taking a song to its fullest potential, but with this album I feel like we\u2019re really becoming the band we\u2019ve always wanted to be,\u201d says Barnett. Not only a creative turning point for The Menzingers, that uncompromising honesty helps fulfill their mission of leaving each listener with a potent sense of solidarity. \u201cA lot of these songs are looking at different life challenges\u2014they\u2019re stories of people at some sort of crossroads,\u201d Barnett says. \u201cWe might not have the answers for anybody, but hopefully the songs will help them to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and know that they\u2019re not alone in whatever tough decisions they\u2019re facing.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "367 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Itay Goldberg ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9520770.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.963185, 40.711308], "Date": "Sun Apr 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-19", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Williamsburg Music Center", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Itay Goldberg Quintet return to Williamsburg Music Center to present new thrilling compositions before going to the studio to record a new album."}, {"Address": "38 Valley Rd, Montclair, NJ 07042", "Artist": "Paul J Baccash ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9188782.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.2214, 40.81577], "Date": "Sun Apr 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-19", "Genre": "Verona, New Jersey", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Sayola Restaurant", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "444 Saw Mill River Rd, Elmsford, NY 10523", "Artist": "linelions ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8117874.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.814617, 41.070309], "Date": "Sun Apr 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-19", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Captain Lawrence Brewing Company", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3 Lafayette Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "Colin Fowler ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.978878, 40.686876], "Date": "Sun Apr 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-19", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Mark Morris Dance Group", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Performing Satie, Handel, and Schubert's Trout Quintet with the MMDG Music Ensemble"}, {"Address": "137 Ethan Allen Hwy, Ridgefield, CT 06877", "Artist": "Christopher Cavaliere ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7535025.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.445192, 41.27385], "Date": "Sun Apr 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-19", "Genre": "Ambient, Jazz, Rock, Folk", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Nod Hill Brewery", "moreBioInfo": "Christopher Cavaliere is a Musician Singer/Songwriter from Bridgeport,Ct.

The Cactus Blossoms \u2013 Minneapolis-based brothers Page Burkum and Jack Torrey \u2013 offer compelling evidence that this tradition is alive and well, with a deceptively unadorned musical approach that offers \u201ccreative turns of phrase, gorgeous harmonies, and an ageless sound\u201d (NPR All Things Considered), not to mention spine tingles aplenty. Their 2016 debut You\u2019re Dreaming, a stunning and transporting collection of original songs, earned high praise from Rolling Stone and Vice Noisey, tour stints with Kacey Musgraves and Lucius, and a perfectly cast performance on the third season of David Lynch\u2019s Twin Peaks. Now their unlikely rise continues with new album Easy Way, to be released on their own label Walkie Talkie Records.\n\nWhile many bands would have been content to stick with the winning formula of their debut, the Blossoms refused to repeat themselves. If You\u2019re Dreaming celebrated their vintage country and rock influences, Easy Way reveals a songwriting style that has changed, evolved, and gotten more modern. Dan Auerbach, another artist who knows from bedrock influences, co-wrote two songs on the album. \u201cDan\u2019s love for songwriting was inspiring, just the kick in the pants we needed to start writing again after being on the road,\u201d says Page.\n\nThe brothers\u2019 decision to produce the new album themselves no doubt led to the new sound. \u201cWe wanted the freedom to experiment with our own weird ideas,\u201d says Jack, \u201cWe used to joke that the working title album should be Expensive Demos.\u201d As they crisscrossed the nation on tour, the brothers would stop through Alex Hall\u2019s Reliable Recorders studio in Chicago to chase the new sound they were after. The result joins together what would otherwise be distant corners of the American songbook. Both the traditional twang of Chicago pedal steel guitarist Joel Paterson (Devil in a Woodpile, The Western Elstons) and the primal wail of free jazz saxophonist Michael Lewis (Bon Iver, Andrew Bird) are at home on the album.

He began studying the piano at the age of eight, and five years later switched to electric guitar. He soon discovered his passion for improvisation and jazz, and during his high school years he began to travel regularly to Tel Aviv to study with Israel\u2019s leading musicians, and to participate in workshops and master classes. At the age of 16 he started performing professionally with jazz bands around the country and leading several projects with his original music. At 19, Yuval wrote an original composition for his hometown\u2019s string quartet and for the renowned Oud and Violin player Yair Dalal. His music was selected by one of Israel\u2019s leading composers and music educators Michael Wolpe, and was performed in concert halls across Israel. Soon afterwards he started studying at The Jerusalem Academy of Music and the Rimon Jazz School in Tel Aviv and participated in various musical projects. In 2005 Yuval moved to Paris. He quickly made his way into the local jazz scene and started playing in Paris clubs and venues. The following year he studied at the Jazz department of the Paris Region Conservatory, graduating two years later. Since 2008 Yuval leads his quintet, the Yuval Amihai Ensemble, with whom he performs music which is strongly influenced by his childhood in Israel. The ensemble has won numerous awards, including the Grand Prize and the 1st composition prize at the \"La D\u00e9fense\" National Jazz Competition in 2009, The 1st prize in the Saint-Germain Jazz festival Contest in Paris (2008), and the 3rd prize in the international jazz competition of Hoeilaart, Belgium. The band has performed in opening act concerts for renowned artists as Avishai Cohen, Bojan Z, Rabia Abu-Khalil and Kyle Eastwood, and played in numerous Jazz festivals, concert halls and jazz clubs in France and Europe, including Nancy Jazz Pulsations, La D\u00e9fense Jazz Festival, Sunset/Sunside Jazz Club (Paris), Jazz \u00e0 Staint-G\u00e9rmain-des-Pr\u00e8s Festival (Paris), Guitar Art Caf\u00e9 (Belgrade, Serbie), Budo Tomovic Theater (Podgorica, Mont\u00e9n\u00e9gro), National theaters of Amiens, Sceaux & Valencienne. In 2012 Yuval released his first album with his quintet, \"Yuval Amihai Ensemble\", which was acclaimed by critics and received the \"Chosen Album\" label by French leading jazz critics website CitizenJazz.com. This was followed by a full support by the SACEM organisation's grants program for self-produced albums. In 2015, Yuval records his second album \"LONGING\" with his new trio, including bass player Damien Varaillon and drummer Gautier Garrigue. The album was released May 25, 2015 (distributed by L'Autre Distribution). Acclaimed by critics it receives the \"Chosen album\u201d label by CitizenJazz.com as well as the \u201cDiscovery\u201d label in the Jazz News magazine.

Purchase and stream at https://themenzingers.ffm.to/helloexile.\n\nSince forming as teenagers in 2006, The Menzingers have shown their strength as rough-and-tumble storytellers, turning out songs equally rooted in frenetic energy and lifelike detail. On their new album Hello Exile, the Philadelphia-based punk band take their lyrical narrative to a whole new level and share their reflections on moments from the past and present: high-school hellraising, troubled relationships, aging and alcohol and political ennui. And while their songs often reveal certain painful truths, Hello Exile ultimately maintains the irrepressible spirit that\u2019s always defined the band.\n\nThe sixth full-length from The Menzingers, Hello Exile arrives as the follow-up to After the Party: a 2017 release that landed on best-of-the-year lists from outlets like Clash and Noisey, with Stereogum praising its \u201calmost unfairly well-written punk songs.\u201d In creating the album, the band again joined forces with producer Will Yip (Mannequin Pussy, Quicksand), spending six weeks recording at Yip\u2019s Conshohocken, PA-based Studio 4. \u201cThat\u2019s the longest amount of time we\u2019ve ever worked with Will,\u201d notes Barnett. \u201cWe wanted to make sure these stories didn\u2019t get lost in the music, so we kept it to a lot of room sounds with the guitar and bass and drums.\u201d\n\nDespite that subtler sonic approach, Hello Exile still rushes forward with a restless urgency\u2014an element in full force on the album-opening \u201cAmerica (You\u2019re Freaking Me Out).\u201d With its pounding rhythms and furious guitar riffs, the viscerally charged track provides a much-needed release for all those feeling frenzied by the current political climate. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a pretty insane time, where all you can think about every single day is \u2018What the hell is going on with this country?\u2019\u201d says Barnett. \u201cBut as I was writing that song I realized that it\u2019s kind of always freaked me out, especially coming-of-age during the Iraq War. I love so much about America, but I think you can\u2019t deny that there are some people in power who are absolutely evil.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on Hello Exile, The Menzingers turn their incisive songwriting to matters of love and romance, exploring the glories and failures of human connection. A wistful piece of jangle-pop, \u201cAnna\u201d paints a portrait of lovesick longing, complete with dreamy recollections of wine-drunk kitchen dancing. And on \u201cStrangers Forever,\u201d the band shifts gears for a searing tribute to parting ways, backing their spiky guitars with brilliantly barbed lyrics (e.g., \u201cMaybe it\u2019s for the better if we both stay strangers forever\u201d).\n\nAn album fascinated with home and displacement and belonging (or the lack thereof), Hello Exile takes its title from its heavy-hearted centerpiece. With its aching vocals, graceful acoustic guitar work, and beautifully lilting melody, \u201cHello Exile\u201d draws inspiration from Anton Chekhov\u2019s \u201cThe Lady with the Dog\u201d (a short story set in the Black Sea resort city of Yalta). \u201cI grew up in a tiny town that\u2019s essentially a cross between a summer-vacation spot for New Yorkers and a retirement home, so for most of my childhood there were always people coming in and out of my life,\u201d says Barnett, who hails from Lake Ariel, PA. \u201cReading that story made me think of how isolating it felt when my friends would leave to go back to the city at the end of the season, and I\u2019d still just be stuck way out there in the woods.\u201d\n\nIn looking back on the songwriting process behind Hello Exile, Barnett points to the starkly confessional \u201cI Can\u2019t Stop Drinking\u201d to illustrate the band\u2019s commitment to total candor. \u201cWe\u2019ve written so many songs about fun times with alcohol\u2014but the older you get, it\u2019s not always fun anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cWith \u2018I Can\u2019t Stop Drinking,\u2019 I wanted to be completely truthful and get away from glorifying anything. Sometimes it\u2019s tough to look at yourself and at others that way, but it felt important to make it as real as possible.\u201d\n\nWith the band achieving that soul-baring intimacy all throughout the album, Hello Exile emerges as The Menzingers\u2019 most emotionally daring work to date. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been in love with good songwriting and the beauty of taking a song to its fullest potential, but with this album I feel like we\u2019re really becoming the band we\u2019ve always wanted to be,\u201d says Barnett. Not only a creative turning point for The Menzingers, that uncompromising honesty helps fulfill their mission of leaving each listener with a potent sense of solidarity. \u201cA lot of these songs are looking at different life challenges\u2014they\u2019re stories of people at some sort of crossroads,\u201d Barnett says. \u201cWe might not have the answers for anybody, but hopefully the songs will help them to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and know that they\u2019re not alone in whatever tough decisions they\u2019re facing.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Common Jack ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10317600.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Sun Apr 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-19", "Genre": "Americana, Indie, Rock, Singer, Songwriter, Folk, Alternative", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Instagram Live", "moreBioInfo": "Hi friends.

After that, we put out an EP called \u2018Canyons in the Dark\u2019 & now we\u2019ve got a new single called \u2018Still Awake\u2019.

The material he was working on took the band forward into a heavier sound\u2014and it also brought them back to the spark of their first album. \u201cIt allowed us to go back to the roots and the spirit we had when we started,\u201d Redman considers. \u201cWe are kind of a new band, in a lot of ways, is what it feels like.\u201d\n\nContinuing their partnership with producer Jonny Bell of Crystal Antlers, who produced Moonless Dream as well as 2017\u2019s Gravedigging, the Buttertones waited until they were good and ready before hitting the legendary Electro-Vox Studios in Hollywood, where they arrived knowing exactly what they wanted to lay to tape. Armed with an arsenal of the most propulsive music they\u2019ve written yet, the band recorded the album mostly live\u2014an ideal method for capturing their cult-status live show, which carries on the torch of acts like the Walkmen and the Fleshtones. \u201cWe\u2019d do a few takes,\u201d says Araiza, \u201cand then it was, \u2018Alright, we got all the main instruments done, now let\u2019s record on the vibraphone that was used on Pet Sounds,\u2019 you know?\u201d\n\nBut Jazzhound is completely new territory for the group, too, with Araiza, who calls this album \u201cprobably the darkest one\u201d he\u2019s written lyrically, pushing his Ian Curtis-via-Bobby Darin baritone to new depths, particularly on scorchers like \u201cPhantom Eyes\u201d and \u201cBebop.\u201d It\u2019s also the first album with Cobi\u00e5n acting\u2014and thriving\u2014in his new role as a full-time guitarist (the drum parts were written by him and played by session musician Paul Doyle), and the first since the departure of guitarist Dakota Boettcher as well.\n\n\u201cWe really worked our asses off on this one,\u201d says Araiza, proudly, already talking about how he can\u2019t wait to do it all again and make another record soon\u2014after they tour the world, that is, making up for the lost dates last summer, and then some. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re still climbing.\u201d", "otherInfo": "The Buttertones"}, {"Address": "129 Macdougal St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "The Real Marya Lawrence Hart Page ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10136287.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.000069, 40.730649], "Date": "Mon Apr 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-20", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Bar Next Door at La Lanterna di Vittorio", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Marya Lawrence Trio at Bar Next Door with Freddie Bryant on guitar and Jennifer Vincent on bass"}, {"Address": "61 Wythe Ave, New York, NY 11249", "Artist": "JAH People ; Roots, Rock, Reggae, Philly Style.
