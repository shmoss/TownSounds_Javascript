Hailing from the Central Louisiana town of Alexandria, David has steadily built his reputation as an entertainer, playing high energy, musically diverse shows driven by what may be his biggest asset \u2013 that powerful, soul-drenched voice. America got a taste of David\u2019s promising talents when he made the finals of Nashville Star in 2007. Now David is delivering on that promise releasing brand new music showcasing what his followers across the country have been raving about for years.\nDavid\u2019s musical education began early in life as a kid. He was taking in the pop-influenced country sounds of Kenny Rogers from his dad\u2019s record collection before rocking out at Metallica and Guns-n-Roses concerts with his Junior High buddies. The new wave of 90\u2019s country, particularly Garth Brooks\u2019 seminal No Fences album, had a big impact on David. David\u2019s growing obsession for music soon gave way to performing for audiences; he says \u201cI never really wanted to do anything else besides singing and entertaining\u201d. Further musical explorations led David to expand his R&B vocal skills, singing in a Juniorr High group styled after the harmonies of Boyz II Men. By his early 20s David had started playing shows in nearby Hammond, La where he met a local producer. That chance meeting led to a few recording sessions and the beginning of David\u2019s trips to Nashville to take his first swing at the big time.\nIn early 2000, David made further connections in Music City and began working on his first full length album DSR with some of Country Music\u2019s top musicians and songwriters. Over the next few years David toured the country; performing frequently gave David an invaluable opportunity to develop his distinct vocal style and energy-driven live show. \u201cThere\u2019s an experience and wisdom in that environment,\u201d David says, \u201cyou learn to be professional at all times, whether you are playing for two people or a crowd of thousands\u201d.\nOpportunity came knocking in Spring 2007 when he was selected to star as a contestant on the new season of TV\u2019s premiere country competition Nashville Star. Besides the invaluable national exposure the show brought him, David also performed on the 40-city Nashville Star tour and had a chance to interact with many of the nearly half million fans who voted for him. Nashville Star also introduced David to many Music Row veterans, in particular Shawn Pennington, the former manager of mulit-platinum acts Big & Rich, Alabama\u2019s Randy Owen and new group Thompson Square. Shawn was very impressed with what he saw in David\u2019s live show during the Nashville Star tour. \u201cAt the time I was working with Big & Rich and their live show is what really set them apart. They owned the room every night and I\u2019ve seen David do that exact same thing,\u201d Shawn says. \u201cDavid can go into a room where no one knows his songs, and by the end, they are all giving him a standing ovation\u201d.\nBy 2008, David and Shawn were working together finding songs and beginning the process of recording a new album. David also continued collaborating on songs of his own with some of Nashville\u2019s top writers. All I Really Wanted to Say was the first album released on David\u2019s own independent label DSR Entertainment in 2010. His hit single \u201cTwenty Years Late\u201d rocketed to #56 on the Billboard Chart. David continues to successfully tour performing his own brand of country music to riveted crowds earning him a new legion of dedicated fans.\nDavid has also been hard at work writing, producing and recording his newest project due to release later this year. He explains, \u201cI hope this latest EP will show my fans the growth I\u2019ve made as a songwriter and artist, while exploring the depth of my musical influences.

Not Shelley King. She sweeps in, carrying herself with the strength and assurance of a woman who knows how to step up and get it done, whether \u201cit\u201d is leading her band, running her own record label or co-producing her new album, Building A Fire. If there\u2019s a little swagger to her strut, she\u2019s earned it. Since quitting a sales job to pursue music full time in 1998, the singer-songwriter has served as the first female Texas state musician, performed with Levon Helm, toured the United States, Europe and Japan and cut two albums with members of the Subdudes \u2014 including this one, her seventh. She\u2019s also the author of a song recorded by Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra; they duetted on \u201cTexas Blue Moon\u201d after Hazlewood heard King\u2019s version on the radio while driving through the state. That might chalk up as a lucky break, but it\u2019s King\u2019s talent and tenacity that make such breaks happen. We\u2019re talking, after all, about a woman who loves the Subdudes\u2019 music so much, she started pursuing opening slots on their tours so she could catch their shows. It makes perfect sense that King would be attracted to that New Orleans-born band; her own soul-filled, earthy Americana sound is rooted in southern gospel and blues, dampened by the Gulf-borne humidity of Louisiana, nourished by the river loam of Muscle Shoals, then cleansed by the hot springs of her native Arkansas, with a little Texas country bubbling underneath. \u201cI opened for them all over the country. It seemed like a coincidence to them,\u201d she says with a hearty laugh. The friendship was forged when they sat in with her at a festival after-party, and when King had a radio appearance lined up in Fort Collins, Colo., where several of the band members live, she got in touch. John Magnie met her at the station, accordion in hand, then gave her a tour of his home studio. Months later, she asked if she could record some demos there. Those supposed demos turned out so well, they became her lauded 2009 album Welcome Home, which also led to a shared tour they actually planned. King, Magnie and fellow co-producer Steve Amedee also made actual plans for recording Building A Fire, though the emphasis was still on having fun, not watching the clock. \u201cI\u2019ve got tons and tons of songs. I\u2019d just go in and start playing songs for them until they went, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s a cool one,\u2019\u201d King says. \u201cI could play 10 songs and they\u2019d find one that was super groovy and we\u2019d work on that one.\u201d The first one they recorded happens to be one of two she didn\u2019t write \u2014 the traditional, \u201cI Know I\u2019ve Been Changed.\u201d King first heard it via a YouTube video her mother sent, then turned up other versions, including several by Southern preachers who roused their congregations with it. \u201cIt got stuck in my head so bad, it was playing nonstop,\u201d she says with a mock-groan. \u201cGrocery store, driving a car, everything. So I walk into this studio and they ask, \u2018What to you want to record?\u2019\u201d The first thing out of her mouth was that lyric, intoned in full preacher mode. \u201cI recorded it just to get us warmed up and because it wouldn\u2019t leave me alone,\u201d she says. Her version drips with sinewy soul, evoking futilely swishing funeral-home fans and handkerchiefs dabbing at perspiring brows. But you\u2019d swear the heat source is the devil himself, hovering behind every note in hopes of snatching wayward sinners from the brink of salvation. In fact, the tension between spirituality and sexuality, gospel influences and rootsier renderings, is almost a theme permeating the album. \u201cI have a lot of lyrics in my songs that border on innuendo,\u201d King notes. \u201cBut I do have a spirituality that gets in, too.\u201d Laughing, she calls the title tune \u201ca juxtaposition, if you will.\u201d She also notes that both are major aspects of the human condition, while remaining mysterious \u2014even taboo. The stage for that duality was set early; born in Arkansas, King began singing as a toddler. Her parents split, her mom remarried and King moved to Houston, then Amarillo, where she landed front and center in the children\u2019s choir at her grandmother\u2019s church. After another stint in Houston, her mother divorced again, and King wound up with her other grandmother in Arkansas. She found salvation \u2014 literally \u2014 in a one-room country church, where she built a social life, gained solace from familial turmoil and soloed weekly. Sometimes her uncles accompanied her on guitar. That\u2019s when she also started writing songs, inspired by her beloved Caddo River and a teenager\u2019s hopes and dreams. King returned to Texas for college, which she financed by running her first business. Her plans included law school. But after working for a lawyer and starting her own band, she realized law was not her passion. Music was. After gigging around Houston for a couple of years, she moved to Austin in 1992. By day, she worked as a sales rep; the rest of the time, she lived and breathed music. One day she realized she didn\u2019t care about sales and would forever regret it if she didn\u2019t at least try to follow her heart. \u201cI went in and quit my job and all the way home, I\u2019m like, \u2018Ohmygod, I must be crazy.\u2019 But I got on the phone and called everybody I knew and told them what I had done, and I booked 11 gigs that day,\u201d King recalls proudly. She also formed her own label, Lemonade Records. \u201cI always liked that saying, \u2018If life hands you lemons, make lemonade,\u2019\u201d King says. \u201cAnd I felt like my corporate gig was a lemon and I split and I made lemonade.\u201d She certainly has. King\u2019s first full-length album, Call of My Heart, contained two songs subsequently covered by Austin songstress Toni Price. Her version of the title tune won Song of the Year at the 2002 Austin Music Awards. A few years later, King and her band were named Band of the Year for roots rock. She\u2019s since racked up more accolades, including that Official Texas State Musician title (she was No. 6, preceding even Willie Nelson) and an appearance with Carolyn Wonderland in an episode of the world-renowned \u201cAustin City Limits\u201d TV show. \u201cTexas Blue Moon\u201d also earned her a chance to meet Hazlewood in 2004, as a surprise guest at a party in his honor. \u201cThat experience was worth more than you could put any kind of a pricetag on,\u201d King says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to quantify the opportunity to sit on the floor between Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra while Lee tells her stories about her dad.\u201d That song is one of many luna-inspired tunes King\u2019s written. The final track on Building A Fire, in fact, is titled \u201cMoonlight.\u201d King calls the mid-tempo melody, dressed with harmonies, accordion and gently chiming percussion, \u201cjust a sweet little love song.\u201d \u201cIt's about longing to be with someone who is far away and you're both looking at the moon at the same time from different places,\u201d she explains. One night, while staring at a fat Austin moon, she picked up her phone to text her sister about it. But her sister had just sent virtually the same message. Now and then, we all have moments that somehow feel cosmically connected; King admits she\u2019s experienced several in Woodstock, where she recently recorded backing vocals on a Marcia Ball song with soul sisters Carolyn Wonderland and Amy Helm, Levon\u2019s daughter. King actually was heading to Woodstock for one of Levon\u2019s famed midnight rambles when she learned of his passing. When she arrived, she sat on the tin-roofed porch of a B&B and taught herself a song she loved that he had done during one of her previous visits: the spiritual, \u201cWhen I Go Away,\u201d written by Helm\u2019s band director, Larry Campbell. As she played, a heavy rain began falling. Listening to its watery rhythms, she realized it was ramble time and wondered if she was hearing Levon trying out his new drumkit. \u201cThat song has meant a lot to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI started doing it then and haven\u2019t stopped.\u201d It gets an almost jubilant treatment on Building A Fire. Another track, \u201cThings You Do,\u201d was co-written years ago with Floramay Holliday. The fan favorite appears on in her live Rockin\u2019 the Dancehall album, but had never been recorded in a studio. In addition to Fort Collins, parts of Building A Fire were tracked in Austin and Muscle Shoals. It features King on vocals and guitar; Amedee on drums, percussion, mandolin and support vocals; Magnie on vocals, accordion and keyboards; Marvin Dykhuis on vocals, guitars, dobro and mandolin; and Sarah Brown on bass. Guests include Wonderland on electric guitar, Cindy Cashdollar on lap steel, Warren Hood on fiddle and Tim Cook on vocals. \u201cThey\u2019re just unique talents, and very expressive,\u201d King says of her musical friends. Her co-producers, of course, offer special inspiration. \u201cThey really care about doing what\u2019s right for the song,\u201d she says. \u201cI like that. When I work with them, when we\u2019re done, I feel like I really found myself.\u201d She\u2019s also found out how build quite a fire \u2014 one so strong, it\u2019s gonna burn for a long, long time. ### 2008 Official State Musician of Texas!", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/BillyBobsTexas"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Buddy Whittington ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/321944.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/BillyBobsTexas"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dirty Pool ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8350459.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Americana, Blues, Blues-rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Based out of Fort Worth, Tx since 2007...

After all, this accomplished and diverse guitarist has explored several styles in his career\u2014hard rock, rock, surf, and prog, to name a few\u2014and he came home to the blues with 2013\u2019s Deja Blues.\n\nNow, Hoey has forged his deep blues and rock roots into a fiery, organic, and thrilling mix that should delight and astound lovers of the guitar and guitar music.\n\n\u201cLooking back from my first album in 1992, it sure seems like I\u2019m musically schizophrenic,\u201d says Hoey. \u201cBut I truly believed in every style I played. I still do. I wanted to master everything\u2014or at least try to\u2014and every lick from every style I\u2019ve absorbed informs everything I do today. And I love that, because all of that diversity helps me come up with riffs, licks, and melodies that are perhaps deeper and more unique than if I had stayed exclusively with one style.\u201d\n\nOne thing that always stays consistent, however, is Hoey\u2019s impassioned command of the guitar. He\u2019s one of those guitarists who can attack his instrument with feral intensity, and then play something very soft and almost achingly beautiful. This ability to devise phrasing, technique, and tone in the service of feeling the music has not gone unnoticed.\n\nIn 1987, the Boston-born guitarist caught the ear of Ozzy Osbourne\u2014no slouch at picking great guitar players\u2014and almost ended up in his band. (The gig ultimately went to Zakk Wylde.) But Ozzy thought enough of Hoey to implore him to move where the action was\u2014Los Angeles. The relocation paid off big time in 1992, when Hoey scored a major-label record deal with Reprise for his band, Heavy Bones. Sadly, the group was dropped in 1993, but Hoey\u2019s determination won the day. He convinced the label to let him record a low-budget instrumental-guitar album, Animal Instinct, and his version of Focus\u2019 \u201cHocus Pocus\u201d brought Hoey chart success and a successful solo career. Since then, the gigs and accolades have never stopped. Here are some highlights\u2026\n\n\u2022 He scored the soundtrack to Endless Summer II (1994).\n\n\u2022 He recorded \u201cMiserlou \u201997\u201d with surf-guitar icon Dick Dale in 1997.\n\n\u2022 He has provided music for several film and television companies, including Walt Disney, New Line Cinema, and ESPN.\n\n\u2022 He scored the music to the awesome roller-coaster ride California Screaming at Disney\u2019s California Adventure.\n\n\u2022 He produced metal legend Lita Ford\u2019s Living Like a Runaway album.\n\n\u2022 He is a frequent coach and musical director at Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Fantasy Camp.\n\n\u2022 In 2015, he celebrated the 20th anniversary of his holiday CDs and tours under the Ho! Ho! Hoey banner. (Hallmark musical greeting cards feature two of his Ho! Ho! Hoey songs.)\n\n\u2022 He recently completed filming an instructional blues-guitar video for TrueFire online guitar lessons.\n\n\u201cI love playing guitar, and, these days, it takes a creative and administrative commitment to keep a career evolving and growing,\u201d says Hoey. \u201cI\u2019ve learned how to make records, how to manage social-networking campaigns, how to put a tour together, how to sell merchandise, and everything about how to survive in the music business as it exists right now. But it\u2019s all worth it when I hang out with the audience at my shows and talk about music. The human interaction is critical, and having that relationship with my fans is what keeps me writing music and practicing like a demon. I never want to let those people down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to hear Gary sing and play the blues with his trademark intensity, feel and authenticity. And the guitar tones! \u201cDust & Bones is a great sounding Blues/Rock album that\u2019s both vintage and modern at the same time.\u201d Joe Satriani\n\n\u201cI had the pleasure of singing a duet with the great Mr Gary Hoey, on the beautiful ballad called \u201cComing Home.\u201d It\u2019s got some awesome guitar playing in it\u201d Lita Ford\n\nGary Hoey\u2019s awesome command of styles, tones, and techniques drives so many different moods on Dust & Bones that you\u2019ll feel as if he transports you across the musical universe and beyond.\nBuckle up!

Those are the qualities that have steered Zito\u2019s career since the beginning and continue to define every effort he\u2019s offered since.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have nothing to hide; it seems my honesty is what people relate to most,\u201d he once told Vintage Guitar magazine. \u201cAnders (Osborne) told me early on, \u2018If you don\u2019t believe what you\u2019re singing, you\u2019ll never be a good singer.\u2019 I try not to write fluff; I try to make every word count.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat point became convincingly clear with his last record 2018\u2019s First Class Life, a collection of songs that detailed his journey from addiction to sobriety and the subsequent success he achieved through his award-winning body of work. A multiple award winner and nominee, Zito has built his career on an ability to tap into tradition while maintaining contemporary credence all at the same time.\n\n\n\nZito\u2019s upcoming album -- his 16th -- due this November on Ruf Records and descriptively titled Rock N Roll: A Tribute to Chuck Berry, finds him broadening his boundaries still further even as it marks a return to his roots. The album consists of 20 Chuck Berry classics performed by Zito and an impressive array of 21 guest guitarists, among them Joe Bonamassa, Walter Trout, Eric Gales, Robben Ford, Sonny Landreth, Luther Dickinson, Albert Castiglia, Anders Osborne and, significantly, Chuck\u2019s grandson, Charles Berry III.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis was a very special project for me,\u201d Zito says. \u201cI lived in Chuck\u2019s hometown of St. Louis for 32 years, and I worked at a small musical instrument store where his drummer also happened to be employed. Chuck\u2019s son would drop by on occasion as well. He was an icon, and rightfully so. I\u2019ve been playing his songs since I was a kid. Needless to say, he was a tremendous influence on my career, and, of course, on many other musicians\u2019 as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nProduced by Zito himself, the album was recorded at his own Marz Studios and mixed and mastered by David Farrell. \u201cWe recorded the basic tracks and then sent them to each guest musician,\u201d Zito recalls. \u201cThey added their contributions and then sent the files back to us. The process took a year to complete.\u201d\n\n\n\nNaturally, patience and perseverance have been Zito\u2019s stock and trade since the beginning. He began playing guitar at the age of five, and by the time he reached his late teens, he was already a fixture on the local St. Louis music scene. He initially released his music independently and then signed with Eclecto Groove Records in 2008. \"Pearl River,\" the title track of his 2009 album for the label, won Song of the Year at the Blues Music Awards and marked his first collaboration with Cyril Nevill, with whom he\u2019d later work in the Royal Southern Brotherhood. A steady succession of critically acclaimed albums followed, culminating in 2011\u2019s Greyhound, which was nominated for Best Rock Blues Album at that year\u2019s Blue Music Awards ceremony in Memphis. Two years later, he signed with Ruf Records and released Gone to Texas, the story of how he gained his sobriety, offered an emotional homage to the state that left an indelible imprint on his entire life. It also marked the debut of his band, the Wheel.\n\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Zito also played an integral role in the super group of sorts, Royal Southern Brotherhood. The group released two albums and a DVD, Songs from the Road - Live in Germany, winner of the year\u2019s Blues Music Award for Best DVD. He also made his mark behind the boards by producing albums for Samantha Fish, Albert Castiglia, Ally Venable, Jeremiah Johnson, Jimmy Carpenter, and many others.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the accolades keep coming. His album Make Blues Not War debuted on the Billboard Blues Album Chart at number one and garnered him recognition as the 2018 Rock Blues Artist of the Year at the Blues Music Awards. Last year\u2019s First Class Life followed suit, also entering the charts at number one. Alternate Root magazine insisted that \u201cThe First Class Life that Mike Zito titles his upcoming album can be heard in the sweet sound of Blue Soul rising like heat waves from his guitar and his vocal.\u201d American Blues Scene said \u201cMike Zito\u2019s return to the blues is, in a word, triumphant!\u201d No Depression declared, \u201cOnce again, Zito has delivered the goods, a first class package with no postage due.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, with Rock N Roll: A Tribute to Chuck Berry, Mike Zito again does what he does best, making an album that\u2019s humble, heartfelt, skilled and sublime....and, to paraphrase Chuck himself, letting it rock all at the same time.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/BillyBobsTexas"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Vanja Sky ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/BillyBobsTexas"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Marcia Ball ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8970336.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Americana, Blues, Swamp Blues, Boogie-woogie", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"Fifty years have passed in a flash,\" says Texas-born, Louisiana-raised pianist, songwriter and vocalist Marcia Ball of her long and storied career. Ball, the 2018 Texas State Musician Of The Year, has won worldwide fame and countless fans for her ability to ignite a full-scale roadhouse rhythm and blues party every time she takes the stage. Her rollicking Texas boogies, swampy New Orleans ballads and groove-laden Gulf Coast blues have made her a one-of-a-kind favorite with music lovers all over the world. With each new release, her reputation as a profoundly soulful singer, a boundlessly talented pianist and a courageous, inventive songwriter continues to grow. Her love of the road has led to years of soul-satisfying performances at festivals, concert halls and clubs. The New York Times says, \"Marcia Ball plays two-fisted New Orleans barrelhouse piano and sings in a husky, knowing voice about all the trouble men and women can get into on the way to a good time.\" The Houston Chronicle says simply, \"She's as perfect as an artist can be.\"\n\nWith her new album, Shine Bright, Ball set out to, in her words, \"Make the best Marcia Ball record I could make.\" In doing so, she has put together the most musically substantial, hopeful and uplifting set of songs of her five-decade career. Produced by Steve Berlin (Los Lobos) and recorded in Texas and Louisiana, Shine Bright contains twelve songs (including nine originals), ranging from the title track's rousing appeal for public and private acts of courage to the upbeat call to action of \"Pots And Pans,\" a song inspired by renowned Texas political writer and humorist Molly Ivins. From the humorous advice of \"Life Of The Party\" to the poignantly optimistic \"World Full Of Love,\" the intensity of Ball's conviction never wavers while, simultaneously, the fun never stops. Shine Bright is exactly the album Ball set out to make. \"It is a ridiculously hopeful, cheerful record,\" she says, in light of some of the album's more serious subject matter. The secret, according to Ball \"is to set the political songs to a good dance beat.\"\n\nBorn in Orange, Texas in 1949 to a family whose female members all played piano, Ball grew up in the small town of Vinton, Louisiana, right across the border from Texas. She began taking piano lessons at age five, playing old Tin Pan Alley and popular music tunes from her grandmother's collection. But it wasn't until she was 13 that Marcia discovered the power of soul music. One day in New Orleans in 1962, she sat amazed as Irma Thomas delivered the most spirited and moving performance the young teenager had ever seen. A few years later she attended Louisiana State University, where she played some of her very first gigs with a blues-based rock band called Gum.\n\nIn 1970, Ball set out for San Francisco. Her car broke down in Austin, and while waiting for repairs she fell in love with the city and decided to stay. It wasn't long before she was performing in local clubs with a progressive country band called Freda And The Firedogs, while beginning to sharpen her songwriting skills. It was around this time that she delved deeply into the music of the great New Orleans piano players, especially Professor Longhair. \"Once I found out about Professor Longhair,\" recalls Ball, \"I knew I had found my direction.\"\n\nWhen Freda And The Firedogs broke up in 1974, Ball launched her solo career, playing clubs around Austin, Houston and Louisiana. She signed with Capitol Records in 1978, debuting with the country-rock album Circuit Queen. Creating and honing her own sound, she released six critically acclaimed titles on the Rounder label during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1990, Ball\u2014collaborating with Angela Strehli and Lou Ann Barton\u2014recorded the hugely successful Dreams Come True on the Antone's label. At the end of 1997, Marcia finished work on a similar \"three divas of the blues\" project for Rounder, this time in the distinguished company of Tracy Nelson and her longtime inspiration, Irma Thomas. The CD, Sing It!, was released in 1998 and was nominated for a Grammy Award.\n\nMarcia Ball has appeared many times on national television over the years, including the PBS special In Performance At The White House along with B.B. King and Della Reese, Austin City Limits and HBO's Treme. She performed in Piano Blues, the film directed by Clint Eastwood included in Martin Scorsese's The Blues series which aired on PBS television nationwide in 2003. Marcia also appeared on The Late Show With David Letterman with The New Orleans Social Club, where she not only reached millions of people, but also helped to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina. In 2012, she had a role in the independent film Angels Sing starring Harry Connick, Jr., Lyle Lovett and Willie Nelson. In 2017 she performed on NPR's A Jazz Piano Christmas, live from The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nBall joined Alligator in 2001 with the release of the critically acclaimed Presumed Innocent. The CD won the 2002 Blues Music Award for Blues Album Of The Year. Her follow-up, So Many Rivers, was nominated for a Grammy Award, and won the 2004 Blues Music Award for Contemporary Blues Album Of The Year as well as the coveted Contemporary Blues Female Artist Of The Year award. Her next release, Live! Down The Road, released in 2005, also garnered a Grammy nomination, as did 2008's Peace, Love & BBQ (the album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Blues Chart). 2010's Grammy-nominated Roadside Attractions and 2014's The Tattooed Lady And The Alligator Man successfully grew her fan base even further. Altogether she holds ten Blues Music Awards, ten Living Blues Awards, and five Grammy Award nominations. She has been inducted into both the Gulf Coast Music Hall Of Fame and the Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame. The Texas State legislature named her the official 2018 Texas State Musician. As her hometown Austin Chronicle says, \"What's not to like about Marcia Ball?\"\n\nSince joining Alligator, Ball has blossomed as a songwriter. Each album has been filled with fresh, original songs, never more so than on Shine Bright. Ball easily draws her listeners deep into her music with instantly memorable melodies and imaginative imagery. Her songs paint vibrant musical pictures richly detailed with recognizable characters, regional flavors, universal themes and colorful scenes, both real and imagined.

The former gravedigger and hotel doorman made his major label debut in 2001 with the Universal release of the stunning Salesmen and Racists. He has recently completed his seventh studio recording, Born On Fire, and his live performances both as a solo performer and as the leader of the ferocious Ike Reilly Assassination have garnered him a cult following and high praise from critics. David Carr of the New York Times said, \u201cIke Reilly is a kind of natural resource, mined from the bedrock of music. All the values that make rock important to people\u2014storytelling, melody, rage, laughter\u2014are part and parcel of every Ike Reilly show I have ever seen. One of the best touring acts in the country, Reilly's band takes it as a personal challenge to upend and amaze every room they play in.\u201d\n\nReilly\u2019s new album, Born On Fire (Rock Ridge Music/ Firebrand Records) captures a songwriter at his best, and a band nimble enough to serve a diverse group of songs that required both recklessness and finesse. The songs on Born On Fire traverse R&B, punk, blues, folk, and rock & roll but are wholly original. Reilly uses humor to combat despair as his songs tell tales of love, lust, struggle, drugs, drinking and the underdog. Born On Fire was mostly recorded at IV Lab in Chicago, IL. Reilly\u2019s longtime friend and Assassination guitar player Phil Karnats (Secret Machines, Polyphonic Spree) worked with Reilly and the band on production and the result is a group of rock & roll songs that would be hard to put in a specific era. Reilly said his hope for the record was that it sound like it could have been made \u201csomewhere between the mid \u201960s and the early 2050\u2019s.\u201d\n\nTom Morello founder of Firebrand Records said, \u201cThere's something in the water in my hometown of Libertyville. Marlon Brando, Adam Jones of Tool, my humble self, and now Ike Reilly. Ike is not just a great, authentic songwriter of the highest caliber but he's always ready to throw down at a union rally... or a bar fight. Ike's songs are a poetic cracked window into the lives of the heartland heroes trying to get by, find and keep love, and carve a place for themselves with humor and dignity. But we love him most because at the drop of a hat he'll travel 1,000 miles to play one song for a dying anti-war veteran.

As a young boy John\u2019s mother knew he would be a singer, \u201che came out singing\u201d she would say. John first appeared on stage at the local Baptist church, in his hometown of Camden Mississippi. John was raised with blues records being played by his grandmother. He dreamed of one day playing his guitar on stage with his idol Muddy Water's.\nAt the age of eighteen John followed the path of his mentors and migrated to Chicago in the fall of 1963. Once in Chicago, John quickly found the blues musicians and formed a band. After the success of his first band The Maintainers, in 1974 John replaced John Watkins in the house band at the world famous Theresa\u2019s Lounge on the South Side of Chicago. Over the course of the next 7 years, John would play with such originators as Sammy Lawhorn, Junior Wells, James Cotton, Buddy Guy, and Lonnie Brooks, all innovators sculpting the sound of Chicago Blues.\nThen in 1979, master songwriter and bassist Willie Dixon invited him to join his band The Chicago All Stars. Traveling through the US, Mexico and Europe, John developed his skills as a rhythm guitarist, a lead-guitar, slide player, and a powerful singer. Another blues master who believed in John Primer was none other than the \u201cHoochie Coochie Man\u201d himself, Muddy Waters. Muddy recruited John not only as a guitarist, but also as an opening act and bandleader. John stayed loyal to Muddy until his untimely death in 1983.\nFresh off the heels of his success with the Muddy Waters Band, John signed on with the legendary Magic Slim. For the next 14 years, he toured with Magic Slim & The Teardrops, bringing tight, house rocking sounds to every corner of the planet. While John was the bandleader of Magic Slim & The Teardrops, they were voted the best blues band in the world year after year and are still today thought of as the inventors of \u201cthe lump\u201d, a style of playing backup rhythm.\nIn 1995 the veteran blues man released his major label debut \u201cThe Real Deal\u201d, on Atlantic Records. Deciding to make it out on his own, he began touring extensively in support of his fourteen solo albums to date, including two CD\u2019s on Blues House Productions, John\u2019s independent record label. John has recorded on several other record labels including: Wolf, Earwig, Telarc, Atlantic, Delta Groove and Raisin Music. He is a songwriter, producer and has taught many other blues musicians.\nJohn Primer has been awarded many awards. He was given 2 Lifetime Achievement Awards in 2013 for Keeping the Blues Alive from the Pennsylvania Blues Society as well as from the Mississippi Valley Blues Society, he has been nominated for a Grammy Award by the Recording Academy in 2010 for Best Traditional Blues Album of the Year, and has been given many nominations year after year by the National Blues Foundation\u2019s Blues Music Awards for the Best Traditional Blues of the Year as well as Best Traditional Blues Musician of the Year.

Just as on Straw in the Wind, there\u2019s a Black Sabbath cover, this time a take on \u201cChanges\u201d that transforms the song into a smooth Memphis-style Al Green soul croon, a nod to the cover by the late Charles Bradley.\n\n\u201cDeath is a part of life that gets looked over,\u201d says Wes. \u201cIt can be a positive or a negative, consequence or reward\u2026 It just finds its way into a lot of our writing.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s title track \u2013 which inspired the mock old-fashioned newspaper album cover representing each of the songs with a tintype illustration \u2013 is an example of the timeliness and timelessness of Old News, a song of hope that focuses on what connects us. \u201cAnd pray for Miss Liberty,\u201d sings Wes. \u201cAnd the crack in Her bell/There\u2019s a tear in Her eye/But Her arm hasn\u2019t fell.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to write a song of hope,\u201d says Bayliss, who notes his wife gave him a hard time about the grammatically incorrect use of \u201cfell.\u201d \u201cForget about those small things which divide us. This is about the things we all have in common. We\u2019re all here living and working, trying to get by, raising families. We all just want to live and die free.\u201d\n\nIn a world torn apart by differences, Old News invites us to partake of music as a common language, reinvigorating classic tropes with up-do-date relevance. The rowdy guitar blues of \u201cBlind Lover\u201d envisions a world where we trust our hearts without judgement, while \u201cCompared to a Soul\u201d offers another of The Steel Woods\u2019 penchant for moral fables, this one a pair of Faustian bargains with the devil, one a man who shoots a friend for cheating at cards, the other a Jezebel stepping out on her Marine lover.\n\nThe opener, \u201cAll of These Years,\u201d offers a ZZ Top-like guitar riff from an unrecorded song, \u201cShooting Scar,\u201d while \u201cWithout You\u201d offers tough love to a friend \u201cin a bad place,\u201d but in a last-minute narrative twist, turns out to be confronting his own reflection in a shattered mirror.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t an easy record to make,\u201d acknowledges Bayliss about the blood on some of these Old News tracks.\n\n\u201cRock That Says My Name\u201d is arguably the album\u2019s raison d\u2019etre, a sprawling multi-part epic that recalls such forebears as Buffalo Springfield\u2019s Jack Nitzsche-produced \u201cExpecting to Fly,\u201d confronting our own lives in the rear-view mirror. The song ends with Wes\u2019 grandfather solemnly intoning the words of Matthew 6:19-21 from the King James Bible, a benediction that leads into the four-song \u201cObituaries\u201d tribute that ends the album. The song was inspired by Wes reading an article about someone purchasing a tombstone in advance.\n\u201cWhat better way to drive yourself to live well than looking at your legacy, what you leave behind when you\u2019re gone,\u201d says Wes. \u201cJust a rock with your name, when you were born and the day you died.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to tour this record and do everything in our power to do it justice and get it out to our fans,\u201d says Bayliss. With Old News, The Steel Woods continue to build on the independent-minded approach to recording, touring and connecting to fans which has defined their career from the start.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://livesessions.npr.org/live/the-steel-woods"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cary Morin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9212936.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Blues, Acoustic Blues, Folk, Roots, Native Americana Fingerstyle Blues, Americana, Contemporary Blues, Fingerstyle Guitar, Folk Blues", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Cary Morin\nCary Morin brings together the great musical traditions of\nAmerica and beyond like no other, from the rocking,\nelectrified world groove of The Atoll, to the pared-down\nacoustic blues of Sing It Louder, which showcases Morin\u2019s\ndeft fingerstyle guitar.\nSing It Louder revisits Morin\u2019s musical origins in Great Falls,\nMontana, where he cut his teeth picking guitar standards at\nneighborhood get-togethers.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town.

A singer-songwriter from Austin, Texas, Clayton Gardner is poised for the height of his career with two Top 20 albums on his record and a fresh country sound that is true to his roots, and yet rivals the best of today\u2019s hit country.\nYou would think he's done this forever, but it wasn't until a dorm room at Texas A&M when he picked up a guitar and found his gift. Early on Clayton had the opportunity to co-write and perform with chart toppers like Pat Green, Jack Ingram, Josh Abbott, Kevin Fowler, Aaron Watson, Wade Bowen, Cody Johnson, and Casey Donahew. Thanks to these collaborations and challenges from his peers, he\u2019s certainly come a long way quickly. Clayton credits the greats Keith Whitley and George Strait as his inspiration, but it\u2019s his own drive and talent that has brought him this far.\nClayton\u2019s most recent release \u201cUnder the Lights,\u201d produced by Aaron Eshuis, is already his highest selling album to date, with the hit \u201cBuy You a Drink\u201d in the Top 10 on Texas radio. The album debuted with single \"Don't Miss It,\" which catalogs life moments and a reminder that you've only got one shot, don't miss it.\nWith \u201cUnder the Lights,\u201d Clayton\u2019s musical style and experience continues to grow. Evidenced in the masterful arrangements and his heart on the line with hopeful lyrics like \u201cWhat If We Fall,\u201d he delivers a more full, progressive, yet \u2018still Clayton\u2019 sound that postures his career for a new level.\nHis sophomore album \u201cLUCKY 7\u201d (2013), produced by Grammy-nominated Mack Damon, charted in iTunes Top 20 country albums, with two singles (\u201cSomething About You\u201d and \u201cTable for Two\u201d) also hitting Top 20. He also earned two Top 20 spots on iTunes with \u201cSettle Down\u201d and \u201cHappy Ending\u201d from his \u201cHere to Stay\u201d EP. LUCKY 7\u2019s \u201cTable for Two\u201d has since become a wedding favorite as it now stands in the ranks of Texas Music Charts Top 100 Songs (#45) of 2014.", "otherInfo": "Facebook Live 5/9/2020 at 8PM"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tom Graham Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8171122.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Rock, Folk, Classic Rock, Acoustic, Singer Songwriter, Classic Blues, Ameriana", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tom Graham is a musician and singer-songwriter based in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet.

March 2020 brought her newest recording, Bull Frogs Croon (and Other Songs), which Paste describes as \u201ccaptivating and American Songwriter describes as \u201ca quietly stirring collection\u2026fraught, delicate, and soothing all at once\u201d.\n\nDeemed \u201ca vocalist of unerring instinct\u201d by the New York Times, Aoife has worked with some of the preeminent names in music: from Alison Krauss (who recorded O\u2019Donovan\u2019s song \u201cLay My Burden Down\u201d for her Grammy-winning album Paper Airplane) to Yo-Yo Ma, Aoife has proven to be a savvy and generous collaborator. Her most recent collaboration is I\u2019m With Her, the band formed with Sara Watkins and Sarah Jarosz. The trio\u2019s debut album See You Around (2018) was hailed as \"willfully open-hearted\u201d by NPR Music, while The Guardian called it \"ethereal and purposeful.\u201d They received a GRAMMY Award for their original song \u201cCall My Name\u201d in 2020 for Best American Roots Song.\n\nAs a solo artist, O\u2019Donovan has released two studio albums. 2016\u2019s In the Magic Hour is an \u201cexhilarating and exploratory\u201d (MOJO) song cycle replete with the singer\u2019s honeyed vocals and a gauzy, frictionless atmosphere. The New York Times named that album\u2019s \u201cThe King of All Birds\u201d one of their Best Songs Of 2016. Following her debut network TV performance on CBS Saturday, Aoife ended that year releasing a live album entitled \"Man In A Neon Coat: Live From Cambridge\" with her In The Magic Hour touring band.\n\nAoife\u2019s debut solo album, 2013's Fossils, is a moody collection of original songs with a country lilt. The record was featured on a number of year-end lists, including NPR Music, American Songwriter, New York Magazine, and No Depression. In 2018, Aoife contributed an original song titled \u201cAre You There\u201d to the filmWhat They Had, an official selection at both Sundance and Toronto Film Festivals.\n\nO'Donovan spent the preceding decade as co-founder and frontwoman of the string band, Crooked Still. She is the featured vocalist on The Goat Rodeo Sessions, the GRAMMY-winning album by Yo-Yo Ma, Stuart Duncan, Edgar Meyer, and Chris Thile.

Thanks to his classic sensibilities, he\u2019s been heralded as the heir to George Strait\u2019s throne. Yet with one listen to his newest hit, \u201cWhere It\u2019s At,\u201d it\u2019s obvious the young Tennessean knows how to combine his traditional influences with an edgy intensity that places him at the vanguard of today\u2019s contemporary country scene.\n\nIt\u2019s that ability to fuse his country roots with a progressive musical vision that makes Lynch one of today\u2019s most successful young artists. His self-titled Broken Bow Records debut hit No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Top Country Albums chart and the lead single, \u201cCowboys and Angels,\u201d exceeded platinum sales status while earning Lynch a legion of devoted fans. His follow up single, the sexy up tempo \u201cShe Cranks My Tractor,\u201d became a No. 1 video on GAC\u2019s Top 20 Country Countdown and the accolades continued to pour in, among them Rolling Stone heralding Lynch as \u201cThe New Hat in Town\u201d in the magazine\u2019s 2013 Best of Rock issue. Lynch\u2019s career momentum continued as he opened for Keith Urban on his recent Light the Fuse Tour and earned critical praise from American Songwriter, Billboard, Country Weekly, Elle, The Los Angeles Times, People and USA Today, to name a few.\n\nAt the heart of it all stands a young man with an abundance of raw talent and an unwavering work ethic that seized his moment and made the most of it. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy what music can do,\u201d Lynch says with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll do a show and have people come up to me in tears because they are getting to share a story about how my songs have affected their life. That\u2019s so inspiring. I know now that a song can really affect someone\u2019s life and that\u2019s what makes me want to keep doing the best I can do.\u201d\n\nAfter the tremendous success of his debut album, one might expect Lynch to be nervous about recording his sophomore project. Instead he approached the task with confidence and a renewed sense of purpose. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about the songs,\u201d he relates. \u201cI\u2019m so confident in these songs, I can\u2019t wait for this album to come out. As a songwriter I want to see what people gravitate towards.\u201d\n\nWith it\u2019s upbeat lyric and insinuating groove, people are already gravitating toward the lead single \u201cWhere It\u2019s At.\u201d \u201cIt just came to life when we were recording it,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cMusically it\u2019s a new groove that we haven\u2019t done before and it\u2019s a sweet song. It says there\u2019s no better place on the planet than with somebody you love. It\u2019s a great message. That\u2019s what I like to do with my music - hopefully impact people in a positive way.\u201d\n\nIn recording the new album, Lynch again teamed with Brett Beavers and Luke Wooten, who produced his debut, and also worked with Mickey Jack Cones (Jason Aldean/ Joe Nichols). \u201cMickey has brought a whole new arsenal of tools to the game and took me to a new place vocally that I haven\u2019t been,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cBrett, Luke and Mickey all have their strengths and I get to have the best of both worlds, so it\u2019s awesome. We\u2019ve got a great partnership.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Lynch has crafted a musically inventive and lyrically substantive album filled with memorable songs \u2013 and he\u2019s never sounded more seasoned and confident. \u201cHell of a Night\u201d percolates with an edgy energy while \u201cSing it to Me\u201d is a song Lynch describes as sexual chocolate. \u201cIt\u2019s a song that\u2019s so sexy,\u201d he grins. \u201cIt\u2019s about a person that\u2019s poison but you just can\u2019t get enough.\u201d\n\nAnother highlight is the beautiful ballad \u201cYour Daddy\u2019s Boots\u201d that chronicles the feelings of a groom as he watches his bride dance with her father, hoping he can fill his boots. \u201cI wrote it with Tim Nichols and Josh Leo, who I wrote \u2018Cowboys and Angels\u2019 with. There is some sort of magical thing that happens with those guys,\u201d Lynch says.\n\n\u201cMiddle of Nowhere\u201d explores a complicated relationship that Lynch says more closely mirrors his own life. \u201cIt\u2019s about being stuck in the friend zone and wondering if you should take a friendship into no man\u2019s land where there\u2019s no return,\u201d he explains with a smile. \u201cOnce you kiss a friend, you\u2019re not a friend anymore. All of a sudden you are something bigger and hopefully better, but sometimes it ends up crashing and burning pretty hard. So there\u2019s that fear factor.\n\nThough he didn\u2019t write \u201cWhat You Wanna Hear,\u201d Lynch says he can relate to the tune penned by Rhett Akins, Ben Hayslip and Ashley Gorley. \u201cI\u2019m definitely a down home guy. If I have a day off, I\u2019m driving the country roads just chillin\u2019 out or going home to turkey hunt and going fishing on the river.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Tullahoma, Tennessee, Lynch lived the kind of rural life celebrated by country music and his album reflects those roots. \u201c \u2018After Party\u2019 is me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s me and my crew back home. We lived for the weekends and Friday night football games. We lived for going out to Lazy Branch Road. We\u2019d go cruising there and then we\u2019d get to the boat ramp where we\u2019d build a fire and drink beer that we snuck away from somebody\u2019s house or bought with a fake ID. We\u2019d play music and try to meet some new girls from the next county over.\u201d\n\nHis parents urged him to attend college and get his degree (he graduated Pre-Med from David Lipscomb University) but music was always his dream. He grew up listening to his heroes--- George Strait, Alan Jackson and Garth Brooks. \u201cThey are such icons and seem so untouchable, but I thought, \u2018Man that would be awesome to be like them.\u2019 You just start taking steps,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cI took a step and got in a band in high school. I took a step and came to Nashville and talked my way into the The Bluebird Caf\u00e9. I took another step and recorded a little five-song album in a basement in one day. These are little milestones and you don\u2019t even realize they are huge building blocks to where we are today. It\u2019s always something I dreamed of doing. I\u2019m just glad I was dumb enough to give it a shot.\u201d\n\nDustin Lynch is living the dream he worked so hard to achieve and he\u2019s happy to walk the line between country music\u2019s past and it\u2019s future, a link between it\u2019s most honored traditions and it\u2019s edgier new direction. \u201cI want to do everything I can possibly do to be the best I can be,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cI never give myself a day off. If you have a list of things that I\u2019ve accomplished, I probably couldn\u2019t tell you a tenth of them because it\u2019s always about what\u2019s happening next. Every time we take that stage is a nice little pat on the back, a nice little present. I love what I\u2019m doing right now. Musically I\u2019ve been blessed to be able to walk a line that is a bit more traditional, but I can sprinkle some newer influences on top of that. I wear a cowboy hat. It\u2019s who I am and weirdly enough, in country music cowboy hats are few and far between right now. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s that way. The door is open for a young guy like me to come in and carry that torch. I\u2019m happy to do so.\u201d\n\n# # #", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Craigie ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9256972.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "John Craigie", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Renowned for his eloquent Americana style, engaging live shows, and off-the-cuff clever observations, John Craigie carries on the legacy of classic singer-songwriters, while blazing a trail of his own.\n\nRecently, that trail twisted and turned into new territory for the Portland, OR performer who The Stranger appropriately dubbed, \u201cthe lovechild of John Prine and Mitch Hedberg.\u201d His music speaks loud to both audiences and fellow artists. Todd Snider notably hand-delivered a gift on-stage, and Chuck Norris has sent fan mail. His fifth full-length album, No Rain, No Rose boasted two collaborations with Gregory Alan Isakov, namely \u201cI Am California\u201d and \u201cHighway Blood.\u201d Both quickly cracked One Million Spotify streams and counting, as his knack for a captivating narrative and rustic aural palettes powered the 13-track offering together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about transparency,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe storytelling enables listeners to relate.

He started his music career by busking in the streets of Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, England, etc, drawing crowds ranging in size from zero (character building) to 50 (which drew the local police). Saint John made his home in Venice Beach CA amongst the hippies, poets, the homeless, gangs, and the modern beatniks and gypsies, to write and record his first two records, \u2018Halo\u2019 and \u2018Mercy\u2019.\n\nBoth \u2018Halo\u2019 and \u2018Mercy\u2019 were released and shared on the internet all around the world, creating thousands of new fans and finding their way into people\u2019s lives, from first dates to funerals. Online music magazines found and wrote about them, and fans shared the music they found. Saint John and the Revelations have also played numerous shows in Southern California (Hotel Caf\u00e9, Genghis Cohen, The Galaxy Theatre, etc), toured the Pacific Northwest, and opened for many acts, including Colin Hay (Men At Work), Wang Chung, Naked Eyes, VAST, and many others.\n\nSaint John recently started recording some new songs with Peter Buck (R.E.M.), Bill Rieflin (R.E.M., KMFDM, Ministry), and Scott McCaughey (R.E.M., Baseball Project) and produced by Paul Fox (XTC, Bjork, 10,000 Maniacs, Wallflowers) . Saint John has gone from being a hitchhiking street performer to recording songs with a legendary rock-and-roll artist like Peter Buck, and isn\u2019t planning on slowing down anytime soon.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Felix Cartal LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10367635.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Electronic, House, Dance Pop", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Felix Cartal built his career on pushing the boundaries of preordained limits. As the music project of Taelor Deitcher, the Vancouver-based and JUNO-nominated \u201cProducer of the Year\u201d is perched on the intersection of indie and electronica, distilling the emotional details that contemporary producers often overlook. Though endorsed by Billboard as one of \"13 Dance Artists Who Dominated 2017\u201d, it\u2019s Cartal\u2019s history of dabbling in DIY punk bands that capitalizes on his talent as a lyricist, and elevates his production into the pop realm. Em- bracing the unapologetic vulnerability of songwriting, Cartal forges personal narratives and cinematic soundscapes from a genre that shies away from the heartfelt.\nAlthough Cartal has no interest in being a vocalist, his ability to manipulate unlikely phrases into potent hooks leaves him oscillating between the dual role of writing lyrics for his songs while also producing their soundscapes. Cartal began weaving words in basement bands during his childhood, where he spent afternoons writing songs with friends. Stumbling upon Radiohead\u2019s KID A signaled validation for the producer to fuse his singer-songwriter roots with an electronic palette, and matured into a novel approach to electronic dance produc- tion. These experiences paved the foundation for a producer who can not only cull an an- them from the quirky play on words that underlies a track like \u201cStop Being Yourself\u201d, but also produce a radio hit from the simple idea of \u201cMood\u201d.\nThe release of his third studio album, Next Season, comes as a moment of clarity for the producer. Written over the course of 3 years, the record sees Cartal exercising his uncanny ability to amplify the intimacy of a poignant lyric with accessible melodies. Despite that the record is crafted with an arsenal of hand-selected vocalists\u2014including Daniela Andrade, Coeur De Pirate, and Iselin\u2014it comes together with an agile pop sensibility that\u2019s as nostal- gic as it is invigorating. With \u201cGet What You Give\u201d certified Gold in Canada, it\u2019s clear that Next Season\u2019s unparalleled emotional depth doesn\u2019t abandon the commercial viability that continues to propel Cartal into radio airplay\u2014instead, it embraces the sincerity and opti- mism that underwrites self-reflection, and marks a coming of age for the sonic identity of Felix Cartal.\nIt took a series of immersive studio sessions for Cartal to craft a record that brims with the sort of lush instrumentals that mark a milestone in a producer\u2019s career. Where \u201cSomething to Live For\u201d and \u201cWith You\u201d found the producer feeling detached from his music, Next Sea- son is a technical feat\u2014though mounting success doesn\u2019t harden Cartal\u2019s humble and light- hearted nature. Getting his start on Steve Aoki\u2019s Dim Mak Records, the producer has col- laborated with industry heavyweights like Kaskade and R3hab, and pads his chameleonic discography with official remixes of Zedd, Selena Gomez, Galantis, Dillon Francis and more. With over 160 million streams on Spotify, it\u2019s still a surreal surprise for the Canadian artist to stumble upon his own music on the radio. Citing international performances at festi- vals like Tomorrowland and EDC, Felix Cartal stands as one of Canada\u2019s most dynamic ex- ports, continuously evolving within a space that\u2019s hinged on predictability.", "otherInfo": "performing as Glass Petals...\nmy other project...\nclub music only."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Joe Kye LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10133866.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Folk, Looping, World Music, Indie Pop, Indie String Pop", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born in Korea and raised in Seattle, singer/composer/violinist-looper Joe Kye has drawn rave reviews in his relatively fledgling career, \u201cdischarging world[s] of emotion\u201d and delivering \u201cdivine messages\u201d with his lush string loops and eclectic style (Guitar World).

Hailing from the Central Louisiana town of Alexandria, David has steadily built his reputation as an entertainer, playing high energy, musically diverse shows driven by what may be his biggest asset \u2013 that powerful, soul-drenched voice. America got a taste of David\u2019s promising talents when he made the finals of Nashville Star in 2007. Now David is delivering on that promise releasing brand new music showcasing what his followers across the country have been raving about for years.\nDavid\u2019s musical education began early in life as a kid. He was taking in the pop-influenced country sounds of Kenny Rogers from his dad\u2019s record collection before rocking out at Metallica and Guns-n-Roses concerts with his Junior High buddies. The new wave of 90\u2019s country, particularly Garth Brooks\u2019 seminal No Fences album, had a big impact on David. David\u2019s growing obsession for music soon gave way to performing for audiences; he says \u201cI never really wanted to do anything else besides singing and entertaining\u201d. Further musical explorations led David to expand his R&B vocal skills, singing in a Juniorr High group styled after the harmonies of Boyz II Men. By his early 20s David had started playing shows in nearby Hammond, La where he met a local producer. That chance meeting led to a few recording sessions and the beginning of David\u2019s trips to Nashville to take his first swing at the big time.\nIn early 2000, David made further connections in Music City and began working on his first full length album DSR with some of Country Music\u2019s top musicians and songwriters. Over the next few years David toured the country; performing frequently gave David an invaluable opportunity to develop his distinct vocal style and energy-driven live show. \u201cThere\u2019s an experience and wisdom in that environment,\u201d David says, \u201cyou learn to be professional at all times, whether you are playing for two people or a crowd of thousands\u201d.\nOpportunity came knocking in Spring 2007 when he was selected to star as a contestant on the new season of TV\u2019s premiere country competition Nashville Star. Besides the invaluable national exposure the show brought him, David also performed on the 40-city Nashville Star tour and had a chance to interact with many of the nearly half million fans who voted for him. Nashville Star also introduced David to many Music Row veterans, in particular Shawn Pennington, the former manager of mulit-platinum acts Big & Rich, Alabama\u2019s Randy Owen and new group Thompson Square. Shawn was very impressed with what he saw in David\u2019s live show during the Nashville Star tour. \u201cAt the time I was working with Big & Rich and their live show is what really set them apart. They owned the room every night and I\u2019ve seen David do that exact same thing,\u201d Shawn says. \u201cDavid can go into a room where no one knows his songs, and by the end, they are all giving him a standing ovation\u201d.\nBy 2008, David and Shawn were working together finding songs and beginning the process of recording a new album. David also continued collaborating on songs of his own with some of Nashville\u2019s top writers. All I Really Wanted to Say was the first album released on David\u2019s own independent label DSR Entertainment in 2010. His hit single \u201cTwenty Years Late\u201d rocketed to #56 on the Billboard Chart. David continues to successfully tour performing his own brand of country music to riveted crowds earning him a new legion of dedicated fans.\nDavid has also been hard at work writing, producing and recording his newest project due to release later this year. He explains, \u201cI hope this latest EP will show my fans the growth I\u2019ve made as a songwriter and artist, while exploring the depth of my musical influences.

Jackson sings of heaven and hell, beauty and grit \u2013 Jackson sings of real life.\nBorn one of eleven siblings to parents of migrant workers, his life began in Moody, Texas, a small town just north of Austin. It was a nomadic existence stripped of the comforts and security that most take for granted. Jackson\u2019s roots instead became deep seeded in his love for music, a passion passed on to Jackson at an early age by his father who would steal away whenever possible to see and hear country greats like Waylon, Willie, and Billy Joe Shaver perform, often with Jackson in tow.\n\nJackson's adolescence was spent bouncing from one migrant labor town to another, finally settling in a small farming town in Washington State. After graduating high school, he moved back to Texas for a while but soon left to try and make his mark in Nashville. There, Jackson found work as a songwriter, but life for Jackson was still a steep uphill climb, and after a couple of tough and frustrating years, Jackson had to face the hard truth that Nashville was not the \u201chome\u201d for which he had spent his whole life searching.\n\nFrom New York City to Los Angeles, Jackson has finally found his rightful home, ironically right back where his life began -- in Texas.\nCombining his real life experiences with old school country elements, and throwing in the flavors of punk and southern rock to create a style all his own, Jackson Taylor continues to break the rules of traditional country music with his straightforward lyrics, \"take it or leave it\" approach, intense live performances, and the drive and determination of a freight train. The end result can not be pigeon holed into any style and can only be rightfully defined as what it is: \u201cJackson Taylor Music\u201d.\n\nRecently signed to the Smith Entertainment Group (Stoney LaRue and No Justice, catalogue on Cross Canadian Ragweed and Randy Rogers Band, the Live at Billy Bob\u2019s Texas line), Jackson Taylor is ready to take country music by storm with his latest release, aptly entitled Dark Days, which was produced and engineered in the mountains of Washington State at Cascade Studios. The CD (produced by Jackson Taylor and Ronnie Belaire, and engineered by Allen Larsen) contains 12 tracks and features the debut single \u201cLonely,\u201d a tale of emotion that Jackson knows all too well. Other tracks include \u201cOutlaws Ain\u2019t Wanted Here No More,\u201d which is a true account of Jackson's experiences in the country music industry that eventually pushed him to take his own musical path. Also featured on the new album is a cover of the tune \u201cHonky Tonk Heroes,\u201d written by Billy Joe Shaver, one of Jackson\u2019s favorite music outlaws.\n\nBilly Joe Shaver summed up it up best when he said, \u201cJackson\u2019s songs are so real and honest, you know straight off he's been there and done that.

The music hits PRODIGY-style depth charges and EBM club elements on its way to IAMX-style expressiveness and vocal hooks that wouldn't sound out of place if sung by MARILYN MANSON. Presented with a provocatively dark, lace-filtered visual style, the group is altogether monstrously seductive.\n\nThe 12 songs on \"Requiem for the Hyperreal\" weave a dark, dynamic tapestry that varies from the industrial drive of \"Malediction\" to the musicbox slither of \"Milk and Honey\", with Pete Crane's lyrics describing a personification of fear over swampy textures in the song \"Here in the Dark\" and carving out a manifesto for self-creation over the heavy, broken beats of \"Something to Say\".\n\n\"Cheshire Grin\" will be the first single from the album dropping on August 25. Otherwordly sound design billows against hard-hitting industrial structures in the darkly maddening title song. Inspired by the laudanum-fuelled and reality-fluid Alice in Wonderland, the single also features remixes by Grammy Award Winner CHRIS VRENNA (Nine Inch Nails/Marilyn Manson and composer of the score of American McGee\u2019s Alice videogame), LEAETHER STRIP and AMBASSADOR 21, and artwork created by the equally fantastical and renowned Natalie Shau.\n\nFar from a dream, \u201cRequiem for a Hyperreality\u201d will hit the real world digitally and physically September 29 2017.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Vanilla Pop LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9306608.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Big Band, 80s, 70s, Pop", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Us: http://vanillapop.com Our Blog: http://dearvanillapop.blogspot.com My Solo Show: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheAlanAllenshow", "otherInfo": "You love us live, now get intimate with us as we perform brand new material from the comfort of our own pajamas.

His subjects fall somewhere in between old cult movies from the turn of the century to vintage Americana \u2014 between John Wayne and Ed Wood. These subjects in any other writer\u2019s care may not coalesce as seamlessly as they do in the hands of Pickard, who ties them together with wit, passion and heart, most recently on display in the Thunderbird Winos\u2019 third record, Heavy on the Heart.\n\nThe album's cover consists of Lichtenstein-inspired art with a mustard bottle labeled with a heart squirting mustard onto a floating hot dog on the backdrop of outer space. The mustard and the hot dog are imbued with a sense of abject silliness but also sustain a deeper meaning.\n\n\u201cWell, when we named the record Heavy on the Heart, I meant it in the same way you would describe to a hot dog vendor that you wanted him to go heavy on the mustard \u2026 and the mustard\u2019s gotta go on something, I guess,\u201d Pickard explains. \u201cI guess hot dogs are pretty heavy on your heart, too,\u201d he adds, \u201cand I figured a hamburger floating in space would just be too normal.\u201d\n\nThe hot dog-mustard motif shows the dichotomy of Pickard, and this album in particular. It embraces both the ridiculous and the serious earnestly and in equal measure.\n\nPickard has been playing in the Dallas music community since the days when live music abounded on Lower Greenville, when people could flock to outdoor graffiti galleries such as the trestle bridge by Flagpole Hill or the Good-Latimer tunnel in Deep Ellum. (Look it up, it was magnificent!) In a way, you could say that Pickard grew with the city, or grew as the city changed. In one of the album's slower tracks, \"Light Rail,\" he laments over soaring pedal steel guitar the city's drive toward the future and its proclivity to occasionally barrel through its past, and past art, in the process: \u201cThe map\u2019s always changing / The roads aren\u2019t the same / tunnels full of dirt / buried in the name of a light rail train.\u201d\n\nWith Pickard, such sentimentality is not in combat but balanced with such off-the-wall tracks as the opener to the album, \u201cUFB,\u201d which \u2014 of course \u2014 stands for \u201cUnidentified Flying Banana.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had seen this documentary about UFOs years ago where a guy was talking about seeing one and saying that it looked 'just like a big ol\u2019 banana\u2019 and then when I was driving back to town from Louisiana one day the song sort of wrote itself.\u201d\n\nThe subject matter alone makes this song easily one of the oddest to come out of Dallas in recent memory. This is reinforced by the music, which recalls the pulp of a detective novel with a hint of old Reverend Horton Heat.\n\n\u201cI feel like with my first record it was a lot of polish and less substance and the second was almost the opposite. This one\u2019s in the middle and a lot of that is because I have my band together now; it\u2019s road-tested,\u201d Pickard says.\n\nThe mixture of polish and substance is maybe most apparent on the title track \u201cHeavy on the Heart,\u201d which falls as the album\u2019s only solo acoustic performance. A sparse chorus reminiscent of Tom Petty reflects the resignation one feels when considering the ills of this world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heavy on the heart\u2026\u201d Pickard writes as the music fades to silence. \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\nThe track's sparse acoustic feel is almost by necessity and not by design.\n\n\u201cThat song was actually written after we finished tracking this record as sort of an afterthought,\" Pickard says. \"I\u2019ve noticed that whenever I record an album, I\u2019ll write a perfect song right after, just too late to put it on, but this time we were able to get it on there.\u201d\n\nLike many albums, Heavy on the Heart could be said to be a culmination of its influences. As with the Petty-inspired title track, there's the Dwight Yoakam-inspired song \u201cMississippi Girl\u201d (which could have easily been the record\u2019s first radio single if not for its profanity-laden splendor \u2014 if only Pickard could go back to the studio, re-record and \u201cafford to take out the \u2018fucks\u2019\u201d) and the Bob Wills-inspired Texas swing song \u201cTexas Heaven.\u201d\n\nThe way Pickard lauds his predecessors is most perfectly represented in the culminatory \u201cChicken and Jesus,\u201d where he ties all of these forefathers together with a series of this-or-thats. Pickard either needs \u201cJesus or Otis [Redding],\u201d \u201cVision or Jim [Morrison],\u201d \u201cBreakfast or Elvis.\u201d\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure. After this record, the world and, more importantly, Dallas, needs more of Justin Pickard and the Thunderbird Winos.\n\n-Jamie Vahala / Dallas Observer / March 19, 2020", "otherInfo": "9pm central on Justin Pickard and the Thunderbird Winos Facebook page"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mike Zito LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9436448.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Blues Rock, Blues & Rhythm Power Trio, Electric Blues, Blues & Rock, Blues, Blues Singer-songwriter, Blues And Roots, Blues Guitar, Blues & Originals., Roots & Blues", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "He may be one of the most lauded artists in the contemporary blues arena today, and rightfully so, but for Mike Zito, the thing that counts the most is maintaining his honesty, authenticity and integrity. Those are the qualities that have steered Zito\u2019s career since the beginning and continue to define every effort he\u2019s offered since.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have nothing to hide; it seems my honesty is what people relate to most,\u201d he once told Vintage Guitar magazine. \u201cAnders (Osborne) told me early on, \u2018If you don\u2019t believe what you\u2019re singing, you\u2019ll never be a good singer.\u2019 I try not to write fluff; I try to make every word count.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat point became convincingly clear with his last record 2018\u2019s First Class Life, a collection of songs that detailed his journey from addiction to sobriety and the subsequent success he achieved through his award-winning body of work. A multiple award winner and nominee, Zito has built his career on an ability to tap into tradition while maintaining contemporary credence all at the same time.\n\n\n\nZito\u2019s upcoming album -- his 16th -- due this November on Ruf Records and descriptively titled Rock N Roll: A Tribute to Chuck Berry, finds him broadening his boundaries still further even as it marks a return to his roots. The album consists of 20 Chuck Berry classics performed by Zito and an impressive array of 21 guest guitarists, among them Joe Bonamassa, Walter Trout, Eric Gales, Robben Ford, Sonny Landreth, Luther Dickinson, Albert Castiglia, Anders Osborne and, significantly, Chuck\u2019s grandson, Charles Berry III.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis was a very special project for me,\u201d Zito says. \u201cI lived in Chuck\u2019s hometown of St. Louis for 32 years, and I worked at a small musical instrument store where his drummer also happened to be employed. Chuck\u2019s son would drop by on occasion as well. He was an icon, and rightfully so. I\u2019ve been playing his songs since I was a kid. Needless to say, he was a tremendous influence on my career, and, of course, on many other musicians\u2019 as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nProduced by Zito himself, the album was recorded at his own Marz Studios and mixed and mastered by David Farrell. \u201cWe recorded the basic tracks and then sent them to each guest musician,\u201d Zito recalls. \u201cThey added their contributions and then sent the files back to us. The process took a year to complete.\u201d\n\n\n\nNaturally, patience and perseverance have been Zito\u2019s stock and trade since the beginning. He began playing guitar at the age of five, and by the time he reached his late teens, he was already a fixture on the local St. Louis music scene. He initially released his music independently and then signed with Eclecto Groove Records in 2008. \"Pearl River,\" the title track of his 2009 album for the label, won Song of the Year at the Blues Music Awards and marked his first collaboration with Cyril Nevill, with whom he\u2019d later work in the Royal Southern Brotherhood. A steady succession of critically acclaimed albums followed, culminating in 2011\u2019s Greyhound, which was nominated for Best Rock Blues Album at that year\u2019s Blue Music Awards ceremony in Memphis. Two years later, he signed with Ruf Records and released Gone to Texas, the story of how he gained his sobriety, offered an emotional homage to the state that left an indelible imprint on his entire life. It also marked the debut of his band, the Wheel.\n\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Zito also played an integral role in the super group of sorts, Royal Southern Brotherhood. The group released two albums and a DVD, Songs from the Road - Live in Germany, winner of the year\u2019s Blues Music Award for Best DVD. He also made his mark behind the boards by producing albums for Samantha Fish, Albert Castiglia, Ally Venable, Jeremiah Johnson, Jimmy Carpenter, and many others.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the accolades keep coming. His album Make Blues Not War debuted on the Billboard Blues Album Chart at number one and garnered him recognition as the 2018 Rock Blues Artist of the Year at the Blues Music Awards. Last year\u2019s First Class Life followed suit, also entering the charts at number one. Alternate Root magazine insisted that \u201cThe First Class Life that Mike Zito titles his upcoming album can be heard in the sweet sound of Blue Soul rising like heat waves from his guitar and his vocal.\u201d American Blues Scene said \u201cMike Zito\u2019s return to the blues is, in a word, triumphant!\u201d No Depression declared, \u201cOnce again, Zito has delivered the goods, a first class package with no postage due.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, with Rock N Roll: A Tribute to Chuck Berry, Mike Zito again does what he does best, making an album that\u2019s humble, heartfelt, skilled and sublime....and, to paraphrase Chuck himself, letting it rock all at the same time.", "otherInfo": "Saturday Night Live in the Studio with Mike Zito!\nLive Stream presented by Mike Zito and the Big Blues Bender!\nSaturday, May 9th @ 9:00 PM Central time on facebook.com/mikezitomusic & facebook.com/bigbluesbender\nMike will take requests.... sing and play guitar LIVE.\nJoin Mike for an interactive and intimate night of music.\n............................\nThis is a free event, tipping would be greatly appreciated."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sunset Sessions LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:15 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "10 Barrel Brewing Co is hosting local San Diego artist performances from their rooftop every Saturday evening at 7:15pm.

The duo\u2019s first release, \u2018You\u2019re So High\u2019 reached Number 3 on Hype Machine and has since picked up over 6 million plays online. \u2018Seeing is Believing\u2019 saw the girls collaborate with Shadow Child, \u2018Feel The Fire\u2019 came on Anjunadeep followed by \u2018Your Eyes\u2019 which saw them team up with Beatport in the first ever Artist Partnership on the streaming platform. Their \u2018California Love\u2019 EP dropped in November 2015 & supported by their North America Tour it undoubtedly was the motivation behind such a connected & embracing audience. 2016 saw further collaborations with Erick Morillo, T\u00e2ches & Forrest as well continued releases on their own imprint NYX Music. 2015 was a pivotal year for Eli & Fur. Tipped by Beatport as 2015 Artists to Watch, they went on to pick up nominations for \u2018Best Newcomer\u2019 in The DJ Awards, \u2018Best Producer\u2019 in the Bass Music Awards, \u2018Best Breakthrough DJ\u2019 at DJ Magazine\u2019s \u2018Best of British\u2019 and more recently \u2018Best Breakthrough Artist\u2019 in the 2016 IDMA Awards. The girls rolled out 2015 with a Thelma & Louise inspired tour through North America. Documenting every step of their 15 date tour with Go-Pro, taking planes, train, automobiles and boats; dropping into radio stations, studio sessions, TV networks and clubs along the way. It was an unusual way to approach the US market but a life-time dream inspired by two of the coolest women ever to grace the big screen. The end result is the self-made video for California Love. With an impressive 2015 in the bag, 2016 was a year of continued success - a defining year for Eli & Fur. Notably the girls were awarded with the PRS Momentum fund in partnership with England Arts Council & Spotify. Not only a nod of approval from three of the most influential organisations in the business but an injection of funds at a crucial point to go towards further recordings. Their touring stepped up a notch in 2016 with some key look shows, playing alongside the likes of Carl Cox at his infamous Space residency, continued support from Ushuaia\u2019s notorious ANTS as well as support from Nic Fanciulli\u2019s Social Festival. Further highlights saw Eli & Fur play at Woogie Weekend, Los Angeles, Manchester\u2019s The Warehouse Project, Berlin\u2019s Kraftwerk and Circoloco\u2019s first ever event in Los Angeles.

This year, he followed up the album with his most intimate, and perhaps most singer-songwriter-y album to date: Kings Corner. The songs started (mostly) as much of his early, unrecorded work from over a decade and a half ago, that were never properly released. He intended to record these songs to give away to fans, but as he worked on it, he realized the songs could use work and be a legit album. These songs deal with drug addiction, death, grief, and overwhelming sadness. They hit hard and still resonate. \u2014 Aaron Carnes", "otherInfo": "West Coast Tour show! 8pm EST at\nhttp://www.youtube.com/bryanmcpherson"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Adam Auburn LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8169155.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "House Music", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Firmly planted in the riches of house music history, but neatly poised to move forward into the future, Adam Auburn has dedicated his life to the music he loves. The buzz probably all began for Adam in 2004, after winning the first ever Traxsource DJ Competition, sparking a whirlwind of international attention for the East Coast native. In 2008, the ginger-bearded, house music advocate moved to Los Angeles, where he was blessed to be discovered by Insomniac, placed on display at their weekly events at Exchange, and ultimately the main stage at Nocturnal Wonderland, Escape from Wonderland, and EDC Week Las Vegas. Auburn's unique versatility as a DJ has allowed him to play alongside a wide range of Artists, including everyone from Kaskade to Diplo, Knife Party, TJR, Oliver Heldens, Duke Dumont, John Digweed, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, The Martinez Brothers, Hot Since 82, Claude Von Stroke, MK, Derrick Carter, Mark Farina, Louie Vega and so many more across 15 years of DJing. Auburn's deep love of house music can not only be found in the infectious energy that resonates from his DJ Performances, but also through the award winning house music events his production company, Auburn Events, has put on for over 10 years -- including Afternoon Delight (#2 Pool Party in the US - Thrillist 2015). In 2014, Adam began working as the Director of Marketing & Entertainment at Exchange LA, continuing to do whatever he can help push the music he loves forward into the future.", "otherInfo": "Join me for a live set at The Dojo interactive experience this Saturday, May 9th at 8pm PT\n\nMore info + RSVP to get access (first come first serve): http://smartURL.it/dojo-rsvp"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Superet LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9021796.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Los Angeles, California", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Superet is a band.\n\n'Bone Bag' is available everywhere.\n\nListen / Download on your favorite platform: http://smarturl.it/BoneBag", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "OMNOM LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8810123.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "It's an Insomniac Records House Party!

The Black Moods' three members \u2014 frontman/guitarist Josh Kennedy, drummer Chico Diaz and bassist Jordan Hoffman \u2014 aren't looking to reinvent the wheel. Instead, they're piling into a vehicle that's existed for decades, souping up the engine to suit their contemporary needs, and steering those wheels toward their own rock & roll horizon.\n\nThe band formed in Tempe, Arizona. Inspired by local heroes like the Gin Blossoms and Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers \u2014 both of whom have become champions of the Black Moods, often tapping the group as a high-profile opening act \u2014 The Black Moods began building their audience the old-school way: by hitting the road. They toured heavily, promoting albums like their 2012 self-titled debut and 2016's Medicine with gigs across the country. By the time \"Bella Donna\" hit the radio airwaves during the summer of 2018, The Black Moods' fanbase had grown exponentially. The song became a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, paving the way for the band's biggest shows to date.\n\nModern-day torchbearers of ageless rock & roll, The Black Moods aren't shy about nodding to their influences. \"Bella Donna\" was partially inspired by the Doors' slinky strut, while the climatic chorus of \"Bad News\" points to alt-rock mainstays like the Foo Fighters. With one boot planted in the same ground as their influences and the other pointed toward unexplored territory, The Black Moods blaze their own path while still paying tribute to those who came before them.\n\nBoth \"Bella Donna\" and \"Bad News\" were recorded with Grammy Award-nominated producer Johnny Karkazis, who flew to Phoenix and set up a makeshift studio in the band's own rehearsal space. There, in the same practice facility once shared by hometown heroes like the Refreshments, the band funneled the spirit and swagger of their live show into their most dynamic recordings to date. That live show \u2014 which The Black Moods sharpened with cross-country tours alongside the Doors' Robbie Krieger, Shinedown, Jane's Addiction, Eve 6, Cracker, and numerous other headliners \u2014 has always been one of the band's strongest selling points. Now, thanks to singles like \"Bella Donna\" (which also lends its name to the first wine in The Black Moods' wine series), The Black Moods' fury and fire onstage is matched by their electricity on record.\n\nThe band's name is The Black Moods.

Powerhouse singer Velle and her band will settle for nothing less than bringing these classic sounds glimmering into the now with a fresh new modern sheen.\n\nRuby Velle and the Soulphonics have made a name for themselves captivating audiences with their stirring live performances. They\u2019re a world-class modern soul revue topped off with the cherry of Velle\u2019s sultry voice, as she deftly toggles between sweetly crooned R&B tunes and expertly belted barn-burning get-downs that can instantly jolt a roomful of wallflowers into a wild dance party.\n\nIt\u2019s this inviting and accessible bravado that has scored the band critical acclaim from outlets such as The New York Daily News, MTV, Paste and more. And in addition to their critical success, at a time when record sales are at an all-time industry low, the independent, DIY-minded Velle and the Soulphonics sold a quarter-million downloads of their single \u201cMy Dear\u201d on iTunes, landing them in the top 30 on Billboard\u2019s Heatseeker charts and at a stunning #4 on the iTunes R&B charts when their debut album It\u2019s About Time was released in 2012. The group has shared bills with megastars and indie press darlings alike, including Larkin Poe, The Temptations, Erykah Badu, The XX, Goodie Mob, Gary Clark Jr., Animal Collective, Feist and Kendrick Lamar.\n\nAnd they continue to blaze a trail into the hearts of music fans with their new single, \"Broken Woman,\" from their sophomore album which was released in the Fall of 2017 and immediately appeared on Spotify's Official \"Still Got the Blues\" playlist. They followed that up with \"Call Out My Name\" releasing on Bitter Southerner. Their new albums tittle track \"State of All Things\" premiered on PASTE Magazine as the LP arrived in stores globally on 4/27/2018 on vinyl- in a time where music is streamed, the LP\u2019s first pressing sold out in less than 2 months.

After discovering Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin in her mother\u2019s record collection and falling in love with rock music, she was then taken to a live show of Michelle Shocked. It was there that she decided, \"That's what I want to do when I grow up\". The American folk singer with punk spirit showed her the way. As a teenager, Nad\u00e9ah taught herself to play guitar and write songs in beauty and work off pain. Like Leonard Cohen and Tori Amos \u2013 two great sources of inspiration, the first for his ability to paint pictures with words and the other for exorcising afflictions \u2013 Nad\u00e9ah turns her often adverse past experiences into something beautiful and engaging, songs that transcend difficult events to give solace, create humour and to touch beauty but always with a lyrical twist. Nad\u00e9ah\u2019s songs, though born of true experiences, are steeped in fantastical imagery and tell the stories of the Australian who, born to immigrant parents (her mother is Indian, Portuguese, English and Serbian, her father Italian), was never able to stand still. She set up her first band, the loveGods, in England with a French guitarist whom she met whilst busking in Paris. Spotted by the highly influential station Radio One, this fiercely electric act was booked to open for the likes of Nick Cave and Franz Ferdinand. Thanks to word of mouth, the band garnered a large and faithful following. However, after the release of two records on independent imprints, the adventure came to an abrupt end. This took Nad\u00e9ah back to square one, and she moved to Paris. Needless to say she brought her guitar along. In Paris, fate came knocking at her door again: whilst working at a caf\u00e9 she met classical conductor and composer Nicola Tescari. She also started to write again, putting to paper the emotions triggered by the \u201cCity of Light\u201d and French culture. After a short while, some kind souls told Marc Collin he should go and see her on stage, at the club where she was playing at the time. Won over by her voice and personality, he invited her to collaborate on the Hollywood Mon Amour project, then to join Nouvelle Vague and take part in the French collective\u2019s 3rd album. So Nad\u00e9ah performed in city after city around the world for three years. She had been a rock tigress on stage until then, reminiscent of PJ Harvey and Juliette Lewis, but now realised she could use her charms and was quite at ease singing other people\u2019s songs while portraying a sexy femme fatale. During the Nouvelle Vague tour, she put the finishing touches to songs intended for Venus Gets Even, all of which were born of \u2013 sometimes autobiographical \u2013 true stories: on \u201cPinot Noir & Poetry for Breakfast\u201d \u2013 her very own \u201cFever\u201d, where she manages to conjure up the spirit of Marilyn \u2013 she muses over the three months of her life when, inspired by the Parisian air, she would wake up each morning and grab a glass of Pinot with one hand and a book of poetry with the other ! (She has now rid herself of this bad habit, rest assured). Built like short films or scenes from a play, her songs \u2013 whether intriguing (\u201cI Burned a Cowboy at the Melbourne AirportI\u201d), cheerful or slightly blues-inducing (\u201cAn Asylum on New Year\u2019s Eve\u201d, about a friend who spent 31st December in an asylum) \u2013 are all clad in dazzlingly bright fabrics, lively arrangements and attractive shapes. The rich and sophisticated orchestration, devised by Nicola Tescari and comprising guitars, double bass, piano and brass (Babylon Circus\u2019 very own brass section) sounds as if Tom Waits and his accompanists were launching into an explosive and classy musical. The infectious \u201cWhatever Lovers Say\u201d swings like fifties rock\u2026 a love song that will make you sweat. \u201cScary Carol\u201d (about the Christmas consumerist frenzy) features a chorus bursting with an energy so groovy it feels like you've been hit with an electric current. Written upon her arrival in Paris, \u201cOdile\u201d feeds on rhythm and makes finger-snapping hard to resist. Nad\u00e9ah\u2019s repertoire has evolved since The Lovegods, but she retains the unbridled energy of rock whilst cultivating a sophistication not dissimilar to the likes of Feist or Goldfrapp. She enthrals us on her more personal songs with the warm and velvety tones of her voice. On the tear-jerking \u201cEven Quadriplegics Get the Blues\u201d (about an ex-partner paralysed from the neck down), she opts for sobriety and minimalism. This simple ballad, on which she is accompanied only by a piano, tastes more like a strong pick-me-up than salty tears. \u201cSuddenly Afternoons\u201d is a more sorrowful track, a lovely and ethereal song that sounds like something Rickie Lee Jones could have written. \u201cHurricane Katrina\u201d sums up Nad\u00e9ah\u2019s approach quite well: performed by a different artist, this song (about a relationship so tense it conjures up images of hurricanes) would sink the listener into gloominess. However Nad\u00e9ah addresses the issue with a bang, amidst a clamouring honky-tonk atmosphere. With songs such as \u201cTell Me\u201d, her first album puts her in a class with singers such as Josephine Baker and all the other foreign artists (Feist, etc.) who really \u201cclicked\u201d with Paris and France. Along with her 5-star formation, she is now raring to go and set ablaze every stage she treads, and between two tracks, whether explosive or moving, she\u2019ll reveal her outlook on life and say, with a smile: \u201cWhatever happens, make something good of it\u201d\u2026 www.nadeah.com www.facebook.com/nadeahmusic www.twitter.com/nadeah www.instagram.com/princessnadeah Nouvelle Vague : www.nouvellesvagues.com http://myspace.com/nouvellevague The LoveGods : www.thelovegods.com http://myspace.com/thelovegods Hollywood Mon Amour : www.hollywoodmonamour.com http://myspace.com/hollywoodmonamour B for Bang : www.bforbang.com http://myspace.com/bforbang Who is she?

Now a quarter-century into that career, Snider has done it again. After making rock records of one kind or another for seven years, both as a solo artist and with his band, Hard Working Americans, Snider has made another left turn and returned to his folk roots with the release in March 2019 of his thirteenth studio album as a solo artist, Cash Cabin Sessions, Vol. 3. As the title suggests, the album was recorded at the studio formerly owned by Johnny Cash and now owned by his son, John Carter Cash. Snider played all the instruments on the record, mostly guitar and harmonica, but he also played banjo on one song and overdubbed mandolin and percussion on some others. The only other people on the album are Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires, who contributed backing vocals to several songs. Among the highlights of the record are a trio of talking blues numbers, which reinforce the fact Snider has come full circle with the album because it was the song \u201cTalking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues\u201d from his 1994 debut, Songs For The Daily Planet, that first launched the native of Portland, Oregon, into the national consciousness. Now twenty-twenty-five years later, he has released another folk record, and as Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan, and others did before him, reminded the world of the enormous power that can come from one man, his guitar, and the truth.", "otherInfo": "Join Todd Snider for his weekly free livestream performance from Purple Building Live!\n\nTune-in at:\nhttps://purplebuildinglive.com\nChip in at:\nhttps://venmo.com/Purplebuildinglive\nhttps://paypal.me/Thepurplebuilding"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alexandre Carlo ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.desdecasaconmusica.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Luis Figueroa ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9945850.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Latin Pop", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "LUIS FIGUEROA is an multi-talented Puerto Rican singer and songwriter posed to become the next Latin pop sensation. \u201cLa Especialista\u201d his first release for Sony Music Latin has an infectious vibe blending acoustic guitars and rich melodies showcasing his distant vocals.

Much later, the band played at El Concurso de Pop/Rock de San Sebasti\u00e1n, at which they were discovered and later signed by Sony Music.\n\nTheir first album, Dile al Sol (Tell The Sun), debuted in 1998; it went to the top of the Spanish music charts, and won the Premio Ondas to The very best Album of the Year. After numerous tours, the group released two more albums, El Viaje de Copperpot (Copperpot's Journey) and Lo que te Cont\u00e9 Mientras te Hacias la Dormida (What I Told You While You Pretended To Be Asleep) as well as two DVDs: La Oreja De Van Gogh with material from their first two records, and a live performance called Lo que te Cont\u00e9 Mientras te Hacias la Dormida Gira 2003'.\n\nTheir songs are written (both lyrics and music) mostly by Xabi San Mart\u00edn and Amaia Montero in collaboration with Pablo Benegas, and the themes are usually love, friendship, or whatever comes up in a relationship between two people.\n\nTheir fourth album, Guapa, was released April 25th 2006. At the end of 2006, the re-edition of this album, called M\u00e1s Guapa was released.\nIt was met with wide critical success.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.desdecasaconmusica.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Luis Coronel ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8664113.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Latin", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.desdecasaconmusica.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Louise Goffin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8193337.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Louise Goffin", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Louise Lynn Goffin, is a singer-songwriter, producer, multi-instrumentalist, and recording artist, grew up in an A-class University with a virtual PhD in Popular Music in the making.

The family moved back to Venezuela when De Vita was 13, and he later studied piano at the university level.\n\nIn 1982, De Vita formed the group Icaro, which released one self-titled album in his homeland. Two years later, he released his first disc as a solo artist, simply titled Franco De Vita. The album spun off three Spanish-language hits: \u201cSomos Tres,\u201d \u201cNo Hay Cielo\u201d and \u201cUn Buen Perdedor.\u201d His 1986 album Fantas\u00eda produced several more hits, including the title song and \u201cAqu\u00ed Est\u00e1s Otra Vez.\u201d \u201cS\u00f3lo Importas T\u00fa,\u201d taken from the album, was used as the theme song to the Spanish-language soap opera La Dama De Rosa. He appeared in the end credits of every episode, performing the song at the piano.\n\nSeeking wider international exposure, De Vita moved to the Sony label for the 1988 album Al Norte Del Sur. A critical and commercial smash, the album cemented his reputation as a purveyor of socially-conscious, adult-oriented pop, particularly through the tunes \u201cTe Amo\u201d and \u201cLouis.\u201d The latter song, about a daydreaming cabbie who idolizes The Beatles, was promoted with a music video considered quite advanced for its time. De Vita\u2019s 1990 album Extranjero featured the song \u201cNo Basta,\u201d which spent four weeks at No. 1 on the U.S. Latin charts and won an MTV Video Music Award.\n\nSubsequent albums have included the live release En Vivo Marzo 16 (1992); Voces A Mi Alrededor in 1993; the acoustic-flavored Fuera De Este Mundo (1996); and 1999\u2019s world-beat inspired Nada Es Igual. He left Sony for the 2002 album Segundas Partes Tambi\u00e9n Son Buenas, but returned to the label the following year.\n\nDe Vita has continued to enjoy success as one of Latin music\u2019s most consistently popular singer-songwriters, with a style often compared to Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel. His 2004 album Stop reached the Top 10 throughout Latin America and on the U.S. Latin charts, spurred by the hits \u201cT\u00fa De Qu\u00e9 Vas\u201d and \u201cSi La Ves,\u201d the latter a collaboration with pop group Sin Bandera. That same year, he toured arenas in the United States on a co-headlining tour with Ricardo Montaner, a fellow Venezuelan songwriter. De Vita is reportedly one of the largest selling musical artists ever to emerge from Venezuela. He also has recorded in Italian and Portuguese, albeit to less success. As a songwriter, he has written hits for Ricky Martin and Chayanne. In 2005, an expanded edition of Stop was released, titled Stop + Algo M\u00e1s, that included remixes and live recordings, as well as No S\u00e9 Lo Que Me Das, De Vita's first recording in English.

Her emotionally disarming performances deceive in their simplicity, often times consisting of nothing more than her voice and a guitar, occasionally accompanied by violinist. Yet, they nevertheless arrest audiences through their quiet, brooding intensity, holding a vulnerability that\u2019s offset by a wintry, gallic allure..\n\nOn any given weekday, you can hear her voice echoing over the Hudson and East rivers. Equipped with only an acoustic guitar, a microphone and a tiny mixer, the French songstress delivers hushed and intimate performances for passengers aboard Spirit Cruises, set against the backdrop of an idyllic Manhattan skyline. Doucet\u2019s set list meanders seamlessly between Top 40 staples like Cindy Lauper and The Week'nd, while discreetly inserting the odd Gallic classic and, of course, a few numbers from her own blooming repertoire. Oddly enough, this sort of eclecticism works, as Doucet\u2019s own style has been informed by her superior command of the pop form.\n\n\nTiphanie Doucet got her start early on in the music and entertainment world. Harp and Ballet were part of her two passions since a very early age, and lead to a professional Dancing and Acting career. A starring role in the film Le b\u00e9b\u00e9 d\u2019Elsa, and later in the Glee-like TV series \"Chante\", gave her popularity in her native France, and the unlikely foundations for what would be a very eclectic musical trajectory. After leaving France, Doucet decided to gamble it all and start fresh in America. The 180 degree turn that her life took left her old life in shambles, bringing her plenty of heartbreak and homesickness that would prove to be a wellspring of musical inspiration. This moment of transition afforded Doucet plenty of material to write her own songs, which she began testing out on street corners, cruises and caf\u00e9s throughout New York and her newly adopted home in Jersey City, New Jersey. The overwhelmingly positive reception was such that she decided to release her own work. She released her first single \"Lucky guy\" with Grammy-nominated producer Jason Agel, whose work can be heard in productions by everyone from Kanye West to Bj\u00f6rk to Beyonce.\n\n\nA year later, she released her debut album \u201cUnder My Sun\u201d, a collection of rustic, yet polished folk numbers produced by David Baron and Simone Felice, who have worked with the likes of Lumineers and Jade Bird. Though Doucet\u2019s influences are prevalent throughout the album, nodding to the likes of Norah Jones, Ingrid Michaelson and Feist, the work is without a doubt a testament to the uniqueness and originality of her voice. The sound is amplified by Felice and Baron's production, which never feels intrusive, but serves as the perfect complement to the singer\u2019s overpowering voice, interjecting only at key moments of emotional revelation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiphanie n'est surement pas inconnue de vous. Elle a commence a 15 ans a la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, quand elle interpr\u00e9tait la fille de Corinne Touzet, dans un premier r\u00f4le plut\u00f4t salu\u00e9 par la critique. A l\u2019\u00e9poque elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 8 ans de conservatoire en musique et danse et continua jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ses 18 ans. A 20 ans elle d\u00e9bute une carri\u00e8re de danseuse professionnelle gr\u00e2ce a Redha qui l'engage comme apprenti sur Romeo et Juliette, apr\u00e8s elle enchaine les shows, plateaux t\u00e9l\u00e9s, tourn\u00e9es. Parmi ses meilleurs exp\u00e9riences, on a pu la voir sur les plateaux de la Star Academy, la tourn\u00e9e de Jenifer ou derri\u00e8re David Guetta, Jonnhy Halliday et m\u00eame Prince, travaillant avec tous les chor\u00e9graphes du moment comme Kamel Ouali, Redha, Mya Frye, Stephane Jarny ou Hakim Ghorab. Comme chanteuse on a pu la voir interpr\u00e9ter \u201cJeanie \u201c dans Hair et bien sur a la TV, meilleure amie de Priscilla dans la s\u00e9rie Chante. A l \u00e9poque elle commence a prendre la musique plus au s\u00e9rieux, rencontre Geoffrey, guitariste, avec qui elle commence a composer et voyager aux Etats Unis : Los Angeles, Nashville, New York. Lors d'un programme court au Musician Institute de Los Angeles, elle s'inscrit a une audition pour l\u2019\u00e9cole AMDA. De retour en France, on lui apprend qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'une bourse de talent ! La voila partie aux Etats Unis, et elle ne reviendra plus. Son dipl\u00f4me en poche elle entame les auditions et commence a travailler. Une com\u00e9die musicale, et m\u00eame un premier r\u00f4le dans une pi\u00e8ce de theatre Off Broadway. Mais la musique est toujours pr\u00e9sente. Elle commence a gratter la guitare, et compose seule son premier EP \u201cBetween us\u201d qu'elle revient enregistrer a Paris. Depuis, elle se consacre a sa musique, elle joue m\u00eame dans la rue, le m\u00e9tro, et a fait plus de 50 concerts a NY, dont la premi\u00e8re partie de Anna Nalick a Brooklyn, une auteur compositeur tr\u00e8s populaire aux Etats Unis, et a Paris aussi ou elle a eu la chance de faire la premi\u00e8re partie d'Arnaud Ducret au casino de Paris au Printemps 2016.\nEn 2017, elle rencontre et enregistre avec le producteur / r\u00e9alisateur Jason Agel, nomin\u00e9 notamment au Grammy Awards pour son enregistrement de la chanson \"All of Me\" par John Legend. Le single \"Lucky guy\" surprend par les m\u00e9lodies m\u00e9lancoliques et relaxantes de Tiphanie, les voix douces et ang\u00e9liques, et les arrangements explosifs de Jason Agel. Apres avoir envoye une demo de chanson en francais, elle attire ensuite l'attention du realisateur Simone Felice ( les Lumineers, Jade Bird... ) Elle debarque a Woodstock et s'enferme avec lui et David Baron dans leur studio au milieu des montagnes de Catskills, le coup de foudre artistique est immediat. L'album est sorti le 10 Aout, comprenant des chansons en Anglais et en Francais.\n\nIl attire la Presse Americaine qui la compare a Norah Jones. En novembre dernier Tiphanie s'est produit au Sunset Jazz Club. Un EP de reprises est prevu pour Mars 2019 avec aussi des versions en Francais des chansons de l'album.\n\n\n\n\nLa p\u00e9pite du jour c\u2019est Tiphanie Doucet et Under My Sun\nPar Charles Chinasky\n\nTiphanie Doucet a une histoire qui ferait un film. Jeune actrice avec Corinne Touzet (oui quand m\u00eame), bourse US, Danse sur le grand journal, com\u00e9die musicale pour finir par se faire rep\u00e9rer dans le m\u00e9tro de New York. Sa vie ressemble \u00e0 un condens\u00e9 de la s\u00e9rie Un, Dos, tr\u00e8s sauf qu\u2019il est par contre fort probable que vous vous souveniez d\u2019elle dans 10 ans. Car Tiphanie a une voix enchanteresse. Elle m\u00e9lange une guitare s\u00e8che folk avec un petit cot\u00e9 soul. C\u2019est une musique \u00e0 faire tomber les \u00e9toiles, en sirotant un petit whisky et en pensant \u00e0 la vie.T\n\n\nPRESS\n\nShaped by her experiences in France, Los Angeles, New York, and her recently adopted New Jersey home alike, Doucet\u2019s new work embraces a folksier, jazz-tinged gentleness. Its subtle warmth instantly feels like home, pervading the senses in a way not dissimilar to Norah Jones or Lucy Rose. Yet, in spite of any similarities you may draw between her and other great songwriters, Doucet\u2019s dreamy vocal quality is markedly distinct, especially in how she tenderly incorporates it into her music to tell stories unique to her own outlook and experiences.\n\nJonathan Frahm \u2022 10 July 2018- For Folk Sake\n\n\"Her vocal performance is compelling in its attention to detail\u2013the ends of lines and the wordless sighs that close the song contain a lot of emotion without going for the big move. If you\u2019re looking for a relaxing summer tune, this is what you\u2019re looking for. Highly recommended.\"\n\nStephen Carradini, for Independant Clauses\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d gotten to know Tiphanie and her sincerity to her work, is obvious to witness. Her dedication to her craft is unconditional. She\u2019s humble, energetic, honest, and she wants to share her music to greater and greater audiences. And in her humble way, she still is seeking Of herself, and About herself \u2013 and we think that contributes profoundly to music making. She wants to be \u2018happy\u2019. Happy with her work, happy with her songs making people happy, and happy with making music an even larger part of her life from a career point of view. She\u2019s come a long way. But she\u2019s a tough gal \u2013 resilient and proud of her accomplishment and the way she\u2019s come through the personal pains in her past. Her heart pushes her to do so. And in our eyes, that passion is something that we can\u2019t help but DIG about her. Kudos, Tiphanie.

This is the thought that crosses Debi Nova\u2019s mind every time she sits down at the piano to write a song. An artist with extraordinary musical talent, an exquisite personality and a captivating smile, Nova soars with the music she creates.\n\nBorn in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica, she first learned piano at the age of four and was fronting a locally popular band within a matter of several years. She\u2019s been a songwriter and multi-instrumentalist since the age of 14, and was on the road to achieving her dreams by 17, when she signed her first record deal. Since then, she has been involved in 6 Grammy nominated projects, and a path in the music world that includes collaborations with artists like the Black Eyed Peas, Sean Paul, Mark Ronson, Boney James, Vybz Kartel and Ce'Cile.\n\nWhile studying Ethnomusicology and Jazz at UCLA, Debi was invited by the legendary Brazilian artist Sergio Mendes to be the featured vocalist on his critically acclaimed album Timeless, and to accompany him on his tour through the U.S. and Japan. It wasn\u2019t until the fall of 2004 that she released her first single, the vibrant \u201cOne Rhythm,\u201d which was remixed by Ralphi Rosario and went to the top of the Billboard Dance Music/Club Play chart.\n\nShe then joined Ricky Martin on his 2004-2005 Life Tour in support of his album \u201cLife\u201d on which Debi was featured on 3 tracks; Drop It On Me (featuring Daddy Yankee as well), I Am and Qu\u00e9 M\u00e1s Da. All this activity fostered her growth not only as a performer but as a songwriter comfortable writing in both Spanish and English (sometimes within the same song).\n\nNova released her first album, \u201cLuna Nueva\u201d, produced by Gustavo Santaolalla and Marius Devries, in 2010. The album showcases Debi's eclectic talents -she plays piano, guitar, and bass, among other instruments- and captures her authentic Latin roots. Through an electrifying combination of Latin beats with forceful pop rhythms, Debi's album speaks vibrantly of the universal language and power of Music. Her first single from \u201cLuna Nueva\u201d, \u201cDrummer Boy\u201d, reached #5 on the Billboard dance charts. That same year, she participated in two of the most watched TV shows in North America, \u201cDancing With The Stars\u201d and \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance\u201d.\n\nDuring 2011-2012, Debi was on tour in Latin America and the United States opening for the popular Mexican group Camila, and was invited by Venezuelan singer Franco De Vita to participate in the recording of the song \u201cSi Quieres Decir Adi\u00f3s\u201d, which was included in Franco De Vita\u2019s album \u201cEn Primera Fila\u201d. She went on to accompany De Vita on his tour throughout Latin America, performing live over 60 times with the singer.\n\nAlso in 2011, MTV Latin America awarded her the prize MTV Chiuku: Agent of Change, for her work in the United Nations\u2019 campaign \u201cUNITE to end violence against women\u201d, and in April 2012, she was named ambassador of YUNGA (Youth and United Nations Global Alliance).\n\nRecently, Nova was the official voice of the Central American Olympics San Jos\u00e9 2013, with the song \u201cArriba Arriba\u201d and was also invited to participate in the conference TEDx Joven Pura Vida, sharing her story and her music to encourage young people to follow their dreams.\n\nDebi Nova\u2019s goal is to captivate the world with her new creations on and further consolidate herself as a Latin/crossover artist. Her second album, \u201cSOY\u201d, is entirely in Spanish and showcases 11 songs which demonstrate Nova\u2019s growth as an artist, pianist, and composer. Songs which transmit warm, positive and contagious emotions, and unleash with great enthusiasm the singularity of a captivating spirit. The album was recorded in Mondomix Studios in Argentina, and produced by Cachorro L\u00f3pez.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.desdecasaconmusica.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ale Sergi ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.desdecasaconmusica.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Thalia ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/120787.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Latin, Pop", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Thal\u00eda (born Ariadna Thal\u00eda Sodi Miranda, August 26, 1971 in Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico) is an actress, singer, record producer, composer and businesswoman, who began her career in the '80s group Timbiriche.

D\u00e1ndole \u00e9nfasis a los sonidos frescos y verane\u00f1os del Caribe y fusionandolos con infecciosos ritmos urbanos, Farruko colabor\u00f3 con Ky-Mani Marley para crear un exito internacional que dominar\u00eda listados de venta y popularidad de todo el continente, \u201cCHILLAX.\u201d El sencillo conquist\u00f3 la codiciada posicion #1 de los listados \u201cLatin Airplay,\u201d \u201cLatin Rhythm Airplay\u201d y \u201cLatin Pop Airplay\u201d de la revista Billboard por varias semanas consecutivas. El verano del 2016 trajo m\u00e1s \u00e9xitos para el cantautor ya que continu\u00f3 llevando su m\u00fasica a todos los rincones del planeta, visitando m\u00e1s de 20 ciudades por los EE.UU. junto a Pitbull y Prince Royce como parte del \u201cThe Bad Man Tour.\u201d Con la mission de seguir llevando su visi\u00f3n musical a traves de todo el mundo, el artista regresa a su natal Puerto Rico para paralizar a la isla con un espect\u00e1culo inolvidable y a llenos totals en el Coliseo Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot, marcando el regreso del artista a la isla y haciendo historia como uno de los conciertos m\u00e1s grandes en la sala m\u00e1s importante del Caribe. Farruko no se detuvo all\u00ed ya que sigui\u00f3 fortificando su posici\u00f3n como el rey del reggaeton con un concierto masivo y una vez m\u00e1s completamente repleto en el legendario Palacio de los Deportes de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico frente a m\u00e1s de 11 mil personas. Reconociendo la necesidad de cambio y evoluci\u00f3n en la industria, Farruko decidi\u00f3 dar notoriedad a un subg\u00e9nero de m\u00fasica urbana \u2013 el Trap Latino. Cambiando ligeramente el estilo de sus \u00e1lbumes anteriores, el artista comenz\u00f3 su revoluci\u00f3n liderando el movimiento Trap Latino, renovando la industria de la m\u00fasica urbana latina con la evoluci\u00f3n natural de estos infecciosos ritmos. Probando una vez m\u00e1s su dominio de cualquier g\u00e9nero, Farruko lidera el Panel Trap Latino durante la Conferencia de Billboard a la M\u00fasica Latina de este a\u00f1o, que tendr\u00e1 lugar en abril.

With lyrics about the experience of being human, her music has a way of connecting with pretty much anyone on a deeply personal level. She's compared frequently to classics like Joni Mitchell and Carol King. And to describe her voice, it\u2019s common to hear words like \"Clear\", \"Pure\", \"Haunting\" and \"Mesmerizing\".\n\nAmy's a California native. After growing up in San Diego, she moved to Santa Cruz for college (go slugs!) and after a fifteen year love affair with the town, moved on to San Francisco where she's lived since 2012. She\u2019s toured the U.S. and Europe, plus recorded and toured with her own French band (The Carbone Band), along with an Artist in Residence in Saint Herblain, France. You also may have heard her song, Carousel, on the hit TV Show, Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\n\nYou can hear Amy perform in a variety of formats. She\u2019s performing frequently in San Francisco with her new energetic groove-rock band, Amy & The Elements. At other times she uses a looper where she can instantly record, playback and perform atop her own performance with harmonies and instruments. And very often she\u2019ll pair things down and simply perform a solo acoustic show highlighting the purity of her songs.\n\nAmy\u2019s musical history stretches back to age five, when she began singing in her school choir. She took up piano at age six and has been studying music ever since. She finally picked up the guitar when she began songwriting at twenty-two.\n\nDuring her long residence in Santa Cruz, she supported local organizations through two benefit concerts called Take Back Your Forest. Collectively they raised six thousand dollars for the Sempervirens Fund, an organization that purchases and protects redwood forest in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

Songwriters Sima Cunnningham and Macie Stewart formed their unbreakable bond performing throughout the fringes of Chicago's many interlocking communities, collaborating with titans from the city's indie rock, hip-hop, and improvised worlds. But together, along with drummer Matt Carroll, they've stretched the boundaries of what guitar music can do starting with the band's experimental 2016 self-titled EP and their adventurous debut 2018 LP Parts. Now their longstanding partnership culminates with the stunning and muscular follow-up Fantasize Your Ghost.\n\nOhmme formed in 2014 as an outlet for Cunningham and Stewart to explore an unconventional approach to their instruments. \"That's the whole genesis of the band: us walking up to our guitars and saying, 'how can we make this noisemaker do something different?'\" says Cunningham. But as their musical collaboration strengthened, bringing Parts and intensive tours with acts like Wilco, Iron & Wine, Twin Peaks, and more, the band's scope and focus has also broadened. Fantasize Your Ghost is the direct result of the band spending more time on the road than in Chicago, a record deeply concerned with questions of the self, the future, and what home means when you're travelling all the time.\n\n\"Grinding on tour last year for so long, it can alter your mental state where you have to think about your life in a different way than you would if you're home. A lot of the songs stemmed from just thinking about all of the possibilities that life could be and could take,\" says Stewart. On the commanding single \"3 2 4 3,\" which tackles the terrifying realization of needing to make a change. The song opens with the two singing in transfixing harmony, \"Looked in the mirror the other day / Caught my reflection / My mouth had moved a different way / The muscles were straining.\" Their deft scene-setting and the way their disparate voices blend together heightens the song's inherent anxiety. Later, they sing, \"Filling the holes to make amends / Tearing them up to start again.\" These moments of emotional clarity fill Fantasize Your Ghost.\n\nWritten across 2019, early sketches of the album's tracklist were demoed at Sam Evian's Flying Cloud Studios in upstate New York. \"That's where we really started to see the record come together,\" says Cunningham. The sessions were intensely collaborative and open: the product of long, existential conversations between Stewart and Cunningham in the van about their lives and how to channel the anger they were feeling about the state of the world. Tracks like the driving opener \"Flood Your Gut\" underwent several revisions with Ohmme uncovering several new directions the song could go before finishing it. The refrain \"your whole vision's not enough\" is a call to action, says Cunningham. \"Do you want to be someone who can disconnect or someone who is hyper-engaged and present?\"\n\nFantasize Your Ghost was recorded over a six day session in August 2019 when the band decamped to the Post Farm in southern Wisconsin, where Cunningham runs a yearly DIY music festival. With indie rock journeyman producer Chris Cohen and the idyllic setting just outside Chicago, the songs came to vibrant life. Though Parts showcased their wildly burgeoning influences and talents, Fantasize Your Ghost captures the astounding magnetism and ferocity of their live show. \"Selling Candy\" is the perfect example. It's a small snapshot of childhood complete with nostalgic references to summertime hot dogs and wandering the city but set to an explosive, stadium-ready fuzzed-out arrangement. Elsewhere, songs like the dystopian dance rocker \"The Limit\" further stretch their already dynamic palette.\n\nFantasize Your Ghost encapsulates the thrilling and sometimes terrifying joy of moving forward even if you don't know where you're going. It's an album that asks necessary questions: When life demands a crossroads, what version of yourself are you going to pursue? What part of yourself will you feed and let flourish and what do you have to let go of? When they sing, \"Just walk out the door and / Don\u2019t tell them goodbye\" it's drastic but also exhilaratingly hopeful. This is a record of strength, of best friends believing in each other. Unapologetic and brave, Ohmme are ready to figure it all out together.", "otherInfo": "We are excited to support #ArtsForIllinois and the Arts for Illinois Relief Fund alongside Mayor Lightfoot, Governor Pritzker and First Ladies MK Pritzker and Amy Eshleman \u2013 providing financial assistance to artists, artisans and cultural organizations impacted by #COVID19.

Since, he has put out a slew of genre-defying cuts, changing the game entirely through massive collaborations and solid remixes for artists such as Paul Oakenfold, Armin van Buuren, Solid Stone, Cosmic Gate and Ruben de Ronde.\n\nThanks to extensive support from a gamut of top-tier performers (e.g. Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Above & Beyond, Markus Schulz, Gareth Emery, Nicky Romero, W&W, Andrew Rayel and even Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and David Guetta), Rodg has been getting the recognition he deserves, even touted \u201cOne of the best producers of 2016\u201d by Armin van Buuren.

California native KP (formerly Kirsten Proffit) launched her solo career with 2006's Lucky Girl, a singer/songwriter record whose tracks found their way onto TV shows like Friday Night Lights and Dawson's Creek. By 2012, she was also touring the country with Jaime Wyatt and Manda Mosher as a member of CALICO, a trio of songwriters whose warm, nostalgic sound nodded to Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, and other icons of California's country-rock golden days. The group hit the ground running, playing 200 shows during their first year together. CALICO was a true collaboration, too \u2014 a group whose members shared songwriting and singing duties \u2014 but after two albums together (both of which were co-produced by Kirsten), the band called it quits. Life and the grind of the road had taken its toll. Besides, KP had become excited about collaborating with another musician: guitar slinger Johnny Hawthorn.\n\nAs a songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, lead guitarist, and record producer, Johnny had already performed with bands like Toad the Wet Sprocket and Everclear by the time he crossed paths with KP at the Cinema Bar in Culver City, CA. He'd also released three albums as a solo artist, with Guitar Player Magazine likening his phrasing to Jimi Hendrix and his vocal melodies to the Eagles. The connection between KP and Johnny was immediate, and the two spent their first date playing songs together. Before long, they were writing songs of their own \u2014 melodic music that made room for KP's voice, Johnny's guitar, and plenty of collaboratively-written hooks. The two became newlyweds, too, their sound mirroring the mutual respect and reverence found in their marriage.\n\n2019's Morning Sun is the HawtThorns' official debut, a collection of warm, West Coast-influenced songs that balance the most engaging parts of the bandmates' different backgrounds. It's an amped-up Americana album for guitar enthusiasts and singer/songwriter fans alike. Laced with touches of lap steel guitar, strings, organ, and thickly-stacked coed harmonies, Morning Sun also introduces the HawtThorns' full lineup \u2014 a roster that includes drummer Matt Lucich and bassist Eliot Lorango \u2014 while making room for additional contributions from Sasha Smith, Kaitlin Wolfberg, and Arthur Barrow. From the heartland rock & roll of \"All I Know\" to the soulful empowerment anthem \"Rebel Road\" to the lushly-harmonized highway ballad \"The 405,\" Morning Sun shows the full range of the HawtThorns' interests and abilities, with production from Eric Corne (founder of the band's label, Forty Below Records), Steve Berns, and KP Hawthorn. The album also includes a John Moreland cover, a revamped version of Johnny Hawthorn's \"Give Me a Sign,\" four songs co-written with Berns, and the chiming, high-spirited lead single \"Shaking.\"\n\nIn a genre that often trends toward moody sounds, Morning Sun is every bit as bright as its name indicates \u2014 an Americana album inspired by the sun-streaked California landscape in which it was written and recorded. It's a record about intersecting lives and finding that balance, with songs that rely equally on Johnny's guitar lines (which he approaches with the nuance of a songwriter) and KP's melodic sensibilities. KP and Johnny aren't newcomers \u2014 they've both weathered the ups and downs of the music industry for years, struggling to overcome musical (and personal) breakups along the way \u2014 but they've tapped into a new beginning with Morning Sun.

After making her Grand Ole Opry debut at the age of 10, the Tennessee-bred virtuoso mandolinist played Carnegie Hall at age 12, then landed a deal with Rounder Records just a year later. Now 28-years-old, Hull is set to deliver her fourth full-length for Rounder: an elegantly inventive and endlessly captivating album called 25 Trips.\n\nRevealing her profound warmth as a storyteller, 25 Trips finds Hull shedding light on the beauty and chaos and sometimes sorrow of growing up and getting older. To that end, the album\u2019s title nods to a particularly momentous year of her life, including her marriage to fellow bluegrass musician Justin Moses and the release of her widely acclaimed album Weighted Mind\u2014a B\u00e9la Fleck-produced effort nominated for Best Folk Album at the 2017 Grammy Awards.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of push-and-pull on this record, where in some moments I feel like everything\u2019s happening so fast and I wish I could slow it all down so I can really enjoy it,\u201d Hull points out. \u201cBut then there are also times where I\u2019m looking forward to the day when the craziness has died down a bit, and life\u2019s a little calmer.\u201d\n\nMade with producer/engineer Shani Gandhi (Kelsea Ballerini, Dierks Bentley, Sarah Jarosz, Alison Krauss), 25 Trips continues the musical journey begun on Weighted Mind, a body of work that built off Hull\u2019s bluegrass roots and ventured into entirely new terrain. But while its predecessor assumed a sparse and stripped-back palette, 25 Trips embodies a far more intricately arranged sound\u2014an effect achieved with the help of peers like guitarist Mike Seal, bassist Ethan Jodziewicz, violinist Alex Hargreaves, and fiddler Christian Sedelmyer, as well as several musicians that Hull has long admired (including bassist Viktor Krauss, guitarist Bryan Sutton, and multi-instrumentalist Stuart Duncan). Along with integrating electric instrumentation and percussion into her material for the first time, Hull dreamed up the album\u2019s eclectic textures by embracing a free-flowing process that often gave way to lightning-in-a-bottle improvisation.\n\n\u201cThere were some songs that we created from the ground up, where I\u2019d go in and play by myself, and from there we\u2019d bring in other musicians to add more and more layers,\u201d Hull says. \u201cIt was really wonderful to work that way, where we started from a place of mystery and then just let the song show us what it wanted or needed to become.\u201d\n\nImmediately proving the power of that approach, 25 Trips lures the listener into its unpredictable sonic world on the beguiling opening track \u201cBeautifully Out of Place.\u201d With its shifting tempos and gently tempestuous mood, the song was sparked from words of encouragement spoken by Hull\u2019s husband at a time of self-doubt and confusion. \u201cI remember Justin saying to me, \u2018I believe in you, so you\u2019re just going to have to learn to believe in yourself,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThat inspired the first line for me, and the song just wrote itself from there.\u201d\n\nAlthough much of the album bears a rich complexity, 25 Trips also includes moments of stark simplicity that perfectly showcase Hull\u2019s stunning vocal range. On \u201cEverybody\u2019s Talking,\u201d for instance, her luminous vocals quietly capture the frustration of finding clarity in the midst of constant chatter from the outside world. And on \u201cCeiling to the Floor\u201d\u2014co-written with Kai Welch, a songwriter/musician known for his work with Glen Campbell and Abigail Washburn\u2014Hull spins a tender metaphor from her longtime fear of heights. \u201cI was telling Kai about how when I was little my dad used to try to get me over that fear by holding me up to the ceiling and saying, \u2018Just touch it\u2014I\u2019m not gonna let you fall,\u2019\u201d she explains. Featuring a performance from legendary steel-guitar player Paul Franklin, \u201cCeiling to the Floor\u201d drifts from memory to real-time reflection, slowly unfolding as a nuanced meditation on courage and love.\n\nOne of the most unexpected turns on 25 Trips, \u201cEscape\u201d emerges as a delicate collage of hypnotic percussion, otherworldly electric-mandolin tones, and poetic yet plainspoken lyrics (e.g., \u201cI want to escape to a world that\u2019s not closing in\u201d). \u201cI didn\u2019t even have that song on my list for the album, but I played Shani a voice memo and right away she said, \u2018I wanna record that,\u2019\u201d remembers Hull, who penned \u201cEscape\u201d with singer/songwriter Angel Snow. \u201cI was a little hesitant since it\u2019s so unlike anything else I\u2019ve done, but in the end it was really exciting to play electric and come up with something in a completely different vein.\u201d\n\nIn closing out 25 Trips, Hull shares an especially poignant track titled \u201cFather Time.\u201d \u201cI wrote that song with Mindy Smith after spending a week with my husband and his grandma, after his grandpa had a stroke on Christmas morning,\u201d she says. \u201cHis grandma had suffered with Alzheimer\u2019s for years and couldn\u2019t really stay by herself, and through that experience I decided to write about watching my husband take such good care of her, and how that made me love him even more.\u201d With its heavy-hearted melody and choir-like harmonies, \u201cFather Time\u201d shows Hull\u2019s effortless finesse in embedding her music with so many subtle details (including an instrumental reference to \u201cJingle Bells\u201d tucked into the second verse). \u201cWe had our instruments with us at Christmas, so at some point we played \u2018Jingle Bells\u2019 for my husband\u2019s grandma,\u201d says Hull. \u201cShe can\u2019t remember my name or Justin\u2019s name now, but for some reason \u2018Jingle Bells\u2019 stuck, and she still asks for it year-round\u2014it\u2019s the most amazing thing.\u201d\n\nEven as its songs continually shift in genre, encompassing everything from bluegrass to folk-pop to ethereal alt-rock, 25 Trips remains rooted in the sophisticated musicianship that Hull has cultivated almost her entire life. Hailing from the tiny Tennessee hamlet of Byrdstown, she learned to sing from her mother as toddler, took up mandolin just a few years later, and began joining in local bluegrass jams by the young age of eight. With her childhood triumphs including joining her hero and mentor Alison Krauss onstage at the Grand Ole Opry at age 11, she made her Rounder debut with the 2008 album Secrets and promptly garnered the first of many nominations for Mandolin Player of the Year at the International Bluegrass Music Association Awards. In 2016, after a near-decade of consecutive nominations, Hull became the first-ever woman to win the award\u2014then claimed that prize again at the 2017 and 2018 IBMAs. Over the years, Hull has also maintained a rigorous touring schedule, and has made occasional guest appearances with such icons as the Indigo Girls, Garth Brooks, and Gillian Welch.\n\nMarking a bold new era in Hull\u2019s artistic evolution, 25 Trips wholly channels the pure and palpable joy she discovered in the album\u2019s creation\u2014and ultimately illuminates certain truths about the indelible connection between risk-taking and reward. \u201cOne of the things I most enjoyed about making this record was getting to show the wide variety of music I love,\u201d says Hull. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what category the album falls in, but I also think that matters less and less. What really matters to me is trusting myself to be who I am, and just putting my voice and my heart out there in the most sincere way that I possibly can.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Restless Age ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8839192.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Brandon Morrison (Bass, Vocals), Will Bryant (Keyboards Vocals), Lee Falco (Drums, Vocals)", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Restless Age is a collaboration - a harmony of Will Bryant, Lee Falco and Brandon Morrison.

Reaching success in a period coinciding with the youth movement started by the Beatles that was taking over the world, Carlos was the leader of Jovem Guarda. He led the TV show that became a generic denomination of a musical style and what was a definitive change of face to the Brazilian phonographic market and of the very art of marketing itself (with the advent of an aggressive merchandising of the JG's top figures, including films, clothes, etc.), encompassing deep behavioral/gestual/language influences widespread through his entire generation. His light music, derived from British pop, and his (and his partner's Erasmo Carlos') lyrics (happy, humorous, and full of fashionable youth slang and na\u00efve though unexpectedly sexual) were deeply contrasting to the serious mpb, with its somber images and protest songs. After all, Brazil was living in a dark period of the military dictatorship, or the \"years of lead\" as they became known.\n\nA few years later, in the late '60s, Carlos (counseled by his advisers) changed his style to become the most successful romantic artist in Brazil. Having written (always with Erasmo Carlos) some of the most beautiful songs in this style (such as \"Detalhes,\" \"Sua Estupidez,\" \"Jesus Cristo,\" \"Debaixo dos Carac\u00f3is dos Seus Cabelos,\" etc.), Carlos accumulated virtually all possible accomplishments as a highly successful artist, including a solid international career with awards like the Grammy and top positions on Billboard's Latin charts. Though the adherence to a worn-out sentimental formula proved to be affective in commercial terms (more than 70 million albums sold in his career), it ultimately led him to be known, in the '80s and '90s, as a cheesy artist by youngsters and part of the adult listeners. Nevertheless, the mid-'90s witnessed a resurgence of Jovem Guarda talents through tributes of new rockers and Carlos reached the 21st century uncontestedly enjoying his absolute title: the King.\n\nRoberto Carlos was from a lower-middle-class family. At six, he lost one of his legs and began using a prosthesis. At nine, he debuted on his home city's local radio. In 1955, he moved to Niter\u00f3i (Rio de Janeiro) and then to Lins de Vasconcelos (a suburb of Rio de Janeiro), where he started to get into rock through Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard, at the same time he met Carlos Imperial, also from his hometown, who, as a TV and radio producer, would be of considerable importance to Carlos's early professional years. Two years later, Carlos performed at TV Tupi, singing \"Tutti Frutti\" (R. Penniman/J. Lubin/D. La Bostrie). In that period, he was scheduled to open a Bill Haley show at the Maracanazinho (Rio), when he became acquainted with Erasmo Carlos (then Erasmo Esteves). In 1958, Carlos met the \"Matoso gang,\" as were known the future artists Tim Maia, Jorge Ben, and the same Erasmo Esteves, among others, who would meet at Matoso Street at Tijuca (a neighborhood of Rio). Carlos, Erasmo, and Tim Maia (together with Edson Trindade, Arl\u00eanio L\u00edvio, and Jos\u00e9 Roberto \"China\") formed the group the Snacks (later the Sputniks), playing balls and performing on TV (including at Carlos Imperial's Clube do Rock on TV Continental, where Carlos was already a regular). The group was soon dissolved due to the incompatibility between Carlos and Maia.\n\nAfter working as an extra in several films such as Ag\u00fcenta o Roj\u00e3o and Minha Sogra \u00e9 da Pol\u00edcia (in which they backed up Cauby Peixoto on one song), Carlos and Erasmo played together in Erasmo's quartet the Snakes until Carlos was called by Imperial to take Carlos Lyra's place in the Os Terr\u00edveis band that played Elvis Presley covers on TV shows and live performances contracted by Imperial.\n\nSoon, Carlos left the band to try to become a bossa nova artist. Strongly influenced by Jo\u00e3o Gilberto in that period, Carlos often tried to \"sit-in\" at the famous temples Plaza nightclub and the clubs of the Beco das Garrafas, but to no avail. A testimony of his ephemeral and unaccomplished bossa nova phase is Carlos' first album, with \"Jo\u00e3o e Maria\" and \"Fora do Tom\" (both by Imperial). In August 1960, a new release was launched, again in the bossa vein, \"Brotinho Sem Ju\u00edzo\" and \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o do Amor Nenhum\" (again, both by Imperial). At the same time, Carlos would participate regularly in shows presented by Imperial, Os Brotos Comandam (TV Continental and R\u00e1dio Guanabara) and Festa de Brotos (TV Tupi). In 1961, in the same year in which Carlos recorded his first LP (a derivation toward boleros and ballads, Louco por Voc\u00ea) that earned some acceptance at the time (3,500 copies sold in one year), he accepted the suggestion of the record company CBS and changed his style to youth music, starting to write songs with the composer/lyricist who would become his most important collaborator: Erasmo Carlos. The duo's first hit was Carlos' rendition for an Erasmo version of \"Splish Splash\" (Bobby Darin), having as the B-side another classic written by them, \"Parei na Contram\u00e3o.\" The album was recorded and launched in 1963 as Carlos' fifth 78 rpm, accompanied by Renato e seus Blue Caps. It sold 7,500 copies, a modest amount today, but it represented a considerable selling then and the milestone of a new time.\n\nIn 1964, the LP \u00c9 Proibido Fumar (backed by the Youngsters) had hits with the title track (by Carlos/Erasmo) and with Erasmo's version of \"Road Hog\" (Gwen/John D. Loudermilk), \"O Calhambeque.\" It sold almost 12,000 copies in 18 months and was considered high-selling then, but still behind the leader Carlos Alberto (a bolero singer), who was selling more than twice as much. Nevertheless, Carlos' nationwide success was ascending, with more and more invitations for TV and radio shows and CBS wanting to take him to Argentina. That year, Carlos recorded the same repertory in Spanish, also backed by the Youngsters, and the album Es Prohibido Fumar was released by the end of 1964 in Argentina. It was planned to also be distributed in Brazil, but as the military government considered anything in Spanish (the language of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara) dangerous to the country, the album was simply taken out of the catalog by the recording company.\n\nIn 1965, Carlos was elected the King for the first time by direct vote of the audience in a contest promoted by Ant\u00f4nio Aguillar on his Reino da Juventude show. Later, the title would be confirmed at the highly popular Chacrinha show and it would be his for life.\n\nIn the same year, Roberto Carlos Canta Para a Juventude broke all records established by the singer until then, by far surpassing Carlos Alberto and his Amor Perdido. Carlos' album reached fifth place according to IBOPE (a most-accredited public opinion research institute), however, it quickly fell several positions. In fact, he would only have an album at number one of the top parade by the end of the year, with his next LP. Until then, his rising success would sell over 20,000 copies of the double single with \"Hist\u00f3ria de um Homem Mau\" (reaching fourth place on the charts) and 50,000 copies of his single \"N\u00e3o Quero Ver Voc\u00ea Triste.\"\n\nOn September 5, Roberto Carlos opened the legendary show Jovem Guarda as the main host and also featuring Vanderl\u00e9a and Erasmo Carlos by his side. The show gave the name and directives to the first musical scene produced especially for Brazilian youth, representing a major cultural/behavioral/commercial breakthrough. After the show debut, Carlos' popularity reached levels unimagined until then. Scoring hits in Argentina and Brazil, Carlos became the best-seller for CBS. A double single with \"A Garota do Baile,\" Carlos reached number two in November, behind the Beatles' \"Help!\" But his album Jovem Guarda, also launched in November, took only one week to push \"Help!\" out of number one on the Brazilian charts, selling almost 200,000 copies in one year. \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo Pro Inferno\" became a nationwide hit and with the exception of brief periods of time, it reigned absolute at number one on the top parade during the entire first semester of 1966. After performing in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay \u2014 countries in which the Spanish version of \"O Calhambeque\" continued to have success \u2014 Carlos went to Europe in April 1966, singing in Portugal (where \"Calhambeque\" and \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo Pro Inferno\" were in first place on Lisbon charts). Returning to Brazil, he soon departed for a tour that started in South America, then Central and North America, where he sang in Los Angeles, Miami, and New York, then Europe (London, Paris, Berlin, and Lisbon). Roberto Carlos, released in December 1966 and went right to number one in the second week (remaining there until April 1967), sold 300,000 copies in less than a year. Also in 1967, Carlos starred the feature film Roberto Carlos em Ritmo de Aventura (whose soundtrack sold 300,000 copies, staying at number one from December 17 until June 1968; the film also broke all box-office records until then); won fifth place at the III FMPB (Festival of Brazilian Popular Music of the TV Record, S\u00e3o Paulo) with \"Maria, Carnaval e Cinzas,\" by Lu\u00eds Carlos Paran\u00e1 (reaching number one as a single in November); participated in the MIDEM Festival in Cannes, France; and won the Chico Viola trophy for the songs \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo pro Inferno\" and \"Esque\u00e7a\" and for the LP Jovem Guarda. In June of the same year, Carlos departed for a series of shows in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the U.S. In Italy, he participated in the Venice Song Festival.\n\nIn 1968, Carlos left Jovem Guarda, which due to his absence would soon cease to exist. His departure was a result of a mature decision to migrate from a youth idol profile to that of a romantic singer. In the same year, Carlos won the San Remo Festival (XVIII Festival della Canzone Italiana) with \"Canzone Per Te\" (Sergio Endrigo) and starred the film O Diamante Cor-de-Rosa (also a box office success), opening his own show Roberto Carlos \u00e0 Noite (TV Record) on March 15. As a romantic singer, Carlos had several hits in the 1970s that still had his creative impetus, such as \"Sua Estupidez,\" \"As Flores do Jardim de Nossa Casa,\" \"Jesus Cristo,\" \"Amada Amante,\" \"Detalhes,\" \"Debaixo dos Carac\u00f3is dos Seus Cabelos,\" \"A Montanha,\" \"A Proposta,\" \"Al\u00e9m do Horizonte,\" \"Olha,\" \"Amante \u00e0 Moda Antiga,\" and \"A Ilha\" (all with Erasmo), along with \"Como Vai Voc\u00ea?\" (Ant\u00f4nio Marcos/M\u00e1rio Marcos), and two songs written by Caetano Veloso especially for him, \"Como Dois e Dois\" and \"Muito Rom\u00e2ntico.\" In that decade, Carlos also consolidated his international career doing regular shows in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America. In the year of 1970, he did his first show at the prestigious Canec\u00e3o, which would be the first of his highly successful annual seasons at the most important Carioca hall in terms of media resonance. In the early '70s, Carlos became the top record-selling Brazilian artist, a position he would keep for many consecutive years. After 1976, his albums were selling over 1,000,000 copies. His 1977 album Roberto Carlos, with \"Falando S\u00e9rio,\" sold 2.2 million copies. His 1978 show also beat all records, with 250,000 spectators in six months throughout Brazil, while the album with \"Caf\u00e9 da Manh\u00e3,\" \"For\u00e7a Estranha,\" and \"Lady Laura\" sold 1.5 million copies.\n\nIn the '80s, Carlos also started to record in English and French (he had already recorded albums in Spanish, Italian, and, naturally, Portuguese), having won the Globo de Cristal trophy, awarded by CBS to Brazilian artists who sell more than five million copies outside Brazil. At the same time, his albums continued to break records in his country. \"Caminhoneiro\" (1984) was aired 3,000 times in a single day, another record soon beaten by his own \"Verde e Amarelo\" (1985), with 3,500 spins. In 1986, he had success at Radio City Music Hall (New York, NY) and, two years later, won the Grammy as the Best Latin American Pop singer. In 1989, his Sonrie reached first place on Billboard's Latin chart.\n\nIn the 1990s, Roberto Carlos became the first Latin American artist to sell more albums than the Beatles (in 1994, having by then sold over 70 million copies of his albums). In the mid-'90s, with the retro Jovem Guarda wave, Carlos, who was worn out among the younger generations who had only known his romantic and sentimental hits directed at a middle-aged audience, had his importance recuperated by young rockers such as C\u00e1ssia Eller, Chico Science & Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi, Bar\u00e3o Vermelho, and Skank, who recorded Rei, a tribute to him with his old Jovem Guarda hits.\n\nIn 1998, his second wife Maria Rita discovered she had cancer (she would die in 1999), which shattered his peace of mind. Trying to keep on with his career, Carlos continued to record and perform after one year of reclusion. In 2001, he broke his contract with Sony (ex-CBS), the recording company through which he had released a vast majority of his albums, due to commercial reasons related to his wife's demise.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dash Berlin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10338224.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Music", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Top 25' Dash Berlin including the new singles 'Home' and 'Love Out Loud'!

Inspired by such visceral singers as Janis Joplin and Tina Turner, she left school at sixteen to follow her own dreams. Dilana soon found herself with a promising music career in Holland, becoming one of the country's most coveted live acts. Recording and releasing the album Wonderfool in 2000 yielded five singles, four videos and a string of touring and festival gigs throughout the region, celebrating her natural talents as a songwriter and performer.\n\nBy way of Houston, Dilana arrived in L.A. and auditioned to compete on TV's \"Rock Star Supernova.\" Quoted in the Hollywood Press, \"The moment she stepped on the Mayan Theatre stage for Episode 1 and performed 'Lithium,' Dilana instantly became the show's frontrunner.\" Her powerful vocals and commanding stage presence amassed legions of new fans from around the world. That acclaim inspired Dilana to further pursue her musical passions with characteristic tenacity.\n\nDilana has performed with rock's biggest legends including Tommy Lee and Mick Mars (M\u00f6tley Crue), Dave Navarro (Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). In 2007, she won over the masses with opening slot performances for Aerosmith and Beth Hart. She launched two solo tours spanning North America and Western Europe that both consistently sold out and earned stellar reviews in the press and in 2009, Dilana ended a third successful year performing by touring her native South Africa.\n\n\nFollowing the release of seven singles, Dilana spent much of 2008 in the studio. In November 2009, she unleashed the album Inside Out, featuring 12 original tracks and her first full-length album in nine years. As new opportunities presented themselves, Dilana jumped at the chance to venture into film acting. The singer/songwriter won the BEST ACTRESS award at the Action On Film International Film Festival as well as winning both the BEST ACTRESS award and the BEST MUSIC award at the American International Film Festival for the 9 songs she wrote and performed in the rock drama: Angel Camouflaged.\n\nDuring her extensive world touring, Dilana performed in Afghanistan for the troops in 2009 and 2010. She was a part of the Go Army Concert Series tour in August 2011, sharing the stage with Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Doobie Brothers as well as touring Holland, South Africa, and across the USA.\n\n2012/2013 brought fans news that Dilana would be welcoming two new creations to the world. One, the studio release of her studio album titled Beautiful Monster, in which she went on tour where she opened for Puddle of Mudd and also for Saliva, and the other, Dilana's best creation EVER - a beautiful daughter named River. Both officially released in 2013.\n\nIn 2016 her fifth album was released, called Dilana / Angel Camouflaged, the soundtrack of the movie with the same name.\nIn the same year her first live (acoustic) DVD was also released.\nIn 2016 Dilana was invited to be part of The Voice of Holland...", "otherInfo": "Round 8 of the Live Streaming Is Here!

Taking her cue from divas of the past and present such as Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Donna Summer, Diana Ross and Sarah Vaughn, this Brooklyn, New York based singer/songwriter and pianist is destined for greatness.\n\nAlison Crockett decided early on, that a career in music was to be the path she would travel. Piano was her first love. \"It just called to me. I still feel like a pianist who sings.\" However after winning several local vocal talent showcases during her high school years, it became quickly apparent that her voice was a rare gift. Alison honed her vocal skills at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA and then a masters degree at the prestigious Manhattan School of Music. As she says, \"I set out to be a craftsman; someone who could mold and shape music like a sculpture.\" Throughout her school years, Alison continued to build her reputation and gain a loyal following by performing regularly with notable local and national artists in and around her Washington, DC home as well as in Philadelphia and New York.\n\nWhile living and performing in Philly, she met up with dj/producer King Britt (formerly of Digable Planets) and recorded the now classic, Season's Change for the groundbreaking Sylk 130 recording, When the Funk Hits the Fan (Ovum/Sony Music). She was also featured on four other genre bending tracks on the album including the first single, Gettin' Into It. Billboard loved her \"throaty, diva-styled vocals.\"\n\nAfter touring with Sylk 130, Alison relocated to Brooklyn, NY, where she currently resides. Almost immediately upon her arrival she began working with hip hop/jazz pioneer Greg Osby at the Knitting Factory for the 1996 What Is Jazz Festival, and at the Clef Club for 1997's Mellon Jazz Festival. In 1998, she was invited to participate in the prestigious Thelonius Monk Institute Jazz Colony in Aspen, CO, where she appeared on the same stage with jazz luminaries Nnenna Freelon and Herbie Hancock.\n\nAfter hearing her work, Geoff Wilkenson , co-founder of the UK based acid jazz outfit Us3 (noted for their 1994 world-wide smash \"Flip Fantasia (Biddy Biddy Bop)\" ) became convinced he was hearing a young legend on the order of his heroes Shirley Bassey, Dianna Washington or Dianne Reeves. He embarked upon a feverish search to track her down and request that Alison became Us3's first lead singer. Upon her acceptance, Alison traveled to London to write and sing on the album An Ordinary Day in an Unusual Place. \"I learned a lot about writing on that record,\" she says. \" Geoff had ideas for songs that required me to come from certain thematic places that were not as natural for me. I really enjoyed the challenge and I'm proud of what I did.\" The first single, Get Out, immediately shot to the top 10 within a few weeks of its release in Japan. In support of the single and the album, Alison toured extensively in Japan and Europe with the group.\n\nThroughout her time on the road with Us3, and back in New York, Alison continued to write, perform and work on a number of interesting musical projects -- always trying to grow, while bringing her unique sound and soulfulness to each new musical venture; often under the pseudonym Diva Blue. Almost overwhelmed with creative energy and song ideas, Alison could hardly wait to begin working on a project that would showcase the new music she was writing.\n\nNow it's time for the world to experience Alison's singular vision as a solo soul artist. She's currently putting the final touches on her first solo recording, On Becoming a Woman. She describes the songs as a cross between Jill Scott, Meshell N'degeocello and UK broken beat visionaries 4-Hero, but make no mistake, it's pure Alison Crockett!. Alison solely composed all of the music and lyrics on the album. Her brother and business partner, multi-instrumentalist teddycrockett, handled production. She is also collaborating with dj/producer Landslide (hospital records UK) and with the up and coming Brooklyn based drum'n bass producers, Mathmatics adding soul to the UK breakbeat and drum'n bass scenes.

They were inducted into the rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and have performed in approx 40 countries.\n\nThe group was formed by Brian Jones, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards met as schoolmates in Dartford, Kent. They took their name from a Muddy Waters song called \"Rollin' Stone Blues\", and made their live debut in July 1962 at London's Marquee Club (minus Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts). They start playing pubs and clubs around the city and suburbs. Bill Wyman joined later that year (the popular story is that he was asked because he had his own amplifier), replacing Dick Taylor, who started the The Pretty Things.\n\n\nIn January 1963, Charlie Watts joined the Stones. The band gigged constantly, with residencies at venues like Ealing Jazz Club, Ken Colyer's Studio 51, and Eel Pie Island in Twickenham. Their weekly peformances at the Crawdaddy at Richmond's Station Hotel resulted in ecstatic press reviews, and in April Andrew Loog Oldham saw them there and signed them to his management company the next day. He started the \"Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone\" press campaign, which set the tone for their career, which has included drug arrests, and many notorious incidents.\n\nIn May 1963, the Stones were signed to Decca Records, supposedly by the same man who had turned down the Beatles. A month later \"Come On\", the first Rolling Stones single, was released, and reached number two in the U.K. charts.\n\nThe fifth and some say founding member of the group, Brian Jones, left officially on 8th June 1969, issuing a statement saying that he wanted to form a new group, possibly with Steve Marriott. On 3rd July 1969, around midnight Jones was found at the bottom of his swimming pool at his home in Sussex, England. The coroner reported \"Death by misadventure\", noting his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by drug and alcohol abuse. Some said it was suicide, others attributed foul play, even blaming Jagger and Richards for Jones state of mental depression.\n\nHe was replaced by Mick Taylor, formerly in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Another former bandmember to mention would have to be Ian Stewart (b. July 18, 1938 - d. December 12, 1985), who officially was in Brian Jones new group prior to even Mick or Keith, but according to legend was squeezed out of the band at Andrew Loog Oldham's suggestion in the early 1960's. Stu was considered by many as the 6th member, and still regularly played piano onstage with the group for many years, steadily at every gig on every tour until 1971, and on & off through 1982 when he was also employed as \"road manager\".\n\n\nIn 1971 the Stones, whose contract with Decca had expired, launched their Rolling Stones Records label originally distributed through Atlantic, an arrangement which lasted a decade.\n\nIn December 1974 Taylor left the group in order to pursue a solo career. He was replaced in 1975 by Faces guitarist Ronnie Wood.\n\nThe Stones became one of the world's most popular touring groups, routinely playing huge sports arenas and stadiums, pioneering mobile recording, corporate sponsorships, and setting records for ticket prices.\n\nBill Wyman left the fold, and was replaced shortly before the group began the Voodoo Lounge stadium tour in 1993. Current bassist Darryl Jones, born in 1961 only a year before the group started, is not an \"official\" band member, but has played bass in the band for more than 15 years.\n\n\nAll the \"official\" members have also undertaken solo projects of various kinds.

The album, Miranda\u2019s fourth full-length solo release, is more than just an artistic step forward, it\u2019s a whole new way for her to make music. \u201cThis really is the most collaborative record I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s first time I\u2019ve shared so much of the writing and the production, the meat and bones of making an album.\u201d\n\nWith support from a stellar circle of players \u2013 including My Brightest Diamond\u2019s Shara Nova, TV On The Radio\u2019s Kyp Malone, Grandaddy/Modest Mouse\u2019s Jim Fairchild and Built To Spill\u2019s Matthew Morgan amongst others \u2013 it\u2019s Miranda\u2019s astonishing singing vocal that is set free, elevating this collection of songs as no one else could. An instrument which can shift from a barely-there whisper to a soaring wail that cracks open the sky, Holly\u2019s voice is startling from the moment it emerges on Mutual Horse.\n\nThis record finds Holly bridging the gap between 2010\u2019s experimental synth laden release The Magician\u2019s Private Library and 2015\u2019s stripped-back, soulful self-titled record. Miranda takes an honest and intimate approach, while maintaining her sense of humor amidst sonic explorations. The tracks run the gamut from the sultry, driving \u201cOn the Radio,\u201d to a cover of Crazy Horse\u2019s \u201cWhen Your Lonely Heart Breaks,\u201d and the delicate \u201cSing Like,\u201d inspired by Miranda\u2019s mother; an intimate clip of her singing while pregnant with Holly follows the song.\n\nThe album was recorded in Los Angeles, where Miranda laid down the beginnings of 23 songs before returning to her home base of New York City to finish the songs that would end up on the album. The Dangerbird studio also inspired the album\u2019s title. \u201cMutual Horse comes from this image we hung in the studio. It was a photo of the singer-songwriter Cris Williamson\u2014we did a cover of her song \u2018Midnight Oil\u2019\u2014and I had become a big fan,\u201d Miranda explains. \u201cWe printed out photos of her from the 1970s and taped them up around the studio; that was our vibe.\u201d One of those photos was of Williamson and another woman holding the reins of a horse; the two women are staring at each other, but the horse is staring at the camera. That picture was on the wall of Miranda\u2019s studio, and eventually someone scrawled the phrase \u201cMutual Horse\u201d beneath it.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like just mine,\u201d Miranda says of the album, which took its name from the graffiti. \u201cIt feels like it belongs to everybody who worked on it. I opened myself to collaborating this time around, which made me really vulnerable.\u201d Her collaborators on Mutual Horse include Shara Nova (My Brightest Diamond), Josh Werner (Dr. John, Lee Scratch Perry), Jared Samuel (Yoko Ono), Jim Kirby Fairchild (Grandaddy, Modest Mouse), Kyp Malone (TV On the Radio), Maria Eisen (Underground System), and Matthew Morgan (Built to Spill, Modest Mouse) among others.\n\nMiranda grew up between Detroit and Nashville, two music towns that would influence her own journey in a very profound way. She began playing piano at the age of six, taught her self-guitar at 14 and moved to New York at 16 to start her professional career. For nearly 20 years, she\u2019s been performing, writing and producing with some of the best talent in the business. She has performed with the likes of Karen O, Lou Reed, The XX, and Lesley Gore.

But it wasn\u2019t until she began exploring her own southern soul roots for her last album, The Muscle Shoals Sessions, that she found her musical sweet spot \u2014 and knew her next stop had to be the place where blues and soul converge (and where she herself was conceived); where Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Al Green, Otis Redding, B.B, King and so many others turned grit and groove into some of the world\u2019s most beloved tunes. Black then hunted down several top musical architects to help her lay down the sound she was meant to make \u2014 the sound of Memphis.\n\nReleasing June 2, 2017 on her own Reuben Records, Memphis puts Black \u2014 already considered \u201ca bluesy, R&B heavy hitter\u201d by Elmore magazine \u2014 on the same continuum as soul sisters from Dusty Springfield, Ann Peebles and Mavis Staples to Bonnie Raitt and Shelby Lynne.\n\nThe album was produced and engineered by Scott Bomar, the Grammy-nominated, Emmy-winning producer and leader of the Bo-Keys. His band includes Hi Records rhythm section\u2019s drummer Howard Grimes, who joins fellow Hi greats, the Rev. Charles Hodges (piano and Hammond B3) and his brother, Leroy \u201cFlick\u201d Hodges (bass) on many of these tracks, along with Stax guitarist, Bobby Manuel and other Memphis musicians. With the expertise of these players, plus horn and strings arrangements by Marc Franklin of the Bo-Keys and the Gregg Allman Band, the album\u2019s seven originals and three well-chosen covers (by Otis Clay, Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland and Ruby Johnson), nail the passion that flows through this town like the mighty Mississippi.\n\nInfusing her vocals with Saturday-night sultriness and Sunday-morning gospel, slow-dance sexiness and fast-dance exuberance, Black goes from silky smooth to raw and gritty with equal ease. Her organic sound was recorded old-school analog style at Bomar\u2019s Electraphonic Studios and mixed to tape by Adam Hill at Ardent Studios. The result is pure and authentic \u2014and she wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\n\u201cI love the music of Memphis; everything that came out of here in the \u201850s, the \u201860s, the \u201870s \u2026 I love the grit and the guts and the soul and the groove,\u201d Black says. \u201cAnd the heart of it all is the blues.\u201d\n\nBlack says she hopes Memphis inspires listeners to dig into this music as she has, and to explore \u201cthe history, the people, the stories\u201d of this fabled place. With her live Memphis Music Revue, she\u2019s ready to carry that music far and wide; but no matter where you live, let her take you to Memphis.

Shortly after the album\u2019s release, she moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia and had her first commercial success when two of her songs were placed in the award-winning British-Canadian two-part drama Sex Traffic (2004) and in the TV drama series Snakes and Ladders (2004).\n\nWith her second album, Two Hearts (2008), Martin gained considerable attention as a hot up-and-coming artist with several East Coast Music Awards and Nominations. Her Two Hearts music video rose to #5 on the Much More Music Countdown, leading to tours across Canada, the US and Ireland. She performed high-profile shows with Canadian rock icon Matt Mays and sang on Parliament Hill in Ottawa for The Queen of England. You Come Home was placed in the internationally distributed teen drama series The Best Years (2010). Two Hearts won Martin two 2008 Music Nova Scotia Awards, and a 2009 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\nHer third album I Can Too (2010) received rave reviews and includes a collaboration with Blue Rodeo\u2019s Greg Keelor on her rendering of Andrew Sisk\u2019s Subject To Change. \u201cWhat sets I Can Too apart is Martin\u2019s commitment to honestly exploring complicated relationships.\u201d (Exclaim Magazine, October 2010). Following multiple East Coast Music Award Nominations and extensive touring across Canada with Juno nominated indie rock band Cuff The Duke, Martin began touring independently in Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nIn 2011 Martin worked on building her label Come Undone Records, and focused on developing a global online presence with fans via community-based projects. She worked with PledgeMusic.com to release A House Concert (2011) containing fourteen live acoustic versions of songs from her first three studio albums. Martin was nominated at the 2011 Music Nova Scotia Awards for Digital Artist of the Year and A House Concert was nominated at the 2012 East Coast Music Awards for Folk Recording of the Year. This project also raised awareness and funds for the Canadian Mental Health Association. During 2011-2012 Christina continued her community development initiatives with a yearlong Artist in Residency through Geriatric Medicine Research (GMR) at Dalhousie University and The Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 2014 she released an EP titled Remember Me, featuring five songs inspired by and dedicated to individuals affected by dementia. Co-produced and written by Dale Murray, the EP won the 2014 Music Nova Scotia Award for Inspirational Recording of the Year.\n\nSleeping With A Stranger (2012), Martin\u02bcs fifth award-winning album, reflects the artist\u2019s coming of age lyrically and musically. \u201cIt\u02bcs one of those rare albums where you have to listen to it all in one sitting. Like a good book that\u2019s hard to put down, Sleeping With A Stranger tickles the ears and within three bars you\u2019re completely hooked.\u201d (Americana UK, October 2012). The album won her the 2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Recording of the Year Award. It was nominated for three East Coast Music Awards Come Undone Records was nominated for Music Nova Scotia Company of the Year. What I Always Knew was placed in the CBC television drama Heartland and her single Falling For You remained on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 countdown for five months.\n\nMartin returned home from Europe in the spring of 2014, following eighty concert dates which included a performance at Rolling Stone Weekender Festival, a publicity partnership with PopUp Records in Hamburg, and an endorsement from the esteemed Duesenberg Custom Guitar Shop in Hannover, Germany. She secured relationships for her future from her home base as Artist in Residence in the city of Dachau, Germany.\n\nIt\u2019ll Be Alright (2015) found Christina attaining what her music has always suggested, a place where the ghosts of her musical heroes freely mingle with the architecture of modern music. Working closely with her long-time producer and guitarist Dale Murray, drummer Brian Murray and bassist Jason Vautour, Martin made a conscious effort to confound the expectations of those who have categorized her in the past. This record utilizes far more sonic textures, allowing Martin to explore the many sides of her musical personality. The album won a 2016 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year and her It\u2019ll Be Alright single rose to #6 on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 chart. You Ran From Me was voted the #14 most played Canadian song on Sonica for 2015, and Somewhere With You was placed in the CBC Television show Heartland.\n\nFollowing two years of touring across Germany, Poland, The Netherlands, The UK, Switzerland, Austria, France and Canada, Martin returned home briefly in 2016 to write her newest album. A fervent anthem for those who are lost and longing, Lungs Are Burning was the first single from her album Impossible To Hold (Released March 23, 2018). The first single was triggered by the rising Fentanyl drug crisis killing thousands of Canadians, with Christina\u2019s lyrics set to music by her and Dale Murray. With lyrics like \u201cwhile I\u2019m watching the babies\u201d and \u201cgot to go out and get some, baby\u201d, Martin captures the desperation of \u201cchasing the dream\u201d and the horror of living it. Murray\u2019s stately production brings that stark reality home with a bite. Martin: \u201cThe song is an modest attempt to bring light to the heavy topic of addiction, and reflects my own personal sense of loss, longing and a deep void, and the ache I feel from losing my brother and friends to addiction and mental illness.\u201d For her Canadian tour dates, Christina has partnered with Center for Addiction and Mental Health to increase engagement and awareness.\n\n\u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is Martin\u2019s sixth and strongest studio album, achieving a perfect balance between organic ambience and impeccable production. \u201cI\u2019m writing about faith and love more than ever with songs like \u2018Keep Me Calm\u2019 and \u2018Always Reminding\u2019, but I haven\u2019t shaken the need to write about the darker things that are part of our human journey\u201d. Combining good taste, passionate singing and thoughtful lyrics, \u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is where music and poetry meet. The album won the 2018 Music Nova Scotia Award for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\n\nAWARDS\n\n2018 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Impossible To Hold)\n2016 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (It\u2019ll Be Alright)\n2014 Music Nova Scotia Inspirational Recording of the Year (Remember Me \u2013 EP)\n2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Sleeping With A Stranger)\n2009 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n\nARTIST IN RESIDENCIES COMPLETED\n\n2013-2015 Dachau, Germany\n\n2010-2011 Halifax NS, Canada \u2013 Dalhousie Geriatric Medical Research & Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN)\n\nFESTIVALS/CONFERENCES\n\n2019 Ottawa Blues Fest - Ottawa ON, Canada\n2019 Area506 - Saint John NB, Canada\n2018 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto, Canada\n2017 Sonder Fest \u2013 Manchester, United Kingdom\n2016 Reeperbahn Festival \u2013 Hamburg, Germany\n2016 Rising Tide Festival @ Fundy National Park- Alma NB, Canada\n2016 Harmony Bazaar Festival \u2013 Lockeport NS, Canada\n2016 Maverick Festival \u2013 Suffolk, United Kingdom\n2013 Rolling Stone Weekender Festival \u2013 Weissenh\u00e4user Strand, Germany\n2011 Winter Olympics @ Atlantic Canada House \u2013 Vancouver BC, Canada\n2011 Canada Games \u2013 Halifax NS, Canada\n2011 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2010 Belfast Nashville Songwriters Festival \u2013 Belfast, Ireland\n2009 Folk Alliance \u2013 Memphis TN, USA\n2009 North By North East \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2009 Stan Rogers Festival \u2013 Canso NS, Canada\n2002 SXSW - Austin TX, USA", "otherInfo": "It's Mother's Day!

But before moving to the DC area, Jorma and family lived in the Philippines and other locales as he followed his father's career from assignment to assignment before returning to the place of his birth. As a teenager in Washington he and future Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady (who at the time played six-string guitar) formed a band named The Triumphs. Kaukonen departed Washington for studies at Antioch College where friend Ian Buchanan taught him fingerstyle guitar playing. Buchanan also introduced Kaukonen to the music of Reverend Gary Davis, whose songs have remained important parts of Kaukonen's repertoire throughout his career.\n\nIn 1962 Kaukonen moved to the San Francisco bay area and enrolled in Santa Clara University. During this time he taught guitar lessons in a small music store in San Jose. As a self-described blues purist, Kaukonen never had any ambition to play in a rock band. He played as a solo act in coffee houses and can be heard accompanying a young Janis Joplin on acoustic guitar on an historic 1964 recording (known as \"The Typewriter Tapes\" because of the obtrusive sound of Kaukonen's first wife Margareta typing in the background). Invited to attend a Jefferson Airplane rehearsal by founding member Paul Kantner, Kaukonen found his imagination excited by the arsenal of effects available to electric guitar and later said, \"I was sucked in by technology.\"\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nKaukonen's electric guitar work was distinctive and widely emulated by other Bay Area guitarists. Notable work with Jefferson Airplane includes \"Greasy Heart\", \"If You Feel\", \"Hey Frederick\" (which culminates in an extended lead guitar duet with himself), \"Wooden Ships\" and his original composition, \"Feel So Good\". Rolling Stone named Kaukonen the 54th greatest rock guitarist of all time and 16th greatest acoustic guitarist.\n\nThough never a prolific singer and songwriter during his Airplane tenure, Kaukonen contributed some distinctive material. \"Embryonic Journey\" showcased his fingerstyle acoustic guitar virtuosity. On the next Jefferson Airplane album, After Bathing at Baxter's, his playing developed a harder-edged sound inspired by Mike Bloomfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Cream and other groups that visited San Francisco. These stylistic changes are prominent in the acid rocker \"The Last Wall of the Castle\", as well as the instrumental \"Spare Chaynge\", co-written with bassist Jack Casady and drummer Spencer Dryden. Clocking in at 9:12 minutes, this improvisational style was further explored on the free-form extended jams \"Thing\" and \"Bear Melt\", both live instrumentals recorded in 1968. Kaukonen insists, however, on the liner notes of the Live at the Fillmore East album that these jams were not chaotic \"free for alls\" but in fact \"complex rehearsed arrangements.\" Two notable songs that were later to become Hot Tuna signature tunes were also recorded during the 1968-1969 period. These were the traditionals \"Rock Me Baby \" and the gospel ballad \"Good Shepherd.\" Other original compositions with the Airplane appeared on the 1971 album \"Bark\", the instrumental \"Wild Turkey\" and \"Feel So good\", as well as the acoustic autobiographical \"Third Week in the Chelsea\" detailing his feelings about the disintegration of the band.\n\nHot Tuna and solo career\n\nIn 1969-70, Kaukonen and Jack Casady formed Hot Tuna, a spin-off group that allowed them to play as long as they liked. An early incarnation of Hot Tuna included Airplane vocalist Marty Balin and featured Joey Covington on drums and vocals. This grouping came to an end after an unsuccessful recording jaunt to Jamaica, the sessions of which have never been released. Pared down to Kaukonen and Casady, Hot Tuna lived on as a vehicle for Kaukonen to show off his Piedmont style acoustic blues fingerpicking skills. The self-titled first album was all acoustic and recorded live. With the dissolution of Jefferson Airplane in 1972, Hot Tuna went electric, with Airplane fiddler Papa John Creach joining for the next two albums. Hot Tuna scored an FM hit with \"Ja Da (Keep On Truckin')\" from their third (and first studio) album, Burgers. At this time, Kaukonen's song-writing began to dominate, as further evidenced by the next album, The Phosphorescent Rat, which only featured one cover song. Beginning with their fifth album, America's Choice (1974), the addition of drummer Bob Steeler encouraged a rise in volume and a change of band personality -- a rampaging, Cream-like rock with often quasi-mystical lyrics courtesy of Kaukonen. During this period, the power trio was known for its very long live sets and instrumental jamming.\n\nIn 1974, Kaukonen recorded the first and most successful of several solo albums, Quah, together with Tom Hobson. Produced by Jack Casady, and featuring (somewhat surprisingly) string overdubs on some tracks, this album contained some of Kaukonen's most deft fingerpicking work, especially on \"Hamar Promenade\", \"Blue Prelude\", \"Genesis\" and \" Flying Clouds\". The curious picture that adorns Quah's cover is today on display at Donkey Coffe and Espresso, a coffee shop in Athens, Ohio.\n\nKaukonen toured vigorously throughout the 1970s in both the United States and Europe, but with Hot Tuna's break up in 1978, the first phase of the band's career ended. Casady left to form the new wave band \"SVT\", while Kaukonen released his second solo album, Jorma, a mix of electric guitar and acoustic fingerstyle in 1979. Meanwhile, he had formed the band \"Vital Parts\".\n\nVital Parts featured bassist Denny DeGorio, who had played in a San Francisco band called the \"Offs\" with ex-Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler. Kaukonen, experimenting with a new image, not only cut his hair but dyed it purple then bright orange, and had extensive tattoos adorn his body, back and arms. The album Barbeque King was released in 1980. Kaukonen's traditional fan base did not warm to this new, perceived to be \"punk\" image, and sales of the album were so disappointing that Jorma was soon dropped from RCA records.\n\nHe continued playing as a solo artist throughout the 1980s at such venues as The Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia, The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey and in Port Chester, New York. As in his Hot Tuna days, he played very long sets, usually beginning with an hour-long acoustic set followed by a long intermission and then a two hour electric set, sometimes accompanied by bass and drums. Hot Tuna themselves reformed in the late 1980s. At a 1987 Hot Tuna performance, Kaukonen surprised fellow Airplane alumnus Paul Kantner, who was sitting in, with a surprise appearance by his estranged lover Grace Slick; the success of this performance helped to pave the way for a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and record in 1989.\n\nIn 1980, Kaukonen appeared on Robert Hunter's Amagamalin Street. This was the third album released by Relix Records, a label, founded by Les Kippel, that specialized in bands from the San Francisco Bay Area. Relix also released Splashdown, featuring a rare performance by Hot Tuna on WQIV, a defunct radio station in New York. Kippel was instrumental in reuniting Kaukonen and Casady in 1985 for a Hot Tuna theater tour. Relix Records was Hot Tuna's record company until 2000, and also released Classic Hot Tuna Acoustic, Classic Hot Tuna Electric, Live at Sweetwater, and Live at Sweetwater 2.\n\nTwo notable outside projects Kaukonen played on were the David Crosby album \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\" (1971) and Warren Zevon's \"Transverse City\" (1989). In 1993, he collaborated with ex-Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten in recording numerous arrangements of \"Embryonic Journey\". The resulting tracks were released as an album 1994 on the Relix label. In 1999, he played several gigs with Phil Lesh and Friends. In 2000, he appeared with jam band Widespread Panic during their summer tour.\n\nWith his wife Vanessa, Kaukonen currently owns and operates the Fur Peace Ranch, a 119 acre music and guitar camp in the hills of southeast Ohio, north of Pomeroy; complete with a 32 track studio. He is currently under contract as a solo artist to Red House Records and still records and tours with Jack Casady and other friends such as Barry Mitterhof as Hot Tuna. His 2002 album Blue Country Heart was widely acclaimed by critics as one of the definitive examples of American \"Depression Era \" music and features Kaukonen backed by an all-star Nashville bluegrass band. The album was nominated for a Grammy. His latest album, Stars In My Crown, was released in March 2007.", "otherInfo": "New York Guitar Festival Livestream: http://www.newyorkguitarfestival.org"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Layla Frankel ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10250915.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Rock, Blues, Rythm & Blues, Folk, Soul", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll make a decision and I won\u2019t know why at the time, but then a song comes out of it.

From the age of three, she was performing on stage and recording with her father, Chicago- based children\u2019s music entertainer, Joel Frankel. As a pre-teen, Layla joined the renowned Chicago Children\u2019s Choir where she gained a strong musical foundation. She later moved on to front big bands and jazz combos singing from the Great American Songbook, while getting formal training at the University Of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana. \u201cWhile I adored, and adore, the classic singers such as Carmen MacRae, Nancy Wilson, and Ella FitzGerald, I needed to write my own songs for my own instrument, my voice. What felt most comfortable was in the Americana, Blues, and Soul genres. While I sing the standards professionally and love when I can get in a gospel vein, I get the most satisfaction from having a song come to me and shaping and nurturing it until it feels just right.\u201d\n\nEach song comes not only from craft but life. In the fall of 2015, Layla took a backpack and her Little Martin guitar and went sightseeing/volunteering in Europe for four months with the goal of meeting interesting people, experiencing other cultures and landscapes, and taking a hiatus from musical pursuits. \u201cI grew up in Chicago and love it but sometimes I just have to get away. To do something different, feel something different. I needed to gain some distance from music to see if my heart was really in it.\u201d Of course she didn\u2019t stay away long; in the Spring of 2016, a two-month-long hike along the Israel National Trail became the catalyst for finally assembling a handful of her best songs into the compact disc collection, Tame The Fox, a title inspired by the book The Little Prince, which she carried with her on the trail.\n\nSound engineer Josh Richter recorded Tame the Fox at Victorian Recording in Barrington, IL and Frankel produced and arranged all of the tracks. The EP features multi-instrumentalist Dave Hiltebrand on almost all of the guitar tracks as well as bass guitar on the whole record. Robert Rashid handled drums, while Eddie Ganet played keys.\n\nLayla played rhythm guitar on the tracks \u201cTenderly\u201d and \u201cIf I Had the Words\u201d and performed all of the vocals, including overdubs and harmonies.\n\nLayla Frankel currently lives in Nashville, TN and performs both locally and nationally.

But before moving to the DC area, Jorma and family lived in the Philippines and other locales as he followed his father's career from assignment to assignment before returning to the place of his birth. As a teenager in Washington he and future Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady (who at the time played six-string guitar) formed a band named The Triumphs. Kaukonen departed Washington for studies at Antioch College where friend Ian Buchanan taught him fingerstyle guitar playing. Buchanan also introduced Kaukonen to the music of Reverend Gary Davis, whose songs have remained important parts of Kaukonen's repertoire throughout his career.\n\nIn 1962 Kaukonen moved to the San Francisco bay area and enrolled in Santa Clara University. During this time he taught guitar lessons in a small music store in San Jose. As a self-described blues purist, Kaukonen never had any ambition to play in a rock band. He played as a solo act in coffee houses and can be heard accompanying a young Janis Joplin on acoustic guitar on an historic 1964 recording (known as \"The Typewriter Tapes\" because of the obtrusive sound of Kaukonen's first wife Margareta typing in the background). Invited to attend a Jefferson Airplane rehearsal by founding member Paul Kantner, Kaukonen found his imagination excited by the arsenal of effects available to electric guitar and later said, \"I was sucked in by technology.\"\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nKaukonen's electric guitar work was distinctive and widely emulated by other Bay Area guitarists. Notable work with Jefferson Airplane includes \"Greasy Heart\", \"If You Feel\", \"Hey Frederick\" (which culminates in an extended lead guitar duet with himself), \"Wooden Ships\" and his original composition, \"Feel So Good\". Rolling Stone named Kaukonen the 54th greatest rock guitarist of all time and 16th greatest acoustic guitarist.\n\nThough never a prolific singer and songwriter during his Airplane tenure, Kaukonen contributed some distinctive material. \"Embryonic Journey\" showcased his fingerstyle acoustic guitar virtuosity. On the next Jefferson Airplane album, After Bathing at Baxter's, his playing developed a harder-edged sound inspired by Mike Bloomfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Cream and other groups that visited San Francisco. These stylistic changes are prominent in the acid rocker \"The Last Wall of the Castle\", as well as the instrumental \"Spare Chaynge\", co-written with bassist Jack Casady and drummer Spencer Dryden. Clocking in at 9:12 minutes, this improvisational style was further explored on the free-form extended jams \"Thing\" and \"Bear Melt\", both live instrumentals recorded in 1968. Kaukonen insists, however, on the liner notes of the Live at the Fillmore East album that these jams were not chaotic \"free for alls\" but in fact \"complex rehearsed arrangements.\" Two notable songs that were later to become Hot Tuna signature tunes were also recorded during the 1968-1969 period. These were the traditionals \"Rock Me Baby \" and the gospel ballad \"Good Shepherd.\" Other original compositions with the Airplane appeared on the 1971 album \"Bark\", the instrumental \"Wild Turkey\" and \"Feel So good\", as well as the acoustic autobiographical \"Third Week in the Chelsea\" detailing his feelings about the disintegration of the band.\n\nHot Tuna and solo career\n\nIn 1969-70, Kaukonen and Jack Casady formed Hot Tuna, a spin-off group that allowed them to play as long as they liked. An early incarnation of Hot Tuna included Airplane vocalist Marty Balin and featured Joey Covington on drums and vocals. This grouping came to an end after an unsuccessful recording jaunt to Jamaica, the sessions of which have never been released. Pared down to Kaukonen and Casady, Hot Tuna lived on as a vehicle for Kaukonen to show off his Piedmont style acoustic blues fingerpicking skills. The self-titled first album was all acoustic and recorded live. With the dissolution of Jefferson Airplane in 1972, Hot Tuna went electric, with Airplane fiddler Papa John Creach joining for the next two albums. Hot Tuna scored an FM hit with \"Ja Da (Keep On Truckin')\" from their third (and first studio) album, Burgers. At this time, Kaukonen's song-writing began to dominate, as further evidenced by the next album, The Phosphorescent Rat, which only featured one cover song. Beginning with their fifth album, America's Choice (1974), the addition of drummer Bob Steeler encouraged a rise in volume and a change of band personality -- a rampaging, Cream-like rock with often quasi-mystical lyrics courtesy of Kaukonen. During this period, the power trio was known for its very long live sets and instrumental jamming.\n\nIn 1974, Kaukonen recorded the first and most successful of several solo albums, Quah, together with Tom Hobson. Produced by Jack Casady, and featuring (somewhat surprisingly) string overdubs on some tracks, this album contained some of Kaukonen's most deft fingerpicking work, especially on \"Hamar Promenade\", \"Blue Prelude\", \"Genesis\" and \" Flying Clouds\". The curious picture that adorns Quah's cover is today on display at Donkey Coffe and Espresso, a coffee shop in Athens, Ohio.\n\nKaukonen toured vigorously throughout the 1970s in both the United States and Europe, but with Hot Tuna's break up in 1978, the first phase of the band's career ended. Casady left to form the new wave band \"SVT\", while Kaukonen released his second solo album, Jorma, a mix of electric guitar and acoustic fingerstyle in 1979. Meanwhile, he had formed the band \"Vital Parts\".\n\nVital Parts featured bassist Denny DeGorio, who had played in a San Francisco band called the \"Offs\" with ex-Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler. Kaukonen, experimenting with a new image, not only cut his hair but dyed it purple then bright orange, and had extensive tattoos adorn his body, back and arms. The album Barbeque King was released in 1980. Kaukonen's traditional fan base did not warm to this new, perceived to be \"punk\" image, and sales of the album were so disappointing that Jorma was soon dropped from RCA records.\n\nHe continued playing as a solo artist throughout the 1980s at such venues as The Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia, The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey and in Port Chester, New York. As in his Hot Tuna days, he played very long sets, usually beginning with an hour-long acoustic set followed by a long intermission and then a two hour electric set, sometimes accompanied by bass and drums. Hot Tuna themselves reformed in the late 1980s. At a 1987 Hot Tuna performance, Kaukonen surprised fellow Airplane alumnus Paul Kantner, who was sitting in, with a surprise appearance by his estranged lover Grace Slick; the success of this performance helped to pave the way for a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and record in 1989.\n\nIn 1980, Kaukonen appeared on Robert Hunter's Amagamalin Street. This was the third album released by Relix Records, a label, founded by Les Kippel, that specialized in bands from the San Francisco Bay Area. Relix also released Splashdown, featuring a rare performance by Hot Tuna on WQIV, a defunct radio station in New York. Kippel was instrumental in reuniting Kaukonen and Casady in 1985 for a Hot Tuna theater tour. Relix Records was Hot Tuna's record company until 2000, and also released Classic Hot Tuna Acoustic, Classic Hot Tuna Electric, Live at Sweetwater, and Live at Sweetwater 2.\n\nTwo notable outside projects Kaukonen played on were the David Crosby album \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\" (1971) and Warren Zevon's \"Transverse City\" (1989). In 1993, he collaborated with ex-Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten in recording numerous arrangements of \"Embryonic Journey\". The resulting tracks were released as an album 1994 on the Relix label. In 1999, he played several gigs with Phil Lesh and Friends. In 2000, he appeared with jam band Widespread Panic during their summer tour.\n\nWith his wife Vanessa, Kaukonen currently owns and operates the Fur Peace Ranch, a 119 acre music and guitar camp in the hills of southeast Ohio, north of Pomeroy; complete with a 32 track studio. He is currently under contract as a solo artist to Red House Records and still records and tours with Jack Casady and other friends such as Barry Mitterhof as Hot Tuna. His 2002 album Blue Country Heart was widely acclaimed by critics as one of the definitive examples of American \"Depression Era \" music and features Kaukonen backed by an all-star Nashville bluegrass band. The album was nominated for a Grammy. His latest album, Stars In My Crown, was released in March 2007.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.youtube.com/user/guitarfestival"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sounds Like Jesse Lopez ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10241868.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Country, Rock, Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A MATADOR AT HEART WITH THE SOUL OF A ROMANTIC, JESSE LOPEZ'S SONGWRITING IS SEEPED IN HIS MEXICAN-ITALIAN CHARM.

Pr\u00f3xima Parada is releasing new music and will embark on their first U.S. tour this year.\n\nTheir last single, Time In A Circle, currently has over 1,500,000 plays on Spotify alone.\n\nStarting in 2012 as a group of college friends wanting to extend their dynamic to their community in San Luis Obispo, CA, they never dreamed that their passion would reach a global audience, that they'd perform at beautiful historic venues and music festivals, that their songs would earn awards, that their music would soothe and uplift people around the world.\n\n\nThe starting lineup for Pr\u00f3xima Parada:\nNick Larson (vocals, keys, guitar), Kevin Middlekauff (bass), Josh Collins (guitar), and Aaron Kroeger (drums).\n\nA BETTER BIO:\n\nThe following recount of the epic of Pr\u00f3xima Parada was translated from ancient Greek dactylic hexameter and is traditionally attributed to Sophocles (although recent investigations by way of modern advancements hypothesize the text as a discarded fragment of Homer's Iliad):\n\nIt all emerged from the discovery of freedom way back when. Pr\u00f3xima Parada, protector of goslings, formed as a result of a murmur, a moo moo, the recitation of a Nordic dirge, and a desperate whimper; sounds heard all the way down to the Mississippi Delta, which had long been shining like a National guitar. Though the individuals of Pr\u00f3xima Parada were all ephemeral in flesh, their collective offering of goodwill in the aural realm became immortal by wish of the gods.\n\nOn Olympus resounded a long, deep breath of agreeable relief, as the gods delivered their most interesting gift for Earth, Kevin Middlekauff, enchanter of the four stringed bass lyre, son of Leto of the Lovely Locks, to whom they gave the patience of the Bald Eagle along with his fierce talons, which made plucking strings a markedly difficult task. With him came a fleet of Achaean spearwomen. Enrapt in observing a quarrel between armies of men, the gods let fall a quiver of divine arrows, and the jumble that fused upon an unforgiving collision of earth and oxen created many a Nicholas Larson, bleak souls with shrill voices. One Nicholas was given the great fortune of finding Kevin, who guided him through wind and sea away from a shameful life as a lotus eater and taught him the Seikilos epitaph (\"While you live, shine / have no grief at all / life exists only for a short while / and time demands an end\").\n\nJoshua Collins\u2019 lineage cannot be enumerated with exactitude, although Agamemnon, supreme commander of the Achaean armies, was informed by an oracle that Joshua was the end result of an abandoned beard. How he and his young fur joined Pr\u00f3xima Parada is even less understood.\n\nFollowing a fortnight of arrows raining from both armies, Apollo ceased his observations of Troy to ponder a creation forming in the northern reaches from the percussion of glaciers striking Galdh\u00f8piggen, Scandinavia\u2019s boldest mountain. Savage ice and rock had been warring for ages. Apollo, to establish consonance in that great region, sent Aaron Kr\u00f6ger, king of Mycenae in the Peloponnese, hiker of short pants. Aaron percussed the earth with his dual gold-bestudded sceptres to instruct the sun of the tempo of the day and the moon of the night\u2019s gloom. Satisfied in frigid Norden, he prepared himself to settle in asceticism for the rest of his days.\n\nNot before long, under the tutelage of Olympus, the three boys became something akin to men and the silence turned to harmony, harmony that spread through the yellow hair of Aaron Kr\u00f6ger, into his ears, and reverberated in his heart. Having never been moved so by man, he vowed to percuss alongside the sounds of the three. Pr\u00f3xima Parada, the amalgamation of the four regions of Nether, was erected in January of 2012 of the Gregorian Calendar, although The China National Petroleum Corporation would soon change their fiscal calendar to mark Pr\u00f3xima\u2019s birth as year 0.", "otherInfo": "We'll be doing a Mother's Day Virtual concert 5/10 at 1pm PST.\n\nTune in on Facebook or YouTube!

He played as a solo act in coffee houses and can be heard accompanying a young Janis Joplin on acoustic guitar on an historic 1964 recording (known as \"The Typewriter Tapes\" because of the obtrusive sound of Kaukonen's first wife Margareta typing in the background). Invited to attend a Jefferson Airplane rehearsal by founding member Paul Kantner, Kaukonen found his imagination excited by the arsenal of effects available to electric guitar and later said, \"I was sucked in by technology.\"\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nKaukonen's electric guitar work was distinctive and widely emulated by other Bay Area guitarists. Notable work with Jefferson Airplane includes \"Greasy Heart\", \"If You Feel\", \"Hey Frederick\" (which culminates in an extended lead guitar duet with himself), \"Wooden Ships\" and his original composition, \"Feel So Good\". Rolling Stone named Kaukonen the 54th greatest rock guitarist of all time and 16th greatest acoustic guitarist.\n\nThough never a prolific singer and songwriter during his Airplane tenure, Kaukonen contributed some distinctive material. \"Embryonic Journey\" showcased his fingerstyle acoustic guitar virtuosity. On the next Jefferson Airplane album, After Bathing at Baxter's, his playing developed a harder-edged sound inspired by Mike Bloomfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Cream and other groups that visited San Francisco. These stylistic changes are prominent in the acid rocker \"The Last Wall of the Castle\", as well as the instrumental \"Spare Chaynge\", co-written with bassist Jack Casady and drummer Spencer Dryden. Clocking in at 9:12 minutes, this improvisational style was further explored on the free-form extended jams \"Thing\" and \"Bear Melt\", both live instrumentals recorded in 1968. Kaukonen insists, however, on the liner notes of the Live at the Fillmore East album that these jams were not chaotic \"free for alls\" but in fact \"complex rehearsed arrangements.\" Two notable songs that were later to become Hot Tuna signature tunes were also recorded during the 1968-1969 period. These were the traditionals \"Rock Me Baby \" and the gospel ballad \"Good Shepherd.\" Other original compositions with the Airplane appeared on the 1971 album \"Bark\", the instrumental \"Wild Turkey\" and \"Feel So good\", as well as the acoustic autobiographical \"Third Week in the Chelsea\" detailing his feelings about the disintegration of the band.\n\nHot Tuna and solo career\n\nIn 1969-70, Kaukonen and Jack Casady formed Hot Tuna, a spin-off group that allowed them to play as long as they liked. An early incarnation of Hot Tuna included Airplane vocalist Marty Balin and featured Joey Covington on drums and vocals. This grouping came to an end after an unsuccessful recording jaunt to Jamaica, the sessions of which have never been released. Pared down to Kaukonen and Casady, Hot Tuna lived on as a vehicle for Kaukonen to show off his Piedmont style acoustic blues fingerpicking skills. The self-titled first album was all acoustic and recorded live. With the dissolution of Jefferson Airplane in 1972, Hot Tuna went electric, with Airplane fiddler Papa John Creach joining for the next two albums. Hot Tuna scored an FM hit with \"Ja Da (Keep On Truckin')\" from their third (and first studio) album, Burgers. At this time, Kaukonen's song-writing began to dominate, as further evidenced by the next album, The Phosphorescent Rat, which only featured one cover song. Beginning with their fifth album, America's Choice (1974), the addition of drummer Bob Steeler encouraged a rise in volume and a change of band personality -- a rampaging, Cream-like rock with often quasi-mystical lyrics courtesy of Kaukonen. During this period, the power trio was known for its very long live sets and instrumental jamming.\n\nIn 1974, Kaukonen recorded the first and most successful of several solo albums, Quah, together with Tom Hobson. Produced by Jack Casady, and featuring (somewhat surprisingly) string overdubs on some tracks, this album contained some of Kaukonen's most deft fingerpicking work, especially on \"Hamar Promenade\", \"Blue Prelude\", \"Genesis\" and \" Flying Clouds\". The curious picture that adorns Quah's cover is today on display at Donkey Coffe and Espresso, a coffee shop in Athens, Ohio.\n\nKaukonen toured vigorously throughout the 1970s in both the United States and Europe, but with Hot Tuna's break up in 1978, the first phase of the band's career ended. Casady left to form the new wave band \"SVT\", while Kaukonen released his second solo album, Jorma, a mix of electric guitar and acoustic fingerstyle in 1979. Meanwhile, he had formed the band \"Vital Parts\".\n\nVital Parts featured bassist Denny DeGorio, who had played in a San Francisco band called the \"Offs\" with ex-Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler. Kaukonen, experimenting with a new image, not only cut his hair but dyed it purple then bright orange, and had extensive tattoos adorn his body, back and arms. The album Barbeque King was released in 1980. Kaukonen's traditional fan base did not warm to this new, perceived to be \"punk\" image, and sales of the album were so disappointing that Jorma was soon dropped from RCA records.\n\nHe continued playing as a solo artist throughout the 1980s at such venues as The Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia, The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey and in Port Chester, New York. As in his Hot Tuna days, he played very long sets, usually beginning with an hour-long acoustic set followed by a long intermission and then a two hour electric set, sometimes accompanied by bass and drums. Hot Tuna themselves reformed in the late 1980s. At a 1987 Hot Tuna performance, Kaukonen surprised fellow Airplane alumnus Paul Kantner, who was sitting in, with a surprise appearance by his estranged lover Grace Slick; the success of this performance helped to pave the way for a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and record in 1989.\n\nIn 1980, Kaukonen appeared on Robert Hunter's Amagamalin Street. This was the third album released by Relix Records, a label, founded by Les Kippel, that specialized in bands from the San Francisco Bay Area. Relix also released Splashdown, featuring a rare performance by Hot Tuna on WQIV, a defunct radio station in New York. Kippel was instrumental in reuniting Kaukonen and Casady in 1985 for a Hot Tuna theater tour. Relix Records was Hot Tuna's record company until 2000, and also released Classic Hot Tuna Acoustic, Classic Hot Tuna Electric, Live at Sweetwater, and Live at Sweetwater 2.\n\nTwo notable outside projects Kaukonen played on were the David Crosby album \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\" (1971) and Warren Zevon's \"Transverse City\" (1989). In 1993, he collaborated with ex-Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten in recording numerous arrangements of \"Embryonic Journey\". The resulting tracks were released as an album 1994 on the Relix label. In 1999, he played several gigs with Phil Lesh and Friends. In 2000, he appeared with jam band Widespread Panic during their summer tour.\n\nWith his wife Vanessa, Kaukonen currently owns and operates the Fur Peace Ranch, a 119 acre music and guitar camp in the hills of southeast Ohio, north of Pomeroy; complete with a 32 track studio. He is currently under contract as a solo artist to Red House Records and still records and tours with Jack Casady and other friends such as Barry Mitterhof as Hot Tuna. His 2002 album Blue Country Heart was widely acclaimed by critics as one of the definitive examples of American \"Depression Era \" music and features Kaukonen backed by an all-star Nashville bluegrass band. The album was nominated for a Grammy. His latest album, Stars In My Crown, was released in March 2007.", "otherInfo": "New York Guitar Festival Livestream: http://www.newyorkguitarfestival.org"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "EMIKA ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8737932.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Classical, Electronic", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Emika has her own sound and is following her own path.

One is a acoustic/electronic act from the United Kingdom (often written Fink (UK)), signed to Ninja Tune, and one is an alternative country act from Germany.\n\nBiographies:\n\na) Fink, AKA Fin Greenall, is a singer-songwriter, producer and DJ from Brighton, England. It is also the name given to the touring trio fronted by Greenall himself, completed by Guy Whittaker (bass) and Tim Thornton (drums). This is his official website\n\nFink's recording career began with Ninja Tune's release of his debut album Fresh Produce in 2001, a well received chill-out set that fitted neatly with the output of the label. However, it was his second release, 2006's Biscuits For Breakfast, that defined his style and began to bring his name to a wider audience.\n\nBuilt around his bluesy voice, finger-picking acoustic guitar and the stripped-back live rhythm section, Biscuits boasted a fledgling pop sensibility while retaining the signature Ninja Tune vibe - a fact not lost on a swelling crowd of industry luminaries, notably Zero 7, who promptly invited Fink to support them on their UK tour, and Nitin Sawhney, with whom Fink guested at the 2006 Electric Proms.A follow-up is currently being recorded for early 2007 release.\n\nDiscography (electronic/acoustic)\n\nDistance and Time - Released: 01/10/07\nBiscuits For Breakfast - Released: 24/04/06\nSo Long - Released: 03/04/06\nPretty Little Thing - Released: 06/02/06\nFresh Produce - Released: 01/06/00\nEver Since I Was A Kid - Released: 01/04/00\nFront Side EP - Released: 01/03/99\nFink Funk EP - Released: 01/07/97\n\nWebsite: Fink World\n\n----------\n\nb) Fink were a German indie-country band from hamburg, led by Nils Koppruch and Andreas Voss (also in band Halma).

It\u2019s a well-rounded one, one marked by streaks of Americana, country, blues, and gospel, and the kinds of four-part harmonies that can burst open a melody and close the loop of an octave. And sentimentally, it\u2019s a sound that represents the feeling of community.\n\n'This Too Shall Light', due September 21st on Yep Roc Records, comprises 10 songs produced by Grammy-winning producer and songwriter Joe Henry. Helm left her home and comfort zone of Woodstock, NY, choosing to record in Los Angeles within the confines of just a four-day window. The musicians were directed not to overthink the songs, and Helm herself barely performed any of the selections while leading up to the recording. As a result, the sessions forced fast musical trust among the collaborators and yielded the vibrant instrumental improvisations heard throughout 'This Too Shall Light'.\n\nAlthough a profound songwriter herself, Helm and Henry jointly arranged a diverse collection of songs for the record, which range from Rod Stewart\u2019s \u201cMandolin Wind\u201d to Allen Toussaint\u2019s \u201cFreedom for the Stallion\u201d and even the Milk Carton Kids\u2019 \u201cMichigan.\u201d The title track in particular, written by Hiss Golden Messenger\u2019s MC Taylor and Josh Kaufman (Josh Ritter, Bob Weir, Craig Finn), is a brilliant summation of the record\u2019s sound and spirit. Seemingly a play on the old adage that \u201cThis too shall pass,\u201d Helm\u2019s voice veers from commanding to supplicating within a single soulful verse, as she manipulates that message so that light leads throughout even the darkest of times.\n\nA lifelong musician and music-lover, Helm\u2019s parents \u2014The Band\u2019s legendary drummer and singer Levon Helm and singer/songwriter Libby Titus \u2014 guided her training and influences. She later became a founding member of the alt-country collective Ollabelle and served as a backing musician in her father's Midnight Ramble Band. And on 'This Too Shall Light', Helm says that two songs in particular pay homage to Levon \u2014 \u201cThe Stones I Throw,\u201d a song he released in 1965 with Levon and the Hawks, and the closing traditional number, an a cappella version of the hymnal \u201cGloryland,\u201d which was passed from father to daughter.\n\nWhile 'This Too Shall Light' is only Helm\u2019s second album under her own name, it serves as a comprehensive portrait covering her life's journeys and recoveries; They\u2019re the stories that, no matter where they take her, seem to end and begin in the same place like a circle.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://citywinery.com/newyork/can-t-be-there-today-billy-bragg-and-the-city-winery-all-stars-presents-a-mother-s-day-special.html"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Joan Osborne ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9031241.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Rock, Soul, Blues, Pop", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Official page of Joan Osborne.

Whether performing with his own quartet or supporting Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett on tour, Newman\u2019s expert trumpeteering and effervescent stage presence reignited a big band scene in New York City, and has since enticed a new generation of jazz fans across the globe. The Verve Recording artist continues to reign at his weekly residency in New York, as well as appear on television programs and in special performances across the United States and Europe.\nNewman is known for his impeccable horn playing and rendition of romantic favorites. But what sets him apart is his ability to command a room not only with his musical talent, but as a bandleader who makes each person in the audience feel as if they are a part of his performance. His fusion of music playing and easy going banter captures the vivacity of great bandleaders of the past. This exuberance is evident on Newman\u2019s 2016 debut album, Eyes on the City, which pays tribute to his musical journey in New York.\nAlong with his Quartet, fellow musicians from Cincinnati\u2019s College-Conservatory of Music, Newman has allured audiences during his residencies at some of New York\u2019s most iconic venues. His first foray into creating an old school big band night was at the elegant Duane Park for \u201cAfter Dark,\u201d a jazz and burlesque revue on the downtown scene in Tribeca. \u201cAfter Dark\u201d lead to a weekly residency at the legendary Oak Room at The Plaza Hotel, a venue steeped in history which was frequented by the likes of Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli and countless others over its one hundred year history. Newman and his Quartet played each Wednesday to a mixed crowd seeking a slice of history, welcoming Lady Gaga as a surprise guest, until the venue closed in 2011. Currently, Newman performs every Tuesday and Thursday, as bandleader in a residency at Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel, and select Friday nights at NYC\u2019s legendary Rainbow Room with his orchestra.

The Jack Daniel\u2019s partnership in 2012, which launched the brand\u2019s Sinatra Select premium Tennessee Whiskey, brought Newman alongside Frank Sinatra Jr. himself, in a performance in Cannes, France.\nBrian married burlesque star, Angie Pontani of the World Famous Pontani Sisters in February 2013, with whom he most notably performs in connection with Pontani\u2019s New York Burlesque Festival and Burlesque-a-Pades shows.

He has been seen outside venues at 3am in Germany playing an acoustic guitar and singing to people that didn\u2019t want the show to end. He has written poems to fans from behind bars whilst locked up on bogus marijuana charges. He has suffered a spiral fracture of the humerus while arm wrestling a marine in Hawaii. He has recorded with and toured alongside some of independent rap music\u2019s most influential figures, including Sage Francis, Busdriver and Astronautalis. He has been in bands described as hardcore, crunk rap, lo-fi synth pop, Latin progressive and psych-jazz-rap. He has crafted abstracted and personal narratives mining the depths of depression and heights of hope. He has slept on countless floors when hotels weren\u2019t in the touring budget and lost girlfriends and jobs all for the love of creating and performing.\n\nCeschi was born with four fingers on his right hand, which served as partial inspiration for the name of his DIY record label, Fake Four, Inc. Those who have worked with him describe Ceschi as one of the most artist-friendly labelheads out there, a rare breed who values art over profit almost to a fault. Since 2008, he has curated a roster of wildly original and critically praised talent and put out albums from the likes of Open Mike Eagle, Buck 65, Sister Crayon and Dark Time Sunshine in addition to his solo records The One Man Band Broke Up and Broken Bone Ballads.\n\nAn engaging, theatrical live performer, Ceschi Ramos has treated entire venues like a stage, viewing the middle of the audience or an empty barstool as good a place as any to perform a soul-baring folk song or tongue-twisting rap track. Ceschi once described himself in song as \u201ca martyr at most\u2026 a failure at least\u201d and said that, \u201cIn the eyes of history I\u2019ll be no more than a leaf on a tree.\u201d He knows what it is to suffer for his art and is aware that music exploring the ugliness and sorrow of the human condition will always exist on the fringes of a game dominated by disposable escapism and expensive publicists.

The standout on this set is the rumbling, roaring \u201cBaby Bird,\u201d where de Lise reflects on mortality and grief \u2013 and who the act of grieving honestly benefits.

It\u2019s a musical relationship that has endured for over two decades, with band members playing in numerous projects together and apart. Following the 2012 release of their freewheeling Sounds Like This, the band took time off to work on various side projects. Zach Gill (keys/vocals) toured the world with the band\u2019s college pal Jack Johnson; Dan \u201cLebo\u201d Lebowitz (guitar/vocals) played shows with the Grateful Dead\u2019s Phil Lesh; Steve Adams (bass/vocals) toured and recorded with Nicki Bluhm & the Gramblers; Dave Brogan (drums/vocals) joined up with Utah band, Mokie. These and other endeavors have influenced the band\u2019s new album Tangle Of Time.\n\nMore than previous releases, Tangle Of Time really taps into what makes ALO unique. It\u2019s that special blend of classic songwriting and the ability to stretch out jams and distill dance floor grooves. It's heartfelt lyrics that make you smile, reflect and just want to sing along either way. It's four great musicians who all write and sing. And four friends who've been through a lot together and still support, challenge and inspire one another.\n\nEntering Allegiant Records in San Anselmo, California this past January with co-producer Dave Simon-Baker, the four members decided they\u2019d take a different recording approach. Instead of spending pre-production days jamming and co-writing, each member brought in their own demos, roughly three dozen in total, for the group to listen to, pick apart and eventually whittle down to the 11 songs that make up Tangle Of Time. Once they narrowed their focus, they turned their attention to arrangements and production techniques. Songs were tightened up, layers made more experimental and the end results validated their new approach.\n\nLebo described the shared respect and admiration the band felt during the recording process this way: \"There are four strong opinions in the room, but playing together for so long we've all become pretty good at the empathy thing at this point; we can be very Zen about it. We truly value being together at this point in our careers, and whatever we get from our solo and side gigs, no matter how much fun we have, it's not this.\"\n\nThat sort of maturity, the ability to take stock of your friends, loved ones, and collaborators, and truly appreciate them is certainly one of the cornerstones of Tangle Of Time. Lebo, Adams and Gill first started playing music together in middle school, and then with Brogan right after college. Somehow, these relationships have lasted, evolved and been made stronger every year. One can almost hear the group releasing a satisfied existential sigh throughout the album, finding acceptance, love and contentment with the world they've built.\n\n\"I really appreciate the guys right now, more so than ever,\" Gill shared, excitedly adding, \"Years ago the feeling was, 'I wanna get to my songs and see how they sound while we're all here', whereas now I'm rooting for everyone else's songs. It's great.\"\n\nThat approach of supporting each other\u2019s songs worked like a charm, capturing each member\u2019s distinct songwriting voice, while simultaneously expanding the notion of what an ALO song or album can be. Take for instance the one-two-punch of the synth-filled, spacey jam vehicle \"The Ticket\" and the pedal steel-driven easy-going happiness of \"Simple Times\". Although two ends of the sonic spectrum, both are classic Gill songs at their core but stretched wide and far by the band\u2019s collective effort.\n\nNot to be outdone, Lebo's guitar epic \"Undertow\" is a song that practically begs to be stretched out live, with its swirling double guitar outro intoxicating the listener to such a degree that you might find yourself on the band's website, dreamily purchasing tickets for an entire run of shows just to see where the song ventures live. Lebo pairs this with \"Push\", a jaunty yet thoughtful number with a playful guitar riff that's basically the musical equivalent of joy.\n\n\"Not Old Yet\" and \"Keep On\", Adams\u2019 contributions to the album, are also touchstones to the spirit of Tangle Of Time. The first is a light-hearted romp about keeping a positive perspective on life\u2019s long road of hurdles and surprises, while the second is an upbeat, forward-thinking sing-along with lines that could be the album's mantra: \"Wherever this takes us, I know/That we've got each other, we've still got a long way to go.\"\n\nBrogan's \"Coast To Coast\" is among the most intriguing songs on the record. He, along with co-writer buddy Ben Malan, came up with a layer-upon-layer soundscape consisting of beautifully esoteric textures. The funky but ominous track tells the surreal tale of a band on the run, with more ideas and energy than know-how. Brogan shared that the theme of \u201ctangled time\u201d materialized unexpectedly over the course of the sessions, elaborating: \"There's a point where there is more behind you than ahead of you, and you realize that time becomes a limiting factor.\"\n\nPut the record on your turntable, and you can clearly hear the band\u2019s excitement to get back on the road and explore these songs with their audience. Improvisation is a staple of what the band does, and as Adams stated: \"Being in that unknown is such a great life lesson beyond just the music. For all the careful planning and preparing we do, being in the moment is really when it all matters.\"\n\nThe band is also planning new ways to expand the theatrical shenanigans that have become a fantastic complement to the live show. From confetti canons to 12-foot beach balls, pre-show skits to elaborate theme nights, bubble suits to a laser-shooting ukulele (yes, really)... ALO is always on the hunt for new and exciting ways to interact with fans to make their shows truly special. Gill, the band's head prankster, put it this way: \"I want people to come to a show expecting to be engaged in a fun and creative way. When I see someone dancing or singing along or reaching out to hit a giant beach ball, I start playing to the dancer and at that point, it's really a circle of energy traveling back and forth from the stage. The larger theatrical concepts are ways of interacting with the audience on another level.\"\n\nOn Tangle Of Time the band has reached that other level, and are ready to bring everyone along.", "otherInfo": "RESCHEDULED from May 3 to May 10, 3pm PDT.\n\nFacebook LIVE streaming the ALO Sawtooth Valley Gathering set from July 2019.

King and John Mayer through Guitar Center and Guitar World magazine. Matt beat out over 4,000 competitors to win the grand prize which consisted of multiple guitars, an endorsement from Gibson, a shopping spree at Guitar Center and a new car from Scion. This major accomplishment was the spark that jumpstarted his career and gave his band momentum for their future success.\n\nGrowing up on influencers ranging from Jimi Hendrix, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Rory Gallagher, ZZ Top, Robin Trower, Joe Walsh, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, the Matt O'Ree Band has taken all these diverse elements and forged a new iron.\n\nMatt's writing is inspired by many life experiences and years of study from the ones that have written the book on how to play real guitar rock music. Not as a photocopy, but in a new light that hasn't been seen in quite some time. Now is the time for real music and real musicianship to make a resurrection.\n\nRecently, the band has been promoting two new singles \"Without You\" and \"Through Time With You\" co-written and produced by John Ginty, B3 Organ player for the Allman Betts Band and the Dixie Chicks. The songs are an indication that the band is moving in a new direction forming a powerhouse team, blending Eryn's soulful vocals with Matt's gritty vocals and unparalleled guitar. Together these two front an incredible sound where the audience can feel the sparks between them. The chemistry on stage is unstoppable.\n\nEryn is an accomplished artist in her right. She won awards such as the BELK Southern Musician Showcase/Blues Artist as well as Asbury Park's Top Female Vocalist and Top Blues Band. She is also the youngest artist to be inducted into the NJ/NY Blues Hall of Fame and one of only three females who have been inducted.

She also recently sang backup vocals with the Smashing Pumpkins on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\nTogether, the band takes their fans on a ride that hasn't been heard or seen at this level since the '70s. Their live show is like revisiting a Zeppelin concert at the Garden, and with Lex Lehman's smooth soulful bass, John Hummel's Bonham-esque drums, and Eryn's angelic and gutsy lead and backing vocals, Matt and company have built a foundation that can hold up the biggest house on the block.", "otherInfo": "Matt O\u2019Ree Band Live from Sofa Stage!\n--------------------------------\n\nMOB family- it\u2019s spring cleaning time!\nJoin Matt & Eryn 7pm EST for an acoustic Qtine house party and live Q+A from the comfort of your sofa.\n\nStreaming available on Facebook, YouTube, Mixer, and Twitch.\n\nVIRTUAL TIP JARS\n-------------------\nVenmo: @matthew-oree\nPayPal / Zelle: mattoree@mattoree.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "May Erlewine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9334351.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Soul, Old-time Country, Bluegrass, Swing, Americana, Jazz, Traditional Folk, Roots", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "May Erlewine has split her heart wide open and hasn\u2019t hidden any of the contents from view.\n\nOne of the Midwest\u2019s most prolific and passionate songwriters, May\u2019s gift for writing empathetic and engaging songs that feel at once fresh and soulfully familiar has earned her a broad, devoted fan base well beyond her deep-set Michigan roots. May\u2019s songwriting reveals her innate ability to emotionally engage with her audience through her lyrics. She shows us her heartbreak, but she also shows us her empowered and emboldened spirit. In her quest to find her most authentic self, May gifts each listener with a powerful, emotional experience that immediately connects her to us.\n\nRaised in a home full of art and music, Erlewine began writing songs at a very young age. As a teenager she hitchhiked across the country, honing her skills as a performer and absorbing the kind of stories and landscapes that would inform her music. She came to know the land and the pulse of the people. Her songs show a very real connection and concern with everyday folk. In the following years, Erlewine would perform in every kind of venue imaginable, from street corners to festival stages to the live-FM airwaves of A Prairie Home Companion.\n\nErlewine draws from a wide variety of influences to create her sound. Lyrically, her songs are rooted in hard-wrought wisdom, joy and sorrow, simplicity, and stories from her own everyday experiences. Musically, these messages are wrapped up in traditional folk roots, Americana, old-time country, swing, soul, and even rock n\u2019 roll. As a live performer, she is just as magnetic when fronting a seven-piece dance-party funk band as she is playing solo acoustic songs in a living room house concert.\n\nWith a long list of full length albums, two EPs, and numerous collaborations, Erlewine\u2019s catalog is proof of her creative power. Her work has been spotlighted by Rolling Stone and NBC\u2019s The Voice. National acts who have covered her songs include Greensky Bluegrass, Railroad Earth, Sawyer Fredericks (Season 8 winner of The Voice), Joshua Davis (Season 8 finalist of The Voice), Lindsay Lou & The Flatbellys, and others.\n\nErlewine uses her music as a platform for positive change. She considers her job a service-oriented one and carries the torch of the folk singer activist. Her voice on stage encourages connectedness and stresses the importance of environmental advocacy, social justice, creative empowerment and community building as necessary work in our world. May's body of work has become an anthem and an example of why we need to listen to women, and why we need to hear their stories.\n\nMay\u2019s music has touched people all over the world. Her words have held solace for weary hearts, offered a light in the darkness, and held a lot of space for the pain and joy of being alive in these times.

Platt is as good a songwriter as anyone with an Americana label by their name and that includes Isbell and Lucinda to name just two of them\u2026 You will need to listen repeatedly as the album is lengthy and Platt\u2019s lyrics are so damn real and relatable on so many levels.\u201d --Elmore, Jim Hynes\n\n\u201cThey\u2026 deliver a feisty, witty, hard-knock life realism on their records and this eponymous release, their fifth, is like the continuation of a classic serial novel you just can\u2019t put down\u2026 My favorite track is \u2018Eden\u2019 and I must have listened to it at least five times because it\u2019s just bloody brilliant, cheeky and slightly heart-wrenching all at once: \u2018Don\u2019t keep a TV \u2019cause the news is always bad and it teaches us to want all the things we\u2019ll never have\u2019 and then the storyteller asks to be let \u2018back inside that garden, I won\u2019t eat anything that\u2019s fallen from that goddamn tree.\u2019 --That Mag, Jane Roser\n\n\u201cPlatt can find a tune and express it exquisitely with a distinctive voice and a sympathetic band\u2026 Her wonderful lyrics seem to be an assessment of the people and circumstances that surround her to find the good bits.\u201d --Americana Music Show, Tony Ives\n\n\u201cPlatt opens with the reflective \u2018Birthday Song\u2019, warmed in among other things, tasty piano the album is immediately up and running on greased wheels. Blending country with folk and country pop you have Americana music with a capital \u2018A\u2019 and it is good!\u201d --Flying Shoes Review (UK), Maurice Hope\n\n\u201cPlatt sings like she means it on this country-tinged folk album, and whether or not her nuanced lyrics are drawn directly from real life, they sure sound as if they are... Platt\u2019s vocals convey joy and tenderness and her band provide amiable backup. At its best, this music is on a par with Lucinda Williams\u2019s, which is saying a lot.\u201d --The Morton Report, Jeff Burger\n\n\u201cThere is, as with the two before, an easygoing warmth to the album, and a certain kind of knowing. The kind from that comes from being a keen and empathetic observer. From the upbeat \u2018Diamond in the Rough\u2019 to the poetic \u2018Eden\u2019 to the solemn \u2018Long Ride,\u2019 Platt and her band flesh out all that's real and been missing in country music for lo these many years.\u201d --No Depression, Amos Perrine\n\n\u201ca gem of an album\u2026 The collection combines sharp and emotive songwriting with crisp production values. A successful blend of country roots and honky-tonk, but with a defining Appalachian twist. Above it all hovers Platt\u2019s voice \u2013 laconic, sultry, pitch perfect and ultimately charming.\u201d --Listening Through The Lens, Rob Dickens\n\n\u201cAmanda Anne is one of the best songwriters I have ever heard \u2013 and I have been listening carefully to music for about 55 years. She writes with her heart and her brain and her observations on life, love and other matters of importance are sparkling ... Her songs get into your blood and become a part of you.\u201d --letter from David Whittaker who commissioned the song \u201cRare Thing\u201d for his wife Holly\n\n\"Amanda is so good it's ridiculous. I don't even know what words to use. Her singing, songwriting and presence is unmatched in Americana, Country, Pop\u2026 Simply breathtaking.\" --Saul Davis: producer (Percy Sledge), manager (Gene Clark, Carla Olson, Phil Seymour)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s soothing (even in the hurtin\u2019 songs) and sobering (except for the drinkin\u2019 songs) and nuanced in a way that I think tops even those rather famous ladies of the moment named Margo and Kacey\u2026 I\u2019d be hard pressed to find a finer string of recordings from any band working in the classic country/mountain tradition in these last five years.\u201d --Music City Roots, Craig Havighurst\n\n\n\u201cPut simply, the Honeycutters are one of the best alt-country bands in the region. If you like Kim Richey and Lucinda Williams, you\u2019ll love Honeycutters singer/songwriter Amanda Anne Platt, who mixes a lazily sensual voice with a storyteller\u2019s eye. If you like prime-period Steve Earl, you\u2019ll love the Honeycutters genre-bending rock & twang.\u201d --Greenville, Journal, Vincent Harris\n\n\u201cAsheville\u2019s Amanda Anne Platt is an amazing songwriter, penning heartbreaking country tunes better\nthan most coming out of Nashville. The band\u2019s take on Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah\u201d is at once\ncompletely original and familiar.\u201d --WDVX Music Director Nelson Gullet\n\n\u201cAmanda Anne Platt is another of those hugely multi-talented artists that don\u2019t get anything like the credit or rewards that they deserve. She is the lead singer and main songwriter for The Honeycutters, another band that have provided the musical background to my year.\u201d --Your Life in A Song (UK), Top 10 Country Albums Of 2016\n\n\n\u201cThe songwriting alone, all of it from the pen of Amanda Anne Platt, stretches the scope of this recording [On The Ropes] beyond a standard honky tonk format. She is completely unafraid to tackle difficult aspects in and around love found and love lost with her incredibly descriptive writing style that opens up the emotions to the listener as if their own. Listening to the lyrics you can't help but hope most of the stories are fictitious and hopefully not from her own life, such is the depth of some of the sadness.\u201d --Americana Roots (UK)\n\n\u201cLike all great songwriters, Platt's characters are alive, with enough nuance to convince the listener that they have entire lives outside the glimpse they get from the songs\u2026 there's a delicate balance of melancholy and hope that takes a deft hand to pull off without sounding cliched. Platt's hand is that deft.\u201d --Examiner, Chris Griffy\n\n\u201cTheir songwriting is first rate, their arrangements and instrumental ability in top form and with a front woman as assertive and impressive as singer Amanda Anne Platt\u2026 clearly, Platt and her colleagues\u2026 have every contingency covered.\u201d --No Depression, Lee Zimmerman\n\n\u201cThis album damn near beats anything coming out of Nashville\u2019s country mainstream these days. The real-life lyrics and the subtle playing of the Honeycutters will insinuate themselves into your psyche like the whispered reassurances of an old friend, touching your heart and opening your eyes to the bittersweet joys and sorrows of everyday life\u2026 Spit out that modern country-pop diet soda and pour yourself some of the real stuff. Bottoms up!\u201d --Alan Cackett (UK)\n\n\u201c12 original songs and probably the best version of \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 you\u2019ll ever hear \u2013 make this NC-based band a must-hear\u2026 From the first moments of the lead-off track On The Ropes you\u2019ll find yourself hooked \u2013 and the music won\u2019t let you go\u201d --Amazon, Steve Ramm, 5 Star Review\n\n\u201cAn album that shines like a good deed in a naughty world.\u201d --3rd Coast Music, Johnny Conquest\n\n\u201c\u2018Blue Besides\u2019 is a superb song. If it was recorded by Miranda Lambert, it would go to number one. It will remain an album track because that\u2019s the way of the world. They are dominant in their field. Underground Americana that seems to be gravitating towards Asheville in North Carolina which happens to be The Honeycutters\u2019 home town.\u201d --Your Life in A Song (UK), Top 10 Country Albums Of 2016\n\n\u201cPlatt\u2019s voice is fair magical. Clearly annunciated, every word is infused with poetic loveliness, made all the more appealing for the slight twang that causes syllables to rise and fall at the end of lines. Like Joy Lynn White once upon a time and Zoe Muth more recently, Platt can sing of desperation and despair while retaining pride of steel... throughout On the Ropes Platt delivers personal devastation that touches universally.\u201d --Lonesome Road Review, Donald Teplyske\n\n\u201cHer songs are poignant, funny in an everyday sort of way, heartfelt, and authentic. The Honeycutters\u2019 On The Ropes is a good friend when you need one the most.\u201d -- Americana Music Show\u2019s Calvin Powers Listed On The Ropes as the #1 in the Best of Albums in 2016\n\n\u201cWhile her country-flavored songs almost always tell a story, The Honeycutters\u2019 musical approach adds a dimension to the tunes that only widens their appeal.\u201d --Mountain Xpress, Bill Kopp\n\n\u201cPlatt is a gifted songwriter and vocalist. Here, as on the fine previous release, Me Oh My, she is clearly the leader. She has an authoritative, confident voice that can be sweet, aching, and joyous, sometimes even in the same song. Platt\u2019s voice and the interplay of the guitar and mandolin give this band their unique complex sound \u2013 a clear-sounding mash-up of Americana, bluegrass, folk, and honky-tonk.\u201d --Elmore Magazine, Jim Hynes\n\n\u201cForget Nashville, with their buzz-making brand of rock-roots-country, the Honeycutters are out to make Asheville, NC the brand new music city.\u201d --Elmore Magazine\n\n\u201cAll of those sad little pop singers need to get off country radio and let the Honeycutters take it from here.

Sounds pretty scary -- but for Chris Pinnella it's the stuff of natural habitat; an environment that the versatile vocalist has thrived in, whether performing with symphony orchestras around the country, leading his own combos of anywhere from 8 to 15 players, or (for several tours of North America and Europe) lending his finely honed skills to the prog-rock / crossover locomotive known as the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. That association with the late Paul O'Neil's spectacularly scaled project netted the New Jersey native a platinum record for his contributions to 'The Lost Christmas Eve' tour, and a chance to perform for an audience of over 1 million people, during a particularly raucous New Year's Eve in Berlin.\n\nIn the process the seasoned young performer - a singer whose influences run from the epic arias of Pavarotti, to the elegant jazz phrasings of Tony Bennett and the next generation concert hall mastery of Bocelli and Groban - built his brand as a bandleader through gigs at venues that range from big city nightspots to theatres across the United States such as The Algonquin Arts Theatre in New Jersey as well as Axelrod PAC, The Great Auditorium, The Pollack Theatre, Rahway PAC, The Newton Theatre, House of Independents, The Grunin Center for the Arts, McLoone's Supper Club and numerous Luxury Private, Charity, Fundraising Galas and Events throughout the country. He has also played such prestigious NYC venues as Birdland, The Rainbow Room, The Explorers Club, The Rose Theatre at Jazz! At Lincoln Center, The Cutting Room, and Feinstein's / 54 Below. Recently, Pinnella was tapped by American Young Voices, singing with the group as one of their guests vocalists alongside massive student choirs ranging from 3000-8000 young singers touring major arenas, including a sold out evening at The Prudential Center in Newark, NJ.\n\nPinnella began his career professionally at the age of 16 after an audition for Maestro Fr. Alphonse Stephenson & the Orchestra of St. Peter performing with the orchestra on and off throughout his career. Chris went on to pursue music and received his degree from Marymount Manhattan College in NYC. Post college he worked off-Broadway and regional theatre and had the opportunity to portray the title role of Simeon in the New Musical 'Simeon's Gift' which was co-written by icon Julie Andrews and her daughter Emma Walton-Hamilton. Pinnella spent a month with Ms. Andrews and the 6-person cast at Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, NY working side by side until the shows premiere. Pinnella also worked alongside Emmy, Oscar winning arranger Ian Fraser and the Tony nominated John Bucchino and Tony nominated director Marcia Milgrom Dodge (B'Way's Ragtime) on the project.\n\nCurrently Chris is working on writing and arranging his debut EP which is set to drop in 2020. The 11-track debut will feature mostly original material as well as a re-worked covers, namely Pinnella's always requested version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' will be given an overhaul complete with gospel choir and full orchestra. Infusing elements of jazz, classical, alternative, rock, and pop, Pinnella has his sights set on making 2020 his best year yet.\n\n\"Pinnella has been compared to vocal superstars Josh Groban and Michael Buble, but there is no doubt about the fact that Pinnella has a style that is completely his own. Every time he takes the stage he proves that he's one of the strongest forces in the classical crossover realm. His strikingly rich baritone and stage presence are unmatched.\" Ticketmaster\n\nGenre breaking.

In adolescence and youth, nightclub listeners of heavy metal bands, Iron Maiden and Megadeth, their main influences. F\u00e1bio also liked to draw, and he painted t-shirts with drawings of the covers of the discs. Perhaps he has inherited his artistic vein from his family since he has been a movie actor in Europe, his best style of violin playing and making woodwork and his mother very much like to paint paintings. He is also a sports lover like Surf and in 1986 decided to create a fashion wave and express his art on t-shirts. He became a fashion designer, a designer brand, and produced fashion shows at renowned venues such as the Victoria Pub located in a neighborhood of the City of S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1991, he moved to the City of Mogi das Cruzes, where he made some visits, \"Surf Shops\" that sold his products. Continued to produce fashion shows and other events with rock bands and other styles, we can cite a landmark event in the City that was produced with the reggae band Cidade Negra. In 1995, he returned to meet the music and decided the school. Six years after his studies, he created a first rock band titled \"Brave Heart\", his ex-wife and brother also joined the band, played songs and some covers of Megadeth, Black Sabath, among others. They even came up with a small EP, but nothing professional. They did some parties in bars and schools of region, but in 1997, the pair of musicians embarked for Japan, where also they presented new songs like songs but without any performances. In 1998, when returning to Brazil, F\u00e1bio started to teach driums lessons in two schools in S\u00e3o Paulo. He returned to Japan even more than 3 times later. After a period of travel and learning, only year 2007 again formed a new band, this time with the name of \"Surfer of Christ\". An idea of ??the name came from the sport he practiced, surf, and \"Christ\", for he became a follower of Jesus' teachings.The band was a mix of rock and reggae and lasted about 2 years, recording only a single demo with five tracks and performed in some public places, squares, events and in public schools and churches of the region of S\u00e3o Paulo and Greater S\u00e3o Paulo . As F\u00e1bio was always fond of the Heavy Metal style, due to his influences, in 2009 he formed the band called \"No Thanxs\". They recorded a single and two CDs, taking on good projections due to the highlight of the remarkable, heavy riffs and inspiring lyrics of the songs. The band made small and large presentations in S\u00e3o Paulo and other cities, among them we can mention the opening of the show by the former vocalist of rock band Raimundos, Rodolfo Abrantes. \"No Thanxs\" participated in interviews on radios, newspapers and some local television channels. In 2012, F\u00e1bio announces the end of the band, for personal reasons and incompatibility of ideas. That same year, he traveled to the United States to improve his English skills and also to do a theological study at the Dunamis Resource Center led by Pr. Dennis Walker and Israel Silva. In February of 2013, he returned to Brazil and began a new stage in his career as guitarist and vocalist of a solo project titled \"Jesus Freack Rock\" starting the new compositions. All songs are of their own making, mostly written in English and Portuguese, because English is a universal language, and are based on the Holy Bible and also on true facts and themes of current reality. The presentations are enhanced in shows, festivals, churches, schools and events in general with the goal of bringing the true message of the gospel to the knowledge of people, whether Christian or not, emphasizing freedom, without religious dogmas and doctrines, nor created standards by some leaders. At the end of the year 2013, he returned to the United States for another season of presentations and divulgation of his new work. Touring the Cities of Las Vegas and Henderson and among some famous places, we can mention: - Mega Store Samash Music - Money Plays - BB's Club House, where he performed at the event in commemoration of US veterans with the special participation of ex- guitarist of thrash metal band Megadeth, Jeff Young. He then traveled to Mexico City to perform at the Veracruzano Social and Cultural Center at La Caverna Rock Bar. Upon returning to Brazil in 2014, the project was renamed \"Jesushed\", a more original name with a profound meaning : \"Jesus Shed.\" In 2015, he released the CD Born Again, in 2017 the EP 360 and in October 2018 the EP \"End Times\", that is currently on tour.Since 2016 \"Jesushed\" had 3 different line up, and currently has the following members: F\u00e1bio Curtis - Vocal and Guitar, Wellington Ferreira - lead guitar, Maicon Martins - Bass and Jos\u00e9 Carlos - Drums.", "otherInfo": "Fabio Curtis & Wellington Ferreira"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Susan Werner ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8067926.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Musicals, Pop, Agnostic Gospel, Songwriter, Singer, Blues, Country, Musical Theater, Jazz, Folk", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "HAYSEED and all SW recordings available on iTunes, CDs available at www.bulletproofartists.com", "otherInfo": "Visit https://www.facebook.com/susanwernerpage/live at 7pm EDT on Sunday May 10 and interact with host, Susan Werner as she plays your requests for Mothers and MotherLikeFigures.\n\nABOUT SUSIE ON SUNDAYS:\n\nJoin singer-songwriter SUSAN WERNER for SUSIE ON SUNDAYS, her new streaming concert series Live on Facebook (and now YouTube) EVERY Sunday at 7pm EDT.\n\nEach week features a different theme or special guest, along with Susan\u2019s signature humor, poetry and musicianship.\n\nWATCH LIVE:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/susanwernerpage/live\nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/susanwerneronline\n\nREPLAY:\n\nMiss the original live broadcast?

Country Artist JD Shelburne grew up on a tobacco farm in Taylorsville, KY, a tiny town southeast of the Ohio River near Louisville KY. At age 19, he found a guitar after the death of his grandmother and began learning to play and sing on his own. By his sophomore year of college, he had found a few gigs at some local bars in the Louisville/Lexington, KY area and developed a fan-base that eventually landed him on some of the biggest stages in the business, opening for some of the nation\u2019s hottest stars. Eventually, Shelburne was adding original songs into the set mix, in addition to producing songs of his own material.\n\nIn 2002, Kentucky fell in love at first sight with Shelburne, then college student/ small-town country boy with a wide smile, natural singing voice and a love of faith, family and his hometown of Taylorsville, KY. But that small-town image is merely a fond memory now that he has moved on to Nashville down the path to music stardom.\n\nNow find him soaking up the music scene, touring cities, building a fan-base and celebrating a decade of success playing venues all across the southeast trying to get his big break. Today he\u2019s among the most hard working and relevant country singers in the business. They say Nashville doesn\u2019t work that way anymore \u2013 that talented musicians with very few connections don\u2019t stand a chance. But Shelburne proved that Music City\u2019s engine still runs off of talent and persistent driven antics. Critics find him credible. Fans pack his shows. Venues strive to book him. There are very few new artists recording songs today about whom that can be said.\n\nDuring his whirlwind career explosion, he has performed with over 50 national acts ranging from stars such as Montgomery Gentry, Craig Morgan, Jamey Johnson, Kellie Pickler, Steve Wariner to Clay Walker and Johnny Lee, performed at some of the region\u2019s most famous venues such as the Historic Ryman Auditorium, Rupp Arena, Murphy Center, KFC Yum Center, Freedom Hall, Churchill Downs and Old Cardinal Stadium which recently drew the Kentucky State Fair\u2019s largest crowd of the concert series. Shelburne performed \u201cGod Bless America\u201d prior to the 2016 Quaker State 400 NASCAR race at Kentucky Speedway to over 100,000 attendees. He has also been featured in Country Weekly Magazine, Kentucky Alumni Magazine, Kentucky Monthly Magazine amongst many other national publications including the Huffington Post. His debut music video \u201cFarmboy\u201d gained him thousands of new fans by airing on the TNN Top Ten Countdown nationwide on Heartland TV network and ZUUS Country Network. In 2015, he made his Nationwide debut on GAC \u2013 Great American Country Network and also CMT.com in October with his second music video entitled \u201cHometown\u201d written about the demise of his smalltown. On October 21, 2015, Shelburne debuted as #1 trending artist on CMT.com edging out Taylor Swift, Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean! Shelburne has performed over 1000 concerts all over the southeast as well as over 300 festivals. Shelburne\u2019s outfit has been featured on display at the Kentucky Derby Museum at Historic Churchill Downs from his appearance at the 2015/2016 Kentucky Derby. In 2016, Shelburne was invited to perform in the Kentucky State Capitol for the State Senate as well as the House of Representatives where he performed his own rendition of \u201cMy Old Kentucky Home\u201d for both parties. JD was named an Honorable Kentucky Colonel and was also presented honor of \u201cAdmiral\u201d by the Commonwealth of Kentucky \u2013 Energy and Environment Cabinet recently. Also in 2016, the University of Kentucky\u2019s College of Communication and Information named JD Shelburne their 2016 Most Outstanding Alumnus!\n\nMost recently in 2017, Shelburne launched his world premiere official music video for \u201cBetter Man\u201d that was filmed in Midway/ Millville, KY. The video also made it\u2019s Network Television Debut on Great American Country (GAC) on June 23, 2017 and is currently in Nationwide rotation. At this past years Kentucky Derby, Shelburne was invited to cook with Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives host Guy Fieri at his restaurant alongside Guy, Travis Tritt and NFL Legend Jerry Rice! In September 2017, Shelburne made his NBC Network Television Debut performing the National Anthem at the NASCAR XS Myrtle Beach 300 at Kentucky Speedway!\n\nShelburne also has performed at several prestigious nationwide events: 2 NBA Basketball Games, Guaranteed Rate Field for the Chicago White Sox, Suntrust Park for the Atlanta Braves, The Kentucky Derby, Unbridled Eve Derby Gala, Barnstable Brown Derby Gala, events for Jim Beam Brands and Four Roses Bourbon, NCAA Division I College Football/Basketball Games, The National FFA Organization National Convention, Omni Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Hotel Brands, NASCAR Racing Events, Minor League Baseball Games, Dollar General NASCAR Racing Team Event, CMA Music Festival, the NCAA Women\u2019s Final Four, SEC Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament and more!

When given a stage from which to sing, he simply soars. The soul-stirring wail of Brooklyn-by-way-of-Western Massachusetts singer-songwriter Sean McMahon belies the otherworldliness of his inspiration, while beautiful sonic landscapes change shape and color around it, ruthlessly bending genre, hopelessly without explanation.

The Workman moniker itself nods to Christian anarchist Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker.\n\nSo much for McMahon the songwriter, McMahon the mystic.

In December of 1995, Jask started Tampa's first weekly soulful underground house night called, \"Jacks House\".

But even in their most exasperated moments, the Brooklyn-based punk trio sustains a ferocious energy and untamed joy, ultimately turning every song into a wildly cathartic anthem.\n\n\u201cA lot of these songs came from feeling stifled in silence, but then the song itself is an answer to that,\u201d says Black. \u201cIt\u2019s us saying, \u2018I have my opinion, and I\u2019m going to share it no matter what.\u2019 Instead of keeping things all bottled up, it feels so much better to face everything head on, and just be really loud about it with your two best friends.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to their 2019 self-titled effort\u2014THICK\u2019s third EP and first release for Epitaph Records\u20145 Years Behind came to life at Studio G Brooklyn with producer/engineer Joel Hamilton (Iggy Pop, Jolie Holland). In a departure from their previous work, the band took a more spontaneous approach to the album-making process, sometimes completely reworking songs at the eleventh hour in order to channel the most immediate emotion into each track. \u201cIt was really important to us that the songs feel emotionally connected to our reality, so that it feel as natural as possible to play them,\u201d notes Black.\n\nAs a result of fearlessly following their instincts, THICK manage the impossible feat of coming off confident and carefree even as they expose their deepest insecurities. On the album\u2019s dynamic yet delicate title track, for instance, the band shifts from furious intensity to harmony-soaked melancholy as they reflect on certain overwhelming societal pressures. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we always feel five years behind in life, at least as far as the expectations of the world around us,\u201d says Sisti. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re constantly battling, but at the same time we know that there\u2019s no real timeline\u2014there\u2019s no time limit for doing what we want to do.\u201d\n\nTHICK\u2019s most politically charged work to date, 5 Years Behind offers up tracks like \u201cMansplain\u201d\u2014a blistering, brilliantly sarcastic takedown bookended by a sound collage of massively infuriating comments from men (e.g., \u201cGirl bands are really in right now,\u201d \u201cHere, let me help you carry your amp,\u201d \u201cAre those your boyfriend\u2019s drums?\u201d). \u201cThose are all things that men have actually said to us or our friends at shows,\u201d Page points out. On \u201cFake News,\u201d the band lets loose a 49-second blast of pure punk vitriol, spiked with scathing social commentary. And on \u201cBumming Me Out,\u201d 5 Years Behind delivers a bouncy but bittersweet epic that perfectly captures the pain of feeling powerless in the face of endless horrors happening in the world (sample lyric: \u201cNever knew I\u2019d be so tired/Fighting for what I believe\u201d).\n\nClosing out with the unrestrained fun of \u201cParty With Me\u201d\u2014as in \u201cJust take your clothes off and party with me/In the backyard of New York City\u201d\u20145 Years Behind also finds THICK looking back on their early days and on the increasingly endangered all-ages scene that birthed the band. To that end, the tenderly detailed \u201cWHUB\u201d unfolds as a heavy-hearted tribute to \u201call the DIY venues that are shut down now,\u201d as Page puts it. All originally from New York State, THICK\u2019s three members forged their friendship in those venues, with Sisti and Page forming the band in 2014 and Black joining the lineup two years later. Along with playing live as often as they could\u2014and purposely focusing on DIY/all-ages spaces all around New York\u2014THICK made their debut with the 2016 EP It\u2019s Always Something\u2026, put out their sophomore EP Would You Rather? in 2018, then signed with Epitaph later that year. \u201cFor a long time we didn\u2019t have management or a booking agent or anything\u2014we just worked our butts off and stayed true to ourselves, and it got us to where we are now,\u201d says Sisti.\n\nOver the years, THICK have earned recognition as an unstoppable live act, with their show typically spawning a mosh pit described by Stereogum as \u201cmore like an aggressive hug.\u201d As they dreamed up the tightly crafted yet uncontainable sound of 5 Years Behind, the band kept the live experience at the forefront of their minds. \u201cWhen we write, we write toward the emotions of the audience,\u201d says Sisti. \u201cI know that lyrics play a huge role in connection, but I\u2019m personally more focused on visualizing how people might physically respond to a song\u2014what it would make them feel in the moment and how it might make them move or dance.\u201d\n\nNow gearing up for a national tour in support of 5 Years Behind, THICK aspire to strengthen the palpable sense of inclusivity that\u2019s defined their shows from the start. \u201cWe want people to feel safe in the mosh pit, and hopefully connect with each other,\u201d says Page. \u201cWe\u2019ve made so many friends at the shows we\u2019ve played, and we\u2019d love it if people could build some kind of community from coming to see us.\u201d And in the making of their first full-length effort, THICK aimed to instill an undeniable feeling of solidarity into each of the album\u2019s tracks. \u201cIn a way the theme of all our songs is: \u2018We\u2019ll get through this. We\u2019re not going to be kept down,\u201d says Black. \u201cI hope when people listen to the album, it gives them that same feeling. And I hope they feel like, if they ever needed it, we\u2019d absolutely have their back.\u201d\n\nNikki Sisti (guitar, vocals) - Kate Black (bass, vocals, guitar) - Shari Page (drums, vocals)", "otherInfo": "THICK will be performing live on The Noise's Instragram"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sebastian Yatra ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617933.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Proulx ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8540692.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Vocal Jazz, Jazz, Folk Jazz", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The jazz scene is abuzz about singer, pianist, composer, and recording artist, John Proulx (pronounced \"Proo\").

After seeing Doc Watson on TV, he became a lifelong devotee of old time and bluegrass music.\n\nHe started making his living as a musician at age 19 in Chicago and in Jackson, Wyoming, eventually relocating to Boulder, Colorado in the fall of 1974. O\u2019Brien found work there as a fiddler with local bluegrass bands and as a member of the Ophelia Swing, recording with them and with Pete Wernick in 1977. In those early Colorado years, he started playing the mandolin, and studied guitar and music theory with local jazz great Dale Bruning.\n\nIn 1978, Tim co-founded the bluegrass group Hot Rize with Pete Wernick, Charles Sawtelle, and Nick Forster. Hot Rize and Western Swing alter-egos Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers eventually recorded ten albums and toured the US, Europe, Japan, and Australia. The group was named Entertainer of the Year 1990 by the International Bluegrass Music Association, and their \"Colleen Malone\" was named IBMA\u2019s Song of the Year in 1991. He won IBMA\u2019s Male Vocalist of the year in 1993, and again in 2005, when he also won song of the year for \"Look Down That Lonesome Road\".\n\nSolo recordings started with 1982\u2019s \"Hard Year Blues\", and other projects included three duet albums with his sister Mollie O\u2019Brien. Folks in Nashville started noticing Tim\u2019s songs, and he had top ten country hits in 1989 and 1990 with Kathy Mattea\u2019s versions of Hot Rize songs \"Walk The Way The Wind Blows\" and \"Untold Stories\". Other notable covers by New Grass Revival, Nickel Creek, Garth Brooks, and the Dixie Chicks followed. Hot Rize went dormant in the spring of 1990, after which O\u2019Brien performed and recorded on his own, eventually releasing fourteen solo recordings, as well as collaborations with Dirk Powell (\"Songs From The Mountain\") and with Darrell Scott (\"Real Time\"). Landmarks solo releases include a Grammy nominated set of bluegrass Dylan covers \u2013 \"Red On Blonde\", the Celtic/Appalachian fusion of \"The Crossing\", and 2005\u2019s Grammy winning \"Fiddler\u2019s Green\".\n\nTim toured and recorded with Steve Earle\u2019s Bluegrass Dukes in the early 2000\u2019s, and with Mark Knopfler in 2009 and 2010. Other recent collaborations include another CD with Darrell Scott (\"Memories and Moments\"), a track with Steve Martin (\"Daddy Played The Banjo\"), a family band set of Roger Miller songs (\"Reincarnation\"), and the reunited Hot Rize\u2019s \"When I\u2019m Free\". A collaboration with Jerry Douglas, Shawn Camp and others -\"The Earls Of Leicester\" - won a Grammy as well as IBMA\u2019s Record of the Year in 2015.\n\nTim has produced recordings for Laurie Lewis, the Yonder Mountain String Band, the Infamous Stringdusters, Old Man Luedecke, and early mentor J.D.

Finally, the album closes with the band\u2019s unique take on \u201cWonderwall\u201d by Oasis, a track sure to trick the audience into thinking they\u2019re listening to another Trawick original.\n\nJustin Trawick has been performing in the Washington DC area and along the East Coast since 2006, citing musical influences like Bob Schneider, Greensky Bluegrass, The Tallest Man on Earth, G. Love, Old Crow Medicine Show, and David Gray. In June of 2015, Trawick released his first single, \u201cGoodbye\u201d, under the band name \"Justin Trawick and the Common Good\u201d; written about the search for direction and belonging in a world that constantly feels one step ahead of you. Trawick has performed for TedxEast in NYC at the City Winery, TedxPennsylvaniaAvenue in DC at the Newseum, and has opened for over 30 national acts including Suzanne Vega, Wyclef Jean, Brett Dennen, Blues Traveler, Enter The Haggis, Bob Schneider, and Edwin McCain, and shared bills with Dr. Dogg and The Avett Brothers. In February of 2014, Trawick won \u201cSong of the Year\u201d at the Washington Area Music Awards for his song \u201cAll the Places That I\u2019ve Been,\" which can be downloaded on iTunes as a single along with his five other solo records and EPs. Founder of the nationally touring show \u201cThe 9 Songwriter Series\u201d and co-founder of \u201cThe Circus Life Podcast\" with guests such as Kevin Eubanks, Chris Thomas King, Ernie Halter, Yarn, and Snuffy Walden, Trawick has built a brand that extends far beyond his home base in DC.

Lalli wrote, \u201cNow more than ever, we need to come together and work towards a brighter future for us, our children and for the human race as a whole.\u201d The album was released on August 26, 2016 and features special guests Waka Flocka Flame, Logic, Cherub, Griz, Pell, and many more.

After donating tens of thousands of dollars, school supplies, food and other items to those in need through their #ABigGiganticDifference initiative, Lalli and Salken have taken their give-back mission to the next level. In Fall of 2016, the duo founded the nonprofit A Big Gigantic Difference Foundation with the mission to spread positivity and enact change alongside their fans and community through #ABDG events, fundraising initiatives, and donations from ticket sales.\nIn 2017, they switched their model of giving many small gifts for a greater impact large donation.

Oh, and give your music away. Which isn\u2019t to say he won\u2019t be selling his debut full-length offering, Messenger ( Released 2/16/2010 on Lightning Rod). But free is how he came to make it, more or less.\n\nIt worked like this, for Joe Pug anyhow: The day before his senior year as a playwright student at the University of North Carolina, he sat down for a cup of coffee and had the clearest thought of his life: I am profoundly unhappy here. Then came the second clearest.\n\nPug packed up his belongings and pointed his car towards Chicago. Working as a carpenter by day, the 23 year-old Pug spent nights playing the guitar he hadn\u2019t picked up since his teenage years. Using ideas originally slated for a play he was writing called \u201cAustin Fish,\u201d Pug began creating the sublime lyrical arrangements that would become the Nation of Heat EP.\n\nThe songs were recorded fast and fervently at a Chicago studio where a friend snuck him in to late night slots other musicians had canceled. He was short on money, but his bare-boned sincerity didn\u2019t require much more than a microphone and it dripped off of each note he sang.\n\nThe early rumblings of critical praise for the EP were confirmed when his first headlining gig sold out Chicago\u2019s storied Schubas Tavern in 2008. As word spread, Pug struck upon an idea that would later prove to be one of the most significant in his young career. He offered his existing fans unlimited copies of a free 2-song sampler CD to pass along to their friends. He sent the CDs out at his own expense, even covering the postage. Inside each package was a personal note thanking the fan for helping to spread the word. The response was overwhelming, and to date he has sent out over 15,000 CDs to 50 states and 14 different countries. Without access to radio, Pug managed to turn his fans into his very own broadcast system. The offer still stands, and to this day it\u2019s featured prominently on www.joepugmusic.com.\n\n\u201cLook, in the end, I just trust my fans, and the nature of people in general. I need to pay my bills like anyone else does. But I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to ask someone to pay $15 when they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting. So in a way by sending out these CDs, I\u2019m wagering that they\u2019ll like my music, and that if they do they\u2019ll come to shows, buy CDs, and help me spread the word even further. And so far I\u2019ve been proven right. Without question, the more sampler CDs I send out, the more music I sell.\u201d\n\nNation of Heat took on a life of its own, passing from friend to friend and iPod to iPod. The crowds swelled and the media took notice. Tours with Steve Earle, M. Ward, and Josh Ritter followed, as did invitations to Lollapalooza and the Newport Folk Festival. He crisscrossed the country incessantly, traveling mostly alone in his 1995 Plymouth Voyager with no stereo or air conditioning. As the tours went on, he became closely linked to the burgeoning indie-folk scene that was coalescing loosely around Pug and his young contemporaries in bands such as The Low Anthem, Langhorne Slim, and Horse Feathers.\n\nAfter over 200 shows, Pug took a brief respite to record his full-length debut. If Nation of Heat heralded the arrival of a talent to watch, Messenger assigns Pug a deserved spot among the finest songwriters of his generation. From the opening notes of the title track that leads off the record, it\u2019s clear that the artist has no intention of retreating to the comfortable or the familiar. While the scathing war indictment \u201cBury Me Far (From My Uniform)\u201d and the sparse, poetic \u201cUnsophisticated Heart\u201d illustrate that Pug is still a master of the guy-and-guitar song, it\u2019s the supporting cast Pug brought on board that truly brings out the record\u2019s subtle beauty.\n\nFrom the haunting, ethereal pedal steel guitar that sneaks delicately under \u201cThe Sharpest Crown\u201d to the barrelhouse rhythm section that propels \u201cThe Door Is Always Open\u201d, it\u2019s clear that Pug is as comfortable exploring this new territory as he is solo. \u201cThe first record, it was a breeze,\u201d he says. \u201cDidn\u2019t even know we were making it, just me and a guitar\u2026the songs completely unadorned.

His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world. He continues to innovate and curate new events with a 2 additional multi-day festival mirroring his Birdhouse radio show in Chicago, and his record BBQ event series that has been going since 2003!\n\nVonStroke also loves art; most notably pop-surrealist artwork that he has commissioned for the last 7 years on Dirtybird for all of the releases. Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude. Claude does not scowl or look mean while he DJs. He does not pretend to know everything and he truly loves his fans. He is grateful to be curating, creating and performing music for a living and he knows that the reason people go to parties is to shake their booty and have fun.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ Prodijay ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10302100.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Top 40, Hip Hop, Reggaeton", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "DJ Prodijay, (DJ/Radio Personality) has proven to be one of the most sought-after and respected open format DJs in Los Angeles, California.

Excelente interprete de rancheras y musica mel\u00f3dica latina.\nComenz\u00f3 interpretando temas con mariachi y m\u00fasica tradicional mexicana. \u00daltimamente canta tambi\u00e9n m\u00fasica pop.\n\nAlejandro Fern\u00e1ndez (born April 24, 1971) is a popular Latin Grammy-winning Mexican singer nicknamed as \"El Potrillo\" (\"The Little Colt\") by the media and his fans. ] Alejandro originally specialized in traditional, earthy forms of Mexican folk and country music, such as mariachi and ranchera. However, his more recent work has focused on mainstream pop music. He is the son of Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez, also a popular Mexican country singer. His nickname \"El Potrillo\" (The Little Colt) was given to him by the media and his fans because of his being the son of Vicente, who is considered the most popular charro in Mexico.\n\n\nCareer\n\nBorn in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, he trained as an architect but turned to singing in 1991, encouraged by his father. A year later, he released his first album, titled Alejandro Fernandez. Since then, he has recorded 18 albums and sold a reported 15 million records, working with producers such as Emilio Estefan, Jr. and Kike Santander. His first public appearance was in 1976, when his father presented him on one of his shows, he was meant to perform the song \"Alejandra\". In the middle of the song he forgot the lyrics, started crying and suffered a panic attack, but then, his father got on stage and helped him singing along the song, making it a very touching moment between Alejandro and his father.\n\nIn 1992, Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez released his debut, self-titled album, launching one of the most prolific, successful and memorable careers in Latin music. Since then, the son of legendary ranchera singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez has done what few progeny of famous parents have ever been able to achieve: He\u2019s followed in his father\u2019s footsteps, but at the same time, he\u2019s carved out his own, separate path, thanks to his skilled vocals and an unparalleled stage presence. Fern\u00e1ndez also has portrayed the lead role in zapata: El sue\u00f1o del h\u00e9roe, a 2004 movie about the Mexican revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata by filmmaker Alfonso Arau, which proved to be one of the greatest disappointments in the Nuevo Cine Mexicano era, spending 7 million dollars in production and publicity but faring poorly at the box office.\n\nWhile most Latin acts talk about crossovers from Spanish to English, Alejandro is one of only a handful of artists that have managed to become a superstar by crossing over from the world of traditional ranchera music to the world of pop. That duality began in 1997 with Me Estoy Enamorando, a collaboration with producer Emilio Estefan that sold 3 million copies worldwide and established Alejandro as an international star. In 1998, Alejandro performed along with the operatic tenor Placido Domingo and the French singer Patricia Kaas in Christmas in Vienna VI.\n\nIn 2004, A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto reunites Alejandro with Grammy-winning producer and songwriter Kike Santander, who penned his greatest hits from \"Me Estoy Enamorando\". But it also finds him singing the songs of a bold new generation of songwriters, including Gian Marco, Leonel Garc\u00eda (one half of pop duo Sin Bandera), Reyli Barba (former member of pop band Elefante) and Mexican group Tres De Copas.\n\n\"A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto\" is about love, but it\u2019s hardly a staid album. Quite the opposite. Under the guidance of producers Kike Santander and Aureo Baqueiro, the sound of this record is taken beyond the traditional and is an album rich in instrumentation\u2014rippling guitars, flowing strings and mariachi lines\u2014that treads on folk, rock and ranchera elements with organic ease and conviction. The superb emotional and musical interpretations are the clincher. At times exuberant, \"A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto\" can also be an album of subtle understatement, unafraid to bare the singer in every sense of the word.\n\n\"Romanticism is something that will never die\", says Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez, explaining his choice of songs on \"A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto\", his breakthrough recording about lost love, love that is never forgotten and the capacity to always love again. \"I\u2019m super, ultra passionate. We\u2019re releasing an album that\u2019s an x-ray of myself. That\u2019s why it\u2019s titled \"A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto\". It was something very honest. Not naked, but something deeper than that\".\n\nIn 2005, Alejandro launches M\u00e9xico - Madrid: En Directo Y Sin Escalas (in English: Mexico - Madrid: Nonstop). Featuring 13 tracks including one new song, this album is Fern\u00e1ndez at his best - live and in concert! \"Produced by Aureo Baquiero and filmed in front of a live audience at Spain\u2019s Palacio de Congresos IFEMA, the production features Fern\u00e1ndez performing some of his biggest hits accompanied by a 28-piece orchestra and some of Spain\u2019s most important voices on three of the songs: Amaia from La Oreja de Van Gogh joins him on \"Me dediqu\u00e9 a perderte\"; Mal\u00fa duets with him on \"Contigo aprend\u00ed\", and with flamenco star Diego El Cigala perform a moving version of \"Como quien pierde una estrella\", accompanied on cajon by famed Flamenco guitarist Ni\u00f1o Josele. That same year, Alejandro was chosen to sing along with the tenors Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo in a special concerto celebrating the opening of the \"Forum Internacional de las Culturas\" in Monterrey. Alejandro's performance was praised by the audience. He also recorded a duet song with the tenor Mario Frangoulis called \"Hay M\u00e1s\" from the album Follow Your Heart.\n\nIn 2007, launches Viento A Favor features tunes written by Leonel Garc\u00eda and Noel Schajris (better known as emotive Latin-pop duo Sin Bandera) and Mexican singer Reyli Barba. They're all taken to wuthering heights by Fernandez's stellar vocal range, which goes from hushed whispers to booming intensity.

They were originally called The Guildford Stranglers and operated from an off-licence in the town. They also based themselves in the nearby village of Chiddingfold for a while.\n\nOriginal personnel were singer/guitarist Hugh Cornwell (from kentish town, london), keyboardist/guitarist Hans Warmling (from Sweden, replaced within two years by brighton-born keyboardist Dave Greenfield), london-born bass guitarist Jean-Jacques Burnel and drummer Jet Black (a.k.a. Brian Duffy), a native of ilford, essex.\n\nThey began as a sinister sounding, hard-edged pub rock group, but eventually branched out to explore other styles of music. The Stranglers were, beginning in 1976, tangentially associated with punk rock, due in part to their opening for Ramones' first British tour. The Stranglers were also associated with new wave music as well as gothic rock, but their idiosyncratic approach never fit completely within a musical genre.\n\nIn August 1990, founding member Cornwell left the band to pursue a solo career. In his autobiography, Cornwell states that he felt the band was a spent force creatively, and cited various examples of his increasingly acrimonious relationship with his fellow band-members, particularly Burnel. The remaining members recruited two replacements, including John Ellis, who had opened for the band in the 1970s as a member of The Vibrators, and singer Paul Roberts.\n\nInterest in The Stranglers resurfaced when, in 2001, singer Tori Amos covered their song \"Strange Little Girl\" and titled the album it was featured on Strange Little Girls. \"Golden Brown\" was also used in the hit film Snatch by film director Guy Ritchie and extensively in the Australian film He Died With A Felafel In His Hand. Their hit \"No More Heroes\" was covered by Violent Femmes and used for the film Mystery Men. \"Peaches\", finally, also appears prominently in another British movie, Sexy Beast by director Jonathan Glazer.\n\nThe Stranglers had a critical and popular renaissance in 2004 (together with their first top 40 hit for 14 years - \"Big Thing Coming\") with the acclaimed Norfolk Coast album and a subsequent sell-out tour. The follow-up album, Suite XVI, was released in September 2006 (the title is a pun on \"Sweet 16\" and also a reference to the fact that it is the band's 16th studio album).", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kysia Live ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10368461.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Motown, R&b, Soul, Neo Soul", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Motown's Blue-Eyed Soul Child now in Chicago and captivating ears everywhere", "otherInfo": "Matt Kysia hosts a live stream morning show that features live performances, special guest interviews and more.

It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label.

Her songs are slow-release works of craft and catharsis that become treasured, lifetime companions for their listeners. As a storyteller, Colvin is both keen and warm-hearted, leavening even the toughest tales with tenderness, empathy, and a searing sense of humor. In the nearly 30 years since the release of her debut album, Colvin has won three GRAMMY Awards, released twelve albums, written a critically acclaimed memoir, maintained a non-stop national and international touring schedule, appeared on countless television and radio programs, had her songs featured in major motion pictures and created a remarkable canon of work.\n\nColvin was born in Vermillion, South Dakota, where she lived until she was eight. A small-town childhood in the university town of Carbondale, IL. drew her to the guitar by the age of 10. She made her first public appearance on campus at the University of Illinois at age 15. By the late 1970\u2019s Colvin was singing in a Western Swing band in Austin, Texas\u2014the city she now calls home. Moving to New York at the decade\u2019s end she remained in the country music field as a member of the Buddy Miller Band where she met producer, guitarist and co-writer John Leventhal. Leventhal inspired Colvin to find her own voice as a songwriter. She began honing her skill and was soon signed to Columbia Records. Her first album, Steady On, produced by Leventhal, won the GRAMMY Award for Best Contemporary Folk Recording.\n\nColvin continued to win fans and critics with her subsequent releases, Fat City (1992) and Cover Girl (1994). In 1996, she released A Few Small Repairs (1996), which would prove to be her breakthrough. The song \u201cSunny Came Home\u201d gave Colvin a Top 10 hit, a platinum-selling album and two of GRAMMY\u2019s biggest honors: Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\nHoliday Songs And Lullabies (1998), recorded while Colvin was eight months pregnant with her daughter Caledonia, followed. Her next studio album, Whole New You (2001) found Colvin examining new motherhood and the responsibilities of family. These Four Walls (2006) was lauded by People Magazine as \u201cthe most self-assured album of her career\u201d and \u201cone for the ages\u201d by the Washington Post. The Austin-American Statesman called it \u201can exquisite portrait of strength and vulnerability.\u201d\n\nShawn Colvin Live (2009), was recorded during a special three-night engagement at San Francisco\u2019s famous jazz club, Yoshi\u2019s. Live captures the beauty and intimacy of Colvin\u2019s performances, showcasing her inimitable voice and matchless guitar stylings. Praised by both critics and fans, the album was honored with a GRAMMY Award nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Recording.\n\nAll Fall Down (2012) was produced by Colvin\u2019s longtime friend and musical cohort Buddy Miller (Patty Griffin, Robert Plant, Lucinda Williams). Recorded in Nashville with a group of stellar musicians, the album features performances by Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Jakob Dylan, Bill Frisell, Viktor Krauss, Brian Blade, Stuart Duncan and Julie Miller.\n\nThe release of All Fall Down was simultaneous with that of her William Morrow/Harper Collins\u2013published memoir, Diamond In The Rough. Diamond in the Rough looks back over a rich lifetime of highs and lows with stunning insight and candor. Through its pages we witness the inspiring story of a woman honing her artistry, finding her voice, and making herself whole.\n\nUncovered (2015) is the long-awaited follow up to fan-favorite Cover Girl. Its twelve tunes include masterful interpretations of songs by Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon, Tom Waits, Stevie Wonder, Robbie Robertson and Graham Nash \u2013 and more - but in their selection and delivery they are pure Shawn Colvin.\n\nIn June 2016, Shawn Colvin and longtime friend Steve Earle united to release, Colvin & Earle, their acclaimed self-titled duo album. Produced by Buddy Miller, Colvin & Earle beautifully captures the pair\u2019s extraordinary chemistry and is a true standout in careers already filled with pinnacles and masterpieces. The album received high praise from critics \u2013 NPR asserted that the duo \u201cElevated their collaboration to the level of top-flight album-making, bringing seemingly opposing impulses to the process.\u201d\n\nColvin was recognized for her career accomplishments when she was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Trailblazer Award at the 2016 Americana Honors and Awards Show. Presenting her with this prestigious award was Bonnie Raitt. Said Raitt, \u201cShe\u2019s simply one of the best singers I\u2019ve ever heard \u2014 and a truly gifted and deep songwriter and guitarist\u2026 She was groundbreaking when she emerged and continues to inspire me and the legions of fans and other singer/songwriters coming up in her wake\u201d\n\nTo mark the 20th anniversary of A Few Small Repairs, Columbia/Legacy issued a newly-expanded edition of the album. This special edition includes seven rare live performances culled from the Sony Music archives, plus enhanced artwork including newly-written liner notes by Shawn and producer John Leventhal and recently discovered archival photos.\n\nShawn Colvin\u2019s latest release is The Starlighter (Amazon Music), a new album of songs adapted from the children's music book \"Lullabies and Night Songs.\" The Starlighters\u2019s 14 songs are a mix of traditional numbers and children's standards, an elegant and graceful musical offering that resonates with the warmth and tenderness of poignant familial experience and remembrance.

You did? Boy oh boy.\n\nThe metronome reference was but a musical in-joke before: now it contains more meaning. The steady tick-tocking of the pendulum represents continuation, stability, endlessness, and consistent familiarity. It understands that while we all ultimately return to the goo from whence we came, time marches on furiously, like a bull aiming for a matador. Your last breath will be another click on the machine.\n\nMetronomy Forever in name represents a similar ethos: something looking backwards and forwards simultaneously, like Janus, something fated and eternal. You were made from dust and to dust you will return, that sort of thing.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is when you\u2019re making music and you enter a world where you have achieved some sort of celebrity no matter how large or small you start to think about yourself in terms of legacy and what you\u2019re going to leave behind,\u201d says Mount. \u201cAnd then you realise that\u2019s limited to the interest people have in you. In the end I feel completely comfortable with it. The less importance you place in any art the more interesting it can become in a way\u2026 I\u2019m making music, I\u2019m going to do some concerts, I need to feed my children.\u201d\n\nMetronomy Forever is the follow-up to 2016\u2019s Summer 08, and contains 17 tracks. Its length is born from a desire for breathing room, from not wanting to stuff the hits together like a bouquet of petrol station roses. In between the sauna-sweat-soaked funk of songs like It\u2019s Automatic, and the beach funeral of Walking In The Dark, lie pretty, glistening ambient tracks. It evokes the feeling of being sat in a nursing home, Swiss-cheese-brained, recalling joyous flashes of a past life while the fugue states of comforting confusion wash over you.\n\nIt also comes from a desire to replicate the feeling of listening to the radio, with sumptuous songs of different types and styles helping lighten your mood, and stifle retches as you inhale scrambled egg steam from the saucepan you\u2019re scrubbing. \u201cThe radio never stops,\u201d as Joe puts it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter how emotionally deep the music that comes on is, it\u2019s entirely your situation that gives the music it\u2019s emotional leaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor so long I was concentrating on trying to make these snappy songs, and when they were all sat together it didn\u2019t make for some impressive thing. It wasn\u2019t until I started thinking about the past several years, realising that in that time there\u2019ve been periods of drifting, and looking around for ideas. When I started including these bits of instrumental music and bits of sound, to which I genuinely felt some kind of connection, I put them in amongst these little flowers.\u201d\n\nFlowers are apt metaphor. Mount has moved away from the bustle of his former Parisian home to take up residence atop a hill in the garden of England. It was a necessary change, he says, and one that has soldered a bond with him and nature.\n\n\u201cI think it has everything to do with me at the moment, being in this environment \u2013 and I literally mean the environment. I feel properly more connected with nature. And I\u2019m embracing myself getting into it, because I think it\u2019s a really important part of being a person \u2013 and I haven\u2019t even read that Sapiens book.\u201d\n\nAnd a good thing he hasn\u2019t, as it seems Sapiens has been widely discredited by academics the world over.\n\nMetronomy Forever is a record that exudes a green tranquillity. Mount was concerned that the relative happiness of his existence might stifle his creativity, having no great tragedy to draw from, but discovered the opposite was true.\n\n\u201cTo be jealous of having that stuff going on is a bit dangerous,\u201d he says. \u201cI look at successful musicians who, as they get older, struggle to remain relevant. I\u2019m at this point where I feel like, my attitude towards what I do is healthy. With this record I wanted to make a very pure expression of what I\u2019m about right now, and I think for me that makes for better music.\u201d\n\nAnd while the music itself promotes a sense of calm joy, it\u2019s in the lyrics that we remember that even idyllic circumstances require their own maintenance, an oiling of the cogs to keep them crunching along. Mount reminds us of this on Lately, desperately singing \u201cThat is love and it's hard to do, it's a job for two. What do I do if I don't get nothing from you?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the physical space and distance from stress and life on the Rue De Dogshit in the French capital that has had its effect on the creative process. \u202fMount spent much of the last four years working with Robyn on her acclaimed and deeply personal record Honey. 48 months of vicarious agony was exhausting, but ultimately extremely fulfilling.\n\n\u201cIn the space of time since the last Metronomy record I\u2019ve had a very large part in writing an album based on a traumatic experience for her. I knew the whole experience was going to be this massive cathartic thing. When it got to the point of finishing, I remember telling her how good it was and how people are really going to respond to it in the way you want them to. Working with someone and being able to tell someone that is quite an enjoyable thing, being able to know that everything\u2019s cool. It\u2019s a nice feeling to have.\u201d\n\nThose glimmers of emotional, intense, carnal mania seem to have rubbed off on Mount in their own way, too. On Sex Emoji, the subconscious throbbing purple of the erotic digitised aubergine comes to life, a refrain of \u2018love, honey, sex, money\u2019 sang in a coital squeal.\n\nSalted Caramel Ice Cream brings this to the fore too, but more in the vein of Lipps Inc\u2019s Funkytown, and evokes the sapid pleasure and delights of love, but also the panics and anxieties (\u2018Oh god, she\u2019s coming, don\u2019t look up\u2019).\n\nBut when the shagging is over you\u2019re left only with the despair of your sweaty reflection. The moments of pain and sadness on Metronomy Forever are just as real, but also surmountable, much like most of the torture of existence ultimately is. It\u2019s the scope of experience of someone who has decided that agony, while perhaps a good palette from which to scrape your paints, is just not really that much fun. We\u2019re here for a good time, not a long time, and, as Homer Simpson once said, \u201cYou could wake up dead tomorrow.\u201d Get on your hands and knees, plunge your fingers in the soil and scream thanks at the moon for making the waves crash warm foam at the feet of our children.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mikel Erentxun ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9714110.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Pop, Latin", "Time": "6:15 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Mikel Erentxun was the lead singer of the Spanish pop-rock group Duncan Dhu.

As the son of Irish singing sensation Dominic Kirwan, it comes as no surprise that Barry had showbiz aspirations from a very early age. Growing up, Barry was a committed member of his school\u2019s choir and devoted much of his time performing in school productions or competing in various solo singing feis\u2019. At the age of 5 he joined the Seamus Kerrigan School of Traditional Irish Dance where he stayed until the age of 18. Here Barry had the amazing opportunity to travel throughout Ireland taking part in a range of competitions, such as the All Ireland Dancing championships and Sc\u00f3r to name a few. A triple threat, Barry can also add acting to his ever increasing list of talents after the years he spent as a member of the Hazel Wand drama school in his hometown of Omagh. No stranger to the stage, Barry was destined to return and seize the spotlight later on in life. At age 11, Barry fell in love with drumming and excelled from grade 1-8 within the space of five years. His passion for the instrument led him to further study in London at Drumtech college, part of the British and Irish Modern Music Institute (BIMM) schools. Shortly after college Barry decided to join his father\u2019s band as his drummer and provided backing vocals for over 4 years. Constantly growing as a musician, Barry left Dominic\u2019s band in September 2010 and had the opportunity to live with his brother Colm in Nashville. During his time in the US he stayed with close friends, American country duo Joey & Rory where he had the incredible honour to play drums for 4 of their US shows. As January 2011 came to a close Barry had began to work with Ireland\u2019s princess of country, Lisa McHugh and performed with her until September 2011 before becoming the drummer and backing vocalist for the hit recording artist Derek Ryan. During his 4 and a half years working with the Derek Ryan band, Barry toured all around Ireland, the U.K and Australia. With every show in every city, Barry\u2019s desires became more apparent and in February 2016 he left the Derek Ryan band to pursue his own dream of a solo career in the Irish country music scene. For the past 4 months he has been touring with his father as the support act on the \u2018Here For A Good Time\u2019 tour throughout the UK and Ireland which has proven to be an excellent platform to prepare before his own live shows this summer.

Take Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra\u2014 passing through tradition, the quartet stumbled upon innovation, proving that old souls can be creatively fresh.\n\nThe Santa Cruz, California-based quartet\u2019s latest, Stereoscope, out February 9, 2018, marks an evolutionary leap in a journey of artistic identity, songwriting maturity, band friendship and fiery group synergy. Here, Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra homed in on their signature cosmic roots aesthetic, brimming with cinematic songcraft, impressionistic lyrics, clever arrangements, telepathic ensemble interplay, and soulfully world-weary vocals. Imagine the delta blues reprised by psychedelic indie rockers.\n\n\u201cMy whole career has been based on better understanding what\u2019s real and important in artistry, and what is bull#$%,\u201d says Marty. \u201cWhen you weed out all the excess, the little thing that is left is you.\u201d\n\nMarty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra features Marty on electrified resonator guitar and vocals, Chris Lynch on violin and keys, Ben Berry on upright bass, and Matt Goff on drums and percussion. The group specializes in roots music with evocative lyrics that are conceptually cryptic, relying on imagery and symbols to convey emotion. Artistic touchstones for the group include John Lee Hooker, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, the darkly cathartic oeuvre of Tom Waits, and the experimental arrangements of Radiohead.\n\nIn its five-year existence, the band has released one previous full length, one EP, and toured nationally and internationally, selling out venues along the West Coast and throughout the United Kingdom. Select career live performance highlights include performing at Outsidelands Festival, Bottlerock, and the Maverick Festival, where despite being at the bottom of the bill, the group managed to sell more CDs than any other artist in the festival's history. They\u2019ve opened for such diverse artists as Shakey Graves, Deer Tick, Martin Sexton, and Kaki King. In addition, they\u2019ve been featured on NPR\u2019s Weekend Edition, and the band\u2019s beloved track, \"Cold Canary Gaslight,\" from its 2014 studio debut album, Pray for Rain, has currently surpassed passed one million Spotify listens.\nMarty\u2019s blues epiphany came from a somewhat hilarious turn of events when, as a teenager, he tried to download a hip hop track on Napster, but accidently downloaded Blind Willie Johnson\u2019s \u201cLet Your Light Shine On Me.\u201d It was indeed a fateful mistake. Marty saw an avenue of expression for his teen angst in the simple 3-chord structures and earthy melodies of the blues, and dove headfirst into the tradition.\n\n\u201cI was dealing with a lot of stuff emotionally at the time, and I would sit in my bedroom, play guitar, and listen to old blues for hours. My parents would leave food for me outside my door,\u201d Marty recalls, laughing. \u201cThere was something both angry and calming about that music that resonated with me. That music was my place to get away from all my troubles.\u201d\n\nLater, Marty\u2019s father, a voracious music lover, hipped him to John Fahey\u2019s The Yellow Princess (Vanguard Records, 1968), and that record illuminated the possibilities one could explore with roots music. \u201cI felt like that record had one foot in blues and American folk music, and one foot somewhere else,\u201d Marty explains. That John Fahey record\u2019s lesson would play a part in the evolution of the Old Soul Orchestra from reverent traditionalists to Americana adventurers, as evidenced by Stereoscope.\n\nThe album represents the maturation of artists shedding hero worship and embracing the creativity within. These new frontiers are characterized by a heartfelt purity in Marty\u2019s vocals, the tracks\u2019 unique and richly expressive chord structures and progressions, a shift in narrative perspectives to a more observational bend, and emotionally dynamic arrangements that are beautifully arresting, often beginning with sparse simplicity and then reaching lush and fully orchestrated climaxes with sensitive group interplay.\n\nThe 11-song album opens with \u201cFirmament,\u201d which eases in with delicately eerie ambience and sparse musical accompaniment, revealing all the soulful nuances and inflections in Marty\u2019s voice. The song soars forward with an impactful arrangement as the full band joins in with rich and varied musicality, including a dazzling drum and percussive break and a violin solo as brilliantly fractured as a cubist painting. The album\u2019s third track, the haunting \u201cGhost,\u201d is a swampy ambient blues that uses the phenomena of sleep paralysis as an intriguing metaphor for vulnerability. The standout album single \u201cOff and On Again\u201d offers sweet yearning for a d\u00e9tente after a lover\u2019s quarrel. Other album highlights include a rendition of Skip James\u2019 blues classic \u201cHard Time Killing Floor\u201d with chillingly beautiful new music to accompany the haunting traditional lyrics, and the three stirring, but challenging, instrumentally-driven songs that conclude the album and recall fringe jazz guitarist\u2019s Bill Frisell\u2019s evocations of dustbowl Americana with futuristic ambience.\n\nStereoscope is no doubt a milestone entry for Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra, offering forth the band\u2019s most assured and mature release to date. \u201cWe put our heart and soul into this album,\u201d shares Marty. \u201cIt\u2019s the album I\u2019ve always wanted to make\u2014one that ten years later I can still be proud of. Making it has made me feel whole, and brought me a lot of joy.\u201d", "otherInfo": "In support of The Caledonia, Liverpool.\nDonate now at: https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/savethecali"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rob Green ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10369168.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Nottingham,United Kingdom", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "ROB.GREEN is a truly rounded performer.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Justin Stanton (trumpet and keyboard player in Snarky Puppy) -\nHey everybody!

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "A Sweet Niche ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alex Taylor ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10367573.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Alternative, Acoustic, Loop Artist", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "UK based singer-songwriter and multi-instrumental loop pedal artist.\nAlready compared by reviewers to the likes of Bill Withers, John Martyn, Damien Rice, Jack Garrett, Sting and Jeff Buckley, Alex Taylor is one of the shining lights of the acoustic scene and a troubadour of world\u2010class standing.

'Deleter' is the new track from Grouplove and it is an emergency opener. It's fueled by pounding keys, squalling guitar lines, and lightning drumming before the voice of Christian Zucconi questions everything around him: faith systems, his sense of belonging, communities, his own psyche. \u201cAll this time I thought you were a leader/It turns out you're only a deleter.\u201dIt could be interpreted as a political statement, but it's also highly personal. \u201cAll this time been burning with a fever / It turns out I've always been my healer,\u201dis also switched in as a rhyming line, and in the end sees Zucconi and his collaborator, wife and frontwoman Hannah Hooper realizing that amid every progression and every regression you always come back to yourself for the answers. They're already within you.\n\nToday in a cafe in their LA neighborhood of Silver Lake,the pair sit down as two people who have experienced and borne witness to a great deal of change, trauma and growth in the past three years. You may associate the band as a beacon for positivity and optimism. They're still a five-piece \u2013albeit with a new drummer in Ben Homola \u2013and at their core, remain a vessel for looking at the glass half full. Hence their opening sentiment: a rallying cry for tearing down false idols and building anew.\n\nAfter the band completed touring their 2016 album Big Mess, it all got tumultuous. Back in LA, Hannah had committed to taking some personal time to pursue an art show of her paintings. Just before theshow and before the band started writing again, they lost a dear friend. As Hannah painted,she felt connected to him, and was consumed by thoughts of death and the afterlife. All the while the left side of her body had started to feel out of her possession. \u201cIt felt like I was having a slow stroke,\u201d she recalls. She got an MRI to be safe. The day she finished painting the show, the results came through. The news was bad \u2013she needed brain surgery. \u201cWhat the fuck?! I just went white.\u201d\n\nWith Hannah's shocking news and the world outside feeling like it was in constant crisis, making music became the greatest remedy for the band and they started to write. They wrote more than they've ever written. Decamping to Northern California they worked in a way they never had before, experiencing a collective catharsis.\n\nThey made very aggressive grunge. \u201cIt felt good to scream,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cWe write music as a way to deal with good times or bad.\u201d The shows, the songsandthe writing took Hannah out of a state of constant freak-out. It didn\u2019t only help heal Hannah, but also helped heal Christian, who wasn't just a Buddha-like figure for Hannah and their young daughter but,was helping keep the band in productive spirits too.\n\nIn October 2018, the band \u2013 including Homola, guitarist Andrew Wessen and bassist Daniel Gleason \u2013 traveled to El Paso, Texas with esteemed producer Dave Sitek [of TV On The Radio] for a month. This was a shift for the band, who had previously worked almost entirely in house with founding member and former drummer/producer Ryan Rabin. Rabin left amicably prior to the band beginning work on this album. Sitek had heard 'Deleter' and loved it but he wanted to work with the band to veer away from their previous grunge-leanings. He wanted to take them outside the box and stretch them beyond what they had ever had to deal with. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d says Hannah. \u201cIt's like playing a sport with a new teammate. We just became better.\u201d\n\nWorking in Texas was a headtrip. \u201cWe had never recorded in a place where time did not exist, because it doesn\u2019t exist at Sonic Ranch if you don\u2019t want it to. We watched the sun rise every singleday, I had lost the concept of time,\u201d Andrewadds. Ben felt the same and helped set the scene in Texas: \u201cWe never missed a sunrise, listening back with the studio doors wide open, sitting around a tired fire surrounded by miles and miles of pecan trees. Hannah and I laughed uncontrollably, couldn\u2019t even produce words, couldn\u2019t stop crying -Were we happy or losing our minds? Haha I\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\nNot only did they learn new tricks, but Sitek encouraged them both to simplify their sound and to extend it. The songs they made during this period are so ambitious, that it pushed them to become a seven-piece band ontour. The limitations were gone. They were away from the world, immersed and unplugged in the middle of nowhere. They were also half a mile from the border and during the height of Trump's family separations crisis.\n\nBeing close to that inspired the song 'Promises.' \u201cNothing disappoints me like the news,\u201dsings Christian, taking into consideration his own experience as a father. \u201cYou're just following orders, closing your eyes and telling lies while they're taking our daughters.\u201d The track sounds like a paranoid futuristic Western.\n\n\u2018Youth\u2019 is an anthem reminding people never to forget their inner child. \u201cWhen we finished Youth a group of us drove to El Paso and went grocery shopping, bought fireworks, went to a guitar shop and stopped at a food stand. We had been up for 2 days. We looked insane, we felt insane & and it was insane. But I\u2019ll never forget how the song felt as we sped down the highway, Dave driving 150 mph, all of us just crammed in. I can literally picture it perfectly because I was so fucking proud of the song and couldn\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t exist 1/2 day before,\u201d Andrew recalls.\n\nSongs like \u2018Expectations\u2019 and \u2018Places\u2019speak to the more internal and personal friction many of us feel these days. \u2018Places\u2019line, \u201cthere\u2019s a place we\u2019re all running from, and we don\u2019t know how to get there,\u201d is Christian examining his experience in a constantly evolving world.\n\nWhen the band got back to LA, they got in the studio with a second producer \u2013Malay, famed for working with Frank Ocean and Lorde. They found themselves more prolific than ever, in an easier mode of creativity. Songs like \u2018Inside Out\u2019 were written and recorded in just a couple of days. Hannah remarks that the song reminds us that life is more beautiful the more honestlywe live it.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to collaborate with brilliant musical minds whose only agenda was to make honest and exciting music. It\u2019s what you hope for. Malay is the perfect example of someone who creates from his inner music fan,\u201d Dan recalls.\n\nHannah has always been the visual force for all of Grouplove\u2019s art, and in June 2019, she was given the opportunity to showcase her own paintings at the legendary artist Shepard Fairey\u2019s gallery. Now, post-surgery, she\u2019s still recovering. Butshe sees it as a gift; a way to connect with others.\n\nIt's been almost ten years since Grouplove met on a commune in Greece and brought the idea of themselves being a band back to California. They'd never have anticipated making it this far. Healer represents a re-birth and one that almost comes full circle to their initial idealism. \u201cWhen we all met in Greece, Christian and I were leaving New York at an all-time low. We just wanted to have a fun summer. We wanted to make art. And we're still doing that. We found that feeling again on this album, of hopelessness put into a medium of expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis album is us fighting for that feeling,\u201d says Hannah.\u201cThere's a darkness that's real and everyone deals with it at a certain point in their life. We\u2019re addressing that life is hard.We understand and we are going through it with you.\u201d\n\nGrouplove is: Hannah Hooper, Christian Zucconi, Andrew Wessen, Daniel Gleason, Benjamin Homola", "otherInfo": "Instagram Live & Chat"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Dears ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10278828.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Indie Rock, Alternative, Art Rock, Prog-rock", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Dears, a critically acclaimed \u201corchestral-pop-noir-romantique\u201d rock'n'roll band from Montre?al, is shaped equally by nineties rock and a broad tableau of gospel, soul, and pop music.\n\nThe band formed in 1995 and released their first album, End of a Hollywood Bedtime Story, in 2000.

On the musician\u2019s second solo album, Devour, Hause scours the foundation of that crumbled dream in an attempt to discover how everything we believed growing up could have turned out so differently. The album, initially written to become the third record from Hause\u2019s rock band The Loved Ones, follows his 2011 solo debut Resolutions, a disc that allowed the musician to understand his potential as his own artist.\n\nAs Hause, a Philadelphia native, began penning new music for a new album from The Loved Ones, it became clear that the group, who had taken a break after their second album, had stalled. These songs, however, which showcased a clear thematic journey, were meant to be vocalized by Hause and over the past few years he transformed them into Devour. Hause solidified the album\u2019s sequence before even going into the studio, aiming to craft a narrative arc that drove the album from its dark, heavy first half into a lighter, more hopeful tone. A thematic line of melody runs through the songs, reflecting the overarching ideas in the music itself. The disc explores the heartbreak of shattered childhood promises of a better world and concludes with optimistic hope.\n\n\u201cDevour is about that inherent American appetite,\u201d Hause says. \u201cIt\u2019s in all the songs in some degree. There\u2019s a reason why Tony Soprano became such a huge American icon \u2013 he\u2019s this guy with this insane appetite for women and food and power. I think for the American public to latch onto a figure like that says something. Some of the positive things about America come from that as well, but there\u2019s a real sense of reckoning that comes from devouring everything in front of you. Is it ever enough?\u201d\n\nThe rock songs, tinged with folk and punk tones, are firmly rooted in Hause\u2019s own upbringing and the sensibility that comes from growing up in a blue collar neighborhood driven by the lingering anticipation of upward mobility. In the lyrics, the fulcrum around which the album revolves, Hause grapples with this working class ideal and the fact that America\u2019s recent shifts have caused it to no longer fit. From \u201cThe Great Depression,\u201d which centers on the unfulfilled promises laid out in the Reagan-era \u201880s, to the more specific-minded relationships of \u201cFather\u2019s Son,\u201d Devour comes to terms with the loss of youthful innocence in a rapidly evolving world.\n\n\u201cI wanted to shine a light back on what was going on,\u201d Hause says. \u201cIt was a topic that was close to me and I wanted to write about it. In the end, it leaves you with the idea that if you have music and love you may be able to save yourself. It\u2019s going to be alright. That simple John Lennon concept of all you need is love. That\u2019s how I wrote myself out of the dark and the music begs the listener to come take that risk as well.\u201d\n\nOnce Hause had the track sequence and overall narrative in place he enlisted producer Andrew Alekel along with musician and co-producer Mitchell Townsend. The producers helped Hause collect the right musicians to build the songs in the best way possible, including My Morning Jacket keyboardist Bo Koster, Social Distortion drummer David Hidalgo Jr. and bassist Bob Thomson. Frightened Rabbit\u2019s Scott Hutchison, Alkaline Trio\u2019s Matt Skiba and The Watson Twins also appear on several tracks. Hause and his crew recorded the album over several weeks from mid-February to mid-March at Grandmaster Recorders LTD. in Hollywood, CA, focusing on giving each song the right tone while maintaining an overall musical aesthetic that helps tie the lyrical themes together.\n\n\u201cIt was this group effort,\u201d Hause says. \u201cA lot of trust went into letting Andrew and Mitch be the architects of the record. I trusted that we would get in there and they would know who was right for the music. They wanted to bring these people together in this great studio to get a record that was greater than the sum of its parts. I\u2019m glad I trusted them because it was great to work with everyone there.\u201d\n\nFor the musician, who has toured with Social Distortion, The Gaslight Anthem, Bouncing Souls and Chuck Ragan since launching his solo career, Devour is a cathartic release, both sonically and lyrically. Hause recently relocated to California and is committed to pursing the music he feels best reflects him individually. The journey on the album, the search for the light at the end of the tunnel, mirrors his own trek. The record closes with the delicate introspection of \u201cBenediction,\u201d a song that pulls lyrical lines from all the tracks that precede it. After all the ruined promises and the culminating disappointments of the world, Hause ends the album with the sentiment of possibility. \u201cIt's love my friend in the end that can save us tonight,\u201d he sings. \u201cSo are you in?\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Houston Bernard Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10353012.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Country & Southern Rock, Country, Country And Original Material", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Houston Bernard may reside in the city, but his country roots run deep.

After making her Grand Ole Opry debut at the age of 10, the Tennessee-bred virtuoso mandolinist played Carnegie Hall at age 12, then landed a deal with Rounder Records just a year later. Now 28-years-old, Hull is set to deliver her fourth full-length for Rounder: an elegantly inventive and endlessly captivating album called 25 Trips.\n\nRevealing her profound warmth as a storyteller, 25 Trips finds Hull shedding light on the beauty and chaos and sometimes sorrow of growing up and getting older. To that end, the album\u2019s title nods to a particularly momentous year of her life, including her marriage to fellow bluegrass musician Justin Moses and the release of her widely acclaimed album Weighted Mind\u2014a B\u00e9la Fleck-produced effort nominated for Best Folk Album at the 2017 Grammy Awards.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of push-and-pull on this record, where in some moments I feel like everything\u2019s happening so fast and I wish I could slow it all down so I can really enjoy it,\u201d Hull points out. \u201cBut then there are also times where I\u2019m looking forward to the day when the craziness has died down a bit, and life\u2019s a little calmer.\u201d\n\nMade with producer/engineer Shani Gandhi (Kelsea Ballerini, Dierks Bentley, Sarah Jarosz, Alison Krauss), 25 Trips continues the musical journey begun on Weighted Mind, a body of work that built off Hull\u2019s bluegrass roots and ventured into entirely new terrain. But while its predecessor assumed a sparse and stripped-back palette, 25 Trips embodies a far more intricately arranged sound\u2014an effect achieved with the help of peers like guitarist Mike Seal, bassist Ethan Jodziewicz, violinist Alex Hargreaves, and fiddler Christian Sedelmyer, as well as several musicians that Hull has long admired (including bassist Viktor Krauss, guitarist Bryan Sutton, and multi-instrumentalist Stuart Duncan). Along with integrating electric instrumentation and percussion into her material for the first time, Hull dreamed up the album\u2019s eclectic textures by embracing a free-flowing process that often gave way to lightning-in-a-bottle improvisation.\n\n\u201cThere were some songs that we created from the ground up, where I\u2019d go in and play by myself, and from there we\u2019d bring in other musicians to add more and more layers,\u201d Hull says. \u201cIt was really wonderful to work that way, where we started from a place of mystery and then just let the song show us what it wanted or needed to become.\u201d\n\nImmediately proving the power of that approach, 25 Trips lures the listener into its unpredictable sonic world on the beguiling opening track \u201cBeautifully Out of Place.\u201d With its shifting tempos and gently tempestuous mood, the song was sparked from words of encouragement spoken by Hull\u2019s husband at a time of self-doubt and confusion. \u201cI remember Justin saying to me, \u2018I believe in you, so you\u2019re just going to have to learn to believe in yourself,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThat inspired the first line for me, and the song just wrote itself from there.\u201d\n\nAlthough much of the album bears a rich complexity, 25 Trips also includes moments of stark simplicity that perfectly showcase Hull\u2019s stunning vocal range. On \u201cEverybody\u2019s Talking,\u201d for instance, her luminous vocals quietly capture the frustration of finding clarity in the midst of constant chatter from the outside world. And on \u201cCeiling to the Floor\u201d\u2014co-written with Kai Welch, a songwriter/musician known for his work with Glen Campbell and Abigail Washburn\u2014Hull spins a tender metaphor from her longtime fear of heights. \u201cI was telling Kai about how when I was little my dad used to try to get me over that fear by holding me up to the ceiling and saying, \u2018Just touch it\u2014I\u2019m not gonna let you fall,\u2019\u201d she explains. Featuring a performance from legendary steel-guitar player Paul Franklin, \u201cCeiling to the Floor\u201d drifts from memory to real-time reflection, slowly unfolding as a nuanced meditation on courage and love.\n\nOne of the most unexpected turns on 25 Trips, \u201cEscape\u201d emerges as a delicate collage of hypnotic percussion, otherworldly electric-mandolin tones, and poetic yet plainspoken lyrics (e.g., \u201cI want to escape to a world that\u2019s not closing in\u201d). \u201cI didn\u2019t even have that song on my list for the album, but I played Shani a voice memo and right away she said, \u2018I wanna record that,\u2019\u201d remembers Hull, who penned \u201cEscape\u201d with singer/songwriter Angel Snow. \u201cI was a little hesitant since it\u2019s so unlike anything else I\u2019ve done, but in the end it was really exciting to play electric and come up with something in a completely different vein.\u201d\n\nIn closing out 25 Trips, Hull shares an especially poignant track titled \u201cFather Time.\u201d \u201cI wrote that song with Mindy Smith after spending a week with my husband and his grandma, after his grandpa had a stroke on Christmas morning,\u201d she says. \u201cHis grandma had suffered with Alzheimer\u2019s for years and couldn\u2019t really stay by herself, and through that experience I decided to write about watching my husband take such good care of her, and how that made me love him even more.\u201d With its heavy-hearted melody and choir-like harmonies, \u201cFather Time\u201d shows Hull\u2019s effortless finesse in embedding her music with so many subtle details (including an instrumental reference to \u201cJingle Bells\u201d tucked into the second verse). \u201cWe had our instruments with us at Christmas, so at some point we played \u2018Jingle Bells\u2019 for my husband\u2019s grandma,\u201d says Hull. \u201cShe can\u2019t remember my name or Justin\u2019s name now, but for some reason \u2018Jingle Bells\u2019 stuck, and she still asks for it year-round\u2014it\u2019s the most amazing thing.\u201d\n\nEven as its songs continually shift in genre, encompassing everything from bluegrass to folk-pop to ethereal alt-rock, 25 Trips remains rooted in the sophisticated musicianship that Hull has cultivated almost her entire life. Hailing from the tiny Tennessee hamlet of Byrdstown, she learned to sing from her mother as toddler, took up mandolin just a few years later, and began joining in local bluegrass jams by the young age of eight. With her childhood triumphs including joining her hero and mentor Alison Krauss onstage at the Grand Ole Opry at age 11, she made her Rounder debut with the 2008 album Secrets and promptly garnered the first of many nominations for Mandolin Player of the Year at the International Bluegrass Music Association Awards. In 2016, after a near-decade of consecutive nominations, Hull became the first-ever woman to win the award\u2014then claimed that prize again at the 2017 and 2018 IBMAs. Over the years, Hull has also maintained a rigorous touring schedule, and has made occasional guest appearances with such icons as the Indigo Girls, Garth Brooks, and Gillian Welch.\n\nMarking a bold new era in Hull\u2019s artistic evolution, 25 Trips wholly channels the pure and palpable joy she discovered in the album\u2019s creation\u2014and ultimately illuminates certain truths about the indelible connection between risk-taking and reward. \u201cOne of the things I most enjoyed about making this record was getting to show the wide variety of music I love,\u201d says Hull. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what category the album falls in, but I also think that matters less and less. What really matters to me is trusting myself to be who I am, and just putting my voice and my heart out there in the most sincere way that I possibly can.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Watch Sierra Hull (https://youtu.be/0onWLT1Z8nc) in her 2018 Woods Stage performance for Pickathon #AConcertADay!

Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music -

It is Nitze's journey through our world. And the sound originates from the stillness of our apartments at night. Our home.\nQuestioned about his musical roots and influences, Nitze replies: \"I grew up listening to \"This Mortal Coil\". David Sylvian's songs have always been a part of my life to the present day. Robert Smith was like my \"guitar teacher\". I think \"A Forest\" was the first piece I played on the guitar. For me Ivo Watts Russell is one of the greatest innovators in the music industry. And in my view these archetypal albums were all created under his direction. In other words what we today call 4AD. The Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, Dead can Dance, Clan of Xymox... These are albums that aren't hyped much but everyone knows them. If they hadn't existed, the music world would have been a much poorer place. I'm especially thinking of albums like \"Sleep With The Fishes\". This influenced me a great deal.\nOn \"almost forgotten tales\" Nitze sets three poems by Dylan Thomas to music; he explains why: \"It is the sense of the absurd in his writing. His writing is a true source of inspiration to me. Jon Cale was the one who first introduced me to Thomas. I devoured everything he wrote. \"Being But Men\" is all about how simple it is to feel happiness. Something that we knew all about as children. It's so simple... but we've forgotten how to do it.

With continued support from NPR, BBC, countless music bloggers, as well as support from Nashville notables like Margo Price, what might have been a blip on the indie radar has proven to be a career-shaping record with life left in it, even a year later.\n\nWith her first UK tour under her belt, and another single (\u201cPlaying Old Games\u201d feat.

They were originally called The Guildford Stranglers and operated from an off-licence in the town. They also based themselves in the nearby village of Chiddingfold for a while.\n\nOriginal personnel were singer/guitarist Hugh Cornwell (from kentish town, london), keyboardist/guitarist Hans Warmling (from Sweden, replaced within two years by brighton-born keyboardist Dave Greenfield), london-born bass guitarist Jean-Jacques Burnel and drummer Jet Black (a.k.a. Brian Duffy), a native of ilford, essex.\n\nThey began as a sinister sounding, hard-edged pub rock group, but eventually branched out to explore other styles of music. The Stranglers were, beginning in 1976, tangentially associated with punk rock, due in part to their opening for Ramones' first British tour. The Stranglers were also associated with new wave music as well as gothic rock, but their idiosyncratic approach never fit completely within a musical genre.\n\nIn August 1990, founding member Cornwell left the band to pursue a solo career. In his autobiography, Cornwell states that he felt the band was a spent force creatively, and cited various examples of his increasingly acrimonious relationship with his fellow band-members, particularly Burnel. The remaining members recruited two replacements, including John Ellis, who had opened for the band in the 1970s as a member of The Vibrators, and singer Paul Roberts.\n\nInterest in The Stranglers resurfaced when, in 2001, singer Tori Amos covered their song \"Strange Little Girl\" and titled the album it was featured on Strange Little Girls. \"Golden Brown\" was also used in the hit film Snatch by film director Guy Ritchie and extensively in the Australian film He Died With A Felafel In His Hand. Their hit \"No More Heroes\" was covered by Violent Femmes and used for the film Mystery Men. \"Peaches\", finally, also appears prominently in another British movie, Sexy Beast by director Jonathan Glazer.\n\nThe Stranglers had a critical and popular renaissance in 2004 (together with their first top 40 hit for 14 years - \"Big Thing Coming\") with the acclaimed Norfolk Coast album and a subsequent sell-out tour. The follow-up album, Suite XVI, was released in September 2006 (the title is a pun on \"Sweet 16\" and also a reference to the fact that it is the band's 16th studio album).", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kysia Live ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10368461.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Mon May 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-11", "Genre": "Motown, R&b, Soul, Neo Soul", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Motown's Blue-Eyed Soul Child now in Chicago and captivating ears everywhere", "otherInfo": "Matt Kysia hosts a live stream morning show that features live performances, special guest interviews and more.

It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label. Two Tomatoes moved into a real office in New York City, with real staff including Shannon Chirone, John Waldman (Great Knight Productions), Corinne Barlow, Katie Messer, Michelle Puskas, Justice Longshore, and publicist Elizabeth Waldman Frazier.\n\nIt's one big happy family!", "otherInfo": "Laurie Berkner is doing daily Facebook lives during the COVID-19 school and community closures.

Her songs are slow-release works of craft and catharsis that become treasured, lifetime companions for their listeners. As a storyteller, Colvin is both keen and warm-hearted, leavening even the toughest tales with tenderness, empathy, and a searing sense of humor. In the nearly 30 years since the release of her debut album, Colvin has won three GRAMMY Awards, released twelve albums, written a critically acclaimed memoir, maintained a non-stop national and international touring schedule, appeared on countless television and radio programs, had her songs featured in major motion pictures and created a remarkable canon of work.\n\nColvin was born in Vermillion, South Dakota, where she lived until she was eight. A small-town childhood in the university town of Carbondale, IL. drew her to the guitar by the age of 10. She made her first public appearance on campus at the University of Illinois at age 15. By the late 1970\u2019s Colvin was singing in a Western Swing band in Austin, Texas\u2014the city she now calls home. Moving to New York at the decade\u2019s end she remained in the country music field as a member of the Buddy Miller Band where she met producer, guitarist and co-writer John Leventhal. Leventhal inspired Colvin to find her own voice as a songwriter. She began honing her skill and was soon signed to Columbia Records. Her first album, Steady On, produced by Leventhal, won the GRAMMY Award for Best Contemporary Folk Recording.\n\nColvin continued to win fans and critics with her subsequent releases, Fat City (1992) and Cover Girl (1994). In 1996, she released A Few Small Repairs (1996), which would prove to be her breakthrough. The song \u201cSunny Came Home\u201d gave Colvin a Top 10 hit, a platinum-selling album and two of GRAMMY\u2019s biggest honors: Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\nHoliday Songs And Lullabies (1998), recorded while Colvin was eight months pregnant with her daughter Caledonia, followed. Her next studio album, Whole New You (2001) found Colvin examining new motherhood and the responsibilities of family. These Four Walls (2006) was lauded by People Magazine as \u201cthe most self-assured album of her career\u201d and \u201cone for the ages\u201d by the Washington Post. The Austin-American Statesman called it \u201can exquisite portrait of strength and vulnerability.\u201d\n\nShawn Colvin Live (2009), was recorded during a special three-night engagement at San Francisco\u2019s famous jazz club, Yoshi\u2019s. Live captures the beauty and intimacy of Colvin\u2019s performances, showcasing her inimitable voice and matchless guitar stylings. Praised by both critics and fans, the album was honored with a GRAMMY Award nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Recording.\n\nAll Fall Down (2012) was produced by Colvin\u2019s longtime friend and musical cohort Buddy Miller (Patty Griffin, Robert Plant, Lucinda Williams). Recorded in Nashville with a group of stellar musicians, the album features performances by Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Jakob Dylan, Bill Frisell, Viktor Krauss, Brian Blade, Stuart Duncan and Julie Miller.\n\nThe release of All Fall Down was simultaneous with that of her William Morrow/Harper Collins\u2013published memoir, Diamond In The Rough. Diamond in the Rough looks back over a rich lifetime of highs and lows with stunning insight and candor. Through its pages we witness the inspiring story of a woman honing her artistry, finding her voice, and making herself whole.\n\nUncovered (2015) is the long-awaited follow up to fan-favorite Cover Girl. Its twelve tunes include masterful interpretations of songs by Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon, Tom Waits, Stevie Wonder, Robbie Robertson and Graham Nash \u2013 and more - but in their selection and delivery they are pure Shawn Colvin.\n\nIn June 2016, Shawn Colvin and longtime friend Steve Earle united to release, Colvin & Earle, their acclaimed self-titled duo album. Produced by Buddy Miller, Colvin & Earle beautifully captures the pair\u2019s extraordinary chemistry and is a true standout in careers already filled with pinnacles and masterpieces. The album received high praise from critics \u2013 NPR asserted that the duo \u201cElevated their collaboration to the level of top-flight album-making, bringing seemingly opposing impulses to the process.\u201d\n\nColvin was recognized for her career accomplishments when she was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Trailblazer Award at the 2016 Americana Honors and Awards Show. Presenting her with this prestigious award was Bonnie Raitt. Said Raitt, \u201cShe\u2019s simply one of the best singers I\u2019ve ever heard \u2014 and a truly gifted and deep songwriter and guitarist\u2026 She was groundbreaking when she emerged and continues to inspire me and the legions of fans and other singer/songwriters coming up in her wake\u201d\n\nTo mark the 20th anniversary of A Few Small Repairs, Columbia/Legacy issued a newly-expanded edition of the album. This special edition includes seven rare live performances culled from the Sony Music archives, plus enhanced artwork including newly-written liner notes by Shawn and producer John Leventhal and recently discovered archival photos.\n\nShawn Colvin\u2019s latest release is The Starlighter (Amazon Music), a new album of songs adapted from the children's music book \"Lullabies and Night Songs.\" The Starlighters\u2019s 14 songs are a mix of traditional numbers and children's standards, an elegant and graceful musical offering that resonates with the warmth and tenderness of poignant familial experience and remembrance. The result is an album that captures the magic and mystery of children's lullabies in a moving and timeless musical offering.", "otherInfo": "My alter ego, Sunny, suggested I start doing a little weekly series and call it \u201cSunny Stays Home\u201d, for obvious reasons.

The blistering guitarist, soulful vocalist, singular songwriter and city bus driver fuses his muscular, rock-inspired blues guitar playing with his original, keenly detailed slice-of-life songs, blazing his own blues trail. With the 2016 release of his Alligator Records debut, The Chicago Way, Cannon burst onto the international stage as one the most electrifying bluesmen to emerge from Chicago in decades. His live performances unfailingly earn him heaps of critical praise and hordes of wildly enthusiastic fans. Cannon has played major cities all over the U.S., Canada, and Europe. He recently performed for the first time in Japan, delighting and surprising audiences with one unforgettable gig after another. Now, with the release of The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Cannon builds upon the foundation he\u2019s laid, creating and defining his vision of contemporary blues.\n\nThe Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp features twelve Cannon originals, ranging from the burning social commentary of the title track to the wryly told, up-to-the-minute truths of Insurance to the trademark Cannon humor of Stop Me When I\u2019m Lying and Ordinary Woman. He gets serious on the haunting The First 24, the Martin Luther King-inspired The Silence Of My Friends and on the moving final track, I\u2019m Not Scared. Cannon\u2019s blazing guitar and soul-baring vocals are front and center. His songwriting is inspired by his deep Chicago roots, the wisdom of his grandparents and his years of observing the public while driving a bus. His songs tell timeless stories of common experiences in uncommon ways.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the solos,\u201d Cannon says, \u201cIt\u2019s about the songs. People get used to everyday life, so it\u2019s easy to miss the things around them. I write about those things. I know the problems of Chicago, the hardship, 'cause we\u2019re always a scapegoat. But I choose to love and respect the city because of the Chicago blues giants that came here from down south. I\u2019m proud to be standing on the shoulders of every great Chicago blues musician who came before me.\u201d\n\nToronzo Cannon was born in the Windy City on February 14, 1968, and grew up in the shadows of the notoriously tough Robert Taylor Homes. Theresa\u2019s Lounge, one of the city\u2019s most famous South Side blues clubs, was nearby. As a child, Cannon would stand on the sidewalk outside the door, soaking up the live blues pouring out while trying to sneak a glance inside at larger-than-life bluesmen like Junior Wells and Buddy Guy. He also heard plenty of blues growing up in his grandfather\u2019s home, and listened to soul, R&B and contemporary rock on the radio.\n\nCannon bought his first guitar at age 22, and his natural talent enabled him to quickly master the instrument. Although his initial focus was reggae, he found himself increasingly drawn to the blues. \u201cIt was dormant in me. But when I started playing the blues, I found my voice and the blues came pouring out.\u201d He absorbed sounds, styles and licks from Buddy Guy, Albert Collins, Hound Dog Taylor, B.B. King, Albert King, Freddie King, Jimi Hendrix, J.B. Hutto, Lil\u2019 Ed and others. Although influenced by many, Cannon\u2019s biting, stinging guitar sound is all his own.\n\nCannon began his rise in the intensely competitive proving ground of the local club scene, where only the best musicians reach the top. Iconic blues artists from Muddy Waters to Howlin\u2019 Wolf to Koko Taylor to Hound Dog Taylor to Luther Allison all paid their dues in the Chicago blues bars before making their mark on the world. The same holds true today, as newcomers look to living legends like Buddy Guy, Jimmy Johnson and Lil\u2019 Ed Williams for inspiration in taking their music from Chicago to fans across the globe.\n\nFrom 1996 through 2002, Cannon played as a sideman for Tommy McCracken, Wayne Baker Brooks, L.V. Banks and Joanna Connor. But he was determined to prove himself. In 2001, while continuing to work as a hired-gun guitarist, he formed his own band, The Cannonball Express. By 2003, he was working exclusively as a band leader. Cannon\u2019s first three albums\u20142007\u2019s My Woman (self-released), 2011\u2019s Leaving Mood (Delmark) and 2013\u2019s Blues Music Award-nominated John The Conqueror Root (Delmark)\u2014document his rise from promising up-and-comer to star-in-the-making.\n\nAlmost immediately upon the release of The Chicago Way, Chicago media helped launch Cannon toward blues stardom. He was the subject of multiple newspaper and magazine feature stories and appeared on every local television station. National and international media soon took notice. CNN filmed Cannon leading a tour of Chicago blues clubs and then broadcast the piece around the world. England\u2019s MOJO magazine declared The Chicago Way the #1 Blues Album Of 2016, as did the readers of Living Blues magazine in their annual poll. The album and Cannon were also nominated for four Blues Music Awards (the Grammy of the blues) in 2017. And the world champion Chicago Cubs invited Cannon to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of the September 13, 2017 game. All the attention only makes Cannon more focused. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve become an ambassador for Chicago blues. People expect a lot from me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s good, because I\u2019m forced to keep upping my game.\u201d\n\nCannon has played the Chicago Blues Festival on ten separate occasions, initially as a sideman, then as a special guest, a sidestage band leader and finally as a main stage headliner. When he\u2019s home, he drives a Chicago Transit Authority bus by day and performs by night. Using every vacation day and day off and working four ten-hour shifts a week, Cannon arranges his schedule to gig out of town as much as possible. It isn\u2019t easy, but, like all of the Chicago greats who have come before him, blues is his calling. Blues Music Magazine declares, \u201cHis guitar playing has all the fire and spontaneity of the Chicago legends he carries; his songwriting is a timely and original look at the world he sees by day on a bus and in blues clubs by night, and his assertive voice is the perfect vehicle to deliver the message.\u201d\n\nNow, with The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Toronzo Cannon delivers his messages loud and clear. Between his searing chops, soul-satisfying vocals and vibrant and distinctive original songs, Cannon has grown from being a local attraction to become a world-renowned torch bearer for the blues. PBS Television\u2019s Chicago Tonight sums it up like this: \u201cCannon is just your typical CTA bus driver who moonlights as a sought-after Chicago blues musician. As a guitarist, singer and songwriter, he drives the sound of Chicago blues from the city to blues clubs and festivals around the world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "\u25aa\ufe0fABOUT THE SERIES\n\"All Dressed Up & Nowhere to Show\" is a virtual concert series presented by SPACE.

Charming. Unstoppable. America first became acquainted with the Country music trio Restless Road while watching Season 3 of The X Factor USA and these are just some of the words that immediately came to their minds. The breakout act didn\u2019t just leave a lasting impression on audiences, but also mesmerized the show\u2019s judges including Simon Cowell and Kelly Rowland. \"X Factor\" of course refers to that undefinable and innate \"something\" that a star simply embodies. And fans and tastemakers recognize that Restless Road has got it times three. Zach Beeken (22), Garrett Nichols (21) and Jared Keim (24) each bring their own \u201cAll- American\u201d experience to a transformed Restless Road. Evident in their self-taught musical skills, these three guys do share one important thing in common above all else: determination. Zach\u2019s very first job was pollinating corn on a farm in Iowa where he discovered his love for Country music and taught himself how to sing. Garrett on the other hand, grew up in Alabama and was involved in everything from school musicals to baseball. One day at age 12 though, he picked up an acoustic guitar and never looked back. Also at a young age, Jared\u2019s community watched in awe as he performed on stage at his local church in Missouri; he found his calling before he could tie his own shoes. Into his teens, Jared trained himself on the guitar, piano and drums. \u201cGetting together to write or record is great because we all grew up with the same hard- working attitude and approach our music in the same way together,\u201d says Zach. It\u2019s this dedication and positive outlook that\u2019s responsible for so much of the group\u2019s success. One of Restless Road\u2019s biggest accomplishments to date is landing at #1 on the iTunes Country Chart. With a Country spin, the group covered one of the most popular songs of 2013, Avicii\u2019s \u201cWake Me Up,\u201d and quickly realized that they had a growing and passionate fan base to satisfy. One of these fans was legendary music manager Johnny Wright. Wright has helped launch Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC and Jonas Brothers (to name a few), so he thoroughly understands what it takes for a group of guys to be successful and began working with Restless Road in 2014. With Wright\u2019s ear for talent and Restless Road\u2019s capability, this Country \u201cman band\u201d (as they refer to themselves) was ready to show the world what they could do and took their live show on the road in 2015. The group has since toured nationwide, secured a coveted performance slot during NASCAR\u2019s AAA Texas 500 Weekend at Texas Motor Speedway in Ft. Worth, brought down the house at Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Draper James fashion line launch party, opened up for songstress Demi Lovato and contributed their talents to an annual Country Music Hall of Fame fundraiser event. Jared sums it up well by explaining, \u201cWe\u2019re three guys who have something to prove. We love what we're doing, we're real and we're going to carve out a place in music history for ourselves.\u201d 3 guys who love singing country music.

Namely, the former still leaves the guy just enough wiggle room to happily say \u201cyes\u201d when legends (and friends) on the level of Ray Wylie Hubbard or the Flatlanders need a can-do guitar man for a sold-out theater engagement. Or, say, when fellow A-list Austin sideman \u201cScrappy\u201d Jud Newcomb \u2014 the MVP co-producer of Sleeping Dogs \u2014 finds out he can\u2019t make it to a very special Johnny Nicholas gig in Hawaii, and asks \u201cPlank\u201d if he\u2019d be up for subbing for him. Who in their right mind is going to say no to that?\n\nPlankenhorn still selectively takes those kinds of calls not because he gets them, but because he\u2019s earned them. For the better part of the last 17 years, ever since he first moved to Texas with nothing to his name but a Geo Prism, $100, seven guitars and the generous hospitality of Ray and Judy Hubbard, the gifted multi-instrumentalist from Columbus, Ohio has busted ass to prove himself not just able and willing, but above all worthy of playing with the best of the best. And the reason so many song poets like Hubbard and Joe Ely like having Plank at their side is not just because of his prodigious chops on all things stringed (especially those played with a slide), but because of his intuitive knack for knowing when to hold back, always allowing the singer room to land a lyric and go for the proverbial kill. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the skill set I learned very early on: \u2018When in doubt, layout,\u2019\u201d Plankenhorn explains with a chuckle. \u201cThat joke about knowing when not to play? It's true.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, that particular skill \u2014 along with myriad other lessons in the finer points of songcraft that he\u2019s picked up from sharing stages with the masters \u2014 has come to greatly inform Plankenhorn\u2019s own music over the years. But it\u2019s never been more apparent than it is on Sleeping Dogs. Make no mistake: Plank plays a lot of guitar on the album, along with pedal steel, piano, upright bass and seemingly anything else he could lay his hands on during the sessions at the Zone recording studio just outside of Austin. But in stark contrast to SoulSlide, which by his own admission was by design a showcase for his custom-designed lap slide guitar, a patented \u201cFrankenstein\u201d beauty he calls \u201cthe Plank,\u201d Sleeping Dogs is first and foremost all about the songs.\n\n\u201cThe Plank guitar came from me wanting to mix together the two worlds of bluegrass dobro and the sacred steel tradition, and my whole last album was dedicated to that one instrument \u2014 to get it out there,\u201d he says. \u201cSoulSlide also really helped put me on the map as a solo artist, which is why I\u2019ve moved on to focusing more on doing my own thing and only doing a side gig once in a while when I really want to, with people that I really respect. But now, with Sleeping Dogs, I wanted to take a bigger look at how the whole world of music is available to me; it\u2019s not about just one guitar or sound, but rather about using all of the instruments I play and bringing all of my influences together \u2014 and about really wanting to bring my songwriting to the forefront.\u201d\n\nTo that end, there are no covers on the new album, but half of the songs were born out of co-writing sessions with a handful of his longtime friends including his co-producer (and bandmate in Austin\u2019s the Resentments) Newcomb, Gabriel Rhodes, Miles Zuniga, Jon Dee Graham, and of course Hubbard \u2014 the \u201cWylie Llama\u201d of Americana/Texas music, who Plankenhorn still credits as his personal gateway to the whole scene. \u201cPretty much everyone I\u2019ve ever played with is like, one degree of separation away from Ray,\u201d he marvels with a laugh. It was also Hubbard who set Plankenhorn straight years ago when he doubted his own merits as a songwriter.\n\n\u201cI had just started out playing some of my own songs at these little acoustic gigs, but I remember telling him, \u2018Ray, I don't think I should be doing this \u2014 I\u2019m just a side guy.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Where\u2019s your proof? Are people coming to your shows? Are people listening to your songs? Yes? Well, there\u2019s your proof.\u2019\u201d\n\nNaturally, the song Plankenhorn and Hubbard cooked up together, a satisfyingly greasy howler called \u201cTooth and Nail,\u201d just happens to be all about the not-for-the-timid troubadour path and the discipline of songwriting, without so much as a grain of sugar to sweeten the pot. \u201cWe had already written a good portion of the song when he came back to me and said, \u2018It\u2019s like an old cat having kittens / You just crawl under the porch and do it,\u2019 which is a very Ray line,\u201d Plankenhorn says. \u201cBut what\u2019s cool is there were other lines where his wife, Judy, was like, \u2018Ray must have written that,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Ha, no, that was me!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the Hubbard-certified gnarled blues of \u201cTooth and Nail\u201d is just one of a handful of different styles Plankenhorn makes his own on Sleeping Dogs. Both the hurricane Harvey-inspired \u201cFurther to Fall\u201d (co-written with Rhodes) and the closing \u201cHeaven on Earth,\u201d Plankenhorn\u2019s awestruck tribute to his wife\u2019s transcendent love of nature, hit the same deep, soulful notes that defined his last album (with that trusty Plank guitar put to especially righteous use on the latter song). But there\u2019s also \u201cThis Guitar,\u201d a disarmingly folky, listening-room-ready paean to the workhorse acoustic Martin that\u2019s been his go-to writing guitar ever since it was anonymously gifted to him not long after he first moved to Texas. And perhaps most surprising of all (even to Plankenhorn himself), there\u2019s even a few free-spirited ventures into buoyantly catchy, unabashedly poppy rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\n\u201cI had already recorded a few rhythm tracks before this, but the day that Scrappy first came to the studio was also the day that Tom Petty died \u2014 and somehow, everything just kind of shifted that day,\u201d he says. \u201cNot on the entire album, but for a good portion of it, there were discussions of like, \u2018What would Mike Campbell do on this guitar part?\u2019 And out of that, some of the songs like \u2018Sleeping Dogs\u2019 and \u2018I Don't Know Anything\u2019 really changed and moved into more of a roots-rock thing. Which wasn\u2019t something I was expecting \u2014 I mean, it came out of nowhere \u2014 but I loved it.\u201d\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be the last happy surprise, either. The stately, hymn-like \u201cHoly Lightning,\u201d an arresting co-write with Newcomb and Zuniga (of Fastball fame), actually almost didn\u2019t make the final cut. \u201cI had started that one myself but just really wasn\u2019t digging it, so I took it to Miles and Scrappy in the studio, and between the three of us we completely reworked it from scratch over a couple of hours,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut even then I still wasn\u2019t entirely about it. But then Scrappy sent the demo to Patty Griffin, and she goes, \u2018I want to sing on this!\u2019 As soon as she said that, I was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m definitely putting it on the album now!\u2019\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, \u201cHoly Lightning\u201d is now one of his favorite songs on the record. Not that there\u2019s a single track that he\u2019s not proud of on Sleeping Dogs, which is a testament both to the positive experience he had recording it and the confidence he feels going forward into the next stage of his career. And should he even find himself second-guessing his conviction on that solo sojourn, well, he\u2019s already written his own anthem to sing his way through the doubt.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote \u2018Sleeping Dogs,\u2019 I got this image of sleeping dogs lying, and how I need to let shit go,\u201d he explains. \u201cI literally took a lot of things that I\u2019m really bad at or think I\u2019m really bad at, and told myself, \u2018If I sing this for a year or two on tour, it may make me better at these things; maybe I won\u2019t take stuff personally, won\u2019t let things get me down.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Maybe somebody else will hear this song and maybe it will help them, too.\u2019 And I really like that idea: I like the idea of writing songs that have a little moral imperative to them.\u201d\n\nSome would call that a sense of purpose. Or, as Hubbard put it best to Plankenhorn way back at the start of his journey, \u201cThere\u2019s your proof.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Code Orange ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10370124.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Hardcore", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "down we go... our new album \u2018U N D E R N E A T H\u2019 is out 3/13. pre-order/pre-save at https://codeorange.lnk.to/underneath. title track available to watch and stream everywhere now.", "otherInfo": "YOU AND YOU ALONE 004\nv i r t u a l p e r f o r m a n c e: joe + mudman in the\ncold.metal.place"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Song Suffragettes ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9288379.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "country music, female singer-songwriter night every Monday night at 6pm at The Listening Room Cafe", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Della Mae ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9701893.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Bluegrass, Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The follow-up to their Grammy-nominated 2013 album, \u2018This World Oft Can Be,\u2019 Della Mae\u2019s self-titled second release for Rounder finds the all-female combo delivering eleven compelling new tunes that embody the musical and emotional qualities of the group\u2019s prior output while venturing into uncharted creative territory.

Their big commercial breakthrough came with their fifth album \"Metallica\", also known as the Black Album. They've been a huge influence for plenty of new metal bands.\n\nOn October 28th 1981, drummer Lars Ulrich made guitarist/vocalist James Hetfield an offer he couldn't refuse: \"I\u2019ve got a track saved for my band on Brian Slagel's new Metal Blade label.\"\n\nIn fact, Lars didn't have a band at that time, but he did when James joined him. The two recorded their first track on a cheap recorder with James performing singing, rhythm guitar and bass guitar duties. Lars dutifully pounded the drums, helped with musical arrangements and acted as manager. Hetfield's friend and housemate Ron McGovney was eventually talked into taking up bass and Dave Mustaine took lead guitar.\n\nThe band adopted the name Metallica after a suggestion from Bay Area friend Ron Quintana, and they quickly began gigging in the Los Angeles area opening for bands like Saxon. Eventually recording a fully-fledged demo called No Life Til Leather, Metallica quickly saw the tape whistle around the metal tape-trading underground and become a hot commodity, with San Francisco and New York particularly receptive.\n\nMetallica performed two shows in San Francisco and found the crowds friendlier and more honest than LA's \"there to be seen\" mob. They also caught up-and-coming band Trauma, and most importantly their bass player, Cliff Burton. Cliff refused to move to Southern California: it was enough to convince Metallica to relocate to the Bay Area, and Cliff subsequently joined Metallica.\n\nIn New York, a copy of No Life Til Leather made its way to Jon Zazula's record shop, the aptly named Metal Heaven. Zazula quickly recruited Metallica to come out east to play some shows and record an album. The band made it to New York in a stolen U-Haul. Dave Mustaine, at that point the band's guitarist, was proving to be more problematic than even these loose young chaps could handle. Thus Mustaine was kicked out due to his drug and alcohol abuse (then going on to form the successful Megadeth), with roadie Mark Whitakker suggesting Kirk Hammett from Bay Area thrashers Exodus. Two phone calls and one flight later, on April 1, 1983 Kirk Hammett joined Metallica.\n\nMetallica's first album, Kill 'Em All, was released in late 1983 and some ferocious touring which saw the band's reputation soar both in the US and Europe. In 1984 they went to work with producer Flemming Rassmussen in Copenhagen at Sweet Silence Studios on their second album. 'Ride The Lightning' proved that Metallica were not some thrash-in-the-pan one trick pony, the writing and sound illustrating a growth, maturity and intensity which saw them immediately targeted by major management in QPrime, and a major label in Elektra. Both deals were done by the fall of '84 and their reputation continued to grow worldwide.\n\nReturning to the same studios in 1985, the group recorded 'Master Of Puppets', mixing in LA with Michael Wagner and releasing in early 1986. They quickly secured a tour with Ozzy Osbourne, and that stint (plus a top 30 album chart position) saw their fan base and name take a quantum leap. What had seemed so unlikely was nearer than ever to coming true; world domination.\n\nOn September 27th, 1986, that dream was given the most shattering of blows. Somewhere in Sweden on an overnight drive, the bands' tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, killing Cliff Burton. His influence on the musical growth of the band was enormous. Burton combined the DIY philosophies of jamming and experimenting with an acute knowledge of musical theory, and Hetfield in particular found a lot in his playing and personality. It was impossible to imagine Metallica without him. Yet Cliff would equally not have cared for people throwing in the towel because he wasn't around. And so it was that after a brief yet intense mourning period, Lars, James and Kirk decided to fight on. Jason Newsted was chosen from over 40 auditions to be the new bassist, the Michigan-born four-stringer leaving Arizona based Flotsam & Jetsam to take on the chance of a lifetime. The quartet immediately jumped into a tour, and then quickly recorded an EP of cover tunes titled Garage Days Re-Revisited (the band literally did the dirty work in Lars' garage!).\n\nWith Jason fully established, the band went back to record their fourth full-length album, ...And Justice For All, released in August 1988. The explosion that had been threatening for sometime finally happened. It reached #6 on the US charts, received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal/Hard Rock album, the band blew headliners Van Halen off-stage during the Monsters Of Rock tour and subsequently embarked upon an enormous worldwide tour. It was even the moment they finally delved into video territory, although the footage for 'One' was most certainly the most 'anti' video of it's era.\n\nThe band took the show back out on the road and toured extensively to all parts of the world. ...And Justice For All produced two US singles and the band's very first venture into music video for the song One.\n\nIn 1991 Metallica released the self-titled album, and saw their popularity soar to stratospheric heights. With new producer Bob Rock, this album was a subtle departure from the previous album with shorter songs, a fuller sound and simpler arrangements. It went straight to number one all over the world, stayed there for several weeks and ended up selling in excess of 15 million copies worldwide, spawned several legitimate singles as well as earning a Grammy and MTV/ American Music Awards. The band toured for close to three years, playing a solo arena tour in 'An Evening With Metallica', with Guns N' Roses on the duos' joint-headline stadium tour, and as headliner at many festivals. It meant that by the time the fall of 1993 rolled around, the four members were shattered both physically and mentally. Save for some Summer Shed action, there was little major activity as the band allowed their real lives to catch up with their rock lives.\n\nNearly four years would pass before the next Metallica album saw the light. Called Load, and recorded at The Plant in Sausalito California, it was the longest Metallica album to date with 14 songs, and signaled some significant changes for the band. Produced by Bob Rock, the material was loose, powerful and eclectic, the sound thick and punchy and the image one which screamed out change and freedom from enslavement to the Black album era. So many songs came from the sessions, that a second album titled ReLoad, followed in 1997. The Load tour was spectacular, encompassing cutting-edge technology, stuntmen, two-stages and an epic two-plus hours of performance. What ever doubts people might have had were swiftly blown away, and whilst Load could never match the heights of the Black album sales wise, it became a phenomenally successful album in it's own right.\n\nIn 1998, they re-packaged all the old B-sides, covers and the two previous Garage Days sessions and ran into The Plant to slam down 11 new covers. Electric, exciting and raw, the double-disc Garage Inc. was great reminder that for all the success, Metallica's heart still lay in the music. This point was further proven in 1999, when with conductor/composer Michael Kamen, Metallica embarked upon collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony to bring new dimension to classic material. Any potential skepticism of the project was blown away by two nights in April at the Berkeley Community Theater which proved to be epic milestones in the group's history. Far from their material being compromised, the arrangements of songs such as 'Master Of Puppets' gave symphonic instruments the chance to explode into the spaces and fill them with greater, heavier power than ever before. Having recorded and filmed the shows on the off-chance it might turn out alright on the night, Metallica released the S&M double-disc and DVD in late '99, marking yet another significant chapter in a Hall Of Fame - like history.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Metallica took yet fresher steps towards establishing freedom from convention, proving that it was possible to assemble, and headline, your own stadium tour without promoting a record. Summer Sanitarium, Hetfield's back not withstanding, was a huge success, and anticipation grew as to when the band would hit the studio again.\n\nThe anticipation was replaced by fear at the turn of 2001 when, after several rumors, Jason Newsted departed the band. No one reason can be fairly the cause, more several long-standing issues that silently grew beyond their initial molehills. Of course many assumed that this would precipitate the break-up of the band, when of course it merely provided a conduit to newer levels of creativity and understanding.\n\nThe band realized there was much work to be done on both their personal and creative relationships, and spent the first part of 2001 investigating spontaneous avenues of discovery both in and out of the studio. They set up shop at an old ex-Army barracks called The Presidio, jammed together at length and made a decision not to rush the process of finding a new band member, opting instead to have producer Bob Rock do all bass parts.\n\nIn the middle of 2001, James Hetfield reached a place in his life where he felt rehabilitation, rest and re-focus were necessary for him to not only continue but also flourish. It meant that for many months, the members of Metallica embarked upon various levels of deeper discovery about themselves, the band and their lives both as a band and human beings. The results were to manifest themselves two-fold: when they came together again in the Spring of 2002 there was a deeper respect and appreciation for each other than ever before. And they were finally ready to make a new album, free of outside expectations, free of inner expectations and independent of anyone.\n\nSettling into their new HQ, the band set about making 'St Anger' with Bob Rock. Those early Presidio sessions had certainly helped shape the freeform thinking and expression that was to come, but no-one, least of all the guys themselves, could've known just how fierce, raw and passionate the 'St Anger' material would turn out to be. With Rock always offering prompt and support, lyrics were written by everyone, writing was shared and performance was off the cuff, spontaneous and a 180 degree turn from the months of cut-and-paste which had become a part of the Metallirecording process in the past.\n\nIt was in the Fall of 2002 that the band decided it was time to search for a new bassist, and after some closed auditions with personal invitees over a few months, ex-Suicidal Tendencies/Ozzy Osbourne bass player Robert Trujillo was chosen to be the new member of Metallica. Note, member. Not bassist or hired gun or replacement. But a band member. His whole demeanor, happy, relaxed, warm, enthusiastic blended with over 15 years of experience and a ferocious finger-picking style made Robert the only natural choice.\n\nThe \u201cSt.Anger\u201d era kicked off on April 30th/May 1st with the small matter of a video shoot at San Quentin prison for the same-titled track, and continued in earnest with an MTV Icons tribute show a week later, where peers such as Ko\u042fn and Limp Bizkit lined up to pay tribute to the chaps. The guys also performed live, marking the first \u2018official\u2019 live appearance of Robert Trujillo as well as James Hetfield\u2019s first public performance since his stint in rehab.\n\nThen came the small matter of rehearsals which Metallica chose to do in front of their loyal fan club members over 4 nights at the historic Fillmore Theatre in San Francisco\u2026and then it was off to Europe in June for the start of what would end up being 19 months of touring, with the festival circuit taking the early brunt, Metallica successfully playing to multiple 60,000-plus crowds. \u201cSt.Anger\u201d saw it\u2019s release on June 5th, a raw, feral, unrestrained slab of molten Metallica stuffed with abrasion, aggression and the overspill of four years excitement, anger, frustration and ultimate fruition. For those who thought it would signal a radio-hohned band, \u201cSt.Anger\u201d was a big, fat slap in the face. Indeed, it was actually too heavy for some! Oh, and as if to prove that this \u2018new\u2019 Metallica were not a bunch of ginger-snap panty-waists, the boys played three shows in three different Parisian clubs in one day during mid-June, each venue harboring a temperature of not less than 100 degrees.\n\nIn the US, Summer Sanitarium followed, with Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit amongst the support acts on another series of stadium sell-outs. In the meanwhile, the fervor was slowly building for \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019, the documentary film by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky about the world of Metallica between 2001 and 2003. Ostensibly slated to be about the making of an album, the filmmakers found a whole new project developing when James went into rehab, and thus having been projected as a marketing tool, the end product ended up being an incredibly revealing 2 hour 20 minute documentary.\n\nAs the Mighty Metallica continued ploughing on through the world (going back to Europe, Japan and then onto Australia in January), SKOM was debuted to enormous critical acclaim at the 2004 Sundance Independent Film Festival in Utah during January.\n\nAnd the year continued in the way that you\u2019d imagine a Metalli-year does, deciding to play (seemingly) every single town capable of hosting a major arena gig in North America (some 80-plus dates) with Godsmack in support. Result? Oh well, the usual sell-outs you\u2019d expect for this \u2018in-the-round\u2019 two hour thirty minute set which saw no song off limits and many a fan favorite raised from retirement for a gleeful airing. (p.s\u2026.there was another Grammy in February for Best Metal Performance \u2013 \u2018St.Anger\u2019).\n\nJuly saw the theatrical debut of \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019 which opened to enormous critical acclaim and went on to hold it\u2019s own in North American theaters for three months before going through Europe. And August also saw the release of the first official Metallica book, \u201cSo What! The Good, the Mad, and the Ugly\u201d, an edited compilation of the band\u2019s fan club magazine spanning 10 years from 1994 to 2004.\n\nAnd still the \u2018Madly In Anger With The World\u2019 tour continued, selling out venues right through to it\u2019s final date in San Jose, California on November 29, 2004.\n\nThey did publicly state that the majority of 2005 would be spent re-charging those creative and mental batteries, and true to their word it was a quiet year, except for two little hometown gigs with the Rolling Stones at SBC Park in November. We all knew an entire year would not pass without at least a sighting of the guys!\n\nWith batteries re-charged after the two shows with the Stones, the guys hit the studio in early 2006 to start writing a new album and were excited to announce that they would be working with a new producer, Rick Rubin. The spring and summer found them escaping from the studio once again with shows in South Africa (their first ever visit to the continent!), Europe, Japan and Korea. \u201cThe New Song\u201d made its debut in Berlin, Germany on June 6 to give us all a little taste of things to come in 2007 with the remainder of the year scheduled for more writing and jamming.", "otherInfo": "#MetallicaMondays"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Aaron Goodvin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/2999240.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Aaron Goodvin\u2019s new Warner Music Canada / Reviver Records release \u2014 V \u2014 is available now.

Sara has previously been featured at Variety, Huffington Post, Yahoo! Music, PopMatters, Magnet Magazine, the homepage of Apple Music, and more. She\u2019s appeared in numerous films and TV shows, including The Wonder Years and Frasier, while her songs have been featured in Grey\u2019s Anatomy and in a national Chevy campaign. Sara has shared the stage with Ben Folds, Juliana Hatfield, Ben Lee, Inara George, Neil Halstead, and Lissie, and provided backing vocals for Moby on The Tonight Show and for The Dandy Warhols and Mojave 3 on KCRW\u2019s Morning Becomes Eclectic.\n\nWild & Precious Life was co-produced by Melson, multi-instrumentalist/guitarist Danny Hechter (Badflower, Jordan McGraw) and Rick Parker (Lord Huron, Joseph Arthur, BRMC, Jeremy & The Harlequins). Hechter brought in bassists Sean Sobash (Dominic Fike) and Nick Diiorio (Jordan McGraw), drummer Jonas Streffer, second guitarist Jake Faun, and violinist Koi Anunta (Jules Galli). Violinist Kerenza Peacock (Adele) also added to the recordings, with additional production and remixing by Eric Breiner of PeachMusicLA.\n\nWritten and performed on piano and guitar, Sara\u2019s songs reflect on hard-won lessons and her tireless journey toward self-acceptance. \u201cIt\u2019s high time I learn to love myself before I\u2019m dead,\u201d she sings in the soulful and heartfelt \u201cComing Out\u201d \u2014 a defiant, weary, and yet serene \u201cI-don\u2019t-give-a-f-ck\u201d anthem for anyone who is ready to shed the mask and step fully into one\u2019s authentic self. \u201cState of Ease,\" written in deep meditation, is a prayer for transcendence \u2014 the quest to maintain a state of equanimity in the face of life\u2019s challenges. \u201cNo one can escape pain, physical or emotional,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we choose to react.\u201d Ethereal and swelling vocals, haunting piano, and swirling guitar lines evoke the bliss of flight, peace and surrender. \u201cSame River\u201d, inspired by the quote from Greek philosopher Heraclitus, No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river, and he's not the same man, is a reminder that the only constant is change -- in the fleeting, morphing moment.\n\nWith classical training at the age of eight, Sara began to gravitate toward the melancholy darkness of Chopin and the fanciful romanticism of Debussy. The daughter of two professors, she grew up in an intellectual Jewish household in a small college town in Indiana. Surrounded by cows and cornfields, her parents\u2019 home was an oasis of culture and worldliness, with books lining the shelves from floor to ceiling, and the best record collection in the neighborhood.\n\nShe graduated from Harvard with an English degree and initially moved out West to become an actor. However, after one too many traumatizing \u201c#MeToo\u201d encounters, Sara went \u201con strike,\u201d as she puts it. \u201cI just refused to go out on any more meetings or auditions. I lived on residuals for a while and spent all day playing guitar and piano, and writing songs. That was when I decided I was going to take that turn from the acting into music. It\u2019s not like that stuff doesn\u2019t exist in the music industry, because it does; but at least you have creative control. You can stand behind a finished product \u2014 your song \u2014 and not have to rely solely on what you look like, or your perceived value, or lack thereof, as a sexual object.\u201d\n\nAfter a brief marriage to Justin Webb, son of famed songwriter Jimmy Webb, the loss of a pregnancy at five months, and an ensuing divorce, Sara struggled with depression, and turned to yoga for salvation, developing a serious daily practice that began to inform her songwriting with new revelations about surrender, acceptance, growth and change. It also slowed her anxious breath to a fluid wave. \u201cYoga is like peeling an onion, gradually removing layers that cover up your true essence. There may be some tears in the process, but it\u2019s delicious, good for you, and worth it.\u201d\n\nThe EP reflects Sara\u2019s spiritual seeking, a deep understanding of her own mortality, and an urgency to make the most of life while she\u2019s here. \u201cWalk Softly\u201d is a plaintive letter of life instructions, penned to herself, invoking the perspective of her older, wiser self advising its younger, more distracted and insecure counterpart: \u201cPlease be gentle, please be kind; you can\u2019t read anybody\u2019s mind. You don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through. So don\u2019t be quick to your defense, \u2018cause we all hide behind pretense; and it\u2019s got nothing to do with you.\" Title track \u201cWild & Precious Life\u201d inspired by the line in the Mary Oliver poem, The Summer Day (\u201cTell me, What is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?\u201d) is a rousing, anthemic call to fulfill one\u2019s full potential, despite the naysayers.\n\nSara will tour in support of the new EP, both solo and with a stripped-down version of her beloved band. She muses that, just as one can never step into the same river twice, her shows take on different forms. \u201cThere is a power in connecting one-on-one with an audience that is its own special magic,\u201d Sara says. \u201cHearing my songs come to life around me with a full band is euphoric. They\u2019re two different experiences, both for me and for the audience, and I live for both.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Land of Deborah ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8483476.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Singer-songwriter Pop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "WELCOME TO THE LAND!\n\nThe Land of Deborah is an award-winning singer-songwriter and composer with a unique take on life, love and the pursuit of fair trade chocolate.\n\nBorn and raised in England, Deborah is a trans-national artist who now calls Vancouver, BC home.\n\nShe has been described in the press as \u201c...feel good folk-pop\u201d and as having \u201c...one of the smoothest voices in the city\u201d.\n\nFor video: youtube.com/TheLandofDeborah\nFacebook: facebook.com/TheLandofDeborah\nInstagram: instagram.com/TheLandofDeborah\nFor more info please go to http://thelandofdeborah.com/bio", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jeremy Messersmith ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10323337.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Singer & Songwriter, Folk", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Pied Piper of Wuss Rock\nhttp://www.jeremymessersmith.com\n\nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/user/jeremymessersmith\n\nBandcamp (Pay What You Want Downloads):\nhttp://jeremymessersmith.bandcamp.com\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/jmessersmith\n\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/jeremymessersmith\n\nFor All Business Inquiries: jeremymessersmithmusic@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Beth Bombara ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9052387.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Folk Rock, Rock, Americana, Blues", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Beth Bombara has a folk singer\u2019s head and a rocker\u2019s heart.\nDrawing inspiration from the melodies and lyrics of Neko Case and Aimee Mann, along with the hooks and harmonies George Harrison and Tom Petty, she has toured nationally as a headliner and supported shows for Pokey LaFarge, Waxahatchee, and Madisen Ward & the Mama Bear.

Favouring passion over precision, it's easy to see why comparisons to Richie Havens, Ray LaMontagne and Tracy Chapman are common for this soulful troubadour. From humble beginnings in Brampton, Ontario, AHI independently toured over 100,000 miles, through the vast woodlands of Canada and the neon lights of Nashville, to the Guggenheim Museum in New York, and eventually beyond the Atlantic to the brick lanes of London. Along the way, he has recorded with leading acoustic sessions across the UK and Europe, but none has been more viewed than a simple home video of his stunning rendition of Bob Marley\u2019s \u2018No Woman No Cry\u2019, filmed in a London alleyway and accompanied by the sweet harmonies of his three-year-old daughter. The video caught the attention of the Marley family who featured it on the official BobMarley.com website and sent AHI a personalized note from Mrs. Rita Marley herself \u2013 an unparalleled experience for an artist who cites Bob Marley as his greatest musical inspiration. Soon after, AHI returned to find his Indie Soul EP (2014) was chosen one of CBC Radio One\u2019s top 10 records of the year, and he has since been recognized and awarded by Folk Alliance International, Nashville Songwriters Association International, the Songwriters Association of Canada, and the Canada Council for the Arts, among others. For his debut full-length We Made It Through The Wreckage (2017), AHI has collaborated with CMA winning producer Eric Masse (Miranda Lambert) to create what Masse has called an entirely \"new genre\", blending folk, soul and rock, and topping it off with a vocal performance to be expected from a seasoned powerhouse rather than an indie debut. The feel-good single Ol' Sweet Day broke the Billboard Spotify Viral 50 Chart and hit #34 on the U.S. Viral 50 without any promotion or marketing. The track took off on playlists worldwide and surpassed 1 million streams; a rare feat for an artist yet to make his mark. Now a 2017 finalist in the Allan Slaight JUNO Master Class, it\u2019s not hard to see why AHI is one of Canada\u2019s most promising emerging acts.

I like to think, and I like people to think and that often generates a connection that can be nurtured,\u201d says Stoney LaRue. As he prepares the release of Us Time, LaRue reflects on this important connection he has fostered with his fans over his 15-plus years of touring. Together, LaRue and his fans have culled together a \u201cfavorite live song set\u201d that is dedicated to his loyal and growing fan base. LaRue is known for his real life, thinking man\u2019s music.\n\nUS TIME is a collection of songs from the native Texan who now resides in Oklahoma reflecting on his own dreams that openly shares with his longtime fans. \u201cThis project is a tribute to my fans. We have developed a strong relationship and I appreciate all of them,\u201d says LaRue. \u201c Together, we have built a compilation of fan favorites from the live shows that reflect the complexion of our time together in music, it is simply our US Time, \u201c he continues. This sentiment rings even louderafter LaRue took a hiatus from touring this summer to re-center his life that seemed to be lost.\n\nLaRue says, \u201cBeing able to record such timeless songs as \u201cEmpty Glass,\u201d \u201cInto the Mystic\u201d and \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d aside some of original tunes, all selected by my fans make me feel validated as an artist and hopefully it gives the fans exactly what they are looking for.\u201d\n\nBeing able to connect with fans the way we can today is mind blowing to LaRue. When this journey started over 15 years ago, communication was restricted mainly to the stage, written letters and before show meet and greets. Today\u2019s instant social media connection is what helped generate this collection of songs. \u201cI just kept a list of songs that fans would either request via Twitter and Facebook or yell to me on stage,\u201d says LaRue. \u201cUs Time is a very collaborative effort with them. Also, having RS Fields as the producer on this project was a good call. This is our first time working together and he totally nailed the production and we totally were in sync on how it should sound. I am very happy with the end result, it feels live and it feels real, and that is what music is all about,\u201d he continued.\n\nIndependently charged, LaRue has sold over 300,000 records over his career and plays 200-plus shows a year.

In more ways than one.\n\n\"We love to expose people to sounds they might not have heard before,\" explains violinist and bandleader Chris McKhool, summarizing the mission statement of the ground-breaking and acclaimed world music ensemble. \"And we love collaborating with other artists.\"\n\nOver the past dozen years and six albums, McKhool and his bandmates \u2014 co-founding guitarist Kevin Lalibert\u00e9, bassist Drew Birston, Cuban percussionist Rosendo \u2018Chendy\u2019 Leon and second guitarist Eddie Paton \u2014 have excelled at both. Thrilling listeners around North America with their genre-hopping fusion of Celtic reels, flamenco, Gypsy jazz, Arabic, Cuban, and South Asian rhythms, Sultans of String celebrate diversity and creativity with warmth and virtuosity. And they often do it with artists such as Paddy Moloney and The Chieftains, Richard Bona, Benoit Bourque (Bottine Souriante), Nikki Yanofsky, Alex Cuba, Ruben Blades, Crystal Shawanda and Ken Whiteley.\n\nWith their historic and visionary seventh album Refuge (coming in 2020), McKhool and co. bring their unique brand of musical synergy and collaboration into the studio like never before. Their most ambitious, diverse, inclusive and passionately political album, Refuge puts the Toronto-based Sultans face-to-face with a VIP roster of artists from around the globe \u2014 including American banjo master Bela Fleck, Israeli vocalist Yasmin Levy and others, like Iraqi violinist Imah Al Taha and Iranian santur master Amir Amiri, who have fled the peril and persecution of their homelands for the safer shores of North America.\n\n\"This is a project that is centred around the positive contributions of refugees and new immigrants to U.S.A. and Canada,\" says McKhool, whose Lebanese grandfather stowed away on a ship bound for North America a century ago. \"We are bringing in special guests that are newcomers to this land, as well as global talents that have been ambassadors for peace. We wish to celebrate the successes of those who make the journey here, and bring their extraordinary talents with them. We hope that the kinds of conversations we can have as musicians can provide a model for peace that our politicians and citizens find inspiration from.\"\n\nThat inspiration could not be summed up more clearly than on Refuge's gorgeously evocative and powerful first single I Am a Refugee, co-starring Somali poet and multi-media artist Ifrah Mansour, who now makes her home in the Twin Cities. \"I wrote the poem for me, for my community, and for those that are yearning for change, those yearning to deepen their empathy,\" explains Mansour. \"Writing the poem was a way to unleash some pain that I could name finally \u2013 I wrote it because I was so frustrated with so many people sending me emails and asking me what I thought about the travel ban, the first time our American government here shared the first travel ban. And that an artist\u2019s job is to draw that hope, especially in a time of deep hopelessness.\"\n\nLike most of the collaborations on Refuge, I Am a Refugee came to life in the studio, with Sultans of String and their guests composing and creating together. But no matter how they began, they all ended the same: with all the artists recording together at Jukasa, a world-class recording facility on the Six Nations reserve between Toronto and Buffalo.\n\n\"We knew we had to do it this way,\" McKhool stresses. \"We couldn't make an album honouring refugees and do it long-distance. But having everyone in the room at the same time made it extremely challenging, both from a logistical and technical standpoint. But the results certainly made it worthwhile.\"\n\nOf course, Sultans of String have never taken the easy road. Since releasing their debut album Luna in 2007, they have continually strived to make each chart-topping album more original and meaningful than the last. That includes working with an orchestra (2013's Symphony), teaming with Pakistani sitarist Anwar Khurshid (2015's Subcontinental Drift) and even crafting a world-music holiday album (2017's Christmas Caravan), which landed them on the Billboard charts and the New York Times. Their ambition and work ethic have garnered them multiple awards and accolades, including three Juno nominations, first place in the International Songwriting Competition (out of 15,000 entries), three Canadian Folk Music Awards, and countless other honours.\n\nTheir live resum\u00e9 is similarly stellar. Equally at home in a concert hall, jazz club or festival setting, the Sultans have gigged at the legendary club Birdland in New York, the renowned Celtic Connections Festival in the U.K. and the San Jose Jazz Festival. They have performed with symphonies across Canada and the U.S., and played live on BBC TV, Irish National Radio, World Cafe and SiriusXM in Washington. No matter the venue, the goal is the same, McKhool says.\n\n\"I've always wanted our concerts to be a place where everyone feels welcome. I want to reach out to diverse communities to say, 'Come out and enjoy music with us \u2014 you're going to have a really good time.' And it's great to see people from, say, the South Asian community mixed in with the hipster crowd. Or to play some very small towns where they might not have heard a sitar played live before. It benefits society as a whole, to have people from around the world blending their ideas, mixing their cultures.\"\n\nAnd sharing the wealth.", "otherInfo": "https://www.facebook.com/cdnmusician\nChris McKhool live stream interview with Canadian Music Magazine\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Andrew King, featuring slides, video clips from our new project, and stories about how this exceptional album came to be. \u201cRefuge is a fantastic, moving, dreamlike, epic, timely album.\u201d \u2013 Ken Micallef (Jazz Times, Stereophile, Downbeat)"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Blaze ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7717923.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "10:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "French producer/director tandem The Blaze.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sam Buckingham ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8974078.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Folk, Pop", "Time": "10:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cWinsome songs delivered with empathic delicacy\u201d - Rolling Stone\n\n\"Gorgeous and moving... with an authenticity that is undeniable\" - The Au Review\n\nAfter an impressive 18 months since releasing her acclaimed album \u201cThe Water\u201d singer-songwriter sweetheart Sam Buckingham hits the road, touring for the first time with her band, bringing the album to life and premiering a swag of gorgeous new songs.\n\nRecorded over just one week in a converted horse stable on the NSW south coast, \u201cThe Water\u201d has seen Buckingham tour alongside Kasey Chambers, James Reyne, Jordie Lane and Diesel, showcase at Nashville\u2019s renowned \u201cAmericanafest\" and embark on three national sellout tours of her own.\n\nAn audio journal of sorts, Buckingham penned the majority of the album while living in Latin America.

You did? Boy oh boy.\n\nThe metronome reference was but a musical in-joke before: now it contains more meaning. The steady tick-tocking of the pendulum represents continuation, stability, endlessness, and consistent familiarity. It understands that while we all ultimately return to the goo from whence we came, time marches on furiously, like a bull aiming for a matador. Your last breath will be another click on the machine.\n\nMetronomy Forever in name represents a similar ethos: something looking backwards and forwards simultaneously, like Janus, something fated and eternal. You were made from dust and to dust you will return, that sort of thing.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is when you\u2019re making music and you enter a world where you have achieved some sort of celebrity no matter how large or small you start to think about yourself in terms of legacy and what you\u2019re going to leave behind,\u201d says Mount. \u201cAnd then you realise that\u2019s limited to the interest people have in you. In the end I feel completely comfortable with it. The less importance you place in any art the more interesting it can become in a way\u2026 I\u2019m making music, I\u2019m going to do some concerts, I need to feed my children.\u201d\n\nMetronomy Forever is the follow-up to 2016\u2019s Summer 08, and contains 17 tracks. Its length is born from a desire for breathing room, from not wanting to stuff the hits together like a bouquet of petrol station roses. In between the sauna-sweat-soaked funk of songs like It\u2019s Automatic, and the beach funeral of Walking In The Dark, lie pretty, glistening ambient tracks. It evokes the feeling of being sat in a nursing home, Swiss-cheese-brained, recalling joyous flashes of a past life while the fugue states of comforting confusion wash over you.\n\nIt also comes from a desire to replicate the feeling of listening to the radio, with sumptuous songs of different types and styles helping lighten your mood, and stifle retches as you inhale scrambled egg steam from the saucepan you\u2019re scrubbing. \u201cThe radio never stops,\u201d as Joe puts it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter how emotionally deep the music that comes on is, it\u2019s entirely your situation that gives the music it\u2019s emotional leaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor so long I was concentrating on trying to make these snappy songs, and when they were all sat together it didn\u2019t make for some impressive thing. It wasn\u2019t until I started thinking about the past several years, realising that in that time there\u2019ve been periods of drifting, and looking around for ideas. When I started including these bits of instrumental music and bits of sound, to which I genuinely felt some kind of connection, I put them in amongst these little flowers.\u201d\n\nFlowers are apt metaphor. Mount has moved away from the bustle of his former Parisian home to take up residence atop a hill in the garden of England. It was a necessary change, he says, and one that has soldered a bond with him and nature.\n\n\u201cI think it has everything to do with me at the moment, being in this environment \u2013 and I literally mean the environment. I feel properly more connected with nature. And I\u2019m embracing myself getting into it, because I think it\u2019s a really important part of being a person \u2013 and I haven\u2019t even read that Sapiens book.\u201d\n\nAnd a good thing he hasn\u2019t, as it seems Sapiens has been widely discredited by academics the world over.\n\nMetronomy Forever is a record that exudes a green tranquillity. Mount was concerned that the relative happiness of his existence might stifle his creativity, having no great tragedy to draw from, but discovered the opposite was true.\n\n\u201cTo be jealous of having that stuff going on is a bit dangerous,\u201d he says. \u201cI look at successful musicians who, as they get older, struggle to remain relevant. I\u2019m at this point where I feel like, my attitude towards what I do is healthy. With this record I wanted to make a very pure expression of what I\u2019m about right now, and I think for me that makes for better music.\u201d\n\nAnd while the music itself promotes a sense of calm joy, it\u2019s in the lyrics that we remember that even idyllic circumstances require their own maintenance, an oiling of the cogs to keep them crunching along. Mount reminds us of this on Lately, desperately singing \u201cThat is love and it's hard to do, it's a job for two. What do I do if I don't get nothing from you?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the physical space and distance from stress and life on the Rue De Dogshit in the French capital that has had its effect on the creative process. \u202fMount spent much of the last four years working with Robyn on her acclaimed and deeply personal record Honey. 48 months of vicarious agony was exhausting, but ultimately extremely fulfilling.\n\n\u201cIn the space of time since the last Metronomy record I\u2019ve had a very large part in writing an album based on a traumatic experience for her. I knew the whole experience was going to be this massive cathartic thing. When it got to the point of finishing, I remember telling her how good it was and how people are really going to respond to it in the way you want them to. Working with someone and being able to tell someone that is quite an enjoyable thing, being able to know that everything\u2019s cool. It\u2019s a nice feeling to have.\u201d\n\nThose glimmers of emotional, intense, carnal mania seem to have rubbed off on Mount in their own way, too. On Sex Emoji, the subconscious throbbing purple of the erotic digitised aubergine comes to life, a refrain of \u2018love, honey, sex, money\u2019 sang in a coital squeal.\n\nSalted Caramel Ice Cream brings this to the fore too, but more in the vein of Lipps Inc\u2019s Funkytown, and evokes the sapid pleasure and delights of love, but also the panics and anxieties (\u2018Oh god, she\u2019s coming, don\u2019t look up\u2019).\n\nBut when the shagging is over you\u2019re left only with the despair of your sweaty reflection. The moments of pain and sadness on Metronomy Forever are just as real, but also surmountable, much like most of the torture of existence ultimately is. It\u2019s the scope of experience of someone who has decided that agony, while perhaps a good palette from which to scrape your paints, is just not really that much fun. We\u2019re here for a good time, not a long time, and, as Homer Simpson once said, \u201cYou could wake up dead tomorrow.\u201d Get on your hands and knees, plunge your fingers in the soil and scream thanks at the moon for making the waves crash warm foam at the feet of our children.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Chad Cooke Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8919274.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Dallas McGillberry- Lead Guitar, Chad Cooke - Lead Vocals Acoustic Guitar, Mike Neyra - Drums, Kevin Pool - Bass", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Four country crooners from Houston are paving their way in the Texas country music scene.

Namely, the former still leaves the guy just enough wiggle room to happily say \u201cyes\u201d when legends (and friends) on the level of Ray Wylie Hubbard or the Flatlanders need a can-do guitar man for a sold-out theater engagement. Or, say, when fellow A-list Austin sideman \u201cScrappy\u201d Jud Newcomb \u2014 the MVP co-producer of Sleeping Dogs \u2014 finds out he can\u2019t make it to a very special Johnny Nicholas gig in Hawaii, and asks \u201cPlank\u201d if he\u2019d be up for subbing for him. Who in their right mind is going to say no to that?\n\nPlankenhorn still selectively takes those kinds of calls not because he gets them, but because he\u2019s earned them. For the better part of the last 17 years, ever since he first moved to Texas with nothing to his name but a Geo Prism, $100, seven guitars and the generous hospitality of Ray and Judy Hubbard, the gifted multi-instrumentalist from Columbus, Ohio has busted ass to prove himself not just able and willing, but above all worthy of playing with the best of the best. And the reason so many song poets like Hubbard and Joe Ely like having Plank at their side is not just because of his prodigious chops on all things stringed (especially those played with a slide), but because of his intuitive knack for knowing when to hold back, always allowing the singer room to land a lyric and go for the proverbial kill. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the skill set I learned very early on: \u2018When in doubt, layout,\u2019\u201d Plankenhorn explains with a chuckle. \u201cThat joke about knowing when not to play? It's true.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, that particular skill \u2014 along with myriad other lessons in the finer points of songcraft that he\u2019s picked up from sharing stages with the masters \u2014 has come to greatly inform Plankenhorn\u2019s own music over the years. But it\u2019s never been more apparent than it is on Sleeping Dogs. Make no mistake: Plank plays a lot of guitar on the album, along with pedal steel, piano, upright bass and seemingly anything else he could lay his hands on during the sessions at the Zone recording studio just outside of Austin. But in stark contrast to SoulSlide, which by his own admission was by design a showcase for his custom-designed lap slide guitar, a patented \u201cFrankenstein\u201d beauty he calls \u201cthe Plank,\u201d Sleeping Dogs is first and foremost all about the songs.\n\n\u201cThe Plank guitar came from me wanting to mix together the two worlds of bluegrass dobro and the sacred steel tradition, and my whole last album was dedicated to that one instrument \u2014 to get it out there,\u201d he says. \u201cSoulSlide also really helped put me on the map as a solo artist, which is why I\u2019ve moved on to focusing more on doing my own thing and only doing a side gig once in a while when I really want to, with people that I really respect. But now, with Sleeping Dogs, I wanted to take a bigger look at how the whole world of music is available to me; it\u2019s not about just one guitar or sound, but rather about using all of the instruments I play and bringing all of my influences together \u2014 and about really wanting to bring my songwriting to the forefront.\u201d\n\nTo that end, there are no covers on the new album, but half of the songs were born out of co-writing sessions with a handful of his longtime friends including his co-producer (and bandmate in Austin\u2019s the Resentments) Newcomb, Gabriel Rhodes, Miles Zuniga, Jon Dee Graham, and of course Hubbard \u2014 the \u201cWylie Llama\u201d of Americana/Texas music, who Plankenhorn still credits as his personal gateway to the whole scene. \u201cPretty much everyone I\u2019ve ever played with is like, one degree of separation away from Ray,\u201d he marvels with a laugh. It was also Hubbard who set Plankenhorn straight years ago when he doubted his own merits as a songwriter.\n\n\u201cI had just started out playing some of my own songs at these little acoustic gigs, but I remember telling him, \u2018Ray, I don't think I should be doing this \u2014 I\u2019m just a side guy.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Where\u2019s your proof? Are people coming to your shows? Are people listening to your songs? Yes? Well, there\u2019s your proof.\u2019\u201d\n\nNaturally, the song Plankenhorn and Hubbard cooked up together, a satisfyingly greasy howler called \u201cTooth and Nail,\u201d just happens to be all about the not-for-the-timid troubadour path and the discipline of songwriting, without so much as a grain of sugar to sweeten the pot. \u201cWe had already written a good portion of the song when he came back to me and said, \u2018It\u2019s like an old cat having kittens / You just crawl under the porch and do it,\u2019 which is a very Ray line,\u201d Plankenhorn says. \u201cBut what\u2019s cool is there were other lines where his wife, Judy, was like, \u2018Ray must have written that,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Ha, no, that was me!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the Hubbard-certified gnarled blues of \u201cTooth and Nail\u201d is just one of a handful of different styles Plankenhorn makes his own on Sleeping Dogs. Both the hurricane Harvey-inspired \u201cFurther to Fall\u201d (co-written with Rhodes) and the closing \u201cHeaven on Earth,\u201d Plankenhorn\u2019s awestruck tribute to his wife\u2019s transcendent love of nature, hit the same deep, soulful notes that defined his last album (with that trusty Plank guitar put to especially righteous use on the latter song). But there\u2019s also \u201cThis Guitar,\u201d a disarmingly folky, listening-room-ready paean to the workhorse acoustic Martin that\u2019s been his go-to writing guitar ever since it was anonymously gifted to him not long after he first moved to Texas. And perhaps most surprising of all (even to Plankenhorn himself), there\u2019s even a few free-spirited ventures into buoyantly catchy, unabashedly poppy rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\n\u201cI had already recorded a few rhythm tracks before this, but the day that Scrappy first came to the studio was also the day that Tom Petty died \u2014 and somehow, everything just kind of shifted that day,\u201d he says. \u201cNot on the entire album, but for a good portion of it, there were discussions of like, \u2018What would Mike Campbell do on this guitar part?\u2019 And out of that, some of the songs like \u2018Sleeping Dogs\u2019 and \u2018I Don't Know Anything\u2019 really changed and moved into more of a roots-rock thing. Which wasn\u2019t something I was expecting \u2014 I mean, it came out of nowhere \u2014 but I loved it.\u201d\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be the last happy surprise, either. The stately, hymn-like \u201cHoly Lightning,\u201d an arresting co-write with Newcomb and Zuniga (of Fastball fame), actually almost didn\u2019t make the final cut. \u201cI had started that one myself but just really wasn\u2019t digging it, so I took it to Miles and Scrappy in the studio, and between the three of us we completely reworked it from scratch over a couple of hours,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut even then I still wasn\u2019t entirely about it. But then Scrappy sent the demo to Patty Griffin, and she goes, \u2018I want to sing on this!\u2019 As soon as she said that, I was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m definitely putting it on the album now!\u2019\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, \u201cHoly Lightning\u201d is now one of his favorite songs on the record. Not that there\u2019s a single track that he\u2019s not proud of on Sleeping Dogs, which is a testament both to the positive experience he had recording it and the confidence he feels going forward into the next stage of his career. And should he even find himself second-guessing his conviction on that solo sojourn, well, he\u2019s already written his own anthem to sing his way through the doubt.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote \u2018Sleeping Dogs,\u2019 I got this image of sleeping dogs lying, and how I need to let shit go,\u201d he explains. \u201cI literally took a lot of things that I\u2019m really bad at or think I\u2019m really bad at, and told myself, \u2018If I sing this for a year or two on tour, it may make me better at these things; maybe I won\u2019t take stuff personally, won\u2019t let things get me down.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Maybe somebody else will hear this song and maybe it will help them, too.\u2019 And I really like that idea: I like the idea of writing songs that have a little moral imperative to them.\u201d\n\nSome would call that a sense of purpose.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Norman Brannon ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Russ Tolman ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9021730.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Rock, Americana", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "https://www.russtolmanmusic.com/bio", "otherInfo": "We're digging even deeper into the catalog.

Caitlyn Smith, one of Nashville's most prized writers, is one of them: and, after years spent composing songs for and with everyone from Dolly Parton to Garth Brooks to Meghan Trainor, she's finally ready to unveil all sides of her enormous talent with Starfire. Long lauded for her ability to whirl pure emotion into unforgettable tracks, Starfire is a raw, visceral journey about love, hardship and the struggle to pave your own way, all anchored by her unforgettable tone. A few minutes of listening and one thing becomes abundantly clear: there is no one better to sing the music of Caitlyn Smith than Smith herself.\n\n\"I wanted to unlock my heart and dig around inside a little,\" Smith says about the songs of Starfire, with the first five songs available now. \"And I wanted to be more vulnerable, and tell the stories I have lived. It's more of a raw process to write for myself.\"\n\nIndeed, songs like \"Before You Called Me Baby\" shake the listener to the core: blending her soulful vocals with stirring, deeply honest lyrics and instrumentation that only amplifies the organic construction, they occupy a unique space that can both blossom with a full band or be stripped down into intimate, solo experiences. Because Smith, who has toured and opened for acts such as Eric Church, Sheryl Crow and Dierks Bentley, understands not only how important the craft itself is, but also how music can \u2013 and should - transform in a live setting. With just her acoustic guitar, Smith can stun to silence.\n\nRaised in the small town of Cannon Falls, Minnesota, Smith grew up singing in the church and at county fairs \u2013 and it soon became abundantly clear that her talent stretched well beyond the ordinary. She wrote her first songs at the young age of eight, and had already convinced her parents that a career as an artist was her true path by the time she reached her teenage years. \"I released two records before I graduated high school,\" Smith recalls. \"I knew I needed to do music and nothing else.\" After a stint in Minneapolis, it was clear that Nashville was where she belonged, and she quickly became a sought-after force in the songwriting scene: so much so that even music she intended to sing herself quickly got snatched up by others, yielding her two top country hits, including the platinum \"Wasting All These Tears,\" recorded by Cassadee Pope.\n\nA celebrated force in the writer's room, Smith's also had her songs cut by Parton, Brooks and Lady Antebellum, and co-wrote Trainor's John Legend duet, \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You,\" among many others. For a while, Smith balanced her two worlds \u2013 as an artist, and a writer \u2013 while primarily focusing on the latter, working to perfect her craft and discover exactly what she wanted to say in her solo work. She released some music under her own name, but it didn't capture the spirit she ultimately wanted. \"I was shooting for something instead of singing music that was in my heart, that I loved,\" she says, as honest as ever. \"So I stepped back. I said to myself, 'the next thing that I release, I don't want to ask anybody's opinion. I want to go into the studio and make a record that I love and is true to me.'\"\n\nThat next thing became Starfire, produced by Paul Moak, who quickly became Smith's trusted collaborator. They would often bunker down at his Nashville studio, while Smith enlisted friends and colleagues for co-writes, like Gordie Sampson, Kate York and Sarah Buxton. But suddenly, some news came along: Smith was expecting a child. \"It added a beautiful layer of excitement,\" she says. \"Not only was I making a record, but I'm making a life. This little boy has been along for the ride.\"\n\nStarfire, itself, is all about growth, and what it takes to get to your most honest and true incarnation. Smith decided to trust her strengths: her soulful vocals, her strong sense of imaginative storytelling and her ability to craft melodies that exist outside of genre walls and instead focus on timelessness. But there are plenty of infectious hooks in there, too.\n\n\"We didn't want to think about genre or radio or any boundaries,\" she says. Like Chris Stapleton, Maren Morris or even Crow, she artfully blends a steady catalogue of influences and reference points, held together by stellar craft and her formidable voice. \"We wanted to make music that moved us, stay out of the way of the songs and let my voice shine through. Some songs sound more country, some sound more folk. There's a little rock and soul in there, too, which makes it a bit of a genre-less record. But it feels just right to me.\"\n\nGenreless, maybe, but full of vitality, and also downright honest. Take a song like \"This Town is Killing Me,\" about how life as an artist in Music City isn\u2019t all champagne and roses, even when there are small successes. \"It can be a such a hard, heartbreak town,\" Smith says. \"As much as you want to write those songs you know would pay the bills, if you did it every day, the artist part in you would die. There is this balance of loving this town because you get to create, but also it is just so brutal.\" Smith isn\u2019t the kind to smile and nod \u2013 instead, she turns her emotions into moments like this that manage to be about both her own experience and the human condition as a whole.\n\nAnd then there are songs like \"Tacoma,\" devastating in both its lyrics and its sheer beauty: \"I'm burning your memory one mile at a time\" Smith sings in her stunning vocal delivery to stripped-down production. Then, of course, there is the title track, which blends a pop groove with a soulful, chugging chorus. It's about how important it is to keep going even when the world wants to bring you down \u2013 an attitude that has ruled Smith's career thus far. Here, she proclaims her strength to a dynamite beat: it's one thing to have the talent to be a star, but it's another to have the will to keep your fire flaming bright.\n\n\"This whole record and process, I've been on a journey,\" she says. \u201cI've heard no many times and just kept going. I've learned that one thing is for certain: nothing is going to burn me out.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.instagram.com/caitlynsmith"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Alpine Camp ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10231483.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Jam Bands, Jamgrass", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "You don\u2019t often picture the wilderness when you think of LA. But there\u2019s actually seven hundred thousand acres of forest in Los Angeles County. In fact, it\u2019s has one of the largest wilderness areas without roads in the lower forty-eight. It also has the media capitol of the world sitting right there in the middle. This Southern Californian duality runs deep in the Los Angeles bred band The Alpine Camp.\n\nThe band is comprised of bass, drums, guitar, piano, pedal steel and banjo. The Alpine Camp could hang with the bluegrass crowd if it wasn\u2019t for the drummer. You could also expect Gram Parsons to waltz through the door since they can chicken pick with the best. But, at its core, the group is an Americana Roots Rock outfit with pop sensibilities. Their live shows showcase the band\u2019s improvisational prowess and run the gambit from ethereal soundscapes to balls to the wall shredding all framed within the context of the great American songbook.\n\nThe band is supporting their latest release Hybrid, a collection of originals along with live performances showcasing the band\u2019s aptitude for improvisation. \u201cWith Hybrid they get the best of both worlds,\u201d said Chris Bell \u201cit\u2019s as close as you can get to our live show.\u201d\n\nThe band started as a way for Bell and songwriting partner Charles Etienne to continue their lifelong musical partnership. Bell had traveled to Nashville and fallen back in love with country, bluegrass and songwriting in general. When that love turned into melodies, Etienne was there to foster those ideas into finished songs. From there, what started as a one off project, blossomed to include some of the most deft players in Southern California. The musicians who added their signature sounds to those initial recordings have since become permanent and integral members of what is now The Alpine Camp.\n\nThe Alpine Camp has spread their mountain tinged roots rock far and wide since 2014. Since then they have performed at Earth Jam, the California Oysterfest, OC Music Fest and shared the stage with Atlas Genius, The Brothers Comatose, Midnight North, The Motet and Ghost Light amongst many others.\n\nThe Alpine Camp seems to think traditional roots instrumentation and exploratory rock can coexist and so do their fans.

She started to sing in church, directed choirs by the age of 10 and received voice lessons in high school. As she was raised in the Bay Area in the 60s she was influenced by all the styles of music going on and places like The Fillmore were second home to her - even Bill Graham watched out for her. Patti jammed with hundreds of musicians during that time and learned how to improvise in any style. Some might remember that Patti was one of the founding members of Kingfish - featuring Bobby Weir, Matthew Kelly, Dave Torbert, Barry Flast among others.\n\nTuck was influenced by swing and classical music from an early age but it wasn't until the Beatles and Rolling Stones came out that he knew he had to play rock and roll. Because Tuck's sister had taught him how to play the piano he started with that instrument but soon decided that the guitar would be a better choice. Although Tuck was influenced by rock music he started to learn complex jazz chords instead, simply because he had the Mel Chord Book, with 400 Orchestral Chords in the appendix, at hand. When he heard Jimi Hendrix for the first time he was not only blown away, he considered it impossible for him to come up with such a sound himself and he dived even deeper into jazz.\n\nIn 1970 Tuck enrolled in Stanford where he would later major in music and played in several rock and jazz bands at the same time. He even went to Los Angeles to play in bands and took the guitar position for the Sonny and Cher TV show for some time - but decided to leave the L.A. scene before it could swallow him. Instead he headed to the Bay Area where he would play in top 40, soul and rock bands or practice and listen to music 8 to sometimes 14 hours a day.\n\nIn 1978 Tuck was playing in a band Patti came to audition for. Once they met they immediately knew they had found their musical soul mate (and partner in life). Since the band didn't happen Tuck and Patti decided to work as a duo and their instant success in the Bay Area proved that their formula that every song had to speak and be played from their hearts worked. Ten years later they would release their first CD Tears of Joy and the rest is history as they say. Tuck & Patti have become a well known act worldwide - especially in Europe and Japan.\n\nThat's also the reason why their CD A Gift of Love got released. They actually produced this album for their fans in Japan who wanted to hear Tuck & Patti's interpretations of classical love songs. The album turned out to be yet another success, once it was released in Japan it had to be released in Europe as well. Last but not least, 33rd Street Records released the album in July 2004 for the American market. What does this tell us?

The album is an experiment in sexuality, an immersive sex positive experience, in which Kacy takes listeners into her mind and her world. To create this world, Hill has developed a unique visual and auditory story, toeing the line between titillation and tenderness, playing with the boundaries of what it means to be a sexually awakened woman in 2017.\n\n\u201cSexuality is a part of my life that I have avoided,\u201d Hill says, citing her discomfort with the attention she received after the release of her breakout single \u201cArm\u2019s Length,\u201d when some images of her modeling for American Apparel surfaced online. At the time they were shot, these images were \u201cfun, and freeing, and like something I had ownership of,\u201d she says. Once they were a topic of conversation, however, she felt that the narrative was being taken out of her hands, and turned into something scandalous. So, she did what any new artist would to: she went to her mentor, Kanye West.\n\nWest\u2019s advice caused Hill to make some serious changes in her sound and her story as an artist. She began focusing more on her voice, letting the melody lead the track, and writing from the parts of her heart that she had previously kept close. The album is about sex, but it\u2019s also about intimacy, longing, heartbreak, and exploration. Where Hill had previously been relying on catchy hooks and production to tell her stories, now she\u2019s relying on her deepest longing, desire, and curiosity to inform the tracks.\n\nThe first two singles, \u201cHard to Love\u201d and the title track, \u201cLike A Woman\u201d introduce listeners to this new Kacy Hill. On \u201cHard to Love\u201d Hill\u2019s voice is front and center, tender and pleading with the listener, to remember their own heartbreaks, but not to let them defeat them. A radio ready pop track, \u201cHard to Love\u201d is a sweet song about sadness, touching on the tender side of sexuality. Meanwhile, \u201cLike a Woman\u201d is a passionate, slow burning song, that builds slowly before opening up to give Hill\u2019s voice room to breathe.

In 2008, Todd won the Soaring Eagle Casino Idol Contest.

Rob notes, \u201cI grew up on KISS, Cheap Trick, ZZ Top, and all the 70\u2019s rock and roll. If you have told me 15 years ago that I would be playing country music, I would have laughed. This new generation of country is a lot more rock than it was 10 years ago. There are a lot of great guitar players in the country music scene!\u201d Rob\u2019s guitar playing has that edge that the new generation of country demands, plus he still has that country \u201ctwang\u201d in his back pocket when he needs it.

Relentlessly touring as a headliner \u2013 his attitude is, \u201cWhen you love what you do, you can work all the time,\u201d \u2013 he has also shared the stage with luminaries such as Emmylou Harris, Richard Thompson, Ani diFranco, Indigo Girls, and Greg Brown, and has attracted an audience that stretches from Anchorage to Amsterdam.\n\nPeter Mulvey began as a self-described \u201ccity kid\u201d from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He played, wrote, and sang in bands while studying theatre there, and then traveled to Dublin, Ireland, in 1989, where he learned the trade of the street singer. Returning to the States, he relocated to Boston and began making a living as a subway and street busker, as well as releasing the first few of many CDs. Within a couple years he took to the road full time.\n\nThe road years further seasoned his abilities as a performer. Whether playing solo or with a band in tow, Mulvey has a rare ability to hold an audience\u2019s attention and transport them, using wit, humor, and a subtle but sophisticated melodic and harmonic sensibility to gracefully introduce complex and provocative concepts and characters.\n\nHighlight recordings over the years include 1995's \"Rapture\", \"The Trouble With Poets\" (produced by David Goodrich in 2000), 2004's \"Kitchen Radio\", the fan favorite \"Notes from Elsewhere\" (entirely solo versions of his songs) and recently, his collaborations with Chuck Prophet (\"Silver Ladder\"), Ani DiFranco (\"Are You Listening?\"), and Todd Sickafoose (\"There Is Another World\").\n\nCollaboration is another source for Peter\u2019s continued growth. In 2003, he released the trio album, Redbird, with fellow songwriters Kris Delmhorst and Jeffrey Foucault. The album\u2019s 17 songs range from jazz standards to old country tunes to contemporary covers, all recorded in three days around one microphone. Peter\u2019s annual hometown holiday in-the-round gigs have become an institution over nearly a decade. He can sit in with nearly any musician or ensemble and improvise in the common language of music.\n\nAs a complement to his touring and recording, Peter has also kept a hand in education; teaching guitar and songwriting workshops across the country. His songs and deep baritone voice have been heard in documentary films, major television shows, and by dance and theater companies. His longstanding gig at the National Youth Science Camp gave rise to an illustrated book, \"Vlad the Astrophysicist\".\n\nFor over ten years Peter has done an annual Fall tour entirely by bicycle, partly for environmental reasons and partly for the sheer fun of continuing his creative, unorthodox approach to a long and fruitful career as an artist.\n\nIn every aspect of his career, Mulvey draws on an extremely broad swath of influence; he is always reading, listening, and eager to hear new poetry, modern minimalist composers, old-time fiddle tunes, Argentinean trip-hop, or top-shelf bar bands. Said The Irish Times: \u201cPeter Mulvey is consistently the most original and dynamic of the US singer-songwriters to tour these shores. A phenomenal performer with huge energy, a quick fire, quirky take on life, and an extraordinary guitar style. A joy to see.\u201d\n\nStill, it is the live performance that defines that work. Night after night, whether performing solo, duo (with David \u201cGoody\u201d Goodrich), or sometimes even with a band, Mulvey attempts to be the sum of his parts, to draw on all the musical legacies he has studied, to make a fresh, vital moment out of everything he and the audience have brought to the table that night. \u201cPeople need this. I need this. To come together in a room, to try to make music come alive, for real, for right now, and then to let it go\u2026that is the whole deal for me.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.signaturesounds.com/homesessions"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hayes Carll ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6177605.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Country, Singer, Alternative Country, Songwriter", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The chorus to the title track on the new Hayes Carll album, What It Is, is a manifesto.\n\nWhat it was is gone forever / What it could be God only knows.\n\nWhat it is is right here in front of me / and I\u2019m not letting go.\n\nHe\u2019s embracing the moment. Leaving the past where it belongs, accepting there\u2019s no way to know what\u2019s ahead, and challenging himself to be present in both love and life. It\u2019s heady stuff. It also rocks.\n\nWith a career full of critical acclaim and popular success, Carll could\u2019ve played it safe on this, his sixth record, but he didn\u2019t. The result is a musically ambitious and lyrically deep statement of an artist in his creative prime.\n\nHayes Carll\u2019s list of accomplishments is long. His third album, 2008\u2019s Trouble In Mind, earned him an Americana Music Association Award for Song of the Year (for \u201cShe Left Me for Jesus\u201d). The follow-up, KMAG YOYO was the most played album on the Americana Chart in 2011 and spawned covers by artists as varied as Hard Working Americans and Lee Ann Womack, whose version of \u201cChances Are\u201d garnered Carll a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers swept the Austin Music Awards, and was his fourth record in a row to reach #1 on the Americana Airplay chart. Kelly Willis and Kenny Chesney have chosen to record his songs and his television appearances include The Tonight Show, Austin City Limits, and Later w/Jools Holland. Carll is the rare artist who can rock a packed dancehall one night and hold a listening room at rapt attention the next.\n\n\u201cRepeating myself creatively would ultimately leave me empty. Covering new ground, exploring, and taking chances gives me juice and keeps me interested.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wanted to find the next level. On What It Is, he clearly has.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessarily easy to get there. Carll\u2019s last release, 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers was an artistic and commercial risk \u2014 a bold move which eschewed the tempo and humor of much of his previous work. The record revealed a more serious singer-songwriter dealing with more serious subjects \u2014 divorce, new love in the middle of life, parenting, the worth of work. What It Is finds him now on the other side, revived and happy, but resolute \u2014 no longer under the impression that any of it comes for free.\n\n\u201cI want to dig in so this life doesn\u2019t just pass me by. The more engaged I am the more meaning it all has. I want that to be reflected in the work.\u201d\n\nAnd meaning there is. Carll sings \u201cbut I try because I want to,\u201d on the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cNone\u2019Ya.\u201d He\u2019s not looking back lamenting love lost, rather, finding joy and purpose in the one he\u2019s got and hanging on to the woman who sometimes leaves him delightedly scratching his head. \u201cIf I May Be So Bold,\u201d finds him standing on similar ground \u2014 lyrically taking on the challenge of participating fully in life rather than discontentedly letting life happen.\n\nBold enough to not surrender bold enough to give a damn\n\nBold enough to keep on going or to stay right where I am\n\nThere\u2019s a whole world out there waiting full of stories to be told\n\nI\u2019ll heed the call and tell\u2019em all if I may be so bold\n\nThere\u2019s no wishy washy here and he\u2019s not on the sidelines. In fact, he\u2019s neck-deep in life. On the rambunctious, fiddle-punctuated, \u201cTimes Like These,\u201d he laments political division in America while delivering a rapid-fire plea to \u201cdo my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor, while keeping all my joie de vivre.\u201d Carll\u2019s signature cleverness and aptitude for so-personal-you-might-miss-it political commentary is as strong as ever. The stark, \u201cFragile Men,\u201d co-written with singer-songwriter Lolo, uses humor and dripping sarcasm to examine his gender\u2019s resistance to change in less than three minutes of string-laden, almost Jacques Brel invoking drama. It\u2019s new musical territory for Carll, and the result is powerful. His voice is strong and resonant on these songs, and it\u2019s thrilling to hear him use it with a new authority. He is alternately commanding and tender, yet always soulful.\n\nCarll returned to trusted producer Brad Jones (producer of 2008\u2019s Trouble in Mind and 2011\u2019s KMAG YOYO) and Alex the Great Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to record What It Is, and recruited singer-songwriter, author, and fiancee Allison Moorer as co-producer. The production is adventurous while keeping the focus on the singer and his songs and providing a path for him to go where he wants to go. Where that is, is forward.\n\nThat\u2019s evident in the songwriting. Carll continues to hone his singular voice, but is also a flexible co-writer. Matraca Berg, Charlie Mars, Adam Landry, and Moorer have co-writing credits here, but it was Moorer\u2019s inspiration that provided the largest impact.\n\n\u201cOn the songwriting front she\u2019s just a pro. She helps me cut through the noise and she does it with wit and style.\u201d\n\nCarll\u2019s own wit and style has never been more evident. Whether it\u2019s with the put-you-in-picture detail of, \u201cBeautiful Thing,\u201d the not quite sheepish enough, dude-esque defense of dishonesty in, \u201cThings You Don\u2019t Wanna Know,\u201d or the strong as a tree trunk declaration of love on, \u201cI Will Stay,\u201d he displays an increasing command of his poetic lexicon.\n\nWriters most often wrestle with experience and expectations, either romanticizing the past or telling us how good it\u2019s going to be when they get where they\u2019re going. What It Is is a record that is rooted solidly in the present, revealing an artist in the emotional and intellectual here and now.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Allan Harris ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10342703.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Jazz, R&b/soul, Folk, Blues, Soul, Americana, Rnb-soul", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Allan Harris\n\"a protean talent\" (NY Times)\nEver since he burst on the jazz scene in the latter part of the twentieth century, The Brooklyn-born, Harlem-based vocalist/guitarist/bandleader/composer Allan Harris has reigned supreme as one of the most accomplished and exceptional singers of his generation. Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rory Block ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7263745.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Tue May 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-12", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "When Aurora \u201cRory\u201d Block was fourteen she was part of the Greenwich Village folk scene.

The original members were Stephan Jenkins (singer, songwriter, electric guitar), Kevin Cadogan (guitar), Adrian Burley (drums), and Jason Slater (bass guitar). The band's original line-up changed several times before the release of the group's debut album, and again shortly after the release of the band's second album Blue \u2014 at which point the band's main guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released from the band under circumstances that still elicit controversy among fans. Third Eye Blind's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, electric guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums), and Tony Fredianelli (electric guitar). More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. Leo Kremer has been filling in for Salazar during concerts, but it is not yet known if he will become a full-time member. For a time the band also featured ex-Smash Mouth drummer Michael Urbano and early Primus drummer Tim ''Curveball'' Wright.\n\nThird Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis, prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing Liam Gallagher to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins' outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of \"the biggest mouth in music\" by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox Twenty.\n\nA fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, is scheduled for a winter 2008 release. Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor. Only Jenkins' lyrics and vocals are left to be finished; all instrumental work is reportedly complete. Recent live performances have revealed a majority of the new tracks being worked on, including \"Don't Believe a Word,\" \"Lay Back (and the Water Will Hold You),\" \"In the Skin,\" \"Summer Town,\" \"Second Born,\" \"(You Really) Don't Like Me Now\" aka \"Campfire,\" \"Monotov's Private Opera,\" \"Break Me,\" \"Stevie Ray Vaughan,\" \"Red Star,\" and \"Standing Up For You.\" Other tracks mentioned for the album by Fredianelli are \"Away,\" \"A Sharp Knife,\" \"Captain of Emo,\" \"Swimming,\" and \"Jesse 2k.\" He also confirmed that \"Lay Back\" was scrapped. A number of previously unreleased recordings were made available, including \"Persephone,\" \"Carnival Barker\" (an instrumental), and numerous instrumental sessions declined by Jenkins for inclusion on the fourth album.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Joe Hanson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10224723.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Invited exclusively by the California talent executives to audition for the hit tv show \u201cThe Voice\u201d, Joe has proven to stand out and stand up for Country music.\n\nJoe\u2019s talent didn\u2019t stop with the Voice.

One listen to his smoky, soulful croon and the breezy way his songs half-step and skip smoothly along the stage, and his hometown Chicago roots are obvious. It was there that Splithoff cut his teeth as a songwriter and performer, and he carried that warm, compositional adventurousness with him to his next and current stop in New York City. The urban soul of the Big Apple taught him to treat the swarms of people buzzing around him as an audience ripe for his evolving pop sound. As Splithoff has grown and moved across various gritty concrete landscapes, so too has his music, which deftly incorporates myriad elements from his surroundings and packages them into one unmistakable pop-soul-dance-urban experience. Splithoff\u2019s style is far from the kitchen-sink mentality permeating much of today\u2019s airwaves: one of his strongest skills may be his ability to draw from his deep bag of tricks\u2014piano, guitar, melody, rhythm\u2014 with precision and harnessed emotion.

As band co-founder Ed Jurdi, who first learned of the term, explains, \u201cIt\u2019s the essence of the artist,\u201d or as partner Gordy Quist says, \u201cIt\u2019s a word we don\u2019t have an equivalent for in English, Artistically, that\u2019s where we tried to set the bar, to do what this band does best.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Duende lives up to those high ideals, a stylistically diverse effort that takes a leap beyond their last, more acoustic, introspective effort, 2013\u2019s Sunday Morning Record, with an eclectic batch of material that shows where The Band of Heathens has been, but more importantly, where they are going.\n\nThere are high-energy rockers like the Keith Richards-Chuck Berry guitars and barrelhouse piano in \u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d as well as the Grateful Dead-by-way-of J.J. Cale Oklahoma boogie in \u201cKeys to the Kingdom,\u201d The Band-meets-New Orleans honky-tonk blues of \u201cSugar Queen,\u201d the British Invasion harmonies laced through \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d the south-of-the-border flavor of \u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d and the New Riders pedal steel country twang of \u201cGreen Grass of California,\u201d an ode to the more potent strains of sensimilla on the dispensary shelf and a fervent plea to \u201clegalize it.\u201d Duende also touches on some of The Band of Heathens\u2019 favorite topics, from the sacrifices of a life lived on the road (\u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d) to the limits of materialism (\u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d), social media absorption (\u201cCracking the Code\u201d), and a moving depiction of Mexican immigration in an age of increased discrimination (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d).\n\n\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d is particular timely, dealing specifically with the migration of workers from Mexico and Latin America. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the politics of the situation,\u201d explains Jurdi, \u201cbut a meditation on people trying to get together to find their own slice of the American Dream, which has been our greatest export to the outside world. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve got leaders trying to divide us, spitting venom and vitriol, trying to get elected by pitting us against each other rather than realizing, almost without exception, we create the same felling of community and connection, regardless of religion, race or immigration status.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, according to Quist, \u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d is a portrait of someone who falls prey to the consumer culture of more, unable to enjoy the present because she\u2019s obsessed with wanting more in the future\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t end well. \u201cSugar Queen\u201d is its sequel, the same character as a newly divorced cougar looking for love in a younger man, told from the perspective of that younger man, another song about the thirst for real connection.\n\nThematically, Quist\u2019s \u201cCracking the Code\u201d comes closest to reiterating the album\u2019s desire to reconsider the value of relationships and priorities in a world of virtual reality and social media.\n\n\u201cWhile modern technology has certainly allowed us to stay in touch over vast distances \u2013 something a band that lives on the road certainly appreciates \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really provide the authentic connection we crave,\u201d says Gordy. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a portal through which we lose ourselves and miss what\u2019s really going on right in front of us, hiding the fact our supposed connected culture can be a really lonely place.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeep Is Love\u201d is another song about loneliness on the road, according to Quist. \u201cAt the time, I felt like I had all these tools to stay in touch with my family \u2013 from Facetime to Skype \u2013 but all the while we were missing the deeper connection that comes from being physically present in one another\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Jurdi describes \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d as a song about \u201cmissing his wife\u2026 lost opportunities, second chances and getting back to the place where it\u2019s just about two people in the same room having a special moment together without outside interference.\u201d\n\nArmed with almost 40 songs all together, the group recorded in a variety of different locations, the majority in the Texas Treefort, a studio in their own Austin backyard, where they took advantage of the vintage broadcast tube equipment to create the album\u2019s warm, inviting sound. All the tracks were initially laid down live in the studio by the full band, making an effort to keep the music infused with its \u201canalog\u201d elements as well as the communal feel.\n\n\u201cI feel the album brings together all our influences, everything we\u2019ve done over the years as a band,\u201d explains Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019ve touched on every part of our career\u2026 our roots, some singer/songwriter contemplative stuff, some high-energy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s all us, the record we were supposed to make. Ten years later, that\u2019s what keeps us coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really opened ourselves up to the collaborative process this time,\u201d adds Gordy. \u201cThe trust we have between us enabled us to chase down our individual ideas wherever they take us. That\u2019s the beauty of being in a band.\u201d\n\nEngineer/co-producer Jim Vollentine (Spoon, White Rabbits, \u2026And You\u2019ll Know Us by the Trail of Dead) helped the album\u2019s diversity sound coherent, adding unique touches such as mellotron and drum machines to the loping rockabilly of tracks like \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how getting the right sounds just brought the songs to life,\u201d adds Ed. \u201cHearing it come back at us through the speakers was really inspiring.\u201d\n\nGordy explains: \u201cWe based the album\u2019s eclecticism on our live shows, where texturally, we go through peaks and valleys. We have this library of music in our heads and at our fingers, and when we go into the studio, the challenge is how to go from that into making something new.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cAmericana\u201d was practically invented to describe The Band of Heathens\u2019 approach, which has mutated almost as much as the genre to which they\u2019re identified. And while the Rolling Stones and The Beatles remain touchstones on songs like \u201cSugar Queen\u201d and \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d respectively, influences as diverse as Sly and the Family Stone (in the psychedelic fuzz-tones of \u201cDaddy Long Legs\u201d) and Latin music (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d) also rear their heads. Literary inspirations also come into play, ranging from a character in Sylvia Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar depicted in as a strutting cougar in \u201cSugar Queen\u201d (\u201cShe even talks dirty/When she\u2019s on her knees to pray\u201d) to Tom Standage\u2019s A History of the World in Six Glasses, which recounts how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola have shaped culture and civilization to modern times (\u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d). \u201cGreen Grass of California\u201d \u2013 with its praise of today\u2019s strong strains of bud and a fervent plea for legalization -- was recorded in Nashville and supposed to include harmonies by Tim Easton, who ate a marijuana cookie and inadvertently lived out the song\u2019s lyrics (\u201cWhen your eyes are red/Spinning in your head/Remember it\u2019s only in your mind)\u201d), unable to continue.\n\nDuende is The Band of Heathens playing to their strengths, unapologetically constructed as an old-school 10-track, two-sided vinyl album (which it will be released as, with a second disc encompassing four songs from their Green Grass EP released earlier this year).\n\nFor co-founders Jurdi and Quist, the album represents a new beginning.\n\n\u201cOur goal is always to make the best record we could make,\u201d says Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019re taking our influences and pushing them into different sonic territory. I feel the band is in a great place to take that next step. More than ever, people need to feel connected. Just like Paul Revere or the town crier, we\u2019re messengers trying to spread the good word and tap into the communal spirit that is created in the wake of music and song. To make your way through the world via inspiration and ultimately, creation, is truly a gift; it\u2019s something we never take for granted. The singular purpose is always to bring our best stuff to the table, whether making a record or playing a show. The hope is that it both resonates with our long-time fans and strikes a chord with people who are just being introduced to the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just try to keep writing songs that mean something to ourselves and others,\u201d concludes Gordy. \u201cThe challenge for us as artists, in these disturbing times, is how can we change things? Music is fun and an excuse to get out with other human in a room together, but you also hope the songs will mean something when someone is all alone in their room listening to the record. This band is better than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nWith Duende, the proof is in the results.

Starita mixed the first two Sayla Dobro singles, \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d and \u201cJ-Train\u201d. During this time, he introduced Guaqueta and Tate and the rest was history.\n\nSayla Dobro\u2019s songs hearken seasoned folk-rockers like Beck and Calexico, thoughtfully self-produced and rough around the edges. It\u2019s no surprise that Sayla Dobro has been able to capture such a potent essence - the band\u2019s frontman and lead songwriter Todd Tate\u2019s industry experience runs deep. In the mid-nineties Tate\u2019s main focus was audio engineering at The Blue Room Studios, working on Grammy nominated Latin jazz with Carlos \u201cPatato\u201d Sanchez, and with popular rock artists like Train. On the brink of the millennium, Tate ditched full-time engineering and went to the other side of the glass to focus on making his own music. He made a rock record with a new group Life Love Misery (members of The Starship and Cacophony).\n\nMeanwhile, Guaqueta has a rich musical background of his own. He\u2019s written and released music with artists including Questions in Dialect, Buddy & The Squids, Mainframe Theory, and Storage 24. He\u2019s collaborated directly with Roy Mitchell-Cardenas (of Mutemath) and Mississippi rapper Kamikaze. His diverse background runs further; Guaqueta\u2019s visual artwork has earned honors for his music videos, including the Telly Award, the Addy Award, and the Ruma Award at Crossroads Film Festival.\n\nWith plans to release singles and videos \"very often\" in the upcoming months of 2016, Sayla Dobro is ready to hit the ground running. Supporters of the band\u2019s efforts to release a new single every month can download the band\u2019s single's as they are released in any format now at sayladobro.com/music or any online digital music service. In the upcoming months, fans also have the opportunity to pledge support on Patreon or Bandcamp and receive access to the private Sayla Dobro social feed, an array of special \"awards\", and even a live performance at their own home or business.", "otherInfo": "Live Dobro, electric and acoustic guitar, singing to tracks.

For the past decade that Lopez has been actively crafting music, multimedia art, and poetry, she has always seen her creative output as a necessary therapy. \u201cFor a long time I didn\u2019t go to therapy, and I used music as a release.\u201d explains Lopez. \u201cI\u2019m able to convey on stage what I can\u2019t off stage, and these songs that we\u2019ve written and performed\u2014I\u2019ve clung to them as a means of survival almost.\u201d What began as a notebook of poems Lopez kept during her youth in South Sacramento, has evolved into a lush and genre-defying body of work.\n\nAfter two close deaths and a period of reflection in 2016, Lopez felt she needed to reassess her life and her musical project, Sister Crayon. The project was reinvented through Rituals of Mine, and with the new moniker Lopez began writing the most honest and personal songs she had ever written. After years of obscuring her story and emotions through metaphorical lyrics, Lopez felt a sudden confidence to write more directly about her experiences as a queer woman of color. Lopez began fleshing out the songs with her long time collaborator and producer Wes Jones, who helped turn Lopez\u2019s heartfelt writing about trauma and personal growth into urgent and powerful electronic tracks. Lopez then enlisted Adam Pierce to play drums, knowing that their background in metal percussion would provide an intensity that could match her own.\n\nSince releasing their debut, Devoted, in 2016, Rituals of Mine has been praised within the indie music community, and Lopez\u2019s interactive art exhibit that simulates female-identifying people's experiences with street harassment, THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, has reached over 200,000 participants. Rituals of Mine has shared its music and message around the world, touring with acts like Garbage, Tricky, Built to Spill, DEFTONES, and Le Butcherettes. The band is excited to release their new EP, SLEEPER HOLD, this fall through Carpark Records.

Hanneke\u2019s music is a blend of the contemporary and traditional, described by the Boston Globe as \u201cexuberant and rhythmic, somehow wild and innocent, delivered with captivating melodic clarity and an irresistible playfulness.\u201d\n\nA prolific composer, Hanneke writes music from personal experiences of love and loss as well as to commemorate the joys and sorrows in the lives of loved ones. Hanneke\u2019s latest release, Trip to Walden Pond, features traditional Scottish and Cape Breton tunes and seventeen new pieces composed in the Scottish idiom. While her lively style is very much evident, this new album carries a deep, soulful sound with songs of celebration and farewell. Produced by Finnish musician Antti J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 (FRIGG, JPP, Baltic Crossing), the album showcases long-time musical collaborators cellist Mike Block, guitarists Keith Murphy and Christopher Lewis, fiddler/violist Jeremy Kittel, and pianist Dave Wiesler.

Trip to Walden Pond, similar to Hanneke\u2019s five previous albums, offers mellifluous arrangements of traditional fiddle music and original tunes that evoke humor and heart. This latest album also includes several compositions penned by Hanneke as commissions to benefit Many Hopes, a children\u2019s education nonprofit based in Kenya that she avidly supports.\n\nA native of Port Orford, Oregon, Hanneke started out as a Texas-style fiddler and went on to win the 1997 U.S. National Scottish Fiddle Championship, which awarded her the opportunity to study with Alasdair Fraser and introduced her to fiddle camps and the folk community -- both of which continue to play an integral role in her life. Hanneke teaches regularly at Fraser\u2019s Valley of the Moon and Sierra Fiddle Camps, the Mike Block String Camp (run by her husband, acclaimed cellist Mike Block), Harald Haugaard\u2019s International Fiddle School, and the Boston Harbor Scottish Fiddle School. She has served as a guest instructor in the American Roots department at Berklee College of Music, where she received her Bachelor\u2019s of Music in Violin Performance.\n\nHanneke is a sought-after performer who has graced stages across North America, Europe, Australia and Asia.

One listen to his smoky, soulful croon and the breezy way his songs half-step and skip smoothly along the stage, and his hometown Chicago roots are obvious. It was there that Splithoff cut his teeth as a songwriter and performer, and he carried that warm, compositional adventurousness with him to his next and current stop in New York City. The urban soul of the Big Apple taught him to treat the swarms of people buzzing around him as an audience ripe for his evolving pop sound. As Splithoff has grown and moved across various gritty concrete landscapes, so too has his music, which deftly incorporates myriad elements from his surroundings and packages them into one unmistakable pop-soul-dance-urban experience. Splithoff\u2019s style is far from the kitchen-sink mentality permeating much of today\u2019s airwaves: one of his strongest skills may be his ability to draw from his deep bag of tricks\u2014piano, guitar, melody, rhythm\u2014 with precision and harnessed emotion. Now, 2016 finds him writing, touring, and releasing new material, with his sights set on expanding well beyond the two cities of his origin.

The original members were Stephan Jenkins (singer, songwriter, electric guitar), Kevin Cadogan (guitar), Adrian Burley (drums), and Jason Slater (bass guitar). The band's original line-up changed several times before the release of the group's debut album, and again shortly after the release of the band's second album Blue \u2014 at which point the band's main guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released from the band under circumstances that still elicit controversy among fans. Third Eye Blind's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, electric guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums), and Tony Fredianelli (electric guitar). More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. Leo Kremer has been filling in for Salazar during concerts, but it is not yet known if he will become a full-time member. For a time the band also featured ex-Smash Mouth drummer Michael Urbano and early Primus drummer Tim ''Curveball'' Wright.\n\nThird Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis, prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing Liam Gallagher to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins' outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of \"the biggest mouth in music\" by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox Twenty.\n\nA fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, is scheduled for a winter 2008 release. Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor. Only Jenkins' lyrics and vocals are left to be finished; all instrumental work is reportedly complete. Recent live performances have revealed a majority of the new tracks being worked on, including \"Don't Believe a Word,\" \"Lay Back (and the Water Will Hold You),\" \"In the Skin,\" \"Summer Town,\" \"Second Born,\" \"(You Really) Don't Like Me Now\" aka \"Campfire,\" \"Monotov's Private Opera,\" \"Break Me,\" \"Stevie Ray Vaughan,\" \"Red Star,\" and \"Standing Up For You.\" Other tracks mentioned for the album by Fredianelli are \"Away,\" \"A Sharp Knife,\" \"Captain of Emo,\" \"Swimming,\" and \"Jesse 2k.\" He also confirmed that \"Lay Back\" was scrapped. A number of previously unreleased recordings were made available, including \"Persephone,\" \"Carnival Barker\" (an instrumental), and numerous instrumental sessions declined by Jenkins for inclusion on the fourth album.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Joe Hanson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10224723.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Invited exclusively by the California talent executives to audition for the hit tv show \u201cThe Voice\u201d, Joe has proven to stand out and stand up for Country music.\n\nJoe\u2019s talent didn\u2019t stop with the Voice.

As band co-founder Ed Jurdi, who first learned of the term, explains, \u201cIt\u2019s the essence of the artist,\u201d or as partner Gordy Quist says, \u201cIt\u2019s a word we don\u2019t have an equivalent for in English, Artistically, that\u2019s where we tried to set the bar, to do what this band does best.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Duende lives up to those high ideals, a stylistically diverse effort that takes a leap beyond their last, more acoustic, introspective effort, 2013\u2019s Sunday Morning Record, with an eclectic batch of material that shows where The Band of Heathens has been, but more importantly, where they are going.\n\nThere are high-energy rockers like the Keith Richards-Chuck Berry guitars and barrelhouse piano in \u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d as well as the Grateful Dead-by-way-of J.J. Cale Oklahoma boogie in \u201cKeys to the Kingdom,\u201d The Band-meets-New Orleans honky-tonk blues of \u201cSugar Queen,\u201d the British Invasion harmonies laced through \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d the south-of-the-border flavor of \u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d and the New Riders pedal steel country twang of \u201cGreen Grass of California,\u201d an ode to the more potent strains of sensimilla on the dispensary shelf and a fervent plea to \u201clegalize it.\u201d Duende also touches on some of The Band of Heathens\u2019 favorite topics, from the sacrifices of a life lived on the road (\u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d) to the limits of materialism (\u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d), social media absorption (\u201cCracking the Code\u201d), and a moving depiction of Mexican immigration in an age of increased discrimination (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d).\n\n\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d is particular timely, dealing specifically with the migration of workers from Mexico and Latin America. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the politics of the situation,\u201d explains Jurdi, \u201cbut a meditation on people trying to get together to find their own slice of the American Dream, which has been our greatest export to the outside world. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve got leaders trying to divide us, spitting venom and vitriol, trying to get elected by pitting us against each other rather than realizing, almost without exception, we create the same felling of community and connection, regardless of religion, race or immigration status.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, according to Quist, \u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d is a portrait of someone who falls prey to the consumer culture of more, unable to enjoy the present because she\u2019s obsessed with wanting more in the future\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t end well. \u201cSugar Queen\u201d is its sequel, the same character as a newly divorced cougar looking for love in a younger man, told from the perspective of that younger man, another song about the thirst for real connection.\n\nThematically, Quist\u2019s \u201cCracking the Code\u201d comes closest to reiterating the album\u2019s desire to reconsider the value of relationships and priorities in a world of virtual reality and social media.\n\n\u201cWhile modern technology has certainly allowed us to stay in touch over vast distances \u2013 something a band that lives on the road certainly appreciates \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really provide the authentic connection we crave,\u201d says Gordy. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a portal through which we lose ourselves and miss what\u2019s really going on right in front of us, hiding the fact our supposed connected culture can be a really lonely place.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeep Is Love\u201d is another song about loneliness on the road, according to Quist. \u201cAt the time, I felt like I had all these tools to stay in touch with my family \u2013 from Facetime to Skype \u2013 but all the while we were missing the deeper connection that comes from being physically present in one another\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Jurdi describes \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking\u201d as a song about \u201cmissing his wife\u2026 lost opportunities, second chances and getting back to the place where it\u2019s just about two people in the same room having a special moment together without outside interference.\u201d\n\nArmed with almost 40 songs all together, the group recorded in a variety of different locations, the majority in the Texas Treefort, a studio in their own Austin backyard, where they took advantage of the vintage broadcast tube equipment to create the album\u2019s warm, inviting sound. All the tracks were initially laid down live in the studio by the full band, making an effort to keep the music infused with its \u201canalog\u201d elements as well as the communal feel.\n\n\u201cI feel the album brings together all our influences, everything we\u2019ve done over the years as a band,\u201d explains Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019ve touched on every part of our career\u2026 our roots, some singer/songwriter contemplative stuff, some high-energy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s all us, the record we were supposed to make. Ten years later, that\u2019s what keeps us coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really opened ourselves up to the collaborative process this time,\u201d adds Gordy. \u201cThe trust we have between us enabled us to chase down our individual ideas wherever they take us. That\u2019s the beauty of being in a band.\u201d\n\nEngineer/co-producer Jim Vollentine (Spoon, White Rabbits, \u2026And You\u2019ll Know Us by the Trail of Dead) helped the album\u2019s diversity sound coherent, adding unique touches such as mellotron and drum machines to the loping rockabilly of tracks like \u201cAll I\u2019m Asking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how getting the right sounds just brought the songs to life,\u201d adds Ed. \u201cHearing it come back at us through the speakers was really inspiring.\u201d\n\nGordy explains: \u201cWe based the album\u2019s eclecticism on our live shows, where texturally, we go through peaks and valleys. We have this library of music in our heads and at our fingers, and when we go into the studio, the challenge is how to go from that into making something new.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cAmericana\u201d was practically invented to describe The Band of Heathens\u2019 approach, which has mutated almost as much as the genre to which they\u2019re identified. And while the Rolling Stones and The Beatles remain touchstones on songs like \u201cSugar Queen\u201d and \u201cDeep Is Love,\u201d respectively, influences as diverse as Sly and the Family Stone (in the psychedelic fuzz-tones of \u201cDaddy Long Legs\u201d) and Latin music (\u201cRoad Dust Wheels\u201d) also rear their heads. Literary inspirations also come into play, ranging from a character in Sylvia Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar depicted in as a strutting cougar in \u201cSugar Queen\u201d (\u201cShe even talks dirty/When she\u2019s on her knees to pray\u201d) to Tom Standage\u2019s A History of the World in Six Glasses, which recounts how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola have shaped culture and civilization to modern times (\u201cTrouble Came Early\u201d). \u201cGreen Grass of California\u201d \u2013 with its praise of today\u2019s strong strains of bud and a fervent plea for legalization -- was recorded in Nashville and supposed to include harmonies by Tim Easton, who ate a marijuana cookie and inadvertently lived out the song\u2019s lyrics (\u201cWhen your eyes are red/Spinning in your head/Remember it\u2019s only in your mind)\u201d), unable to continue.\n\nDuende is The Band of Heathens playing to their strengths, unapologetically constructed as an old-school 10-track, two-sided vinyl album (which it will be released as, with a second disc encompassing four songs from their Green Grass EP released earlier this year).\n\nFor co-founders Jurdi and Quist, the album represents a new beginning.\n\n\u201cOur goal is always to make the best record we could make,\u201d says Jurdi. \u201cWe\u2019re taking our influences and pushing them into different sonic territory. I feel the band is in a great place to take that next step. More than ever, people need to feel connected. Just like Paul Revere or the town crier, we\u2019re messengers trying to spread the good word and tap into the communal spirit that is created in the wake of music and song. To make your way through the world via inspiration and ultimately, creation, is truly a gift; it\u2019s something we never take for granted. The singular purpose is always to bring our best stuff to the table, whether making a record or playing a show. The hope is that it both resonates with our long-time fans and strikes a chord with people who are just being introduced to the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just try to keep writing songs that mean something to ourselves and others,\u201d concludes Gordy. \u201cThe challenge for us as artists, in these disturbing times, is how can we change things? Music is fun and an excuse to get out with other human in a room together, but you also hope the songs will mean something when someone is all alone in their room listening to the record. This band is better than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nWith Duende, the proof is in the results.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Snarky Puppy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371900.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Soul, Pop, Jazz, World & Latin Jazz, Funk", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With every new project\u2014hell, with every show they play\u2014Snarky Puppy hopes to do something they\u2019ve never done before. With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League).

Songs of love, alchemy and life\u2019s journeys. Beautiful vocals, bittersweet melodies and a cheeky pop edge.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, music is often reduced to background noise and treated like a mass-produced product to be sold, even by those who create it. Few in the business give much thought to artistry or how their music impacts those who listen. UK folk-pop duo Faeland is an emerging act that is fully committed to making music that changes lives for the better and adds something good to human existence. Gentle, intuitive, and mystical, the music on Faeland\u2019s debut album All My Swim blends folk traditions from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Singer-songwriter stylings and a dose of pop bring a captivating sound with instant appeal.\n\nFaeland is the brainchild of singer-songwriters Rebecca Nelson and Jacob Morrison, a project designed to break them both out of their comfort zones and to allow them to do meaningful work, not merely start another band. This lead to All My Swim, a song cycle that deals with the deeper themes of humanity like love, healing, and magic. Nelson and Morrison come from families of artists, creatives and healers and this gives a natural quality to these ideas that would flounder in lesser hands. The sound is acoustic guitars and double bass mixed with drums, harp, santour, and violin. Ethereal, bittersweet vocals float across the mix and complete the picture. Echoes of Joni Mitchell, Fleetwood Mac and Gillian Welch are detectable but the vibe is original and individual.\n\nFaeland\u2019s sound and mission pair up well together and create a beautiful vulnerability that is authentic and true. Songs like \u201cWe\u2019re Just A Love Song\u201d, \u201cAll My Swim\u201d and \u201cThe Wheel\u201d offer listeners a seductive realness that rises above all the pushed product out there and must be heard and experienced to be fully understood.

What began in 2011 as two artists sharing a love of Appalachian music has evolved into a visionary project that utilizes multimedia such as visual art, movement, and experimental film. Through their immersive creative process and bold interpretations, Anna & Elizabeth pioneer new ways of understanding old songs and stories.\n\nIn winter 2018, Anna & Elizabeth will release a new full-length album produced by Benjamin Lazar Davis of avant-pop outfit Cuddle Magic, featuring Jim White of The Dirty Three on drums. This new project expands on their recent studio release, the 7-inch vinyl single Hop High/Here in the Vineyard--also produced by Lazar Davis and his collaborator Alec Spiegelman--which signaled a new sonic direction with its sparse banjo and fiddle lines, pulsating pump organ, electronics, and swooping woodwind and string arrangements.\n\nArchival research and visits with elders are the bedrock of the duo\u2019s creative process. In preparation for this new record, Anna & Elizabeth spent months under the flickering fluorescent lights at the Library of Congress and at archives in the places they grew up--Vermont and Virginia, respectively--unearthing forgotten sounds recorded by song collectors some 80 years ago. During a residency at the prestigious MacDowell Colony, they continued experimenting and making art with the songs they found, discovering the many vibrating worlds within them. The pair\u2019s interest in experimental music and avant-rock is paramount in this new cycle of work. They continue to delve deeper into the works of pioneers such as Meredith Monk, Nick Cave, and Laurie Anderson, as well as drone musicians and avant composers who use field recordings in order to further unpack these old songs.\n\nSince forming six years ago, Anna & Elizabeth have released two acclaimed full-length albums\u2014Sun to Sun (2012) and Anna & Elizabeth (2015). They have performed at hundreds of venues worldwide, including National Sawdust (Brooklyn), Newport Folk Festival, NPR Music\u2019s Tiny Desk Concerts, Cambridge Folk Festival (UK) and Pickathon.

He's always exploring, crossing genres, and questioning assumptions. He\u2019s just as likely to release a video series of creative collaborations as he is to release a traditional album. Described by Zac Brown as \u201ca mad scientist with a five-string fiddle,\u201d the GRAMMY-nominated artist loves to experiment, collaborate, mentor, travel, and push the boundaries of not only his instrument, but of what it means to be an independent working musician in the current climate.\n\nFor the high-energy fiddle player, that has meant a constant juggling of stage and studio, independent media projects, teaching and other opportunities that pique his interest and fit the long-term vision. He's even gone as far as taking short runs for friends like B\u00e9la Fleck doing anything from stage managing to drum tech-ing while also sitting in with the band. He sees those odd jobs as a chance to add new skills to his toolbox or get another perspective on how his peers manage their tours and careers. It's a professional investment in his future and a small price to pay for maintaining creative freedom.\n\nCurrently, the unexpected turn that keeps him busy\u2014yet still free to experiment\u2014is a recent appointment as Program Director of Contemporary Performance (Production Concentration) for Berklee College of Music\u2019s graduate school at their international campus in Valencia, Spain. Hired in the summer of 2015 by his alma mater, he divides his time between family, teaching, leading the program and developing outside projects to ensure that his artistry doesn\u2019t get lost in the day-to-day challenges of running a graduate program.\n\nBut Driessen, never one to wear a single hat, is taking advantage of the location and opportunities that come with his new gig.

Very rarely though, do we see this happen in a live environment.\n\nSince 2005, John Rotellini has captivated audiences around the world by doing the impossible. A childhood love for magic paired with an eclectic collection of interests led John to develop what has become an obsession. By merging sleight of hand magic and illusions with other disciplines - psychology, con artistry, film, music and theatre, John has created live, interactive events that more closely resemble Hollywood blockbusters rather than traditional magic shows. No longer is the world of the impossible limited to the silver screen.\n\nJohn now resides in Las Vegas, Nevada where he can be found performing select dates in some of the Strip's most critically acclaimed productions and entertaining some of today's hottest stars when not on his own U.S. Tours.\n\nWhether it be performing live in front of thousands, entertaining small groups or executing death-defying large scale stunts, John's performances will be sure to leave you speechless. After all, how often do you get to live the impossible?\n\n\nHistory:\n\nWhen it comes to his shows, John has a very unique way of thinking. Rather than using a traditional audience/performer relationship, John has developed interactive experiences where the audience become the stars of the show. This allows each show to be different than the last and makes for many off-the-cuff and unique moments between John and his volunteers.\n\nAfter several years of honing his craft and performing for people in his home state of Wyoming, John launched his first headlining tour, Locked UP in April of 2009. The show, which opened to sold out crowds included a very special stunt. The spectacle, Rotellini's first venture into stunt work, was entitled -B L I N D- and required John to spend a day without sight, wrapping up with a blind drive through the streets of his hometown in a 2009 Pontiac Solstice roadster.\n\nThree years later, in January of 2012, the show transitioned from it's original Locked UP format into the TOURPOCALYPSE brand. The show, a blend of high-octane illusions punctuated with close up effects, celebrity cameos and what can only be called \"special\" theatrical moments, entertained crowds across the U.S. and led to John's first full-length DVD - John Rotellini: TOURPOCALYPSE Live From The Gryphon Theatre.\n\nFrom late 2011 until early 2013 John spent most of his time on the road. After his critically-acclaimed tour wrapped its run during the middle of 2013, John began developing an all-new show - AGENT PROVOCATOUR which began in 2015 and is currently touring the United States.\n\nOn April 19, 2016, John became the first magician to perform at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, NV. John joined the Harlem Globetrotters (who were also completing another first for the arena - its first athletic event) to create some very special magic for their 90th Anniversary World Tour.\n\nCurrently, John keeps very busy, raising thousands of dollars for charities that include Kidd's Kids, Children's Miracle Network, Win-Win Entertainment, The USO and Relay for Life while traveling the country entertaining audiences at various colleges, public and private events to rave reviews. He has been fortunate enough to gain sponsorship from Countryman Microphones, American Crew Men's Products and has had the privilege of having EXPRESS Fashion be the official wardrobe provider for some of his tours.", "otherInfo": "Special Win-Win Entertainment Virtual Visit and performance for patients, staff and visiting families of Dignity Health Hospital Campuses in Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "At Home ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7854512.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"Almost Forgotten Tales\" is the debut album from AT HOME - Andre Nitze. It is released in an elegant digipack, with photography by Sarah-Johanna Eick. \"Almost Forgotten Tales\" is a concept album in which 10 pieces of music are interwoven with each another, conjuring up a world of images. It is Nitze's journey through our world. And the sound originates from the stillness of our apartments at night. Our home.\nQuestioned about his musical roots and influences, Nitze replies: \"I grew up listening to \"This Mortal Coil\". David Sylvian's songs have always been a part of my life to the present day. Robert Smith was like my \"guitar teacher\". I think \"A Forest\" was the first piece I played on the guitar. For me Ivo Watts Russell is one of the greatest innovators in the music industry. And in my view these archetypal albums were all created under his direction. In other words what we today call 4AD. The Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, Dead can Dance, Clan of Xymox... These are albums that aren't hyped much but everyone knows them. If they hadn't existed, the music world would have been a much poorer place. I'm especially thinking of albums like \"Sleep With The Fishes\". This influenced me a great deal.\nOn \"almost forgotten tales\" Nitze sets three poems by Dylan Thomas to music; he explains why: \"It is the sense of the absurd in his writing. His writing is a true source of inspiration to me. Jon Cale was the one who first introduced me to Thomas. I devoured everything he wrote. \"Being But Men\" is all about how simple it is to feel happiness. Something that we knew all about as children. It's so simple... but we've forgotten how to do it.

After hearing classic hip-hop albums from the era such as The College Dropout, Get Rich Or Die Tryin\u2019 and The Documentary, LTtheMonk knew that he had to find out properly what this music was. Combining this with an interest in reggae (shown to him at an early age by his Jamaican mother) and rock (via his Irish father), LT\u2019s adventurous love of music and performing onstage grew throughout the years, culminating in the release of his first EP at age 17. He has since grown into a vibrant and compelling talent. LTtheMonk\u2019s 2015 debut album, Monk in London, described his career, relationship with his home city and journey to adulthood. His 2017 release The Dark Side of the Monk was an introspective and wide-ranging session rooted in California production aesthetics and informed by contemporary race politics.\nHaving moved from the UK megacity to Hamilton, Ontario in 2017, listeners might expect LT\u2019s latest outing Kinks, Drinks & Hip-Hop to reflect another leap in personal and artistic evolution. And they would not be disappointed. The album is as questioning as its predecessors, serving up an in-depth exploration of his romantic relationships, place in hip-hop and the music industry, and more discoveries of his persona. The album\u2019s title nods to Diamond D\u2019s 1992 classic Stunts, Blunts & Hip-Hop, but the album is of-the-moment and crisply defined by local players \u2014 the sounds of Hamilton producer Judah Jump, plus Hamilton hip-hop and R&B artists Hoss Bowman and Viktoria Csik \u2014 as well as collaborations with New York\u2019s YoHanMadeTheBeat, Canadian musicians such as Aisha Barrow, Lucas Hibbs and Owen Gow, and (in a call-back to his roots) longtime friend, rapper and producer ROYOS from South London.

Born on the Jazz & Heritage Festival stage, and descended from Neville family bloodlines, these soldiers of funk ignite a deep, gritty groove that dares listeners not to move. Their performances combine ingenious musicianship and complex funk and jazz arrangements with soulful melodies that are simple enough for anyone to enjoy. In Big Easy tradition, dueling baselines from Tony Hall and Nick Daniels III set off one of the dirtiest rhythm sections on the planet, while Ivan Neville lights up the Hammond B3 keys and cousin Ian Neville\u2019s funky guitar riffs send the groove into overdrive. The band recently welcomed their newest member, Alvin Ford Jr. to the quintet, a New Orleans born and raised powerhouse drummer. Dumpstaphunk tosses around lead vocals and four-part harmonies the way Sly & the Family Stone did, but with three studio albums under their belt, Dumpstaphunk stands on the merit of their own material. Songs like \u201cDancin\u2019 To The Truth\u201d off their latest record, Dirty Word (July 30, 2013, Louisiana Red Hot Records), offer an escape into the funky sublime, sharing the true spirit of New Orleans with every note.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Adam Ezra Group ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9011372.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 13 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-13", "Genre": "Americana, Rock, Roots Rock, Folk, Contemporary Folk", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Talk to any Adam Ezra Group fan around the country and they\u2019ll tell you that each AEG performance is a one-of-a-kind, community-driven experience, propelled by the spirit of the people in front of the stage. For both fans and band members alike, an AEG concert is a rally to live life with intensity and soak in the moments we share with one another.\n\nHailing from Boston, AEG\u2019s unconventional approach to the music world has allowed them to surge beyond their beloved hometown and emerge as one of the most uniquely powerful, underground live music experiences in the country. While Ezra has played with an array of musicians over the years, his current line-up featuring Corinna Smith on fiddle, Alex Martin on drums, and Poche Ponce on bass has been creating a new buzz around the country, as evidenced by their mind numbing tour schedule, ballooning tickets sales, and opening features with The Wallflowers, Galactic, John Oates, The Wailers, Southside Johnny, Graham Parker, and America.\n\nNot believing in set lists, every AEG show provides new and unique concert experiences that the band has been recording in real time and sharing with fans on thumbs drives as part of their \"Live Sound Project\" every night.

With a later start than most musicians, Adam didn't pick up a guitar until the age of eighteen. He soon fell in love with playing and knew music was his calling. He developed interest in songwriting and, before long, was looking to put together a band and hosting try-outs for singers. It wasn't until friends told Adam that his voice didn't sound half-bad that he put any thought into singing.\n\n\n\nThroughout the years since, Adam's been involved in several projects - most notably his original band Black Magnolia. The band\u2019s debut album, \u201cFields Are Burning,\" was released in 2012 and featured Randy Jackson of Zebra, who played a guest guitar solo on the song \u201cApocalypse.\u201d He's opened for several major bands in his day including Zebra, 12 Stones, Filter, Puddle of Mudd, and Louisiana Leroux. He\u2019s also played major festivals throughout the South who's had headliners such as Foreigner, Kiss, Doobie Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Temptations, Sublime with Rome, Dee Snider, and Cowboy Mouth.\n\n\n\nAdam's success grew substantially following his appearance on NBC's \"The Voice\". He chose Adam Levine as his coach and made it to the Top 20 on Season 13 (as the \"comeback kid\" from Season 12). Shortly afterwards, Adam Levine invited him to sing for the Maroon 5 Annual Halloween party in 2017. That night they covered only AC/DC songs with Adam Pearce singing, Adam Levine on drums, James Valentine and Andrew Watt on guitar, and Milo Decruz on bass. The night became extra memorable when Sammy Hagar jumped on stage to join Adam Pearce singing \"Highway to Hell.\" The night before, they also surprised guests and performed for the Casamigos Annual Halloween Party.\n\n\n\nIn Decemeber 2017, thanks to the support of his amazing Backers, Adam launched a very successful Kickstarter Campaign which allowed him to bring his newest songs to life with a new album. This new album was recently released October 31, 2018 as Adam Pearce: WARBIRD, featuring Kyle Thomas of Exhorder, Terry McDermott of Lotus Crush, and Paul Mirkovich who's plays keys for and sings duets with Cher.\n\n\n\nAdam can currently be found performing his solo acoustic gigs as well as playing with his full band, Adam Pearce & The Warbirds, all over the state and across the south. As a true Zepplin fan, he couldn't pass up the opportunity to sing with a great band called and thoroughly enjoys these shows.\n\n\n\n\"Adam Peacre: WARBIRD\" and \u201cFields Are Burning\u201d by Black Magnolia can be found on this website as well as on iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, and other major retailers.", "otherInfo": "Adam will be broadcasting live from his front porch!"}]
