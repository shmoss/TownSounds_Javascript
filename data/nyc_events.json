After receiving a guitar for his ninth birthday from his father it wasn\u2019t long before Terry was playing in local bands and spending summers on the road with his dad, the late Dale McBride, who was a recording artist with several Billboard charted single in the late 70\u2019s. After high school, Terry traveled and toured as part of his father\u2019s band for three years before moving to Austin. Terry became a sought after bass player in the local music scene and spent the next few years playing with Texas artists Lee Roy Parnell, Bill Carter and the Blame, Jimmy Dale Gilmore, Johnny Duncan, Rosie Flores and a two year stint with Delbert McClinton. In 1989, Terry travelled to Nashville and the songs he had been writing found their way to MCA president Tony Brown, who would later go on to sign Terry to a recording contract with the label. Terry\u2019s group, McBride & The Ride, recorded four albums for MCA, racking up several top five singles over the next few years, including \u201cSacred Ground\u201d a #1 single in 1992. McBride also received two million airplay awards for his writing credits for \u201cJust One Night\u201d and \u201cGoing Out Of My Mind\u201d. McBride & The Ride received nominations from CMA and ACM for vocal group of the year before eventually disbanding in 1995. Terry then began to focus most of his attention on songwriting, and through the years since has had songs cut by other artist such as Garth Brooks, George Strait, Reba McEntire, Ronnie Dunn, Kix Brooks, Alan Jackson, Trace Adkins, Easton Corbin, Kenny Rogers, John Anderson, Chase Bryant, Josh Dorr, Clare Dunn, Ricky Van Shelton, Jack Ingram, George Ducas, David Ball, Casey James, Wade Hayes, Gretchen Wilson, Andy Griggs, Jedd Hughes, Jason Michael Carroll, James Otto, Gord Bamford, Emerson Drive and Rosie Flores. In 2004 Terry co-wrote American Idol finalist Josh Gracin\u2019s top five single \u201cStay With Me/Brass Bed\u201d. He followed that up by co-writing \u201cPlay Something Country\u201d with Ronnie Dunn, which was the fastest rising single of Brooks and Dunn\u2019s career and was also the final #1 song for the award winning duo. Terry has had over 25 songs recorded by Brooks & Dunn, which led to 13 singles and 12 BMI million air awards. Belgian DJ Lost Frequencies' version of \u201cAre You With Me\u201d written by Terry, Tommy Lee James and Shane McAnally was one of the most performed songs in Europe for 2015. The song went #1 in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Europe Digital Songs, Germany, Greece Digital Songs, Ireland, Israel, Poland, Romania, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and reached #1 on the UK Singles and Dance Charts.

What's more, it's a story told by two artists whose individual careers are years deep. They both boast a string of acclaimed records and command large audiences nationally, but Hold My Beer grew out of the pair's decade-long, house-packing acoustic tour they started doing just for the fun of it. \"It became obvious to us that we should write the story of our friendship,\" explains Bowen, \"How we met, how we became friends.\" That story began 15 years ago, when Rogers dropped by one of Bowen's gigs. \"I invited him back to the house \u2013 nicknamed \u2018the White House\u2019 \u2014 to jam,\" Rogers explains. \"The house sat on a big lot so we never worried about our music waking the neighbors. We usually had a keg tapped and staying up all night playing music was a regular thing. Anyway, the next thing you know, we're here, 15 years later.\" That sense of camaraderie and personal history comes through in each of Hold My Beer's ten songs. Musically, the songs are rich and layered \u2013 big, oaky acoustic guitars, swooping fiddles and lap steel that chuckles at every punchline; that's no surprise, given that the album was produced by the legendary Lloyd Maines. \"Lloyd's not only one of the most talented people on the planet, he might be one of the funniest, too,\" says Rogers. \"He's a genius. He's smart, and he knows how to make each musician play in order to be the best version of themselves.\" That \"best version\" comes through again and again on Hold My Beer. In the rollicking album-opener \"In the Next Life,\" Bowen and Rogers outline the story of their lives together, from that first meeting at Wade\u2019s show in San Marcos to the stage of the Grand Ole Opry. They acknowledge every peak and valley along the way before concluding, \"I guess that what they say is true, all you need is one good friend/ and in the next life, we wanna be ourselves again.\" Of that unique chemistry, Bowen explains, \"We don't have to flip the 'entertainer' switch. We flip the 'friendship' switch. That\u2019s what 'In the Next Life\u2019 is about \u2013 how we became friends, and how that outshines everything else.\" -more- \"'Til it Does\u2019 opens with a bright, swaying guitar line and Bowen's warm voice sighing, \"I never told her that I loved her, but I do.\" From there, it settles slowly and sadly into its wistful, indelible chorus. \"The first time I heard it we were playing one of our acoustic shows together,\" Rogers recalls. \"He played it, and by the time the second chorus came around, I knew the words and I was singing along. I looked at him when it was finished and said, \"Did you write that? That's a damn good song. We gotta cut that.\" Like so many songs on Hold My Beer, \"'Til It Does\" is a showcase for the pair's deft and savvy skill as writers. They're able to summon strong, evocative images that convey deep meaning \u2013 avoiding clich\u00e9 without ever sounding forced or labored. The songs go down smooth and smoky, like finely-aged whiskey. They're also defined by a natural mood of exuberance. In the riled-up, boot-stomping \"Lady Bug,\" they arc their voices up high over galloping banjo, pleading \"Lady bug, lady bug, give me some good luck/ four-leaf clover, come on over.\" \"That was a real hard song to pull off, because I had a different vision for it than Randy did,\" Bowen says. \"We kinda battled over how the song should go. Then we went out, started drinking vodka and beers, took a few shots \u2013everybody just relaxed \u2013 and came back in the studio and did it in one take.\" Even the album's choice of cover songs \u2013 Willie Nelson & Merle Haggard's 1983 hit \"Reasons to Quit,\" Haggard's 1978 song \"It's Been a Great Afternoon\" and Joe Ely's roaring \"Hopes Up High\" \u2013 are effortlessly made over in Rogers and Bowen's images, and feel as much a part of their story as their originals. \"'Reasons to Quit' really sums us up,\" Rogers says. \"We play so many dates, we're gone so much from our families, the excesses of the road, the toll it takes on our bodies\u2026 We tried to sit down and write that song, and we realized, 'Fuck it \u2013 they already wrote it.'\" The song provides the perfect conclusion to the record.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hayden James LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8805226.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Music", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hayden James may have only released his first track in late June 2013, but he has amassed millions of plays for his work.

Their first album was Out of the Shadow which was written, recorded and produced entirely by Zach Rogue (except the drums) - released privately in 2003 and finally re-released in 2004 on Subpop. In the autumn of 2004 they went on a national tour of the US, which lasted two years. They have been compared in the music press to The Shins. Their second album, Descended Like Vultures, was released in October of 2005.\n\nThey are also featured on the Stubbs: The Zombie Soundtrack doing a cover of Buddy Holly's \"Everyday\". A live version of their Out of the Shadow track, \"Every Moment\", appeared on the soundtrack for the movie Napoleon Dynamite. However, the song never appeared in the movie itself. In addition, the song \"Eyes\" was featured twice in the Ryan Reynolds movie Just Friends this fall, and the first episode of NBC's Heroes. The Fox show The O.C. has used Rogue Wave songs, \"Publish My Love\" (DLV) and \"Interruptions\" (10:1 EP) as well as included \"Publish My Love\" on The O.C. Mix 5, a collection of songs used in the show. Rogue Wave recently recorded an exclusive song for the new movie, \"Spiderman 3\".\n\nUntil very recently, the band lineup consisted of Zach Rogue (Vocals, Guitar), Pat Spurgeon (Drums, Samples, Guitar, Vocals), Gram LeBron (Keyboards, Guitar, Drums, Vocals) and Evan Farrell (Bass, Vocals). Farrell replaced original bassist Sonya Westcott in Autumn of 2004. Unfortunately, in December 2007, bassist Farrell passed away in a house fire. A link to the memorial paypal fund set up to help support the Farrell family can be found on the band's website www.roguewavemusic.com. Their new bassist is Patrick Abernethy.\n\nZach Rogue was previously a guitarist in the Bay Area band The Desoto Reds. Pat Spurgeon has played with bands Antenna, Stranded at the Drive In, Ramona The Pest, Brando, Steve Kowalski, and has also released solo work as The Phantom Drummer.

The young Dallas native began to see a lifetime of hard work pay off in spades in 2015, as he signed with Sunfire Entertainment, released a critically acclaimed debut album, cracked the top 25 on the Texas Music Chart, and shared bills with Hayes Carll, Randy Rogers, Turnpike Troubadours, Green River Ordinance, and more. \"This is all I wanted to do since I was 14,\" he reflects, \"and now I'm doing it.\"\n\nWith so much momentum on his side, it's no surprise that Cartwright titled his new release 'Don't Fade.' It's a note-to-self that he more than lives up to on the EP, bringing together the heartfelt vulnerability of Ryan Adams and the arena-ready anthems of Eric Church into an infectious, genre-blurring masterpiece. The tracks showcase Cartwright's considerable growth, both as a writer and performer, while honing in on the sharp lyrics and soulful delivery that earned his self-titled debut widespread praise in Texas and beyond. The Dallas Observer called that record \"one of the very best of 2015,\" while the Fort Worth Star Telegram raved that \"there\u2019s an ease and a polish\u2026belying Cartwright\u2019s relative youth,\" and Red Dirt Nation said that it \"stirs what makes us all feel young and poignantly reminds us how fragile we all are when it comes to love, heartbreak and home.\" For Cartwright, though, it was only just the prelude.\n\n\"You never know what you don't know,\" he reflects from his newly adopted hometown of Nashville. \"I'm very proud of that first record and some of those songs have done very well for me, but with a whole additional year-and-a-half of hard touring and writing under my belt when we recorded 'Don't Fade,' I felt like I had a much better idea of how I wanted to sound and who I was as an artist.\"\n\nCartwright grew up in a conservative Texas home where his exposure to modern music was limited primarily to the 'Forrest Gump' soundtrack and Steven Curtis Chapman records. For his twelfth birthday, his parents gave him an acoustic guitar, and suddenly the entire world opened up. He discovered singer-songwriters and alt-country troubadours, contemporaries like Pete Yorn and classic artists like John Prine. It led him to begin penning his own songs, and by the time he hit high school, he was playing regularly in bars and churches. A summer program at NYU exposed Cartwright to the world outside of Dallas and inspired him to head even further from home to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\nCartwright worked his way through school with odd jobs in the music industry and wedding band gigs, and while they paid the bills, they left him unsatisfied and more convinced than ever that he needed to take the leap with his own music. He moved back to Texas and recorded an EP, 'Bull Run,' that earned him top honors in the B.W. Stevenson Songwriting Competition. A performance with John Fullbright led Cartwright to Oklahoma, where he collaborated with producer Wes Sharon on the self-titled debut that would break him onto the Texas radio charts.\n\nThroughout it all, Cartwright was a hustler to his core, playing 100+ shows per year without an agent or a manager, working harder than he ever had before in his life but moving closer towards his goals every day. The quality of the music and the exhilarating live performances were turning heads throughout the south, and that's when Cartwright caught the ear of fellow Texas songwriter Rob Baird, who offered to produce 'Don't Fade' with Brian Douglas Phillips at Phillips\u2019 Austin-based Rattle Trap Studio.\n\n\"We spent three or four days in total at Rob's house before we went into the studio because I had between 30-50 songs that I had written,\" remembers Cartwright. \"Rob and I went through each of them and pared the list down to figure out what made for a cohesive collection and what kind of sound we wanted to go after.\"\n\nThe sound that they ultimately landed on is instantly appealing, a warm, radio-friendly blend that calls to mind everything from Will Hoge to The Old 97's. Earworm opener \"Never Coming Back\" is an ideal showcase for Cartwright's gifts, with his silky-smooth vocals riding a laid-back drum groove punctuated by dynamic electric guitar riffs and classic rock organ swells.\n\n\"That was one of the first co-writes I ever did in Nashville,\" says Cartwright. \"I wrote it with Ty Graham, who had actually been my next door neighbor at Berklee during my freshman year. We always used to talk about girls and relationships in college, and when we sat down to write this song, the story was something we'd both experienced in our personal lives, so it came together really naturally.\"\n\nCartwright takes a darker turn on \"Busted,\" a driving, gritty tune inspired by the breakdown of a truck in the west Texas heat that mirrored the breakdown of his own crumbling relationship, while \"Nobody But You\" channels the pain of staying behind while a loved one leaves, and the sweetly emotional \"Don't Fade\" battles the inevitable passage of time. One of the most special moments for Cartwright, though, comes at the end of the EP, as the stripped-down acoustic meditation of \"Arkansas\" drifts off into an ethereal soundscape like the last rays of light at sunset.\n\n\"That ending was a very specific idea that came to me on a camping trip with my roommate,\" remembers Cartwright. \"We were spending the days and nights out in the middle of nowhere just listening to the crickets chirp and trying to figure out life, and I wanted to recreate that feeling.\"\n\nThe ability to capture such intimate, meaningful moments is the magic of Cartwright's songwriting. These are tunes about coming and going, uncertainty and change, finding yourself and what you're willing to sacrifice for your dreams. There are no dramatic revelations here, just the steadily deepening understanding of self that comes with maturing. Cartwright renders the sound of growing up beautifully and in vivid detail, capturing the anxiety and the ecstasy in all its messy, human glory. For a kid who grew up worshipping songwriters, to craft such exceptional music is to truly live the dream, and with another full length album on the way, it's safe to say Troy Cartwright's years are going to just keep getting bigger and bigger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jeff Jensen LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9068407.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alice Howe LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9118397.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Folk, Blues, Americana", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With her soulful, impeccably tuned voice and crafted poetry, Boston\u2019s Alice Howe is \u201cat once of the moment and timeless, personal and universal\u201d (Americana UK).

Formed in 2015 out of high school, the band has spread their sound far and wide from triathlon finish lines and waiting outside of dives to nationwide tours and sold out shows at home. The band released their debut album \u201cCamp Poppa\u201d at the turn of 2017 and is released their sophomore album \u201cYup\u201d in November 2019.

The Macks currently reside in Eugene, Oregon.\n\n\"The [Yup] album consistently delivers on its experimental take through ever-changing guitar licks and fascinating drum patterns.

The album constantly develops, leaving the listener constantly entertained of the unsuspecting vocal inflections and instrumental development.\" - Daily Emerald\n\n\u201cTheir angsty attitude is masterfully translated from the vibes of a house show into a recorded album. Even though you\u2019re just hearing their songs, the imagery of what you know their performances are like immediately comes to mind.

Consisting of Sam Fulwiler on vocals, Ben Windheim on guitar, Joe Windheim on drums, Rhiannon Sternkopf on bass, and Jake Perris on keys and vocals, this five- piece based in Portland delivers quite the head-banging good time.

With guitar solos that absolutely shred, quick-witted lyrics executed with articulate ease, and a whole lot of technical skill, this band brings the house down every time. In relation to their songwriting process, Guitarist Windheim explains, \u201cSongwriting for us is a lot like putting a puzzle together\u201d. He translates by telling me \u201cA lot of our songs are a combination of riffs from myself, Josef and Sam and then we ambitiously smash 'em together.\u201d Their 2017 debut album Camp Poppa contains elements from all across the spectrum expertly crafted together to produce a sound unique to them.

Their latest work Yup released in 2019 takes their sound to a whole other level with the perfect blend of DIY and professional elements.

Los Inicios\n\nBohemia Suburbana se form\u00f3 en la ciudad de Guatemala en marzo de 1992. La banda fue fundada por los guatemaltecos Juancarlos Barrios como guitarrista, Giovanni Pinz\u00f3n como vocalista, el colombiano Juan Lu\u00eds Lopera (Piolly) en el bajo y Jos\u00e9 Pedro Mollinedo en la bater\u00eda (Pepe).\n\nA esfuerzo de conciertos y bajo su propio auspicio en 1993 Bohemia Suburbana public\u00f3 su primera producci\u00f3n musical titulada Sombras en el Jard\u00edn. La misma se edit\u00f3 bajo el sello de Primera Generaci\u00f3n Records.\n\nEn \u00e9ste \u00e1lbum se encuentran las primeras versiones de los temas \u201cEn el Jard\u00edn\u201d, \u201cPeces e Iguanas\u201d , \u201cYo Te V\u00ed\u201d y cinco temas m\u00e1s; el original editado en cassette contiene \u00fanicamente ocho canciones.\n\nEn 1994 se integra a Bohemia el peruano Alvaro Rodr\u00edguez en los teclados y guitarra. Ese mismo a\u00f1o Primera Generaci\u00f3n Records en vista a la creciente demanda, decidi\u00f3 publicar una versi\u00f3n de Sombras en el Jard\u00edn en formato de disco compacto. En esta nueva edici\u00f3n se incluyeron dos nuevos temas \u201cDios es ajeno\u201d y \u201cDel-fin\u201d.\n\nBohemia planificaba sus apariciones en vivo en forma totalmente l\u00f3gica y emp\u00edrica debido a la ausencia de una escena de eventos y compa\u00f1\u00edas de producci\u00f3n que se encargaran de velar por \u00e9ste trabajo.\n\nNo obstante la aceptaci\u00f3n y poder de convocatoria de la banda fue creciendo en forma exponencial, siendo una sorpresa para lo o\u00eddos conservadores de la \u00e9poca y un reto para nuevos patrocinadores interesados en promover sus marcas y conceptos.\n\n2. Mas all\u00e1 de las fronteras\n\nEn 1995 los bohemios suburbanos viajaron a la ciudad norteamericana de Miami, Florida, para grabar y producir su siguiente placa discogr\u00e1fica. Auspiciados bajo el sello disquero RadioVox grabaron los temas que conformaron su segundo \u00e1lbum titulado Mil palabras con sus dientes.\n\nCon \u00e9sta producci\u00f3n tuvieron la oportunidad de exponerse y debutar m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de las fronteras centroamericanas. La canci\u00f3n \u201cPeces e iguanas\u201d logr\u00f3 posicionarse como una de las favoritas en muchas estaciones de radio y lleg\u00f3 a sonar en lugares que la banda jam\u00e1s pens\u00f3. As\u00ed Bohemia se vio inmersa en una intensa faena de giras y presentaciones en Guatemala, Centroam\u00e9rica, Puerto rico y otras ciudades dentro de los Estados Unidos. Por motivos personales en 1996 Alex Lobos releva las baquetas a otros bater\u00edas invitados por la banda.\n\nSe podr\u00eda decir a ojo de espectador que en 1997 Bohemia Suburbana se encontraba en un \u00e1pice de su carrera. Sus discos parec\u00edan venderse bien, la demanda por la banda en los escenarios era cada vez m\u00e1s grande. Sin embargo Bohemia sucumbi\u00f3 ante una crisis producto de la falta de orientaci\u00f3n y escaso apoyo recibido por parte de los sellos discogr\u00e1ficos; Bohemia deja los escenarios y sus integrantes toman caminos separados.\n\nEl distanciamiento de la banda se prolong\u00f3 durante dos a\u00f1os, y en 1999 los bohemios decidieron reunirse para realizar un concierto de reencuentro. Al mismo tiempo, bajo el t\u00edtulo de los Remixes y la emergencia de las circunstancia, RadioVox decidi\u00f3 publicar un disco donde se incluyeron versiones electr\u00f3nicas de las canciones conocidas de Bohemia. Estas versiones fueron remezcladas por Juancarlos Barrios durante el receso de la banda.\n\nEl concierto de reencuentro se realiz\u00f3 en la vieja Plaza de Toros en la ciudad de Guatemala y para sorpresa del grupo y los organizadores el evento rompi\u00f3 record de asistencia superando por mucho las expectativas previstas. Esto motiv\u00f3 de nuevo a los bohemios a seguir adelante y se proyectaron producir un nuevo disco.\n\nCon las ganancias del concierto decidieron retirarse una temporada a Madrid, Espa\u00f1a, con el fin de convivir de nuevo como banda y adentrarse en los estilos musicales que flu\u00edan por esos lugares. En \u00e9ste proceso Juancarlos decidi\u00f3 dejar el grupo y los bohemios acordaron reagruparse en Guatemala para seguir adelante con el proyecto.\n\n3. Cierre del milenio\n\nAs\u00ed naci\u00f3 el disco que se public\u00f3 en el 2001 con el titulo de Sub, producido por ellos mismos y bajo el auspicio del sello discogr\u00e1fico Pir\u00e1mide sound/Premier producciones.\n\nEn el escenario Alvaro Rodr\u00edguez contin\u00faa en guitarra y se integra a la banda el guatemalteco Rudy Bethancourt ejecutando los teclados y guitarras. Asimismo el colombiano Alejandro Duque (ex-Aterciopelados) se suma a la alineaci\u00f3n en los tambores.\nLos noventas fueron a\u00f1os de renovaci\u00f3n en el rock latino y por ende se dieron nuevos intereses para los productores y promotores de la m\u00fasica. Bohemia rearmada y renovada inici\u00f3 un nuevo despegue captando de a pocos la atenci\u00f3n de sus antiguos seguidores y llamando la atenci\u00f3n de nuevos adeptos. Realizaron cont\u00ednuas presentaciones en Guatemala y reiteradas incursiones a escenarios centroamericanos y estadounidenses. Esta vez con el respaldo de su disquera, los bohemios produjeron el video clip filmado para la canci\u00f3n El grito.\n\nEn marzo del 2002 la banda cumple diez a\u00f1os de existencia y para celebrarlo el quinteto realiz\u00f3 una serie de conciertos. Estas presentaciones fueron grabadas y varios de los temas fueron agrupados en un disco que publicaron en el 2003 con el t\u00edtulo Aqu\u00ed diez a\u00f1os\u2026en vivo bajo los sellos Strip Records y DLN distribution. A este disco se incluyeron nuevas versiones de estudio de los temas \u201cEn el jard\u00edn\u201d y \u201cBolsas de t\u00e9\u201d canci\u00f3n de la cual adem\u00e1s realizaron un video clip, filmado y producido en la ciudad de Nueva York.\n\nPor desdicha fue la pirater\u00eda la que acapar\u00f3 las ventas de los discos dejando a la compa\u00f1\u00eda flaca e impotente para mantener el proyecto y elevarlo a una mayor escala. Bohemia sigui\u00f3 tocando en Guatemala de forma constante, pero a inicios del 2004 se encontraron ante una crisis similar a la del 97; la banda decidi\u00f3 hacer receso para que as\u00ed cada uno de sus integrantes tuviera tiempo de estabilizar su vida personal.\n\n4. Sonido hom\u00f3nimo\n\nEn este lapso Lopera y Bethancourt decidieron mudarse a la ciudad de Miami, FL. Por su parte Rodriguez viaja a California, Duque a Colombia y Pinz\u00f3n se queda en Guatemala.\n\nEn mayo del 2007 con el soporte de una productora guatemalteca y el apoyo de viejos amigos de la banda los bohemios se reunen en la ciudad de Miami. Tras unos meses de convivencia como banda desarrollan nuevos temas, luego se disponen a grabarlos y a estudiar las posibilidades de lanzar un nuevo \u00e1lbum al mercado.\nA inicios del 2008 Bohemia realiza una serie de conciertos y presentaciones de fogueo en la isla de Puerto Rico. Despu\u00e9s de eso la banda decidi\u00f3 guardarse y enfocarse en la producci\u00f3n musical de su cuarto \u00e1lbum al que titularon simplemente Bohemia Suburbana. El mismo fu\u00e9 lanzado en formato digital y m\u00f3vil en Estados Unidos y Latinoam\u00e9rica en Enero del 2010 bajo una iniciativa de distribuci\u00f3n y promoci\u00f3n a cargo Warner Chappell y Warner Music latinoam\u00e9rica; \u00e9ste disco obtuvo la nominaci\u00f3n al premio Grammy latino en la categor\u00eda de mejor \u00e1lbum de rock a\u00f1o 2010.\n\nEsta nueva producci\u00f3n representa un giro en el estilo que ven\u00eda siguiendo la banda en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. Buscando un sonido m\u00e1s fresco Bohemia Suburbana vuelve con nuevos aires promoviendo temas como \u201cSerenidad\u201d, \u201cQuiero Decir\u201d y \u201dSobrevolar\u201d retomando de \u00e9sta forma los escenarios de Estados Unidos, Puerto Rico y Centroam\u00e9rica.\n\n5. BS20 El inicio de un nuevo ciclo\n\nEn septiembre del 2012 bohemia cierra un ciclo importante de 20 a\u00f1os de fundaci\u00f3n para lo cu\u00e1l convoca a todos los integrantes que circularon por la banda en alg\u00fan \u00e1lbum o gira. La celebraci\u00f3n se produce en 3 fechas consecutivas presentando un espect\u00e1culo compilatorio de su repertorio en las ciudades m\u00e1s importantes de su pa\u00eds natal.\n\nEl grupo se re\u00fane en el lago de Atitl\u00e1n a ensayar y montar un show sin precedentes recopilando los temas m\u00e1s representativos a lo largo de toda la trayectoria musical de la banda; la afluencia total a la celebraci\u00f3n del BS20 suma alrededor de las 25,000 personas. Paralelamente Juan Luis Lopera bajista fundador del grupo notifica su retiro de la banda acompa\u00f1ado de un abandono t\u00e1cito por parte de Rudy Bethancourt.\n\nActualmente la banda cuenta con los siguientes integrantes, los cu\u00e1les representan un 80% de la alineaci\u00f3n original:\n\nGiovanni Pinz\u00f3n (voz), Alvaro Rodr\u00edguez (guitarra y teclados), Juan Carlos Barrios (guitarra), Josu\u00e9 Garc\u00eda (bajo) y Jose Pedro Mollinedo (bater\u00eda).\n\nEntre el 2013 y 2014 la banda comenz\u00f3 a componer nuevas canciones para una nueva producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica. En septiembre del 2014 Bohemia empieza la grabaci\u00f3n de su quinto \u00e1lbum de estudio en la ciudad de Guatemala bajo la producci\u00f3n de Phil Vinall, conocido productor musical de bandas como Zo\u00e9, Placebo, Pulp y Radiohead. El nuevo disco fue mezclado por Phil Vinall y Manny Calder\u00f3n (Hello Seahorse, Enjambre, Bunbury) en diciembre 2014 en los estudios de Sonic Ranch, Texas y masterizado por Harris Newman en Grey Market Mastering, Montreal, Canad\u00e1.\n\nEl 26 de febrero de 2015, la banda lanza de forma sorpresiva a trav\u00e9s de sus redes sociales, el primer sencillo del nuevo \u00e1lbum: \"Tengo Que Llegar\". Se registran m\u00e1s de 8000 descargas la primera semana y el single aparece en el n\u00famero uno de ventas de iTunes Guatemala.\n\nEl 16 de abril de 2015, Bohemia publica Imaginaria Sonora, en formato digital y f\u00edsico. Ese mismo d\u00eda, Imaginaria Sonora se convierte en Trending Topic y aparece en el n\u00famero uno de los charts de iTunes Guatemala. El quinto \u00e1lbum de la banda contiene 12 canciones: Tengo que llegar, La Quimera, Mapa universal, Mal sabor, Perplejo, Ayai Uyui, Pero nadie, Paso al r\u00edo, D\u00eda de los muertos, Xibalb\u00e1, Irreversible sistema y Buscando conexi\u00f3n.9\n\nImaginaria Sonora es un viaje a las ra\u00edces de la banda y un salto hacia el futuro. El resultado es, seg\u00fan Pinz\u00f3n: Una propuesta ecl\u00e9ctica, esencialmente rocanrolera. Una versi\u00f3n actualizada de Bohemia. La nueva placa asume influencias del rock cl\u00e1sico e incorpora sonidos espaciales, anal\u00f3gicos, electr\u00f3nicos logrando una propuesta madura fresca y bailable. La l\u00edrica social de Pinz\u00f3n, la cr\u00edtica humanista y la poes\u00eda a ratos introspectiva y rom\u00e1ntica se empapa de la esencia volc\u00e1nica de Guatemala, acompa\u00f1a al migrante que atraviesa el desierto y al que vive las tradiciones latinoamericanas.10\n\nCon este nuevo \u00e1lbum la banda se adentra con m\u00e1s vehemencia al rock m\u00e1s energ\u00e9tico salpicado de electr\u00f3nica y por qu\u00e9 no decirlo, de experimentaci\u00f3n con elementos retro. Imaginaria sonora es precisamente la banda sonora (por ratos impredecible) de una pel\u00edcula que derrocha imaginaci\u00f3n. Y donde de nuevo, la banda vuelve a divertirse. Aqu\u00ed yacen canciones singulares y con gancho. Giovanni Pinz\u00f3n, cantante, resulta m\u00e1s terrenal y cuyo aporte a todo el conjunto de la obra es decisivo incluso en la ideolog\u00eda que acompa\u00f1a a la banda.11\n\nEl 1 de mayo de 2015, Bohemia se presenta en el expocenter de Tikal Futura para presentar: Imaginaria Sonora en vivo. Desde ya algunos medios de comunicaci\u00f3n destacan la renovaci\u00f3n de la banda y colocan la nueva producci\u00f3n como uno de los mejores discos de su carrera.12\n\nEn el a\u00f1o 2014, Bohemia Suburbana, conformada por Giovanni Pinz\u00f3n (voces), Josu\u00e9 Garc\u00eda (bajo), Alvaro Rodr\u00edguez (teclado), Juancarlos Barrios (guitarra) y Jos\u00e9 Pedro Mollinedo (bater\u00eda) se re\u00fanen para crear colectivamente su quinto disco de estudio. Consiguen la atenci\u00f3n del prestigioso productor Phil Vinall quien viaja a Guatemala para la grabaci\u00f3n de algunas canciones y luego van durante unas semanas a los estudios de Sonic Ranch en Texas para los \u00faltimos arreglos de Imaginaria Sonora.\n\nEn el 2015, lanzan los sencillos con v\u00eddeo: \"Tengo Que Llegar\" y \"Mal Sabor\", los cuales les permitieron ingresar a la rotaci\u00f3n de importantes cadenas de televisi\u00f3n y radio como MTV, asimismo, recibieron los reconocimientos de \"Mejor Canci\u00f3n\", \"Mejor V\u00eddeo\", \"Mejor Concierto\" y \"Mejor Concierto\" en los Premios 2015 del Circo del Rock en Guatemala. Ahora se encuentran en el lanzamiento de su nuevo sencillo y video \"Pero Nadie\" y lo que ser\u00e1 su Gira 2016 como pre\u00e1mbulo a la celebraci\u00f3n del 25 Aniversario de la banda en el 2017. 13\n\nGira Estados Unidos 2016\nA mediados de agosto del 2016 Bohemia Suburbana inicia una gira por California. La banda logra vender todas las entradas en su primer concierto en The Troubadour (Los Angeles) y en el Brick & Mortar de San Francisco.\n\n\n\nBohemia Suburbana es considerada por muchos como un \u00edcono de la m\u00fasica nacional guatemalteca. El inconfundible sonido postmodernista y surreal de sus composiciones han hecho de la banda una leyenda suburbana presente en la historia de Guatemala y Centro Am\u00e9rica.\n\n\nBohemia Suburbana ha compartido escenario con:\n\n\u25aa Jaguares\n\u25aa Rata Blanca\n\u25aa Caf\u00e9 Tacuba\n\u25aa Desorden P\u00fablico\n\u25aa King Chang\u00f3\n\u25aa Divididos\n\u25aa Fobia\n\u25aa El Tri\n\u25aa Juanes\n\u25aa Los Aut\u00e9nicos Decadentes\n\u25aa Aterciopelados\n\u25aa Joaqu\u00edn Sabina\n\u25aa H\u00e9roes del Silencio\n\u25aa Man\u00e1\n\u25aa Red Hot Chilli Peppers", "otherInfo": "Estaremos en el chat en vivo desde las 21:30."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Marina V ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10280080.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Pop, Pop Rock, Russian, Folk, Singer & Songwriter, Electronic Pop Indie Rock", "Time": "3:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201chauntingly beautiful\u201d ~ L.A.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rogue Wave LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8479770.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Rogue Wave is an alternative rock band signed to Jack Johnson's label Brushfire Records (they released 2 previous albums with Sub Pop).

The young Dallas native began to see a lifetime of hard work pay off in spades in 2015, as he signed with Sunfire Entertainment, released a critically acclaimed debut album, cracked the top 25 on the Texas Music Chart, and shared bills with Hayes Carll, Randy Rogers, Turnpike Troubadours, Green River Ordinance, and more. \"This is all I wanted to do since I was 14,\" he reflects, \"and now I'm doing it.\"\n\nWith so much momentum on his side, it's no surprise that Cartwright titled his new release 'Don't Fade.' It's a note-to-self that he more than lives up to on the EP, bringing together the heartfelt vulnerability of Ryan Adams and the arena-ready anthems of Eric Church into an infectious, genre-blurring masterpiece. The tracks showcase Cartwright's considerable growth, both as a writer and performer, while honing in on the sharp lyrics and soulful delivery that earned his self-titled debut widespread praise in Texas and beyond. The Dallas Observer called that record \"one of the very best of 2015,\" while the Fort Worth Star Telegram raved that \"there\u2019s an ease and a polish\u2026belying Cartwright\u2019s relative youth,\" and Red Dirt Nation said that it \"stirs what makes us all feel young and poignantly reminds us how fragile we all are when it comes to love, heartbreak and home.\" For Cartwright, though, it was only just the prelude.\n\n\"You never know what you don't know,\" he reflects from his newly adopted hometown of Nashville. \"I'm very proud of that first record and some of those songs have done very well for me, but with a whole additional year-and-a-half of hard touring and writing under my belt when we recorded 'Don't Fade,' I felt like I had a much better idea of how I wanted to sound and who I was as an artist.\"\n\nCartwright grew up in a conservative Texas home where his exposure to modern music was limited primarily to the 'Forrest Gump' soundtrack and Steven Curtis Chapman records. For his twelfth birthday, his parents gave him an acoustic guitar, and suddenly the entire world opened up. He discovered singer-songwriters and alt-country troubadours, contemporaries like Pete Yorn and classic artists like John Prine. It led him to begin penning his own songs, and by the time he hit high school, he was playing regularly in bars and churches. A summer program at NYU exposed Cartwright to the world outside of Dallas and inspired him to head even further from home to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\nCartwright worked his way through school with odd jobs in the music industry and wedding band gigs, and while they paid the bills, they left him unsatisfied and more convinced than ever that he needed to take the leap with his own music. He moved back to Texas and recorded an EP, 'Bull Run,' that earned him top honors in the B.W. Stevenson Songwriting Competition. A performance with John Fullbright led Cartwright to Oklahoma, where he collaborated with producer Wes Sharon on the self-titled debut that would break him onto the Texas radio charts.\n\nThroughout it all, Cartwright was a hustler to his core, playing 100+ shows per year without an agent or a manager, working harder than he ever had before in his life but moving closer towards his goals every day. The quality of the music and the exhilarating live performances were turning heads throughout the south, and that's when Cartwright caught the ear of fellow Texas songwriter Rob Baird, who offered to produce 'Don't Fade' with Brian Douglas Phillips at Phillips\u2019 Austin-based Rattle Trap Studio.\n\n\"We spent three or four days in total at Rob's house before we went into the studio because I had between 30-50 songs that I had written,\" remembers Cartwright. \"Rob and I went through each of them and pared the list down to figure out what made for a cohesive collection and what kind of sound we wanted to go after.\"\n\nThe sound that they ultimately landed on is instantly appealing, a warm, radio-friendly blend that calls to mind everything from Will Hoge to The Old 97's. Earworm opener \"Never Coming Back\" is an ideal showcase for Cartwright's gifts, with his silky-smooth vocals riding a laid-back drum groove punctuated by dynamic electric guitar riffs and classic rock organ swells.\n\n\"That was one of the first co-writes I ever did in Nashville,\" says Cartwright. \"I wrote it with Ty Graham, who had actually been my next door neighbor at Berklee during my freshman year. We always used to talk about girls and relationships in college, and when we sat down to write this song, the story was something we'd both experienced in our personal lives, so it came together really naturally.\"\n\nCartwright takes a darker turn on \"Busted,\" a driving, gritty tune inspired by the breakdown of a truck in the west Texas heat that mirrored the breakdown of his own crumbling relationship, while \"Nobody But You\" channels the pain of staying behind while a loved one leaves, and the sweetly emotional \"Don't Fade\" battles the inevitable passage of time. One of the most special moments for Cartwright, though, comes at the end of the EP, as the stripped-down acoustic meditation of \"Arkansas\" drifts off into an ethereal soundscape like the last rays of light at sunset.\n\n\"That ending was a very specific idea that came to me on a camping trip with my roommate,\" remembers Cartwright. \"We were spending the days and nights out in the middle of nowhere just listening to the crickets chirp and trying to figure out life, and I wanted to recreate that feeling.\"\n\nThe ability to capture such intimate, meaningful moments is the magic of Cartwright's songwriting. These are tunes about coming and going, uncertainty and change, finding yourself and what you're willing to sacrifice for your dreams.

Los Inicios\n\nBohemia Suburbana se form\u00f3 en la ciudad de Guatemala en marzo de 1992. La banda fue fundada por los guatemaltecos Juancarlos Barrios como guitarrista, Giovanni Pinz\u00f3n como vocalista, el colombiano Juan Lu\u00eds Lopera (Piolly) en el bajo y Jos\u00e9 Pedro Mollinedo en la bater\u00eda (Pepe).\n\nA esfuerzo de conciertos y bajo su propio auspicio en 1993 Bohemia Suburbana public\u00f3 su primera producci\u00f3n musical titulada Sombras en el Jard\u00edn. La misma se edit\u00f3 bajo el sello de Primera Generaci\u00f3n Records.\n\nEn \u00e9ste \u00e1lbum se encuentran las primeras versiones de los temas \u201cEn el Jard\u00edn\u201d, \u201cPeces e Iguanas\u201d , \u201cYo Te V\u00ed\u201d y cinco temas m\u00e1s; el original editado en cassette contiene \u00fanicamente ocho canciones.\n\nEn 1994 se integra a Bohemia el peruano Alvaro Rodr\u00edguez en los teclados y guitarra. Ese mismo a\u00f1o Primera Generaci\u00f3n Records en vista a la creciente demanda, decidi\u00f3 publicar una versi\u00f3n de Sombras en el Jard\u00edn en formato de disco compacto. En esta nueva edici\u00f3n se incluyeron dos nuevos temas \u201cDios es ajeno\u201d y \u201cDel-fin\u201d.\n\nBohemia planificaba sus apariciones en vivo en forma totalmente l\u00f3gica y emp\u00edrica debido a la ausencia de una escena de eventos y compa\u00f1\u00edas de producci\u00f3n que se encargaran de velar por \u00e9ste trabajo.\n\nNo obstante la aceptaci\u00f3n y poder de convocatoria de la banda fue creciendo en forma exponencial, siendo una sorpresa para lo o\u00eddos conservadores de la \u00e9poca y un reto para nuevos patrocinadores interesados en promover sus marcas y conceptos.\n\n2. Mas all\u00e1 de las fronteras\n\nEn 1995 los bohemios suburbanos viajaron a la ciudad norteamericana de Miami, Florida, para grabar y producir su siguiente placa discogr\u00e1fica. Auspiciados bajo el sello disquero RadioVox grabaron los temas que conformaron su segundo \u00e1lbum titulado Mil palabras con sus dientes.\n\nCon \u00e9sta producci\u00f3n tuvieron la oportunidad de exponerse y debutar m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de las fronteras centroamericanas. La canci\u00f3n \u201cPeces e iguanas\u201d logr\u00f3 posicionarse como una de las favoritas en muchas estaciones de radio y lleg\u00f3 a sonar en lugares que la banda jam\u00e1s pens\u00f3. As\u00ed Bohemia se vio inmersa en una intensa faena de giras y presentaciones en Guatemala, Centroam\u00e9rica, Puerto rico y otras ciudades dentro de los Estados Unidos. Por motivos personales en 1996 Alex Lobos releva las baquetas a otros bater\u00edas invitados por la banda.\n\nSe podr\u00eda decir a ojo de espectador que en 1997 Bohemia Suburbana se encontraba en un \u00e1pice de su carrera. Sus discos parec\u00edan venderse bien, la demanda por la banda en los escenarios era cada vez m\u00e1s grande. Sin embargo Bohemia sucumbi\u00f3 ante una crisis producto de la falta de orientaci\u00f3n y escaso apoyo recibido por parte de los sellos discogr\u00e1ficos; Bohemia deja los escenarios y sus integrantes toman caminos separados.\n\nEl distanciamiento de la banda se prolong\u00f3 durante dos a\u00f1os, y en 1999 los bohemios decidieron reunirse para realizar un concierto de reencuentro. Al mismo tiempo, bajo el t\u00edtulo de los Remixes y la emergencia de las circunstancia, RadioVox decidi\u00f3 publicar un disco donde se incluyeron versiones electr\u00f3nicas de las canciones conocidas de Bohemia. Estas versiones fueron remezcladas por Juancarlos Barrios durante el receso de la banda.\n\nEl concierto de reencuentro se realiz\u00f3 en la vieja Plaza de Toros en la ciudad de Guatemala y para sorpresa del grupo y los organizadores el evento rompi\u00f3 record de asistencia superando por mucho las expectativas previstas. Esto motiv\u00f3 de nuevo a los bohemios a seguir adelante y se proyectaron producir un nuevo disco.\n\nCon las ganancias del concierto decidieron retirarse una temporada a Madrid, Espa\u00f1a, con el fin de convivir de nuevo como banda y adentrarse en los estilos musicales que flu\u00edan por esos lugares. En \u00e9ste proceso Juancarlos decidi\u00f3 dejar el grupo y los bohemios acordaron reagruparse en Guatemala para seguir adelante con el proyecto.\n\n3. Cierre del milenio\n\nAs\u00ed naci\u00f3 el disco que se public\u00f3 en el 2001 con el titulo de Sub, producido por ellos mismos y bajo el auspicio del sello discogr\u00e1fico Pir\u00e1mide sound/Premier producciones.\n\nEn el escenario Alvaro Rodr\u00edguez contin\u00faa en guitarra y se integra a la banda el guatemalteco Rudy Bethancourt ejecutando los teclados y guitarras. Asimismo el colombiano Alejandro Duque (ex-Aterciopelados) se suma a la alineaci\u00f3n en los tambores.\nLos noventas fueron a\u00f1os de renovaci\u00f3n en el rock latino y por ende se dieron nuevos intereses para los productores y promotores de la m\u00fasica. Bohemia rearmada y renovada inici\u00f3 un nuevo despegue captando de a pocos la atenci\u00f3n de sus antiguos seguidores y llamando la atenci\u00f3n de nuevos adeptos. Realizaron cont\u00ednuas presentaciones en Guatemala y reiteradas incursiones a escenarios centroamericanos y estadounidenses. Esta vez con el respaldo de su disquera, los bohemios produjeron el video clip filmado para la canci\u00f3n El grito.\n\nEn marzo del 2002 la banda cumple diez a\u00f1os de existencia y para celebrarlo el quinteto realiz\u00f3 una serie de conciertos. Estas presentaciones fueron grabadas y varios de los temas fueron agrupados en un disco que publicaron en el 2003 con el t\u00edtulo Aqu\u00ed diez a\u00f1os\u2026en vivo bajo los sellos Strip Records y DLN distribution. A este disco se incluyeron nuevas versiones de estudio de los temas \u201cEn el jard\u00edn\u201d y \u201cBolsas de t\u00e9\u201d canci\u00f3n de la cual adem\u00e1s realizaron un video clip, filmado y producido en la ciudad de Nueva York.\n\nPor desdicha fue la pirater\u00eda la que acapar\u00f3 las ventas de los discos dejando a la compa\u00f1\u00eda flaca e impotente para mantener el proyecto y elevarlo a una mayor escala. Bohemia sigui\u00f3 tocando en Guatemala de forma constante, pero a inicios del 2004 se encontraron ante una crisis similar a la del 97; la banda decidi\u00f3 hacer receso para que as\u00ed cada uno de sus integrantes tuviera tiempo de estabilizar su vida personal.\n\n4. Sonido hom\u00f3nimo\n\nEn este lapso Lopera y Bethancourt decidieron mudarse a la ciudad de Miami, FL. Por su parte Rodriguez viaja a California, Duque a Colombia y Pinz\u00f3n se queda en Guatemala.\n\nEn mayo del 2007 con el soporte de una productora guatemalteca y el apoyo de viejos amigos de la banda los bohemios se reunen en la ciudad de Miami. Tras unos meses de convivencia como banda desarrollan nuevos temas, luego se disponen a grabarlos y a estudiar las posibilidades de lanzar un nuevo \u00e1lbum al mercado.\nA inicios del 2008 Bohemia realiza una serie de conciertos y presentaciones de fogueo en la isla de Puerto Rico. Despu\u00e9s de eso la banda decidi\u00f3 guardarse y enfocarse en la producci\u00f3n musical de su cuarto \u00e1lbum al que titularon simplemente Bohemia Suburbana. El mismo fu\u00e9 lanzado en formato digital y m\u00f3vil en Estados Unidos y Latinoam\u00e9rica en Enero del 2010 bajo una iniciativa de distribuci\u00f3n y promoci\u00f3n a cargo Warner Chappell y Warner Music latinoam\u00e9rica; \u00e9ste disco obtuvo la nominaci\u00f3n al premio Grammy latino en la categor\u00eda de mejor \u00e1lbum de rock a\u00f1o 2010.\n\nEsta nueva producci\u00f3n representa un giro en el estilo que ven\u00eda siguiendo la banda en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. Buscando un sonido m\u00e1s fresco Bohemia Suburbana vuelve con nuevos aires promoviendo temas como \u201cSerenidad\u201d, \u201cQuiero Decir\u201d y \u201dSobrevolar\u201d retomando de \u00e9sta forma los escenarios de Estados Unidos, Puerto Rico y Centroam\u00e9rica.\n\n5. BS20 El inicio de un nuevo ciclo\n\nEn septiembre del 2012 bohemia cierra un ciclo importante de 20 a\u00f1os de fundaci\u00f3n para lo cu\u00e1l convoca a todos los integrantes que circularon por la banda en alg\u00fan \u00e1lbum o gira. La celebraci\u00f3n se produce en 3 fechas consecutivas presentando un espect\u00e1culo compilatorio de su repertorio en las ciudades m\u00e1s importantes de su pa\u00eds natal.\n\nEl grupo se re\u00fane en el lago de Atitl\u00e1n a ensayar y montar un show sin precedentes recopilando los temas m\u00e1s representativos a lo largo de toda la trayectoria musical de la banda; la afluencia total a la celebraci\u00f3n del BS20 suma alrededor de las 25,000 personas. Paralelamente Juan Luis Lopera bajista fundador del grupo notifica su retiro de la banda acompa\u00f1ado de un abandono t\u00e1cito por parte de Rudy Bethancourt.\n\nActualmente la banda cuenta con los siguientes integrantes, los cu\u00e1les representan un 80% de la alineaci\u00f3n original:\n\nGiovanni Pinz\u00f3n (voz), Alvaro Rodr\u00edguez (guitarra y teclados), Juan Carlos Barrios (guitarra), Josu\u00e9 Garc\u00eda (bajo) y Jose Pedro Mollinedo (bater\u00eda).\n\nEntre el 2013 y 2014 la banda comenz\u00f3 a componer nuevas canciones para una nueva producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica. En septiembre del 2014 Bohemia empieza la grabaci\u00f3n de su quinto \u00e1lbum de estudio en la ciudad de Guatemala bajo la producci\u00f3n de Phil Vinall, conocido productor musical de bandas como Zo\u00e9, Placebo, Pulp y Radiohead. El nuevo disco fue mezclado por Phil Vinall y Manny Calder\u00f3n (Hello Seahorse, Enjambre, Bunbury) en diciembre 2014 en los estudios de Sonic Ranch, Texas y masterizado por Harris Newman en Grey Market Mastering, Montreal, Canad\u00e1.\n\nEl 26 de febrero de 2015, la banda lanza de forma sorpresiva a trav\u00e9s de sus redes sociales, el primer sencillo del nuevo \u00e1lbum: \"Tengo Que Llegar\". Se registran m\u00e1s de 8000 descargas la primera semana y el single aparece en el n\u00famero uno de ventas de iTunes Guatemala.\n\nEl 16 de abril de 2015, Bohemia publica Imaginaria Sonora, en formato digital y f\u00edsico. Ese mismo d\u00eda, Imaginaria Sonora se convierte en Trending Topic y aparece en el n\u00famero uno de los charts de iTunes Guatemala. El quinto \u00e1lbum de la banda contiene 12 canciones: Tengo que llegar, La Quimera, Mapa universal, Mal sabor, Perplejo, Ayai Uyui, Pero nadie, Paso al r\u00edo, D\u00eda de los muertos, Xibalb\u00e1, Irreversible sistema y Buscando conexi\u00f3n.9\n\nImaginaria Sonora es un viaje a las ra\u00edces de la banda y un salto hacia el futuro. El resultado es, seg\u00fan Pinz\u00f3n: Una propuesta ecl\u00e9ctica, esencialmente rocanrolera. Una versi\u00f3n actualizada de Bohemia. La nueva placa asume influencias del rock cl\u00e1sico e incorpora sonidos espaciales, anal\u00f3gicos, electr\u00f3nicos logrando una propuesta madura fresca y bailable. La l\u00edrica social de Pinz\u00f3n, la cr\u00edtica humanista y la poes\u00eda a ratos introspectiva y rom\u00e1ntica se empapa de la esencia volc\u00e1nica de Guatemala, acompa\u00f1a al migrante que atraviesa el desierto y al que vive las tradiciones latinoamericanas.10\n\nCon este nuevo \u00e1lbum la banda se adentra con m\u00e1s vehemencia al rock m\u00e1s energ\u00e9tico salpicado de electr\u00f3nica y por qu\u00e9 no decirlo, de experimentaci\u00f3n con elementos retro. Imaginaria sonora es precisamente la banda sonora (por ratos impredecible) de una pel\u00edcula que derrocha imaginaci\u00f3n. Y donde de nuevo, la banda vuelve a divertirse. Aqu\u00ed yacen canciones singulares y con gancho. Giovanni Pinz\u00f3n, cantante, resulta m\u00e1s terrenal y cuyo aporte a todo el conjunto de la obra es decisivo incluso en la ideolog\u00eda que acompa\u00f1a a la banda.11\n\nEl 1 de mayo de 2015, Bohemia se presenta en el expocenter de Tikal Futura para presentar: Imaginaria Sonora en vivo. Desde ya algunos medios de comunicaci\u00f3n destacan la renovaci\u00f3n de la banda y colocan la nueva producci\u00f3n como uno de los mejores discos de su carrera.12\n\nEn el a\u00f1o 2014, Bohemia Suburbana, conformada por Giovanni Pinz\u00f3n (voces), Josu\u00e9 Garc\u00eda (bajo), Alvaro Rodr\u00edguez (teclado), Juancarlos Barrios (guitarra) y Jos\u00e9 Pedro Mollinedo (bater\u00eda) se re\u00fanen para crear colectivamente su quinto disco de estudio. Consiguen la atenci\u00f3n del prestigioso productor Phil Vinall quien viaja a Guatemala para la grabaci\u00f3n de algunas canciones y luego van durante unas semanas a los estudios de Sonic Ranch en Texas para los \u00faltimos arreglos de Imaginaria Sonora.\n\nEn el 2015, lanzan los sencillos con v\u00eddeo: \"Tengo Que Llegar\" y \"Mal Sabor\", los cuales les permitieron ingresar a la rotaci\u00f3n de importantes cadenas de televisi\u00f3n y radio como MTV, asimismo, recibieron los reconocimientos de \"Mejor Canci\u00f3n\", \"Mejor V\u00eddeo\", \"Mejor Concierto\" y \"Mejor Concierto\" en los Premios 2015 del Circo del Rock en Guatemala. Ahora se encuentran en el lanzamiento de su nuevo sencillo y video \"Pero Nadie\" y lo que ser\u00e1 su Gira 2016 como pre\u00e1mbulo a la celebraci\u00f3n del 25 Aniversario de la banda en el 2017. 13\n\nGira Estados Unidos 2016\nA mediados de agosto del 2016 Bohemia Suburbana inicia una gira por California. La banda logra vender todas las entradas en su primer concierto en The Troubadour (Los Angeles) y en el Brick & Mortar de San Francisco.\n\n\n\nBohemia Suburbana es considerada por muchos como un \u00edcono de la m\u00fasica nacional guatemalteca. El inconfundible sonido postmodernista y surreal de sus composiciones han hecho de la banda una leyenda suburbana presente en la historia de Guatemala y Centro Am\u00e9rica.\n\n\nBohemia Suburbana ha compartido escenario con:\n\n\u25aa Jaguares\n\u25aa Rata Blanca\n\u25aa Caf\u00e9 Tacuba\n\u25aa Desorden P\u00fablico\n\u25aa King Chang\u00f3\n\u25aa Divididos\n\u25aa Fobia\n\u25aa El Tri\n\u25aa Juanes\n\u25aa Los Aut\u00e9nicos Decadentes\n\u25aa Aterciopelados\n\u25aa Joaqu\u00edn Sabina\n\u25aa H\u00e9roes del Silencio\n\u25aa Man\u00e1\n\u25aa Red Hot Chilli Peppers", "otherInfo": "Estaremos en el chat en vivo desde las 21:30."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "TYNAN ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9609900.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Electronic, Trap", "Time": "5:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With electronic music continuing to grow and expand, standing out may seem like a difficult task for an artist.

She managed to record two full-length albums and tour with some of the music world's biggest names even before she hit the age of 20. Her first album drew rave reviews from most critics and put her on the often rocky road toward stardom.\n\nDevon was born in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in the spring of 1982. She grew up in a household filled with music and family and friends. She admits some of her influences include Bikini Kill, Frank Zappa, and even some of the classic rock & roll groups her parents loved, like the Beatles. At a young age, Devon practiced vocal harmony with her father. Later she used his old guitar to strum out her first tentative notes. By the time she was 15, she was putting her musical talents to work, playing in front of local places for change from those who stopped to listen. There was never any other dream in her mind but music, and luckily no one to tell her it was the kind of dream that was out of reach.\n\nWhen Devon was still in her teens, she recorded her debut album, a self-titled offering filled with original songs. That album -- really, her voice on that album -- drew a lot of interest, and in the end landed her a spot touring as a side act with the very popular Dave Matthews Band. One tour turned into two. For 2001, Devon released a second album, LONG SLEEVE STORY, under the Three Word Records label. She had some pretty impressive help on her sophomore release, such as drummer Nate Brown, bassist David Saull, trumpeter John D'earth, and bass player Stefan Lessard, who also served as producer for the album.\n\nDevon's 2003 CD, UPSTATE SONGS, (City Salvage Records) was included in Rolling Stone's \u201cCritics Top Albums of 2003\u201d. Critic Julie Gerstein called the record \u201cperhaps the sweetest and most honest folk-pop album recorded this year,\u201d and added, \u201cSproule's vocal and lyrical beauty is unmatched.\"\n\n2007 brought the release of her 'getting-married' (to songwriter Paul Curreri) CD, KEEP YOUR SILVER SHINED (City Salvage/Waterbug). Produced by Jeff Romano in the heart of Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge mountains, this CD highlights Sproule\u2019s talent for combining Appalachian, folk and jazz influences. From the front porch thump of \"Old Virginia Block\" to the high lonesome traditional \"The Weeping Willow,\u201d featuring fellow Virginia-native Mary Chapin Carpenter, the record finds Sproule making another important contribution to the Great American Songbook. The New Yorker magazine: The nimble singer-guitarist Devon Sproule chronicles her ongoing love affairs with humanity, nature, and the state of Virginia. She performs with a sweet, round diction that shines through even her most ornate imagery and rambunctious melodies.

With a do-it-yourself attitude Honey Lung do things on their own terms often creating to their own desires and interests.

There are so many layers to Canadian-Colombian singer Lido Pimienta\u2019s identity that you might get lost in them. But if you did, you\u2019d be missing the point.\n\nHer multi-textural, mind-bending voice and music project what Canada\u2019s The Globe and Mail called her \u201cbold, brash, polarizing\u201d persona, which constantly confronts the powers that be. But it also reveals an embrace of the Afro- and Indigenous traditions that is at once defiant, delicate and sweetly nostalgic.\n\nPimienta\u2019s new album Miss Colombia takes her ecstatic hybridity to a new level, building on the \u201cnu\u201d intersection of electronica and cumbia established by her first two albums, Color, released in 2010, and the 2016 Polaris Prize-winning La Papessa as Canadian album of the year. The latter was the first 100% independently released, non- English or French album to win the $50,000 prize. Produced with Matt Smith, a/k/a Prince Nifty, Miss Colombia overflows with the kind of understated genius that promises yet another breakthrough.\n\nAs a Canadian global-beats trailblazer, Lido has an affinity for acts like A Tribe Called Red and Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq, but her work also resonates with British-Sri Lankan rapper MIA and she draws unabashed inspiration from the New York-bred Dominican-Trinidadian rap queen Cardi B. Miss Colombia has the effect of expanding the narrative about her dual Colombian/Canadian identity to her family\u2019s mixed roots in the Afro-Colombian and Indigenous Wayuu communities, while establishing an ambitious new sonic palette that brings her closer to home.\n\nWho or what exactly is Miss Colombia? Pimienta\u2019s new album\u2019s title was inspired by Miss Universe MC Steve Harvey\u2019s gaffe in 2015 when he mistakenly awarded the crown to Miss Colombia instead of the actual winner, Miss Philippines. The incident not only caused her to reflect on the anti-blackness she experienced as a child growing up in Barranquilla, but the fact that while her sister was groomed to be a beauty queen, she suffered through an awkward adolescence as the \u201cweird artistic tomboy\u201d of the family.\n\n\u201cSo I was like am I still Colombian or should I just keep calm and carry on because I\u2019m Canadian now?\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the premise and genesis of Miss Colombia.\u201d\n\nThe central mood of Miss Colombia coalesces around a series of moving, musical poems embracing how she\u2019s loved and lost. The journey magically documents an introspection tinged with sadness, yet still evoking a kind of optimism about experiencing the emotion in glorious repetition. \u201cTe Quer\u00eda,\u201d (I Wanted You) pulses with a kind of samba-like cumbia, floating in the memory of desire and denial. The narrator\u2019s \u201cwant\u201d is quickly dismissed by quoting 2018\u2019s Latin trap hit \u201cTe Bot\u00e9\u201d (I discarded you).\n\nAs Pimienta more firmly grounded herself in her return to the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where Miss Colombia was recorded \u201clive\u201d in rustic settings, her approach evolved from the opulent electronic crafting of La Papessa to something even more sensual and spiritual. The change in scenery helped her closer to her goal of re-contextualizing her music. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to control electronic music,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWhat\u2019s hard about electronic music is to make it sound emotional, make it sound beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe emblematic track \u201cEso Que Tu Haces,\u201d flows with an ethereal mysticism that fuses Lido\u2019s love for traditional porro and slow-building cumbia. Its unique orchestral swirl of wind instruments and synthetic sounds quickly sets the tone for Miss Colombia. On \u201cNada,\u201d she teams up with Bomba Estereo\u2019s Li Samuet, venturing further with her transcendent soprano, crafted with precision and clarity, and driven by sharp-edged metallic beats.\n\nLido clearly remembers the moment when she began her journey as a transnational, cultural mixing experiment as a singer. The brashly dynamic electro-cumbia diva had gone through several phases, starting in her early teens fronting punk and metal bands, and had become obsessed with trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack and Tricky.\n\n\u201cIt was before I moved to Canada, I was in this dance group called Cumb\u00e9 in Colombia,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy cousin was one of the drummers in the group and he told me, \u2018you know you have a really good voice, why would you waste that voice on this depressing music?\u201d\n\nPimienta\u2019s cousin then introduced her to an Afro-Colombian group called Sexteto Tabala, who she later collaborated with on the song \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves\u201d (I Want You To Save Me). Initially formed in 1996, Sexteto Tabal\u00e1 are the cultural heartbeat of Palenque and guardians of Afro-Latin musical history who can swing like a salsa band, groove like a fuji orchestra and serenade you all at the same time. They are one of the most representative musical expressions of the African communities in Colombia.\n\nPimienta credits her time in Sexteto with the development of her singing and overall aesthetic. \u201cThat\u2019s what shaped me, how I learned to have stage control,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because of some bar in Ontario; it was because I was in front of thousands of people singing Afro-Colombian spiritual music.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the flow of Miss Colombia so riveting and rewarding. Structurally it\u2019s bookended by two versions of \u201cPara Transcribir,\u201d one listed as \u201cSol,\u201d (Sun) and the other \u201cLuna\u201d (Moon), a song that tries to come to grips with Pimienta--who is fully bilingual--as a perpetual translator of cultures. The edgy playfulness of her love songs gives way to tracks like \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves,\u201d \u201cPelo Cucu,\u201d which celebrates the symbolic African texture of her hair, and \u201cResisto y Ya,\u201d which makes pointed reference to recent massive Colombian protests against the current government.\n\nWith the latter track, Lido wants to make it clear that while she shares the popular disdain for a \u201cpolitics of division\u201d that squeezes Colombians, she insists that just by being who she is, an Afro-Indigenous, queer feminist, and Canadian outsider, she has always been engaged in resistance. The setting of the recording with Sexteto Tabala in San Basilio de Palenque, a historic town settled by escaped slaves in the 17th century, allows for an expression of healing through traditional culture. \u201cThe chance has arrived/To fix our past,\u201d she sings hauntingly in the chorus of \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel like Miss Colombia is me really doing it for real,\u201d mused Lido. \u201cLike I feel everything up until this point has been happy accident or a horrible accident. This album has been a beautiful process. It\u2019s a really good representation of where I am now and where I\u2019m ready to go next.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tusks ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9149331.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bob Sinclar ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7197520.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Electronic, House Music", "Time": "12:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bob Sinclar, real name Christophe LeFriant, is a French record producer, DJ, remixer and co-owner (with DJ Yellow) of the label Yellow Productions. Sinclar started DJing in 1986, when he was just 18 years old, specializing in funk and hip-hop music, with the name Chris The French Kiss. His first club hit was Gym & Tonic, a track produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, featuring vocals illegally taken from a Jane Fonda fitness tape. The Bob Sinclar persona was based on a character from Philippe de Broca's film Le Magnifique.\n\nSinclar is famous for popularizing the \"french touch\" of house music, with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. His track \"Feel for You\", a tribute to french musician Cerrone, from his second album Champs Elys\u00e9es, hit #9 in the UK Top 40. On track \"Darlin'\", he worked with vocalist James \"D-Train\" Williams.\n\nSinclar has also worked under other pseudonyms. Under the aliases The Mighty Bop and Reminiscence Quartet, he has dabbled in hip-hop and acid jazz. He also created the Africanism project, where an ensemble of artists produce house music with a combination of latin, jazz, african and tribal flavors. In 2005 he scored a hit with his single \"Love Generation\", that reached #1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts and the German Media Control Single Charts in 2006. The song was a huge success throughout Europe, also peaking at no. 2 in the Dutch Top 40. The followup hit was \"World, Hold On\", that features Steve Edwards and also managed to chart in the top ten in most of the European countries. \"Rock this Party (Everybody Dance Now)\" followed on August 22, 2006.\n\nThe remix of \"World, Hold on\" by E-Smoove is nominated for a Grammy 2007 in the category \"Remixed Recording\". Also, \"World Hold on\" was chosen by Billboard Magazine as the number one Hot Dance Club Play Single of 2006, beating Madonna and Christina Aguilera.\n\nThe fourth single of the album 'Western Dream' called 'Tennessee' was supposed to be released in April 2007, but has been cancelled due to the rumour of a new album being released.\n\nThis album is Soundz Of Freedom. It came out in France on May 21st.

Over the last couple of years, the man originally turned on to the dance by Derrick Carter has fomented his own groove driven, emotive brand of house that now resonates around the world. Turning heads right from the off were his compilations on Deep Down and Defected, which found Sonny adding his remix flair to a bunch of classics, and after that came sophomore effort After Parties & Aeroplanes. Again a collaborative affair featuring the likes of Doorly, Gene Farris and Cajmere, it was a more jacking, sharp-edged treat designed for maximum dance floor impact, but was also stuffed with unforgettable vocals that agin saw Sonny stepping up his game.\n\n2016 saw the already influential artist stepping up yet again, this time by making his brilliant entry into the hallowed Defected In the House series. His standout contribution is a terrific three disc affair that is jam packed with his own stellar originals and remixes as well as some brand new and exclusive material (including Sonny Fodera ft. Alex Mills \u2013 \u2018Always Gonna Be,\u2019 Sonny Fodera ft. Shannon Saunders \u2018Over This\u2019 and \u2018The Definition\u2019 amongst many others). Aside from that high impact work, Sonny has also turned out a consistently excellent string of EPs on labels like Defected, Dirtybird and Visionquest, as well as remixing Rudimental. Never was he in finer form that with \u2018Let Go\u2019, a collaboration with Cervendos that sat pretty in the Beatport Deep House Top 10 for no fewer than 12 weeks in 2014, whilst more recently, his current single with Yasmin, \u2018Feelin U\u2019 shot straight in to the 2nd spot in the Beatport chart, only to be outdone by a stunning remix of Gershon Jackson on the legendary Strictly Rhythm label. As such, Sony currently has no fewer than six releases in the Beatport Deep House Top Ten, proving that he is very much creating the sounds of now for DJs and dancers everywhere.\n\nAs a result, of course, Sonny is a hugely in demand DJ who started 2016 with a 30 date tour of the UK, United States and Australia. It was his smooth technical skills in the booth that first won him the affections of Green Velvet, and nowadays he weaves his tight, seductive sets featuring all colours of the house spectrum everywhere from Footwork Toronto to Warung in Brazil, Cielo in New York City to Pacha, Sankeys, Amnesia DC10 and in Ibiza as well as We ARE FSTVL and many others.\n\nThe future is just as bright as the past for Sonny, who was born in Adelaide, Australia, and has lived between there, Ibiza, the USA and the UK since, though he is currently settled in London. It means he is fully focussed on the next chapter, which already promises to be a thrilling one for his fans, with a new album due on Defected \u2018Frequently Flying\u2019 , as well as more EPs on influential labels like Cajual and Lee Foss\u2019s highly anticipated new imprint, Repoulate Mars.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Roberto Surace ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alex & Juan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10368105.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Alex & Juan, dupla goiana formada na grande Goi\u00e2nia capital de Goi\u00e1s.

It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label.

In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa.

It had been over twenty years since the singer-songwriter had graduated from Montgomery Blair High School, yet his adolescent dreams, hopes, fears, anxieties and emotions the singer faced as a kid began flooding back; suddenly, the singer felt transported back into his teenage self. Growing up in suburban Maryland, Hutchinson\u2019s teenage years were filled with the type of alienation and private angst recognizable to most anyone who\u2019s ever been 16. Twenty-plus years later, the singer was finally ready to write about it.\n\nThe result: Class of 98, a 90\u2019s alt-rock-inspired autobiographical record that chronicles the singer-songwriter\u2019s adolescence.\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to understand myself,\u201d Hutchinson says. \u201cWriting this record allowed me to get into the time machine and go back and look around my old life and report from my current point of view. That was fun. The problems were waiting for me: Who likes me? Why doesn\u2019t this person want to be around me? Why don\u2019t I understand myself?\u201d\n\nAfter experimenting with a series of genres like Americana/soul and jazz on his last few albums Modern Happiness and Before and After Life, the singer-songwriter turned to the pop-punk alt-rock of his youth for the riff-heavy Class of 98, taking inspiration from bands like Green Day, Oasis, and Weezer. \u201cThat music is in my guitar DNA,\u201d says the singer. \u201cI love 90\u2019s music, and this type of sound was so formative for me.\u201d To help round out his sound, Hutchinson recruited Justin Sharbono (formerly of Soul Asylum) to offer his distinctive (and period appropriate) guitar playing on the album. Hutchinson also enlisted the sonic guidance and mixing talents of Paul Kolderie, who\u2019d made great 90\u2019s records with bands like Radiohead, Hole, The Lemonheads, Buffalo Tom and The Pixies.\n\nFor Hutchinson, taking such an imaginative leap with a concept as specifically personal of Class of 98 was an artistic risk he knew he needed to take. \u201cI don\u2019t think people want me to keep making the same record, as much as anyone might think they do,\u201d he says.\n\nThe opening track \u201cRock Out Tonight\u201d sets the scene with a narrative that evokes the high-drama restlessness of a group of teenagers aimlessly driving around the suburbs in a Ford Taurus. The song, says the singer, is about \u201cwanting to be rebellious, but having no idea how to do so.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, cinematic songs like \u201cDrunk at Lunch\u201d and \u201cCooler Than You\u201d show a darker underbelly of Hutchinson\u2019s high-school introversion, echoing a theme that the singer-songwriter has been tackling in his work ever since releasing his chart-topping debut LP Sounds Like This, in 2007. \u201cI\u2019m always interested in asking questions in my songs: who\u2019s cool, who gets to decide, and where do I fit into all of that?\u201d he says.\n\nBut the emotional centerpiece of Hutchinson\u2019s latest, and the song that was the most difficult to write, is \u201cMy Old Man,\u201d written in the wake of his father\u2019s passing, after years of living with Myotonic dystrophy. More than anything else on the album, the deeply personal song gets at the album\u2019s central tension of writing from the teenage perspective while simultaneously embodying the adult point of view.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t necessarily get along with my dad in high school,\u201d says the singer. \u201cWe were in different places in our lives and he had different things to worry about. I tried to sing this song from my perspective back then as well as my perspective now, where I\u2019ve made peace with him.\u201d\n\nTaken as a whole, Class of 98 arrives as Hutchinson\u2019s most playful yet distinctive work, one that will surely resonate with longtime fans of the singer\u2019s pop-rock hits like \u201cRock & Roll,\u201d \u201cTell the World,\u201d and \u201cWatching You Watch Him.\u201d For Hutchinson, the experience of delving back into his high school youth helped him learn a lot: about his upbringing, about parenthood, and about himself.\n\n\u201cI like the 90\u2019s way better,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen I\u2019m not living in them.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Fakear ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9615410.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Trip Hop, Electronic", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Electronic music like a journey without destination : here is the concept of the young French producer Fakear.

Gilmour joined Pink Floyd in 1968, when he was asked to replace former frontman and guitarist Syd Barrett. Barrett was becoming increasingly difficult to work with (partly due to substance abuse), so Gilmour stepped in to fill the void. Gilmour's contributions helped to define what would become known as the \"Pink Floyd\" sound. With Roger Waters, Gilmour co-wrote many of Pink Floyd's classic songs, including \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", \"Wish You Were Here\", \"Time\", \"Dogs\", \"Echoes\", \"Comfortably Numb\", and \"Run Like Hell\". When Waters left the band in 1984 to pursue a solo career, Gilmour took over Pink Floyd as leader, and they released two more albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), and The Division Bell (1994). Both albums performed very well, proving that the Pink Floyd name was stronger than any individual member. On July 2, 2005, David Gilmour and Roger Waters briefly set aside their differences and performed as Pink Floyd for one final performance at Live 8. The reunion was the most talked about event of the day, and sales of Pink Floyd's back catalogue shot through the roof. Rumors of a full scale tour began to surface shortly after the show, with both Gilmour and Waters being offered millions of dollars, but it wasn't meant to be. Neither Waters nor Gilmour showed much enthusiam to work together again, with Gilmour being quoted as saying that he would rather spend his time pursuing his solo career.\n\nDavid Gilmour has released 3 \"official\" solo albums (although there are numerous bootlegs of live recordings); David Gilmour (1978), About Face (1984), and On An Island (2006).\n\nThis last album, \"On An Island\" is for sale with a limited edition including a DVD which you can see live&session videos of Gilmour.", "otherInfo": "David Gilmour Live at Pompeii Broadcast Livestream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAmOdxZKWjY"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Medi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8836001.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Soul - Pop - Rock", "Time": "4:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The year 2018 was all about going back to the roots for Medi. Based on his instincts, far from today's codes and marketing strategies, he felt the need to let the music speak and sing his heart out from the depth of his soul.

The Nice native decided to start a new journey in february 2018 with new single releases \"My Life\" and \"Im In The Mood\" which have reached 400 000 streams. And this has now lead Medi to the brand new EP \"My Life\" out on June 15th 2018. And it will certainly be followed by a long awaited third album.\n\nRewind.

The album flagship single \u00ab How Would You Do It \u00bb was an international success, followed by a tour of more than a hundred concerts including a headline show at Fuji Rock as the single reached number 1 airplay in Japan.\n\nA second album entitled \u00ab One Is Not Enough \u00bb was born in 2014 and it was during that year that the Nice-based artist joined his hometown and became a producer by founding his own label Dime On with which he launched careers of artists such as David Zincke , songwriter from the UK, who's first single \"Oh My\" and debut EP has been critically acclaimed.\n\nMedi is a true entertainer never leaving the stage for too long, a songwriter, a multi-instrumentalist and recently became a music producer for artists such as Ben Mazu\u00e9, Sophie Tith, Joyce Jonathan, or Frero Delavega for which he produced their number one hit single \"Sweet Darling\".\n\nStay tuned, 2018 will be there to write the sequel to an already busy career", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cl\u00e9a Vincent ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9040568.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Pop Fran\u00e7aise", "Time": "4:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Cl\u00e9a Vincent c\u2019est d\u2019abord la musique au sens de l\u2019instrument, jouant du clavier debout depuis aussi longtemps que le conservatoire s\u2019en souvienne.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Black Coffee ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8395084.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Dance, Nu-jazz, House, Lounge", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Considering his meteoric rise to fame, it would be easy to stereotype Black Coffee as just another black diamond, a BEE beat magnet out to mine the insatiable upwardly mobile urban house party market. But as he proved on his South African Music Award-winning album \u201cHome Brewed\u201d, this DJ and producer defies convention. Sidestepping Afro-house clich\u00e9s and stage-managed highs in favour of restrained sophistication, Black Coffee's penchant is for true Afropolitan house: home-brewed but fresh and future-focused. Expect almost sculptural balance and beauty.\n\nIf one heard a clamour and ululating emanating from the eastern provinces of South Africa, KwaZulu Natal and the Eastern Cape, announcing the recognition of a cultural phenomenon.. and their role in the development of this cultural phenomenon.. one could not argue were that clamour and ululating to be in respect of one.. that is the soul, spirit, talent and vision of Nkosinathi Innocent Maphumulo, one better known as \u201cBlack Coffee\u201d.\n\nBlack Coffee was born in Durban in KwaZulu Natal and grew up in the Eastern Cape in Mthatha, before moving back to Durban to study music at Natal Tech where he majored in Jazz. His reason for studying music was because he felt that as a producer, he had to deepen his overall musical knowledge, develop his listening skills and advance his knowledge of music theory. Leaving tech prior to completion of his studies, Black Coffee with two friends Thandukwazi \u201cDemor\u201d Sikhosana and Mnqobi \u201cShota\u201d Mdabe worked as backup vocalists for the renowned Madala Kunene. Deciding then to form an urban soul trio \u201cShana\u201d the three moved to Johannesburg to make their way.\n\nKeeping \u201cSimply Hot And Naturally African\u201d (the meaning of \u201cShana\u201d) together as an ongoing project, the three also pursued their individual visions, collaborating on the way. Black Coffee was chosen as one of two South African participants in the Red Bull Music Academy in 2003 jump-starting him into the South African DJ scene - a decision he says he has never looked back on. His first big break was when his song \u201cHappiness\u201d was featured on the \u201cDJs At Work\u201d album.\n\n2005, the same year as the release of Black Coffee\u2019s powerful debut album \u201cBlack Coffee\u201d saw the birth and formation of Soulistic Music, Black Coffee\u2019s wholly owned 360\u00b0 corporate structure, his team\u2019s home base and the jump-off point for himself, and as time has evidenced for many others too. Black Coffee revealed that his first album was created using very basic music-making software. \u201cI don't know how to explain the production stages of my album because all I did was put down the basic ideas that I had, I didn't use any MIDI controllers everything was played with a computer mouse. He added that the use of live instruments in a song is also very important, giving a track that final magic touch and bringing it to life.\n\nA view through the Black Coffee \u2018lens\u2019, at the end of 2011, confirms a delightful, fresh and truly heart warming vista of dynamic and exciting creative production, glimpses of a genius unfolding and degree\u2019s of difficulty, challenge and hardship. To many Black Coffee has led the \u2018house music\u2019 way.. establishing since a global pre-eminence in vocal house music and a business approach structured to unlock the plethora of opportunities offered by a converged digital realm driven by the songs and their performance.\n\nReserved, studiously academic, inventive, imaginative, quiet, enigmatic, shy and bold are but of the few ways in which many across the world perceive Black Coffee. No matter how he is seen he remains one of the very few club DJs in the country who genuinely understands the precise function of a music disc jockey: he does not simply mix songs, he re-interprets their previously unimagined musical possibilities, adapting and arranging as each work advises and so quietly creating new works that give life. When he debuted his interpretation of Hugh Masekela\u2019s rambunctious jazz hit \u201cStimela\u201d (2005 original South African release, 2008 UK release), Black Coffee simply demonstrated how it was possible to rework the South African canon music vault into club music, creating works that were acceptable to both the young and the old, a feat not easily achievable. It has required a decidedly original-inclined, singular mind such as this to be able to pursue this kind of music trajectory and the gold and platinum awards since are testimony to his resolve .\n\n2007 brought another powerful Black Coffee release \u201cHave Another One\u201d which featured amongst others a host of great female vocalists and the likes of Bucie, Siphokhazi and Busi Mhlongo at the helm of an array of original works. With world demand and interest in a Black Coffee performance starting to stand up and shout so to speak, he began a new phase of growth in 2008 with a string of new Soulistic Music signed releases from Culoe de Song, Tumelo and the great Zakes Bantwini all achieving gold and platinum sales.\n\nIn 2009 Black Coffee dropped his third offering, titled \u2018\u2019Home Brewed\u2019\u2019, featuring Ringo Madlingozi, Zonke, Hugh Masekela, Zakes Bantwini and others, and at the South African Music Awards in 2010 he scooped two awards in the categories \u201cBest Urban Dance Album\u201d and \u201cBest Male Artist\u201d.\n\nHighlights during 2011 included a nomination for the 2011 MTV Europe Awards in the Africa, India and Middle East category for \u201cBest Worldwide Act\u201d, the launch of Africa Rising and its first presentation (which included a 24-piece orchestra along with a band and featured artists performing Black Coffee\u2019s works) at Moses Mabhida Stadium, four releases on the Soulistic Label including Culoe de Song\u2019s \u201cElevation\u201d, Sai & Ribatones \u201cHere and Now\u201d, Boddhi Satva\u2019s \u201cInvocation\u201d and the label\u2019s \u201cSoulistic Cuts\u201d and a Channel O Award for \u201cMost Talented Male Artist\u201d.\n\nIn 2012, Black Coffee\u2019s Africa Rising DVD and CD (triple CD) featuring artists such as Bucie and the soulful Toshi Tikolo on international house hit \"Buya\u201d, garnered double platinum sales status in the space of a single month and went on to win \u201cBest Dance Album\u201d at the 2013 South African Music Awards. All of this transpiring shortly after Soulistic Music announced the signing of Thembisa born rising star DJ Shimza to the imprint.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Soulistic Music under Black Coffee\u2019s leadership has built a worldwide network of exclusive track licenses, tours and agents giving Black Coffee and other Soulistic Music artists their break into the international touring market where they have become regular features in cities from Sydney to New York, London to Luanda and Los Angeles to Athens.\n\nBlack Coffee continued to grow his profile internationally during 2013, gracing the decks at Cape Town Electronic Music Festival, Southport Weekender, ADE and for Berlin\u2019s Panorama Bar, Iberian institution Circoloco and Boiler Room. He also forged a strong relationship with Bridges For Music by taking up the role of official spokesperson and ambassador for the music charity initiative.\n\nFast forward to present day and it\u2019s starkly evident that the past 24 months have been no less than a rollercoaster of career milestones, accolades and achievements for the Durban born musical mastermind. Attention grabbing performances for the likes of Ultra South Africa, FabricLive, BPM Festival, Ballantines\u2019 Boiler Room Stay True, Sonar Barcelona, Mixmag Live, SW4, an 8-date North American tour, RMBA debut tour of Japan, two consecutive seasons as a one of Circoloco\u2019s most talked about residents and a 2015 world tour this past summer which spanned 17 countries across 4 continents over 5 months has elevated Black Coffee into the realm of global superstar in waiting.\n\nIn addition to that, he also launched the Black Coffee Foundation Scholarship with SAE and Bridges For Music, scooped Breakthrough DJ and Dance Nation Of The Year for South Africa at the 2015 DJ Awards and unveiled his 5th artist album titled Pieces of Me to an African audience in September 2015. Both Pieces of Me and the debut album single We Dance Again featuring vocalist Nakhane Tour\u00e9 triumphantly laid claim to the #1 spot on iTunes and the album went on to reach double platinum status within 3 months of release.\n\nAs 2015 drew to a close, accolades continued to roll in unabated. Black Coffee became the first African DJ to be selected by BBC Radio 1 to deliver his 2-hour musical journey for the prestigious Essential Mix. Shortly thereafter, Red Bull revealed an official limited edition Black Coffee hero can and dedicated legacy website centred around celebrating the first decade of immense success achieved by SA\u2019s house music luminary. Black Coffee is the second only musical artist and first person of colour to be singled out and depicted on a Red Bull commemorative can.\n\nBlack Coffee continued his path of global domination at the 22nd annual SAMAs this past June by scooping Album of the Year, Best Dance Album and Best Engineered Album for Pieces of Me. And was also honoured with a prestigious International Achievement Award. Later that same month, Black Coffee made history by becoming the first South African to win a BET Award. He was recognized in the Best International Act: Africa category whilst attending the 3-day awards festivities in Los Angeles.\n\nNotwithstanding an already stellar year, Black Coffee surprised fans across the globe with a re-work of the Alicia Keys track In Common. Black Coffee\u2019s retake released by the award winning US songbird on July 1 as part of a 5-track remix package, has drawn unprecedented praise with many hailing it as the best version of the song. All the while, Black Coffee is still hard at work preparing the worldwide release of \u201cPieces of Me\u2019 through US record label Ultra Music later this year.\n\nFrom family, to community, to clan, to culture, to country, to the world; all are blessed with the prodigious talent and productivity of such a great creative genius, as is Black Coffee.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Saint John and the Revelations ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/440517.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Alt Folk, Alternative, Folk Rock, Rock, Indie Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"...I feel like the guy who discovered U2\" - Indie Music Express\n\n\"...these guys are Smiths 3.0\" - Eat Sleep Drink Music\n\n\"Halo demonstrates that this band from Venice, CA comes with\nremarkable depth\" - Caught in the Carousel\n\nSaint John was born in Victoria, BC, Canada.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow.

Her debut single \"You've Got That Something\" was released in Sweden in 1995. Later the same year, her Swedish breakthrough came with the single \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)\". It was slightly less successful in the USA in its 1997 release. These singles became part of the album Robyn Is Here.\n\nRobyn had her North American breakthrough in 1997 when the singles \"Show Me Love\" and \"Do You Know (What It Takes)\" were released. These singles ended up on the Billboard top 10, and both made #2 in Canada. She followed those two singles with the slightly less successful \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)\", which was the lead-off single for the 1995 Swedish release. It was ineligible for the Billboard Hot 100 at the time since it was not released as a retail single in the U.S., but did reach #32 on the Hot 100's Airplay chart, and #6 in Canada. The album offered the standard version and a remix causing the album to be re-released with this remix on it.\n\nHer following album My Truth was released in May 17, 1999, but not in the US (though it was promised to be) because her American record company RCA didn't think the album contained any potential hits. The album won rave reviews and is referred to by fans as her best album to date, even garnering her a Grammy (as did Robyn is Here both in the US and Sweden).\n\nIn 2000, Povel Ramel gave her the Karamelodiktstipendiet; a scholarship for her musical achievements where most of the reward lies in the prestige and honor, not the money.\n\nIn 2001, she contributed the song Say You'll Walk The Distance (written by J\u00f6rgen Elofsson) to the soundtrack On The Line.\n\nIn November 2002, she changed labels (from RCA to JIVE) and released the album Don't Stop The Music in Sweden. This album was also promised a US release after a few minor changes were made to it. These changes were never made and it has yet to see an American release. The title track was later covered by Swedish girl group Play, and album track \"Keep This Fire Burning\" was a single for British soul singer Beverley Knight.\n\nIn May 2004, the CD Robyn's Best was released by BMG. It is a shortened version of her first album and contains no material from her other two albums that had been previously released. It is considered by fans to be a poor attempt by her past record label to pass the album off as a greatest hits album.\n\nIn 2005, Robyn released her new single \"Be Mine\", and a month later the album titled Robyn. This music was released by Konichiwa Records, a record label she started in 2004 for the sole purpose of releasing her music. Konichiwa (Misspelling of Japanese 'Konnichi wa', which means \"Hello\") is a reference to the phrase \"Konichiwa bitches!\" by the comedian Dave Chappelle. It is also the name of a rap song in the end of her self-titled album, which is considered to be a little controversial for this young pop singer. The album entered at No. 1 on Swedish charts on May 5th, 2005.\n\nIn December 2006, Robyn released The Rakamonie EP in the UK as a preview to her more recent material. This was followed by the release of \"Konichiwa Bitches\" in March 2007. The revised edition of Robyn was released in the UK on April 2, 2007. The UK release contained new tracks \"With Every Heartbeat\" and \"Cobrastyle\" (a cover of a 2006 single by Swedish rockers Teddybears) alongside two slightly altered versions of the original songs.\n\nThe second single from the UK release was the Kleerup collaboration \"With Every Heartbeat\" which reached number 1 in the singles chart in the UK on August 12, 2007.\n\nShe is also present in EA GAMES \" Fifa 08\" with the song \"Bum Like you\".", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "VICTOR SIERRA ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7939700.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Steampunk, Electro, Rock, Gothic, Electronic, Alternative, Retro-futurism, Dieselpunk", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Victor Sierra leads you into a vaporous and multicoloured universe through unexplored paths down to a future that could have been...

Caitlyn Smith, one of Nashville's most prized writers, is one of them: and, after years spent composing songs for and with everyone from Dolly Parton to Garth Brooks to Meghan Trainor, she's finally ready to unveil all sides of her enormous talent with Starfire. Long lauded for her ability to whirl pure emotion into unforgettable tracks, Starfire is a raw, visceral journey about love, hardship and the struggle to pave your own way, all anchored by her unforgettable tone. A few minutes of listening and one thing becomes abundantly clear: there is no one better to sing the music of Caitlyn Smith than Smith herself.\n\n\"I wanted to unlock my heart and dig around inside a little,\" Smith says about the songs of Starfire, with the first five songs available now. \"And I wanted to be more vulnerable, and tell the stories I have lived. It's more of a raw process to write for myself.\"\n\nIndeed, songs like \"Before You Called Me Baby\" shake the listener to the core: blending her soulful vocals with stirring, deeply honest lyrics and instrumentation that only amplifies the organic construction, they occupy a unique space that can both blossom with a full band or be stripped down into intimate, solo experiences. Because Smith, who has toured and opened for acts such as Eric Church, Sheryl Crow and Dierks Bentley, understands not only how important the craft itself is, but also how music can \u2013 and should - transform in a live setting. With just her acoustic guitar, Smith can stun to silence.\n\nRaised in the small town of Cannon Falls, Minnesota, Smith grew up singing in the church and at county fairs \u2013 and it soon became abundantly clear that her talent stretched well beyond the ordinary. She wrote her first songs at the young age of eight, and had already convinced her parents that a career as an artist was her true path by the time she reached her teenage years. \"I released two records before I graduated high school,\" Smith recalls. \"I knew I needed to do music and nothing else.\" After a stint in Minneapolis, it was clear that Nashville was where she belonged, and she quickly became a sought-after force in the songwriting scene: so much so that even music she intended to sing herself quickly got snatched up by others, yielding her two top country hits, including the platinum \"Wasting All These Tears,\" recorded by Cassadee Pope.\n\nA celebrated force in the writer's room, Smith's also had her songs cut by Parton, Brooks and Lady Antebellum, and co-wrote Trainor's John Legend duet, \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You,\" among many others. For a while, Smith balanced her two worlds \u2013 as an artist, and a writer \u2013 while primarily focusing on the latter, working to perfect her craft and discover exactly what she wanted to say in her solo work. She released some music under her own name, but it didn't capture the spirit she ultimately wanted. \"I was shooting for something instead of singing music that was in my heart, that I loved,\" she says, as honest as ever. \"So I stepped back. I said to myself, 'the next thing that I release, I don't want to ask anybody's opinion. I want to go into the studio and make a record that I love and is true to me.'\"\n\nThat next thing became Starfire, produced by Paul Moak, who quickly became Smith's trusted collaborator. They would often bunker down at his Nashville studio, while Smith enlisted friends and colleagues for co-writes, like Gordie Sampson, Kate York and Sarah Buxton. But suddenly, some news came along: Smith was expecting a child. \"It added a beautiful layer of excitement,\" she says. \"Not only was I making a record, but I'm making a life. This little boy has been along for the ride.\"\n\nStarfire, itself, is all about growth, and what it takes to get to your most honest and true incarnation. Smith decided to trust her strengths: her soulful vocals, her strong sense of imaginative storytelling and her ability to craft melodies that exist outside of genre walls and instead focus on timelessness. But there are plenty of infectious hooks in there, too.\n\n\"We didn't want to think about genre or radio or any boundaries,\" she says. Like Chris Stapleton, Maren Morris or even Crow, she artfully blends a steady catalogue of influences and reference points, held together by stellar craft and her formidable voice. \"We wanted to make music that moved us, stay out of the way of the songs and let my voice shine through. Some songs sound more country, some sound more folk. There's a little rock and soul in there, too, which makes it a bit of a genre-less record. But it feels just right to me.\"\n\nGenreless, maybe, but full of vitality, and also downright honest. Take a song like \"This Town is Killing Me,\" about how life as an artist in Music City isn\u2019t all champagne and roses, even when there are small successes. \"It can be a such a hard, heartbreak town,\" Smith says. \"As much as you want to write those songs you know would pay the bills, if you did it every day, the artist part in you would die. There is this balance of loving this town because you get to create, but also it is just so brutal.\" Smith isn\u2019t the kind to smile and nod \u2013 instead, she turns her emotions into moments like this that manage to be about both her own experience and the human condition as a whole.\n\nAnd then there are songs like \"Tacoma,\" devastating in both its lyrics and its sheer beauty: \"I'm burning your memory one mile at a time\" Smith sings in her stunning vocal delivery to stripped-down production. Then, of course, there is the title track, which blends a pop groove with a soulful, chugging chorus. It's about how important it is to keep going even when the world wants to bring you down \u2013 an attitude that has ruled Smith's career thus far. Here, she proclaims her strength to a dynamite beat: it's one thing to have the talent to be a star, but it's another to have the will to keep your fire flaming bright.\n\n\"This whole record and process, I've been on a journey,\" she says. \u201cI've heard no many times and just kept going. I've learned that one thing is for certain: nothing is going to burn me out.\"", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.instagram.com/caitlynsmith"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Jive Aces ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9160947.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Jazz, Rockabilly, Jazz Blues, Jive, Trad Jazz, Blues, Swing, Skiffle", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The UK's No.1 jive and swing band, more info at http://www.jiveaces.com/meet-the-band", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/jiveaces"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kyle Hancharick ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7248519.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Folk-rock", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "It\u2019s always been about the music for Kyle Hancharick, a singer/songwriter from Warwick, New York.

And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music.\n\nHis journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6.\n\nKyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day.\n\nAs he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories.\n\nThroughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music.\n\nRecently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.\n\nKyle takes in the world, processes it and turns it into song with his own special touch. He has a unique take on things, a view of the world others may not necessarily notice. He continues to grow as an artist, sharing his story and messages of love and peace.\n\nAbove all, though, it\u2019s still about the music.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Adam & Elvis ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Dears ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10278828.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Indie Rock, Prog-rock, Alternative, Art Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Dears, a critically acclaimed \u201corchestral-pop-noir-romantique\u201d rock'n'roll band from Montre?al, is shaped equally by nineties rock and a broad tableau of gospel, soul, and pop music.\n\nThe band formed in 1995 and released their first album, End of a Hollywood Bedtime Story, in 2000.

Justin Fabus tells a story worthy of this time-honored and timeless tradition. In his music, the singer and songwriter exudes a raw relatability between the resounding twang of acoustic guitar and robust rhythms. Endorsed by everyone from Taste of Country to The Boot and handpicked by Donnie Wahlberg to open New Kids on the Block\u2019s Mixtape Tour in his native Pittsburgh, the troubadour transforms trials and tribulations into country anthems.\n\u201cI\u2019m from a dog-eat-dog place that\u2019s very hard to break out of,\u201d he admits. \u201cHowever, my philosophy is, \u2018If you\u2019re not going to let me through the front door, I\u2019m going to climb through the window\u2019. Pittsburgh\u2019s a blue-collar hardworking town; I write blue-collar songs. That\u2019s country music at its core. That\u2019s who I am.\u201d\nHe also continues to make major strides through simply doing what he does. 2016\u2019s self-titled Justin Fabus soared to the Top 3 of iTunes Top Country Albums chart as he performed with everyone from Garry Allan and Randy Houser to Craig Campbell. In addition to sold out headline gigs, the 2017 CMA Music Festival showcased him as an \u201cEmerging Artist.\u201d However, he reached new heights with Remedy in 2018. Boasting collaborations with Joey Henry [Frank Sinatra, John Denver, Garth Brooks] and The Voice star Tony Lucca, it crashed the Billboard New Country Albums Chart in the Top 50. Not to mention, he landed features from Paste, AXS, All Access, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and many others.\nIn the midst of this rapid rise, Justin faced a turbulent and trying time. His mother passed away after a bout with pancreatic cancer.\n\u201cIt was definitely a rough year,\u201d he sighs. \u201cMy mom was the main reason I got into music. She was always my number one fan. It took a toll on me. I was lost. After a month, I snapped out of it, because music is all I know. I put my best foot forward.\u201d\nIn January 2019, he got a little encouragement from a legend. Tweeting about how \u201cthere needed to be a country version of New Kids on the Block\u2019s \u20182 in the Morning\u2019,\u201d Donnie replied with his blessing. So, Justin recorded his take on the tune from 2008\u2019s chart-topping, The Block. The cover caught fire online and Donnie personally invited Justin to perform it at PPG Paints Arena in front of 20,000 screaming fans when New Kids On The Block\u2019s Mixtape Tour rolled through Pittsburgh in 2019.\nIn the aftermath, Justin launched his biggest solo headline run to date the Back From Hell Tour, crisscrossing the country and packing houses. However, everything set the stage for his next original body of work.\nStripping down the sound to guitar, drums, and bass as the backdrop for the same catchy and confessional storytelling, Justin ultimately adds a new edge to country by preserving its integrity.\n\u201cI want people to listen to it and feel the pain and realness of my songs,\u201d he leaves. \u201cI\u2019m never going to write songs I didn\u2019t live or haven\u2019t gone through. My style keeps progressing and growing. I\u2019m writing about loss, but I\u2019m also writing about falling in love.

Expect almost sculptural balance and beauty.\n\nIf one heard a clamour and ululating emanating from the eastern provinces of South Africa, KwaZulu Natal and the Eastern Cape, announcing the recognition of a cultural phenomenon.. and their role in the development of this cultural phenomenon.. one could not argue were that clamour and ululating to be in respect of one.. that is the soul, spirit, talent and vision of Nkosinathi Innocent Maphumulo, one better known as \u201cBlack Coffee\u201d.\n\nBlack Coffee was born in Durban in KwaZulu Natal and grew up in the Eastern Cape in Mthatha, before moving back to Durban to study music at Natal Tech where he majored in Jazz. His reason for studying music was because he felt that as a producer, he had to deepen his overall musical knowledge, develop his listening skills and advance his knowledge of music theory. Leaving tech prior to completion of his studies, Black Coffee with two friends Thandukwazi \u201cDemor\u201d Sikhosana and Mnqobi \u201cShota\u201d Mdabe worked as backup vocalists for the renowned Madala Kunene. Deciding then to form an urban soul trio \u201cShana\u201d the three moved to Johannesburg to make their way.\n\nKeeping \u201cSimply Hot And Naturally African\u201d (the meaning of \u201cShana\u201d) together as an ongoing project, the three also pursued their individual visions, collaborating on the way. Black Coffee was chosen as one of two South African participants in the Red Bull Music Academy in 2003 jump-starting him into the South African DJ scene - a decision he says he has never looked back on. His first big break was when his song \u201cHappiness\u201d was featured on the \u201cDJs At Work\u201d album.\n\n2005, the same year as the release of Black Coffee\u2019s powerful debut album \u201cBlack Coffee\u201d saw the birth and formation of Soulistic Music, Black Coffee\u2019s wholly owned 360\u00b0 corporate structure, his team\u2019s home base and the jump-off point for himself, and as time has evidenced for many others too. Black Coffee revealed that his first album was created using very basic music-making software. \u201cI don't know how to explain the production stages of my album because all I did was put down the basic ideas that I had, I didn't use any MIDI controllers everything was played with a computer mouse. He added that the use of live instruments in a song is also very important, giving a track that final magic touch and bringing it to life.\n\nA view through the Black Coffee \u2018lens\u2019, at the end of 2011, confirms a delightful, fresh and truly heart warming vista of dynamic and exciting creative production, glimpses of a genius unfolding and degree\u2019s of difficulty, challenge and hardship. To many Black Coffee has led the \u2018house music\u2019 way.. establishing since a global pre-eminence in vocal house music and a business approach structured to unlock the plethora of opportunities offered by a converged digital realm driven by the songs and their performance.\n\nReserved, studiously academic, inventive, imaginative, quiet, enigmatic, shy and bold are but of the few ways in which many across the world perceive Black Coffee. No matter how he is seen he remains one of the very few club DJs in the country who genuinely understands the precise function of a music disc jockey: he does not simply mix songs, he re-interprets their previously unimagined musical possibilities, adapting and arranging as each work advises and so quietly creating new works that give life. When he debuted his interpretation of Hugh Masekela\u2019s rambunctious jazz hit \u201cStimela\u201d (2005 original South African release, 2008 UK release), Black Coffee simply demonstrated how it was possible to rework the South African canon music vault into club music, creating works that were acceptable to both the young and the old, a feat not easily achievable. It has required a decidedly original-inclined, singular mind such as this to be able to pursue this kind of music trajectory and the gold and platinum awards since are testimony to his resolve .\n\n2007 brought another powerful Black Coffee release \u201cHave Another One\u201d which featured amongst others a host of great female vocalists and the likes of Bucie, Siphokhazi and Busi Mhlongo at the helm of an array of original works. With world demand and interest in a Black Coffee performance starting to stand up and shout so to speak, he began a new phase of growth in 2008 with a string of new Soulistic Music signed releases from Culoe de Song, Tumelo and the great Zakes Bantwini all achieving gold and platinum sales.\n\nIn 2009 Black Coffee dropped his third offering, titled \u2018\u2019Home Brewed\u2019\u2019, featuring Ringo Madlingozi, Zonke, Hugh Masekela, Zakes Bantwini and others, and at the South African Music Awards in 2010 he scooped two awards in the categories \u201cBest Urban Dance Album\u201d and \u201cBest Male Artist\u201d.\n\nHighlights during 2011 included a nomination for the 2011 MTV Europe Awards in the Africa, India and Middle East category for \u201cBest Worldwide Act\u201d, the launch of Africa Rising and its first presentation (which included a 24-piece orchestra along with a band and featured artists performing Black Coffee\u2019s works) at Moses Mabhida Stadium, four releases on the Soulistic Label including Culoe de Song\u2019s \u201cElevation\u201d, Sai & Ribatones \u201cHere and Now\u201d, Boddhi Satva\u2019s \u201cInvocation\u201d and the label\u2019s \u201cSoulistic Cuts\u201d and a Channel O Award for \u201cMost Talented Male Artist\u201d.\n\nIn 2012, Black Coffee\u2019s Africa Rising DVD and CD (triple CD) featuring artists such as Bucie and the soulful Toshi Tikolo on international house hit \"Buya\u201d, garnered double platinum sales status in the space of a single month and went on to win \u201cBest Dance Album\u201d at the 2013 South African Music Awards. All of this transpiring shortly after Soulistic Music announced the signing of Thembisa born rising star DJ Shimza to the imprint.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Soulistic Music under Black Coffee\u2019s leadership has built a worldwide network of exclusive track licenses, tours and agents giving Black Coffee and other Soulistic Music artists their break into the international touring market where they have become regular features in cities from Sydney to New York, London to Luanda and Los Angeles to Athens.\n\nBlack Coffee continued to grow his profile internationally during 2013, gracing the decks at Cape Town Electronic Music Festival, Southport Weekender, ADE and for Berlin\u2019s Panorama Bar, Iberian institution Circoloco and Boiler Room. He also forged a strong relationship with Bridges For Music by taking up the role of official spokesperson and ambassador for the music charity initiative.\n\nFast forward to present day and it\u2019s starkly evident that the past 24 months have been no less than a rollercoaster of career milestones, accolades and achievements for the Durban born musical mastermind. Attention grabbing performances for the likes of Ultra South Africa, FabricLive, BPM Festival, Ballantines\u2019 Boiler Room Stay True, Sonar Barcelona, Mixmag Live, SW4, an 8-date North American tour, RMBA debut tour of Japan, two consecutive seasons as a one of Circoloco\u2019s most talked about residents and a 2015 world tour this past summer which spanned 17 countries across 4 continents over 5 months has elevated Black Coffee into the realm of global superstar in waiting.\n\nIn addition to that, he also launched the Black Coffee Foundation Scholarship with SAE and Bridges For Music, scooped Breakthrough DJ and Dance Nation Of The Year for South Africa at the 2015 DJ Awards and unveiled his 5th artist album titled Pieces of Me to an African audience in September 2015. Both Pieces of Me and the debut album single We Dance Again featuring vocalist Nakhane Tour\u00e9 triumphantly laid claim to the #1 spot on iTunes and the album went on to reach double platinum status within 3 months of release.\n\nAs 2015 drew to a close, accolades continued to roll in unabated. Black Coffee became the first African DJ to be selected by BBC Radio 1 to deliver his 2-hour musical journey for the prestigious Essential Mix. Shortly thereafter, Red Bull revealed an official limited edition Black Coffee hero can and dedicated legacy website centred around celebrating the first decade of immense success achieved by SA\u2019s house music luminary. Black Coffee is the second only musical artist and first person of colour to be singled out and depicted on a Red Bull commemorative can.\n\nBlack Coffee continued his path of global domination at the 22nd annual SAMAs this past June by scooping Album of the Year, Best Dance Album and Best Engineered Album for Pieces of Me. And was also honoured with a prestigious International Achievement Award. Later that same month, Black Coffee made history by becoming the first South African to win a BET Award. He was recognized in the Best International Act: Africa category whilst attending the 3-day awards festivities in Los Angeles.\n\nNotwithstanding an already stellar year, Black Coffee surprised fans across the globe with a re-work of the Alicia Keys track In Common. Black Coffee\u2019s retake released by the award winning US songbird on July 1 as part of a 5-track remix package, has drawn unprecedented praise with many hailing it as the best version of the song. All the while, Black Coffee is still hard at work preparing the worldwide release of \u201cPieces of Me\u2019 through US record label Ultra Music later this year.\n\nFrom family, to community, to clan, to culture, to country, to the world; all are blessed with the prodigious talent and productivity of such a great creative genius, as is Black Coffee.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lauren Davidson Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10351084.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Urban Country", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "CMA Artist and Grammy Recording Academy Member Lauren Davidson is an Urban Country singer/songwriter who has opened for Old Dominion, LOCASH, Carly Pearce, Justin Moore and others.", "otherInfo": "LIVE From Lauren's House\nEvery Friday @ 3:00 pm est\n3 songs - 3 questions\n\n*Send your Questions & Requests to info@laurendavidsonmusic.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Robyn ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8901416.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Electronic, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Robin Miriam Carlsson aka Robyn (born June 12, 1979) is a Swedish singer and songwriter, living in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nShe scored massive successes in the summer of 2007 with her hit single \"With Every Heartbeat\" which was most notably #1 in the UK, but also had chart success in her native Sweden, the Netherlands, Ireland and Germany.\n\n\nShe is best known in the US for her 1997 song \"Do You Know (What It Takes)\". Her debut single \"You've Got That Something\" was released in Sweden in 1995. Later the same year, her Swedish breakthrough came with the single \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)\". It was slightly less successful in the USA in its 1997 release. These singles became part of the album Robyn Is Here.\n\nRobyn had her North American breakthrough in 1997 when the singles \"Show Me Love\" and \"Do You Know (What It Takes)\" were released. These singles ended up on the Billboard top 10, and both made #2 in Canada. She followed those two singles with the slightly less successful \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)\", which was the lead-off single for the 1995 Swedish release. It was ineligible for the Billboard Hot 100 at the time since it was not released as a retail single in the U.S., but did reach #32 on the Hot 100's Airplay chart, and #6 in Canada. The album offered the standard version and a remix causing the album to be re-released with this remix on it.\n\nHer following album My Truth was released in May 17, 1999, but not in the US (though it was promised to be) because her American record company RCA didn't think the album contained any potential hits. The album won rave reviews and is referred to by fans as her best album to date, even garnering her a Grammy (as did Robyn is Here both in the US and Sweden).\n\nIn 2000, Povel Ramel gave her the Karamelodiktstipendiet; a scholarship for her musical achievements where most of the reward lies in the prestige and honor, not the money.\n\nIn 2001, she contributed the song Say You'll Walk The Distance (written by J\u00f6rgen Elofsson) to the soundtrack On The Line.\n\nIn November 2002, she changed labels (from RCA to JIVE) and released the album Don't Stop The Music in Sweden. This album was also promised a US release after a few minor changes were made to it. These changes were never made and it has yet to see an American release. The title track was later covered by Swedish girl group Play, and album track \"Keep This Fire Burning\" was a single for British soul singer Beverley Knight.\n\nIn May 2004, the CD Robyn's Best was released by BMG. It is a shortened version of her first album and contains no material from her other two albums that had been previously released. It is considered by fans to be a poor attempt by her past record label to pass the album off as a greatest hits album.\n\nIn 2005, Robyn released her new single \"Be Mine\", and a month later the album titled Robyn. This music was released by Konichiwa Records, a record label she started in 2004 for the sole purpose of releasing her music. Konichiwa (Misspelling of Japanese 'Konnichi wa', which means \"Hello\") is a reference to the phrase \"Konichiwa bitches!\" by the comedian Dave Chappelle. It is also the name of a rap song in the end of her self-titled album, which is considered to be a little controversial for this young pop singer. The album entered at No. 1 on Swedish charts on May 5th, 2005.\n\nIn December 2006, Robyn released The Rakamonie EP in the UK as a preview to her more recent material. This was followed by the release of \"Konichiwa Bitches\" in March 2007. The revised edition of Robyn was released in the UK on April 2, 2007. The UK release contained new tracks \"With Every Heartbeat\" and \"Cobrastyle\" (a cover of a 2006 single by Swedish rockers Teddybears) alongside two slightly altered versions of the original songs.\n\nThe second single from the UK release was the Kleerup collaboration \"With Every Heartbeat\" which reached number 1 in the singles chart in the UK on August 12, 2007.\n\nShe is also present in EA GAMES \" Fifa 08\" with the song \"Bum Like you\".", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Phil Madsen Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8790337.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Indie Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer Songwriter from Auckland, New Zealand", "otherInfo": "Phil Madsen performing live via his home in New Zealand for all the home sick Kiwi's and Aussies in the Uk and all around the world."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ming ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10366088.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Deep House, Tech House, Tribal House, House, Electro House, Electronica, Progressive House", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "When it comes to change, you either get on board or get left behind.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "AWOLNATION ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9609563.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Indie Rock, Alternative, Rock, Indie", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "AWOLNATION crafted one of the most influential songs in years with the chart-topping, record-breaking track 'Sail.'

If they hadn't existed, the music world would have been a much poorer place. I'm especially thinking of albums like \"Sleep With The Fishes\". This influenced me a great deal.\nOn \"almost forgotten tales\" Nitze sets three poems by Dylan Thomas to music; he explains why: \"It is the sense of the absurd in his writing. His writing is a true source of inspiration to me. Jon Cale was the one who first introduced me to Thomas. I devoured everything he wrote. \"Being But Men\" is all about how simple it is to feel happiness. Something that we knew all about as children. It's so simple... but we've forgotten how to do it.

Fox called \u201cWalrus\u201d. Later he wrote the inspirational songs, \u201cGot a Song in My Heart\u201d, \u201cWind of the Spirit\u201d, \u201cDancing in a Field\u201d and many others for a year round \u201ccamp in the city\u201d program called Rise Up, this was his initiation as a recording artist.\n\nFrom there he stuffed his young family into a motorhome and, armed with a slew of new material, toured across Canada for 5 years with the group Upstream. They hauled a 350 seat theatre from town to town and set up in mall parking lots hosting community celebrations. (chronicled in the book \u201cOff The Map\u201d) He recorded 4 CDs with Upstream.\n\nIt was these experiences that forged the Russ Rosen Band sound. Roots rock with a celtic Gospel twist. Percussive guitars and fierce drums anchoring the energetic folk songs. Their 2002 release \u201cOil\u201d (Produced by Alan Shacklock - Roger Daltrey, The Alarm, Meatloaf, Jeff Beck, Mike Oldfield) and the French version \u201cHuile de paix\u201d have received high praise from listeners and critics who say it sounds like a crazy blend of The Chieftans, Dave Mathews Band and The Who.\n\nIn 2010 Russ released a compilation disc, \u201cAudio Memories, 20 years of soul tracking\u201d a collection of songs from his twenty some years of traveling and recording. This extremely diverse anthology is packed with gospel, folk, blues, and inspirational campfire songs with unique stories as part of his journey.\n\nIn 2012, with songs that were tried and tested over several years the Russ Rosen Band released \"Waiting For Abraham\", produced by Brett Ziegler. Folk to funk to dance with nods to celtic roots. The collection of songs reflect the joys and pains of Canada\u2019s history and potential future. They have performed with Graham Ord, Marcus Mosely, Greg Sczebel, Brian Houston, Jacob Moon, Norm Strauss and many others at events across the country.\n\nOn the heels of Abe, Russ released \"Songs From Christmas Tales\" which is as the title suggests, the music from the super successful and well travelled show, Christmas Tales. Russ partners with master storyteller, Justyn Rees, multi- instrumentalist Brett Ziegler and others to deliver the traditional songs and stories like you've never heard before. Since 2013 Christmas Tales has been selling out dozens of shows each year as it makes the rounds of western Canadian towns with plans to continue this annual tradition.\n\nRuss is now the artistic director at Bez Arts Hub in Langley, BC where he and his wife train and mentor emerging artists, host live music events, dance shows, workshops and all manner of arts and community interactions.", "otherInfo": "The delightful Shari Ulrich joins Russ and Sandy Rosen with music and conversation on the Bez Livestream.\nWatch live at 2:00PM Friday afternoon on the Bez Arts Hub Facebook page or YouTube channel.\nJoin the fun with live comments and interaction.\nThe video will remain available on FB and YT after the live broadcast.\n\nShari Ulrich is an award winning singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist (violin, mandolin, piano, guitar, dulcimer) who has been winning hearts with her music for over four decades.

With this 14th studio album of their impressive career, the thrashers from Essen, Germany have crafted a work of art of utmost vigor, drawing its unfailing power from the pounding heart of one of the greatest, most versatile metal bands of all time. Gods Of Violence lives and breathes!\n\nAs is often the case, it all started with a good idea. KREATOR mastermind Mille Petrozza had followed the latest news with growing concern. Especially the November 2015 Paris attacks made him realize that there had to be a continuum of human malevolence, running like a thread through the ages, from ancient times up to the present day. These thoughts led Petrozza to interlocking current events with tales from Greek mythology, eventuating in the song Gods Of Violence that was consequently chosen as the album\u2018s name giver. \u201cCurrently, religion has regained a level of importance that I would have never considered possible 20 years ago,\u201d Mille states. \u201cAn extremely dangerous polarization is taking place, giving rise to growing hate among us all. That\u2018s what I wanted to write about.\u201d\n\nLike this, a key note of the album was found that is also reflected in the sheer brutality of \u201cWorld War Now\u201d, among others. The song\u2018s deriving from the observation that we\u2018re in the middle of a World War III of sorts, but not in the way we\u2018ve always feared: A-bomb dropped, humanity wiped out. \u201cThese days, our weapons of mass destruction are called hatred and religious delusion,\u201d says Petrozza.

Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music -

Justin Fabus tells a story worthy of this time-honored and timeless tradition. In his music, the singer and songwriter exudes a raw relatability between the resounding twang of acoustic guitar and robust rhythms. Endorsed by everyone from Taste of Country to The Boot and handpicked by Donnie Wahlberg to open New Kids on the Block\u2019s Mixtape Tour in his native Pittsburgh, the troubadour transforms trials and tribulations into country anthems.\n\u201cI\u2019m from a dog-eat-dog place that\u2019s very hard to break out of,\u201d he admits. \u201cHowever, my philosophy is, \u2018If you\u2019re not going to let me through the front door, I\u2019m going to climb through the window\u2019. Pittsburgh\u2019s a blue-collar hardworking town; I write blue-collar songs. That\u2019s country music at its core. That\u2019s who I am.\u201d\nHe also continues to make major strides through simply doing what he does. 2016\u2019s self-titled Justin Fabus soared to the Top 3 of iTunes Top Country Albums chart as he performed with everyone from Garry Allan and Randy Houser to Craig Campbell. In addition to sold out headline gigs, the 2017 CMA Music Festival showcased him as an \u201cEmerging Artist.\u201d However, he reached new heights with Remedy in 2018. Boasting collaborations with Joey Henry [Frank Sinatra, John Denver, Garth Brooks] and The Voice star Tony Lucca, it crashed the Billboard New Country Albums Chart in the Top 50. Not to mention, he landed features from Paste, AXS, All Access, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and many others.\nIn the midst of this rapid rise, Justin faced a turbulent and trying time. His mother passed away after a bout with pancreatic cancer.\n\u201cIt was definitely a rough year,\u201d he sighs. \u201cMy mom was the main reason I got into music. She was always my number one fan. It took a toll on me. I was lost. After a month, I snapped out of it, because music is all I know. I put my best foot forward.\u201d\nIn January 2019, he got a little encouragement from a legend. Tweeting about how \u201cthere needed to be a country version of New Kids on the Block\u2019s \u20182 in the Morning\u2019,\u201d Donnie replied with his blessing. So, Justin recorded his take on the tune from 2008\u2019s chart-topping, The Block. The cover caught fire online and Donnie personally invited Justin to perform it at PPG Paints Arena in front of 20,000 screaming fans when New Kids On The Block\u2019s Mixtape Tour rolled through Pittsburgh in 2019.\nIn the aftermath, Justin launched his biggest solo headline run to date the Back From Hell Tour, crisscrossing the country and packing houses. However, everything set the stage for his next original body of work.\nStripping down the sound to guitar, drums, and bass as the backdrop for the same catchy and confessional storytelling, Justin ultimately adds a new edge to country by preserving its integrity.\n\u201cI want people to listen to it and feel the pain and realness of my songs,\u201d he leaves. \u201cI\u2019m never going to write songs I didn\u2019t live or haven\u2019t gone through. My style keeps progressing and growing. I\u2019m writing about loss, but I\u2019m also writing about falling in love.

Every June for decades,\ngypsies have descended upon Samois, setting up caravans in nearby meadows for the annual Django Reinhardt Festival.

Over the next decade, three further critically acclaimed albums followed; \u2018Drastic Fantastic\u2019, \u2018Tiger Suit\u2019 and \u2018Invisible Empire//Crescent Moon\u2019 in 2007, 2010 and 2013 respectively, keeping the platinum sales rolling and cementing the Scottish singer-songwriter\u2019s reputation as a major recording talent, as well as a mesmerising live artist.\n\nTunstall has toured the world many times over. She outsold every other female artist in the UK in 2005, won the 2006 Brit Award for Best British Female Solo Artist, won the Ivor Novello Best Song award for her huge, self-penned hit 'Suddenly I See\u2019, and a Q award for Track of the Year. She also landed a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and lent her tunes to a host of movies and TV shows ('Suddenly I See', used in the iconic opening scene of Meryl Streep flick 'The Devil Wears Prada').\n\n2012 and the years that followed saw a seismic shift in outlook - the loss of her father, a divorce, and a relocation to Venice Beach, California.\n\nAfter a period of healing, soul-searching, and a change of scenery, 2016 hailed the arrival of the first of a trilogy of albums, the critically acclaimed UK top 10 album - 'KIN'. The trilogy evokes, separately and in sequence, spirit, body and mind. With 'KIN' being her phoenix- from-the-ashes 'spirit' album, 2018 marked the second offering of that trilogy, the \u2018body\u2019 album \u2018WAX\u2019 - released October 5th.\n\nSpeaking about her 6th studio album, Tunstall says of \u2018WAX\u2019 \u201cI knew before I started writing that I wanted it to be an electric guitar record. It had to be visceral, about the physical, and the weight of that, and the obstacles of that. It\u2019s a record about human-ness, which we so often just write off as \u2018flaws\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe title a nod to the viscous pungency of one of the body\u2019s natural substances. \u201cWax evokes colonies of bees, candlelight, the material that the first long-playing records were made of\u201d, she explains, \u201cbut more than that, wax is produced inside your own head. You unconsciously create it, and then weirdly that same basic substance has been used for centuries to make the most lifelike replicas of human beings. It has a life glow to it. It sticks to you. We have these strange, ancient connections and relationships with wax. How odd is it that the body produces all these substances from all these holes!\u201d laughs this stoutly down-to-earth singer, songwriter and guitarist.\n\nLead single \u201cThe River\u201d, which was released August 23rd, opens with an arresting synth hook, before Tunstall\u2019s powerful voice enters, emotionally taking centre stage. The track builds with strong rhythmic guitar textures, exploding into an anthemic chorus. Heavy guitar riffs are central to this track capturing the dirt, grit and physicality of the album. Tunstall explains, \u201cit\u2019s about wanting to escape the madness in the world, escaping bad relationships, and wanting to be washed clean - emancipation through nature\u201d. The single was named one of Rolling Stone's \u2018Songs You Need To Know\u2019. The music video, directed by Alexo Wandael, premiered on Clash Magazine and features KT performing a sensual routine with dancer Alex Thomas.\n\nKT released \u2018WAX\u2019 in October 2018 via Virgin Records (UK) / Rostrum Records/ InGrooves (US / RoW). \u201cWAX\u201d entered the UK album chart at number 15 (Tunstall\u2019s 6th Top 20 album in the UK), was featured on Spotify\u2019s \u2018New Music Friday\u2019 playlist in a dozen countries worldwide and received critical acclaim from both national publications and specialist music outlets in both the UK and USA.\n\nThe Sunday Times - \u201cKiller folk-rock melodies and chord progressions; lyrics rich with emotional intelligence, candour, self-awareness and bite and vocals of immediacy\u201d\n\nThe I \u2013 \u201cFrom the moment she strikes the first meaty chord of her new album, KT sounds visceral capturing the grit of her live shows\u201d\n\nThe Sun 4* \u2013 \u201cWAX provides a gritty collection of classic rock-pop\u201d\n\nSecond single, \u2018Human Being\u2019, was released in December 2018, accompanied by a self- directed video by Tunstall which was premiered on NYLON and features an 8-year-old black belt nunchuck talent Eccaia Sampson. KT says of the video: \u201cMy vision for the video was to create a mirror between a young, crazy- talented, bold little girl, and link that burgeoning energy to a band of warrioress women\u201d. The track was playlisted by BBC Radio 2.\n\nThe last few years have seen something of a creative rebirth for Tunstall. Upon relocating to the west coast of the USA, she was accepted as one of six annual fellows for the Sundance Film Institute\u2019s Composers Lab (hosted by George Lucas\u2019s Skywalker Ranch in Northern California) and has since scored music for short and feature films.\nShe has also been awarded the Inspirational Artist gong at the Women In Music Awards and was chosen as the first ever female Grand Marshal (following the likes of Sir Sean Connery) to lead April 2018\u2019s annual New York Tartan Week parade.

Young's dad Richard, and his Uncle Fred, are two members of the iconic country-fried rock n\u2019 roots band The Kentucky HeadHunters, and the high school-aged boys came up honing their craft in the group\u2019s Practice House, a 1940s bungalow.\n\n\u201cWe grew up in the Kentucky Headhunters\u2019 rehearsal space, looking up at posters of Cream, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, the Stones, Montrose, and the Faces. We were like kids someone took in a time capsule and put in the woods,\u201d says drummer John Fred Young.\n\nLike the band\u2019s previous album and EP, Black Stone Cherry opted to self-produce and track Family Tree at David Barrick's Barrick Recording, the same studio where BSC recorded its self-titled debut and Kentucky albums . BSC also opted to not over-rehearse in advance of the album, instead preferring the immediacy and spontaneity of in the-moment takes. \u201cThere was a lot of laughter in the studio this time, and an air of comfort because we had self-produced the last few releases. It helped us get down to the nitty gritty bones of our music,\u201d says bassist Jon Lawhon. The band also entrusted guitarist and vocalist Chris Robertson to mix the album. This homespun approach perfectly suited the loose but epiphanic creative sessions that birthed Family Tree.\n\nFamily Tree boasts BSC\u2019s tried-and-true lucky number with its 13 songs, and, like all BSC releases, features songwriting contributions from each member. The result is a modern and meaty blues-based rock album, with unexpected sonic twists like punchy horn sections, barrelhouse pianos, Southern gospel organ, atmospheric synthesizer passages, and forays into funk and country.\n\nThe title track melds brawny blues riffage with BSC\u2019s most telepathic ensemble playing, showcasing the group\u2019s maturation as a unit without detracting from its Southern, hard rock wallop. The album also packs some satisfyingly surprising moments. \u201cCarry Me On Down The Road\u201d is a sleek slice of pure 1970s American rock n\u2019 roll\u2014something you would hear blaring out of a 1972 Chevy El Camino. \u201cJames Brown\u201d offers forth some stanky swamp-funk, replete with wah-wah guitars and gospel girl vocals. \u201cBad Habit,\u201d however, dripping sensual innuendo hammered home by a horny groove-rock beat, delivers some prime hooky and heavy BSC.\n\nOne Family Tree centerpiece is the rustically elegant \u201cMy Last Breath,\u201d a sweetly downhome ode to the unbreakable bonds of family. The song\u2019s goose bump-inducing call and response male and female vocal breakdown is one of those musical moments where light just shines through the speakers and you know everything is going to be alright.\n\nTwo special guests bring Family Tree full circle, one being Chris\u2019 5 year-old son singing backup on the brawny swaggering \u201cYou Got The Blues,\u201d and the other being jam band icon Warren Haynes\u2019 vocal and guitar cameo on the delta stomp of \u201cDancing In The Rain.\u201d The band first met Warren 17 years ago when they first came to New York to showcase for their new label. \u201cI remember coming to New York when we first were signed, and hearing Warren\u2019s voice behind me the minute my feet hit the street,\u201d recalls bassist Jon Lawhon. \u201cHearing him play on this track all these years later gave me chills.\u201d\n\nHaving Warren guest on the album was a wonderful gesture of \u201cyou\u2019re in the family now.\u201d It was truly a validation of all the miles the band has clocked on tour, and the dues the guys have paid being away from home. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how four good old boys from nowhere Kentucky can still be around 17 years later,\u201d singer/guitarist Chris Robertson says. Ben Wells concludes: \u201cI don\u2019t remember how life was outside of Black Stone Cherry. The four of us are family.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Chi & Greg ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10351659.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Gregory Meyer, Chi Ko", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Chi & Greg are a Brooklyn-based duo made up of Chi Ko and Gregory Meyer.

The new album mixes traditional Irish music with modern influences, creating a sound that's as wide-ranging as the band's own audience.\n\nFrom bluegrass fans and country cowboys to Deadheads, rock & rollers and Celtic fanatics, Gaelic Storm has built one of the most diverse fan bases in modern music. Matching Sweaters helps explain the broad appeal. Rooted in the songwriting of founding members Patrick Murphy and Steve Twigger, the album moves from drinking songs (\"Another Stupid Drinking Song\") to energetic instrumentals (\"The Narwhaling Cheesehead\") to rootsy pop/rockers (\"Whiskeyed Up and Womaned Out\"), gluing everything together with the spark and spirit of a band that's spent close to 20 years on the road.\n\n\"We're a touring band,\" says percussionist Ryan Lacey, who joined the lineup in 2003. \"That's how this band works.Matching Sweaters is one of the most complete albums we've done so far, because it taps into every facet of our live show.\"\n\nThose live shows date all the way back to the mid-1990s, when Gaelic Storm kicked off its career as a pub band in Santa Monica, California. By the end of the decade, the musicians had appeared in the blockbuster film \"Titanic\" (where they performed \"Irish Party in Third Class\") and laid the groundwork for a career that would eventually find them topping the Billboard World Chart five times, making appearances at mainstream music festivals such as Summerfest, Telluride and The Rock Boat Cruise, and regularly headlining the largest Irish Festivals across the country, all the while gaining a reputation as a genre-bending Irish band whose songs mix Celtic traditions with something new and unexpected. Now, with the band's 20th anniversary on the horizon, they're putting even more emphasis on those newer directions.\n\n\"We'll push the envelope, then reel it back in, then push it again,\" says Murphy. \"There's a lot of variety here, and that's why we can play country festivals, bluegrass festivals and rock festivals, and still fit in perfectly with each one. We wanted Matching Sweaters to reflect that range, so people could buy the CD and hear everything we're able to do in concert.\"\n\nWhen it came time to write Matching Sweaters' 12 songs, Murphy and Twigger teamed up with longtime friend and co-writer Steve Wehmeyer. Together, the three found inspiration in everything from old Irish newspapers (\"The Rustling Goat Gang,\" whose details were gleaned from an article about a vanishing goat herd from Waterford) to bits of conversation overheard in local pubs (\"Paddy's Rubber Arm\").\n\nIn addition to writing new songs, the musicians have continued to play new markets every year, taking the chance to stretch their boundaries \u2014 and widen their audience \u2014 whenever possible. It helps keep them on their toes.\n\n\"Playing for a new crowd is great,\" says Twigger. \"It takes you back to those early days, where you've got something to prove. We could just do Irish festivals, but why not play a crossover show where 90% of the audience doesn't know you, and you have to make them know you? That's what makes your band good.\"\n\nMatching Sweaters follows in that hard-working tradition, dishing up all the ingredients fans have come to expect from Gaelic Storm \u2014 the drinking songs, sea shanties, furiously-strummed instrumentals and sing-along melodies \u2014 while spiking the mix with newer flavors.

Whether it was \u201cLet it Be\u201d by The Beatles, \u201cBorn to Run\u201d by Bruce Springsteen (a fellow New Jersey native), or \u201cIt\u2019s My Party\u201d by Leslie Gore she was into it. A 90\u2019s baby herself, Bowman\u2019s knowledge and love for music spans decades. Inspired by pop acts and bands of the 90\u2019s in particular she knew she wanted to pursue music at an early age. After graduating high school, not having a clue how to pursue a career in music, she started going into New York City looking to meet with producers and songwriters who might want to work with her. After several failed auditions, several unreturned phone calls, and a little bit of heartbreak she met a producer who saw something in her. Bowman, only a singer at the time began recording songs written by the producer. Suggesting she start writing herself, with the melody and concept already started Bowman alongside her producer finished writing what would be her first single \u201cProblem.\u201d \u201cProblem\u201d was added to Sirius XM 20 on 20 and in 2 weeks was a top 5 requested song. Her next single \u201cKing Boy\u201d trumped her first becoming the 5th most played song of the year on Sirius XM 20 on 20 while also selling over 20,000 copies, a major feat for an independent artist.\n\nWith the success of her first 2 releases Bowman found herself writing with more and more producers/songwriters. She had been working on new music with a writer at Warner Chappell Publishing when the synch team there received a request for a song about staying warm. Alongside the producer Bowman wrote \u201cKeep Me Warm,\u201d a release that would play in a national McDonald\u2019s ad campaign for over a month, as well as receive airplay on 3 different radio formats: Top 40, Hot AC, and AC.\n\nContinuing to work alongside different writers/producers she caught the attention of Kobalt Music. A publishing company who\u2019s rosters includes the likes of Max Martin, Mumford and Sons, Simon and Garfunkel, Lionel Richie, Dixie Chicks, Beck, and countless other successful artists and songwriters. Eventually signed to a Kobalt publishing deal herself Bowman released \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d through AWAL, Kobalt\u2019s global artist services company. \u201cGood Time Good Life\u201d debuted on NBC\u2019s This Is Us, ran in a national Target ad, a national Beaches Resort ad, and was chosen by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to drive The Oscar\u2019s 2017 promo aired on ABC for over 2 months. The Oscar promo lead to Bowman\u2019s national TV debut on Good Morning America where she performed \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d followed up with a performance at the Radio Disney Music Awards, and Live with Kelly and Ryan.\n\nWith the success of \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d and a move out west (a NJ native now in Los Angeles) Bowman found herself working on music going in a slightly different direction. She was doing less co-writes and found herself writing everyday on her own. Songs started pouring out of her. Her life was changing and the music she was writing was some of the realest she had ever written. In March of 2018 Bowman found herself traveling to London to explore a new city and work on new music. A NJ native, now based in Los Angeles, traveling to London. It was on a whim that she decided to attend an open mic night where she\u2019d perform a couple of her new songs for the first time. It was at that open mic night that she would meet the 2 cowriters/producers that would bring this new direction of music, this new project, to life. Bowman traveled back to London for over a month in the summer and in the fall to work on what will be her first ever EP.

In the time before and after, Butler\u2019s been relentlessly on the road performing at everything from stadiums to state prisons. With a rocked out electric and a heartbreaking live acoustic version being released simultaneously (February 19th), Butler\u2019s latest single \u2018Tell Lucy That I Love Her\u2019 is ripped straight from the experience of performing over 150 shows in correctional facilities across the United States. Moreover, the new single exemplifies how Butler\u2019s music shines a light into some of the darkest corners of our world. He paints vivid pictures of pain and truth while exposing the glimmers of hope that only exist in those raw moments where redemption is born.\n\nThat skillful storytelling has led Butler to some unlikely venues. Shortly after the release of his debut album Reckless Son in 2016, he wrote and performed \u2018Just One\u2019, the original song for the feature length and nationally distributed documentary Generation Found - A film about teens struggling with substance abuse and special schools supporting their path to recovery. Suddenly at the center of a growing national movement, in November of 2016 Matt was invited to play a concert for the incarcerated population \u201cbehind the walls\u201d of Albany County Jail. Following a glowing response, word of the show quickly spread and requests to perform at other facilities culminated in an entire \u2018Behind the Walls\u2019 Tour of state prisons across Ohio. Afterwards, he was named a \u20182017 Leader In Mental Health Awareness\u2019 by The National Alliance On Mental Illness (NAMI). Deeply inspired by these experiences, Butler established the Just One Foundation(501c3) in 2018 which brings art with a mission and a message into underserved communities.\n\nMatt kicked off 2020 by releasing the David Bendeth (Paramore, Bruce Hornsby) produced anthem \u2018Like A River\u2019 - a track inspired by the chance to be of service that exists in each moment of everyday life. As he continues to record, Butler\u2019s new music draws heavily on the stories of people he\u2019s met on the road and behind the walls. With accessible writing and relatable characters, upcoming singles like \u2018Justice or Mercy\u2019 and \u2018Been Gone So Long\u2019 can\u2019t help but stir compassion in a listener. Each song has a transcendent quality that shows us how universal our struggles and experiences can really be.\n\nTo date, Butler has now performed in more than 30 correctional facilities across 11 states and continues this work alongside his regular touring. He\u2019s a staple figure at New York City\u2019s famous \u2018Rockwood Music Hall\u2019 and performs in venues as diverse as local high schools, yoga centers and spiritual retreats. He\u2019s also gained recognition as a sought after keynote speaker (with guitar in hand, of course).", "otherInfo": "We\u2019re bringing American Folk Art Museum's acclaimed music series to you!\n\nJoin us for performances by Taylor Plas, Matt Butler, and Miwa Gemini."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mr. V ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10337110.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Electronic, House Music, Edm", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Experiencing Mr. V\u2019s DJ sets, original productions, or remixes is like taking a trip back in time to dance music\u2019s golden age.

Coming up near Chicago in the early 90s, Intel grew up in the early days of Hip Hop with a fascination for turntablism.

It was tough, but it built character for sure.\u201d\n\nCiting his parents as the main reason he got into music, John credits them for their influence. \u201cThey are the only reason why music was introduced at an early age.\u201d John\u2019s musical tastes were formed early on by the southern rock sounds of Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers Band, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and The Black Crowes. As country music took a huge leap forward in the 1990s, John found himself in awe of one of country music\u2019s greatest entertainers, Garth Brooks.\n\nWhen it comes to the fans, the bar is set high according to John. \u201cI love the way Garth treats his fans like royalty\u2026I wanna be like that\u2026 If you\u2019ve made a long career in country music it\u2019s because your fans love you.\u201d As King puts it, \u201cEntertaining a crowd, meeting the fans, hearing their stories, seeing them have the time of their lives\u2026that is what God put me here to do\u2026that\u2019s my passion.\u201d\n\nJohn took serious interest in guitar when he realized he could figure out how to play his favorite songs, but then went on to modify them. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that I could write my own music. I started by playing familiar melodies and turning them into funny songs with lyrics about my friends.\u201d Once John settled into the position of lead singer, his voice began to change the sound of the band. \u201cOur early bands were rock bands but my voice was country. I grew up country, I talked country, and I wrote country songs.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating high school, John decided to arm himself with a music degree and went to study at the University of Georgia. It was during his time at UGA that the formation of John\u2019s musical footprint would really take shape. John\u2019s music career was in full developmental swing during his time at Georgia. \u201cMy time at UGA helped me tremendously,\u201d John said with a very serious tone. \u201cIt made me realize I could make a career out of doing what I love.\u201d\n\nHis dedication and tenacity paid off in opening slots for nationally recognized, award-winning artists-a feat that is virtually unheard of for a young, unsigned artist. This tenacity caught the attention of world renowned booking agent Kevin Neal (Jason Aldean, FGL, Cole Swindell) in 2013.\n\nIn a short time, King has been making a name for himself in Country Music. John's debut radio single, \u201cTonight Tonight,\u201d earned him his first Top 40 hit and was heard by millions of NFL fans and used to highlight CBS network\u2019s Thursday night football throughout the 2014 season.\n\nIn addition to his rising success as an artist, King is also earning national recognition as a songwriter. In early 2016, King experienced his first #1 with a song called \u201cWe Went\u201d recorded by artist Randy Houser. King co-wrote the song with friends, Matt Rogers and Justin Wilson and received a 2016 ASCAP Songwriter Award for the song's success. King has gone on to write songs for some of Country\u2019s biggest stars. King also penned the first Hootie and The Blowfish song to be released since 2005. \u201cRollin\u201d is featured on their upcoming album.\n\nJohn continues touring countless dates building his fanbase and in late 2016, signed his first management deal with Narvel Blackstock and Starstruck Entertainment. Narvel has been instrumental in the rise of Superstars like Reba, Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson. In late 2017, King released the single \"I Still Pick Up\" from his latest project. The song debuted Top 5 on the Apple Music Hot Chart and has already gained over 1 million streams. The music video recently debuted on CMT and was voted Top 10 on the countdown.\n\nKing\u2019s releases \u201cHeat Wave\u201d and \u201cNever Wanna Be\u201d both debuted on Spotify\u2019s \u201cNew Boots\u201d playlist and gained over 3 million cumulative streams. In April of 2018, King signed a major publishing deal with Sony/ATV Nashville. He is currently on tour.\n\nKing\u2019s current single, \u201cTry Saying Goodbye\u201d pulls from his storytelling prowess. It has already garnered more than 15 million streams and 30 major market radio adds including Atlanta, Boston and Seattle. It was described by Tom Roland, of Billboard Magazine, as \u201ca de facto ear worm that continues to connect.\u201d CMT stated \u201cWith fresh melodies and lyrics mixed with old school believability, John King is a serious new artist you need to have on your playlists\u201d. It was named one of Rolling Stone\u2019s Top 10 Country Songs, earning features from , Amazon, Whiskey Riff, Taste of Country and more.

R. Castillo. While a lot of artists can say the same, the influence of music on Castillo\u2019s life began years before he was born. When Castillo\u2019s father was a boy, he idolized his brother who was nine years older and in the Navy. Castillo\u2019s uncle would come home on leave from the Navy and play guitar on the front porch, and Castillo\u2019s father aspired to play just like his older brother. Tragically, his uncle lost his life serving in the Navy and his father\u2014now the oldest son and responsible for his family\u2014never learned to play like he wanted. \u201cAs he got older [my father] said, \u2018If I ever have a son, I want to put a guitar in his hands and make sure he learns to play,\u2019\u201d Castillo says, and to honor the brother he lost, Castillo\u2019s father put a guitar into his son\u2019s hands at a very early age. His mother also loved music. She encouraged him to sing and find harmonies as she introduced him to all kinds of music, and both his father and mother\u2014a \u201ccloset poet\u201d and \u201cgrammar queen,\u201d respectively\u2014encouraged their son to write. It was no surprise then when their son was fronting bands and performing his own music by the time he was 13. With the bands he was in during middle and high school, Castillo would work his own original music into sets of well-known covers at parties and festivals, and the reaction was always very positive. \u201cIt always seemed that every time I\u2019d announce, \u2018Here\u2019s a song that I wrote,\u2019 it immediately drew people in, which caught my attention,\u201d Castillo recalls. \u201cI saw that people all the sudden weren\u2019t just out there dancing and having a good time, their attention was on the song that I\u2019d written. The reaction of those first few folks\u2014they don\u2019t realize it, the influence they had\u2014as they were out there listening and giving me those words of encouragement after they heard the songs, it really encouraged me to continue with the song writing. It really set me on the path that I\u2019m on today.\u201d Despite his early success, he didn\u2019t immediately run off to Nashville to pursue a record deal; his family assumed that first he would get a college education, though they encouraged him to continue with his music while doing so. However, avoiding the temptation to quit college wasn\u2019t easy when record labels started showing interest during his sophomore year. \u201cIt kind of scared my folks a little bit, because they thought that I was just going to stop everything and pack my bags and move to Nashville. It just seemed like the right thing at that point in time.\u201d It was the advice of friend Casey Monahan at the Texas Music Office that persuaded him he could do both, a decision he\u2019s happy with in retrospect: \u201cI often look back at that moment and I know that it didn\u2019t have a huge an impact. If I had moved over there, it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. I was still able to do everything they wanted us to do, but at the same time we were still able to take care of things at home and I was able to continue my education.\u201d Over the last 15 years\u2014through his formative years, his time at the University of Texas, and up to the present day\u2014Castillo has written over a thousand songs for himself and other artists, 25 percent of which are in Spanish. His songwriting strays from that of many other artists, as his music is often more specific and personal than other artists\u2019 music. \u201cA lot of the stuff is based on life experiences and stuff that I\u2019ve gone through, personal stories,\u201d Castillo says of his songwriting. \u201cI try to take actual stories and actual experiences and lay them out in that three and a half minute length of a song.\u201d For Castillo, the joy of songwriting isn\u2019t in mass appeal, but connecting on a deeper, more-personal level with his listeners. \u201cI want to write about real things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about writing the basic love songs where everybody can relate. I want to write about stuff that people out there listening can actually hold on to and say, \u201cThat\u2019s my song. That guy wrote that song about my life and what I\u2019m going through.\u201d His latest single, \u201cThe Flip Side of Sober,\u201d was released on July 4, and is apart of a full CD release entitled The Hombre that Castillo expects to be released in late September. Other songs on the 16-track album include the classic Leo Sayer hit, \u201cMore Than I Can Say\u201d (one of his mother\u2019s favorites), and unofficial Texas High School football anthem, \u201cAny Given Friday.\u201d \u201cSome of my fellow artists and writers are like, \u2018Man you\u2019re nuts. You\u2019re the only one who would serve up that many songs in one project,\u2019\u201d Castillo remarks. \u201cBut hey, it\u2019s music. I\u2019m cranking it out.

The younger brother of Cajun fiddler Michael Doucet, Doucet has used his distinctive hybrid of folk-style fingerpicking and bluegrass-like flatpicking to strengthen the performances of Beausoleil, the band he's shared with his brother for over 21 years. With the release of his debut solo album, Quand J'ai Parti in 1991, Doucet successfully stepped into the spotlight.\nDoucet first played the guitar after recuperating from a broken arm sustained while practicing with his high school football team. Although he initially taught himself to play by using Bob Dylan and Paul Simon songbooks, Doucet became fascinated with flatpicking after listening to an album by Doc Watson.\n\nTogether with his brother and banjo player Raoul Breaux, Doucet played Cajun music in Louisiana clubs in 1975. When the project proved commercially unsuccessful, the band broke up with Doucet enrolling in college and his brother going on to form the Cajun rock band Coteau and the original lineup of Beausoleil. A turning point in Doucet's evolution as a guitarist came when he heard the playing of the late Clarence White on an album, The Kentucky Colonels 1965-1967, in 1980. Inspired by White's use of unusual chords and imaginative melodies, Doucet began to develop his own unique style.\n\nAlthough Doucet did not play on Beausoleil's first recording session in Paris, he joined the group before the recording of their debut album, The Spirit of Cajun Music, in 1976.\n\nGrand Texas Doucet moved to New Orleans, where he continues to reside, in 1980 to work at the World's Fair. In addition to his solo album and recordings with Beausoleil, Doucet was featured on albums by Chuck Guillory (Grand Texas), Octa Clark & Hector Duhon (Ensemble Encore) and Michael Doucet (Dit BeauSoleil).\nDoucet was accompanied on Quand J'ai Parti by members of Beausoleil (Michael Doucet, Jimmy Breaux, Tommy Comeaux, Billy Ware and Tommy Alesi) and influential dobro player Josh Graves, whom he met during a \"Legends of Folk Violin\" tour.\n\n\nMore to come", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Heads Up Penny ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8820270.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Pop, Rock, Country, Soul", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "We were standing outside of our practice space when we came up with the name, \u201cHeads Up Penny.\u201d You\u2019d think we may have been taking a well-deserved break during a successful practice - not this time! We were standing among guitar amps, drum stands, cymbals, pedals and cases that had been drenched from a faulty ceiling. We saw a heads up penny at the edge of the door and decided to do the best we could to keep our heads up and our spirits high.\nWe have been together for three years since then. In that time we\u2019ve been paying our dues. It\u2019s undoubtedly been work but we\u2019ve had a great time nonetheless. Playing cover shows week in and week out has given us the opportunity to hone our skills as musicians, learn how to run a business and figure out who we are and what we want out of this dream.\nThere\u2019s often a stigma that comes along with being in a cover band. It can be viewed as selling out. In our experience, a cover band can be an effectual incubator for something wildly original. For instance, if you\u2019re a chef, you\u2019re most likely cooking someone else's recipe. If you\u2019re a salesman, you\u2019re most likely selling someone else\u2019s product. If you're a musician (who's making any money), you're most likely playing someone else's music. And just like the chef who can go home and cook a meal inspired by his work and the salesman can go home and successfully convince his kid to eat broccoli, musicians can learn so much from playing other people's music. This is where we find much of the inspiration to create something of our own.\nWe\u2019ve figured out a lot. For one, it IS possible to make a living playing music - even though most won\u2019t suggest it and it\u2019s not easy or glamorous. For two, not having a boss is as good as it sounds. And for three, there\u2019s nothing else we\u2019d rather be doing.\nWe\u2019ve released two EP\u2019s of original music. \u201cWinnebago Soul\u201d came out in 2017 and \u201cOnward and Upward\u201d came out in 2018. Both EP\u2019s are available on all major streaming services. We learned a lot from the creation and production of those ten tunes. But having focused much of our time in the last three years to establish ourselves as a successful cover band, we haven\u2019t focused on original music as much as we would have liked. But now we are collectively ready for a paradigm shift. Of course, we will continue our business as a cover band with the utmost passion and professionalism, but now it is time to also devote serious attention to original music. January 2019 marks the beginning of recording our first full-length album. Our hearts are full and our faith is strong.

She is passionate about her music and her enthusiasm for life and million-dollar smile is infectious. She is full of personality and is a natural on stage! Martin\u2019s warm, powerful voice brings energy to every performance.\n\nThe Texas-native moved to Nashville in 2017 to follow her musical dreams and continues to tour across the country. She has already achieved success on the Texas Country charts. Her songs \u201cFrom Here to There\u201d (#22), \u201cDone Deal\u201d (#19), and \u201cWoman Up\u201d (#20) are all loved amongst her fans.\n\nGrowing up in Azle, Texas, the 24-year-old has always had a passion for music. She began singing in church as a child and was heavily influenced by her country music-loving Paw-Paw, who bought Martin her first guitar. Growing up on classics like Johnny Cash and Tammy Wynette, \u201cStand by Your Man\u201d was the first song she learned to sing and at age 14, she began performing at opry houses around Texas. She recorded her first EP, Falling Straight Up in Nashville at age 16 and played her first headlining concert that same year.\n\nNoting Dolly Parton, Whitney Houston, and Stevie Nicks as her musical inspirations, Martin has become known for her powerhouse vocals and sincere songwriting. In 2014, she was named one of the \u201cNew Faces of Country\u201d by Renegade Radio Nashville and was a contestant on Season 14 of American Idol. The following year, she was nominated for \u201cNew Female Vocalist of the Year\u201d at the Texas Regional Radio Music Awards. She also performed at Taste of Addison, headlined by Granger Smith, in 2017. \u201cMy greatest dream is to share what I love to do with the world, and that\u2019s to sing and make music! I love to be on stage and connect with my fans.

His unique sandy tenor and masterful blend of rhythm and melody draw comparison to Paul Simon and contemporaries Josh Ritter and Jason Mraz. He wins song competitions. He fills rooms. But most of all he moves people.\n\nFirst time listeners often are drawn to Garveys engaging performance style, accomplished musicianship, and memorable melodies. But his lyrics project a depth and sincerity that allow the observant listener to find meaning beyond the catchy hook. Meanwhile, the intricate production of his albums adds emotional depth and keeps the songs fresh play after play.\n\nThis combination of songwriting and performance strength has earned Garvey numerous awards including being named winner of the Kerrville New Folk, Rocky Mountain Folks Fest, SolarFest, Wildflower Art and Music Festival and Maine Songwriters Association songwriting competitions, voted as Most Wanted artist at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, nominated for Best Male Performer in the New England Music Awards, and a top new singer songwriter by Sirius XM's The Coffeehouse.\n\nOn his latest release, Meteors and Beating Hearts, Garvey shows further maturity as a songwriter, addressing personal and universal themes through a series of lyrical stories. Many of the songs were written as assignments for a weekly songwriting group. The challenge of writing a new song each week and presenting it to a group of artists he admires challenged and pushed Garvey to try a new approach to his songwriting.\n\nGarveys interest in music and writing began at a very young age. Both his parents are educators and his father was a songwriter. Growing up in such a musical environment in the artistically rich Northeast, Garvey developed the firm belief that songwriting is a method for bringing community together and a way for people to explore a greater depth within their own lives.\n\nOriginally a drummer, he picked up the guitar in his teens, in part because his best friend was better with the sticks and together they could start a rock band. But this rhythmic background remains at the core of his musical style. He merges syncopated bass lines with melodic leads to create a full sound from his acoustic guitar.\n\nThe themes of community and living with intention run deep for Garvey, from the musical memories of his youth to his ease in developing relationships with audiences and fellow artists. He builds upon on the energy of live performance to deliver a memorable experience in a way that has led folk stalwarts Vance Gilbert and David Wilcox to proclaim the tradition of acoustic music is in good hands with Connor Garvey.\n\n*2015 Rocky Mountain Folks Fest Main Stage Performer\n\n*2015 Kerrville Folk Festival Main Stage Performer\n\n*2014 Kerrville Folk Festival Grassyhill NEW FOLK WINNER\n\n*2014 Rocky Mountain Folks Fest Singer Songwriter Showcase Winner\n\n*2014 SolarfestSinger-Songwriter Showcase Winner\n\n*2014 Nominee for New England Music Award Best Male Artist\n\n*2014 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival MOST WANTED Artist (crowd voted)\n\n*2012 Winner of Wildflower Festival Singer Songwriter Competition\n\n*2010, 2011, & 2012 Rocky Mountain Folks Fest Singer Songwriter Honorable Mention\n\n*2011, 2012, & 2013 Telluride Troubadour Competition Honorable Mention\n\n*2011 Winner of Maine Songwriters Associations Annual Songwriting Competition\n\n*Top 6 Sirius XM's The Coffeehouse's New Singer Songwriter of 2010", "otherInfo": "Moving our Falmouth Coffee House show to the digital realm!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Danny Kensy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7503491.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Songwriter, Country", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "I'm a Rad Records Nashville, CMA, TCMA, EACM and ASCAP artist who is also with NSAI.

Symphonic compositions flow from her fingertips effortlessly, with sound ranging from transcendental folk-pop to virtuosic instrumentals. Christie is often described as \u2018Michael Hedges meets Joni Mitchell and Dave Matthews,\u201d integrating melodic pop lyricism with catchy hooks and percussive, harmonic textures. As an Official Showcase Artist at Folk Alliance International consistently logging a number of major festivals, events, opera houses and theaters nationwide, Christie Len\u00e9e performs with radiant joy that awes crowds and inspires fellow musicians. She recently told Digital Journal that \"years ago, I set my intention to be an inspirational songwriter, though over time I've come to realize that inspiration comes in many forms. Talking about the dark and the light, the beauty and moments of pain are all forms of inspiration.\"\n\nChristie has shared stages with Tommy Emmanuel, Tim Reynolds (Dave Matthews Band), Andy McKee, and Amy Ray (Indigo Girls) to name a few, who have all raved about her talents (see below). Her first place victory in the acclaimed 2017 International Fingerstyle Guitar Championship has earned her featured coverage in Guitar Player Magazine, Acoustic Guitar Magazine, and Premier Guitar. She has released five albums, with \u201cSTAY\u201d one of three finalists for \u201cBest CD of 2016\u201d (Indie Acoustic Project Awards). The album includes three instrumentals produced by Grammy Award Winning producer Will Ackerman, founder of Windham Hill Records, and a music video for the title track supporting a movement on suicide prevention.\n\nChristie\u2019s live shows present a menu of percussive and sonic effects, larger than life sounding instruments, her solo shows embody layers of orchestral elements with a wide array of dynamics and harmonic textures. In 2018 Christie released an arrangement of Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d which garnered media attention across several Digital Publications. AXS.com's Jim Wood noted \"through the use of harmonics and tapping, Len\u00e9e's infectious style utilizes all parts of the guitar and combines elements of folk, rock and pop into one tasty and eclectic musical stew.\"\n\nWith over 12,000 fans on Facebook and nearly half a million plays on YouTube, Christie continues to spread the love of music through live performance, radio airplay and appearances on multiple television stations. Her most recent music video \"Call My Heart Back Home\" premiered via Acoustic Guitar Magazine. Her next video, \u201cFree World Citizen\u201d, is an anthem expressing the connection of all beings.

The new album mixes traditional Irish music with modern influences, creating a sound that's as wide-ranging as the band's own audience.\n\nFrom bluegrass fans and country cowboys to Deadheads, rock & rollers and Celtic fanatics, Gaelic Storm has built one of the most diverse fan bases in modern music. Matching Sweaters helps explain the broad appeal. Rooted in the songwriting of founding members Patrick Murphy and Steve Twigger, the album moves from drinking songs (\"Another Stupid Drinking Song\") to energetic instrumentals (\"The Narwhaling Cheesehead\") to rootsy pop/rockers (\"Whiskeyed Up and Womaned Out\"), gluing everything together with the spark and spirit of a band that's spent close to 20 years on the road.\n\n\"We're a touring band,\" says percussionist Ryan Lacey, who joined the lineup in 2003. \"That's how this band works.Matching Sweaters is one of the most complete albums we've done so far, because it taps into every facet of our live show.\"\n\nThose live shows date all the way back to the mid-1990s, when Gaelic Storm kicked off its career as a pub band in Santa Monica, California. By the end of the decade, the musicians had appeared in the blockbuster film \"Titanic\" (where they performed \"Irish Party in Third Class\") and laid the groundwork for a career that would eventually find them topping the Billboard World Chart five times, making appearances at mainstream music festivals such as Summerfest, Telluride and The Rock Boat Cruise, and regularly headlining the largest Irish Festivals across the country, all the while gaining a reputation as a genre-bending Irish band whose songs mix Celtic traditions with something new and unexpected. Now, with the band's 20th anniversary on the horizon, they're putting even more emphasis on those newer directions.\n\n\"We'll push the envelope, then reel it back in, then push it again,\" says Murphy. \"There's a lot of variety here, and that's why we can play country festivals, bluegrass festivals and rock festivals, and still fit in perfectly with each one. We wanted Matching Sweaters to reflect that range, so people could buy the CD and hear everything we're able to do in concert.\"\n\nWhen it came time to write Matching Sweaters' 12 songs, Murphy and Twigger teamed up with longtime friend and co-writer Steve Wehmeyer. Together, the three found inspiration in everything from old Irish newspapers (\"The Rustling Goat Gang,\" whose details were gleaned from an article about a vanishing goat herd from Waterford) to bits of conversation overheard in local pubs (\"Paddy's Rubber Arm\").\n\nIn addition to writing new songs, the musicians have continued to play new markets every year, taking the chance to stretch their boundaries \u2014 and widen their audience \u2014 whenever possible. It helps keep them on their toes.\n\n\"Playing for a new crowd is great,\" says Twigger. \"It takes you back to those early days, where you've got something to prove. We could just do Irish festivals, but why not play a crossover show where 90% of the audience doesn't know you, and you have to make them know you? That's what makes your band good.\"\n\nMatching Sweaters follows in that hard-working tradition, dishing up all the ingredients fans have come to expect from Gaelic Storm \u2014 the drinking songs, sea shanties, furiously-strummed instrumentals and sing-along melodies \u2014 while spiking the mix with newer flavors.

With acoustic and electric ingredients and unique combinations of guitar, mandolin, slide and lap steel with savory bass, hearty drums and, of course, a heapin\u2019 helpin\u2019 of the wizard\u2019s magic on Hammond B-3 Organ and keyboards, the result is a most satisfying blend of natural organic grooves that challenges genre boundaries. Their chemistry is the focus from which they create a spontaneous and high art where the sky is the limit musically. They offer an exciting, often psychedelic musical journey that keeps audiences dancing and smiling (and some staring in amazement) for several hours.

In the time before and after, Butler\u2019s been relentlessly on the road performing at everything from stadiums to state prisons. With a rocked out electric and a heartbreaking live acoustic version being released simultaneously (February 19th), Butler\u2019s latest single \u2018Tell Lucy That I Love Her\u2019 is ripped straight from the experience of performing over 150 shows in correctional facilities across the United States. Moreover, the new single exemplifies how Butler\u2019s music shines a light into some of the darkest corners of our world. He paints vivid pictures of pain and truth while exposing the glimmers of hope that only exist in those raw moments where redemption is born.\n\nThat skillful storytelling has led Butler to some unlikely venues. Shortly after the release of his debut album Reckless Son in 2016, he wrote and performed \u2018Just One\u2019, the original song for the feature length and nationally distributed documentary Generation Found - A film about teens struggling with substance abuse and special schools supporting their path to recovery. Suddenly at the center of a growing national movement, in November of 2016 Matt was invited to play a concert for the incarcerated population \u201cbehind the walls\u201d of Albany County Jail. Following a glowing response, word of the show quickly spread and requests to perform at other facilities culminated in an entire \u2018Behind the Walls\u2019 Tour of state prisons across Ohio. Afterwards, he was named a \u20182017 Leader In Mental Health Awareness\u2019 by The National Alliance On Mental Illness (NAMI). Deeply inspired by these experiences, Butler established the Just One Foundation(501c3) in 2018 which brings art with a mission and a message into underserved communities.\n\nMatt kicked off 2020 by releasing the David Bendeth (Paramore, Bruce Hornsby) produced anthem \u2018Like A River\u2019 - a track inspired by the chance to be of service that exists in each moment of everyday life. As he continues to record, Butler\u2019s new music draws heavily on the stories of people he\u2019s met on the road and behind the walls. With accessible writing and relatable characters, upcoming singles like \u2018Justice or Mercy\u2019 and \u2018Been Gone So Long\u2019 can\u2019t help but stir compassion in a listener. Each song has a transcendent quality that shows us how universal our struggles and experiences can really be.\n\nTo date, Butler has now performed in more than 30 correctional facilities across 11 states and continues this work alongside his regular touring. He\u2019s a staple figure at New York City\u2019s famous \u2018Rockwood Music Hall\u2019 and performs in venues as diverse as local high schools, yoga centers and spiritual retreats. He\u2019s also gained recognition as a sought after keynote speaker (with guitar in hand, of course).", "otherInfo": "We\u2019re bringing American Folk Art Museum's acclaimed music series to you!\n\nJoin us for performances by Taylor Plas, Matt Butler, and Miwa Gemini."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "KITTEN ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8490824.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Pop, Alternative", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Growing up in LA, KITTEN\u2019s Chloe Chaidez never learned about limitations in her life, only possibilities.

The younger brother of Cajun fiddler Michael Doucet, Doucet has used his distinctive hybrid of folk-style fingerpicking and bluegrass-like flatpicking to strengthen the performances of Beausoleil, the band he's shared with his brother for over 21 years. With the release of his debut solo album, Quand J'ai Parti in 1991, Doucet successfully stepped into the spotlight.\nDoucet first played the guitar after recuperating from a broken arm sustained while practicing with his high school football team. Although he initially taught himself to play by using Bob Dylan and Paul Simon songbooks, Doucet became fascinated with flatpicking after listening to an album by Doc Watson.\n\nTogether with his brother and banjo player Raoul Breaux, Doucet played Cajun music in Louisiana clubs in 1975. When the project proved commercially unsuccessful, the band broke up with Doucet enrolling in college and his brother going on to form the Cajun rock band Coteau and the original lineup of Beausoleil. A turning point in Doucet's evolution as a guitarist came when he heard the playing of the late Clarence White on an album, The Kentucky Colonels 1965-1967, in 1980. Inspired by White's use of unusual chords and imaginative melodies, Doucet began to develop his own unique style.\n\nAlthough Doucet did not play on Beausoleil's first recording session in Paris, he joined the group before the recording of their debut album, The Spirit of Cajun Music, in 1976.\n\nGrand Texas Doucet moved to New Orleans, where he continues to reside, in 1980 to work at the World's Fair. In addition to his solo album and recordings with Beausoleil, Doucet was featured on albums by Chuck Guillory (Grand Texas), Octa Clark & Hector Duhon (Ensemble Encore) and Michael Doucet (Dit BeauSoleil).\nDoucet was accompanied on Quand J'ai Parti by members of Beausoleil (Michael Doucet, Jimmy Breaux, Tommy Comeaux, Billy Ware and Tommy Alesi) and influential dobro player Josh Graves, whom he met during a \"Legends of Folk Violin\" tour.\n\n\nMore to come", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John King ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10363399.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Country, Southern Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Drive, paired with raw talent and business savvy took this young man out of a little mountain town in Georgia and into the spotlight opening for award-winning artists, writing number 1 songs, and touring over 150 dates a year.\n\nKing grew up working with his hands, building work ethic as he built structures. \u201cThose jobs made me who I am,\u201d says John. \u201cI started off working rock construction, putting in fireplaces, and walkways at about 14 or 15. It was tough, but it built character for sure.\u201d\n\nCiting his parents as the main reason he got into music, John credits them for their influence. \u201cThey are the only reason why music was introduced at an early age.\u201d John\u2019s musical tastes were formed early on by the southern rock sounds of Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers Band, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and The Black Crowes. As country music took a huge leap forward in the 1990s, John found himself in awe of one of country music\u2019s greatest entertainers, Garth Brooks.\n\nWhen it comes to the fans, the bar is set high according to John. \u201cI love the way Garth treats his fans like royalty\u2026I wanna be like that\u2026 If you\u2019ve made a long career in country music it\u2019s because your fans love you.\u201d As King puts it, \u201cEntertaining a crowd, meeting the fans, hearing their stories, seeing them have the time of their lives\u2026that is what God put me here to do\u2026that\u2019s my passion.\u201d\n\nJohn took serious interest in guitar when he realized he could figure out how to play his favorite songs, but then went on to modify them. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that I could write my own music. I started by playing familiar melodies and turning them into funny songs with lyrics about my friends.\u201d Once John settled into the position of lead singer, his voice began to change the sound of the band. \u201cOur early bands were rock bands but my voice was country. I grew up country, I talked country, and I wrote country songs.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating high school, John decided to arm himself with a music degree and went to study at the University of Georgia. It was during his time at UGA that the formation of John\u2019s musical footprint would really take shape. John\u2019s music career was in full developmental swing during his time at Georgia. \u201cMy time at UGA helped me tremendously,\u201d John said with a very serious tone. \u201cIt made me realize I could make a career out of doing what I love.\u201d\n\nHis dedication and tenacity paid off in opening slots for nationally recognized, award-winning artists-a feat that is virtually unheard of for a young, unsigned artist. This tenacity caught the attention of world renowned booking agent Kevin Neal (Jason Aldean, FGL, Cole Swindell) in 2013.\n\nIn a short time, King has been making a name for himself in Country Music. John's debut radio single, \u201cTonight Tonight,\u201d earned him his first Top 40 hit and was heard by millions of NFL fans and used to highlight CBS network\u2019s Thursday night football throughout the 2014 season.\n\nIn addition to his rising success as an artist, King is also earning national recognition as a songwriter. In early 2016, King experienced his first #1 with a song called \u201cWe Went\u201d recorded by artist Randy Houser. King co-wrote the song with friends, Matt Rogers and Justin Wilson and received a 2016 ASCAP Songwriter Award for the song's success. King has gone on to write songs for some of Country\u2019s biggest stars. King also penned the first Hootie and The Blowfish song to be released since 2005. \u201cRollin\u201d is featured on their upcoming album.\n\nJohn continues touring countless dates building his fanbase and in late 2016, signed his first management deal with Narvel Blackstock and Starstruck Entertainment. Narvel has been instrumental in the rise of Superstars like Reba, Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson. In late 2017, King released the single \"I Still Pick Up\" from his latest project. The song debuted Top 5 on the Apple Music Hot Chart and has already gained over 1 million streams. The music video recently debuted on CMT and was voted Top 10 on the countdown.\n\nKing\u2019s releases \u201cHeat Wave\u201d and \u201cNever Wanna Be\u201d both debuted on Spotify\u2019s \u201cNew Boots\u201d playlist and gained over 3 million cumulative streams. In April of 2018, King signed a major publishing deal with Sony/ATV Nashville. He is currently on tour.\n\nKing\u2019s current single, \u201cTry Saying Goodbye\u201d pulls from his storytelling prowess. It has already garnered more than 15 million streams and 30 major market radio adds including Atlanta, Boston and Seattle. It was described by Tom Roland, of Billboard Magazine, as \u201ca de facto ear worm that continues to connect.\u201d CMT stated \u201cWith fresh melodies and lyrics mixed with old school believability, John King is a serious new artist you need to have on your playlists\u201d.

R. Castillo. While a lot of artists can say the same, the influence of music on Castillo\u2019s life began years before he was born. When Castillo\u2019s father was a boy, he idolized his brother who was nine years older and in the Navy. Castillo\u2019s uncle would come home on leave from the Navy and play guitar on the front porch, and Castillo\u2019s father aspired to play just like his older brother. Tragically, his uncle lost his life serving in the Navy and his father\u2014now the oldest son and responsible for his family\u2014never learned to play like he wanted. \u201cAs he got older [my father] said, \u2018If I ever have a son, I want to put a guitar in his hands and make sure he learns to play,\u2019\u201d Castillo says, and to honor the brother he lost, Castillo\u2019s father put a guitar into his son\u2019s hands at a very early age. His mother also loved music. She encouraged him to sing and find harmonies as she introduced him to all kinds of music, and both his father and mother\u2014a \u201ccloset poet\u201d and \u201cgrammar queen,\u201d respectively\u2014encouraged their son to write. It was no surprise then when their son was fronting bands and performing his own music by the time he was 13. With the bands he was in during middle and high school, Castillo would work his own original music into sets of well-known covers at parties and festivals, and the reaction was always very positive. \u201cIt always seemed that every time I\u2019d announce, \u2018Here\u2019s a song that I wrote,\u2019 it immediately drew people in, which caught my attention,\u201d Castillo recalls. \u201cI saw that people all the sudden weren\u2019t just out there dancing and having a good time, their attention was on the song that I\u2019d written. The reaction of those first few folks\u2014they don\u2019t realize it, the influence they had\u2014as they were out there listening and giving me those words of encouragement after they heard the songs, it really encouraged me to continue with the song writing. It really set me on the path that I\u2019m on today.\u201d Despite his early success, he didn\u2019t immediately run off to Nashville to pursue a record deal; his family assumed that first he would get a college education, though they encouraged him to continue with his music while doing so. However, avoiding the temptation to quit college wasn\u2019t easy when record labels started showing interest during his sophomore year. \u201cIt kind of scared my folks a little bit, because they thought that I was just going to stop everything and pack my bags and move to Nashville. It just seemed like the right thing at that point in time.\u201d It was the advice of friend Casey Monahan at the Texas Music Office that persuaded him he could do both, a decision he\u2019s happy with in retrospect: \u201cI often look back at that moment and I know that it didn\u2019t have a huge an impact. If I had moved over there, it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. I was still able to do everything they wanted us to do, but at the same time we were still able to take care of things at home and I was able to continue my education.\u201d Over the last 15 years\u2014through his formative years, his time at the University of Texas, and up to the present day\u2014Castillo has written over a thousand songs for himself and other artists, 25 percent of which are in Spanish. His songwriting strays from that of many other artists, as his music is often more specific and personal than other artists\u2019 music. \u201cA lot of the stuff is based on life experiences and stuff that I\u2019ve gone through, personal stories,\u201d Castillo says of his songwriting. \u201cI try to take actual stories and actual experiences and lay them out in that three and a half minute length of a song.\u201d For Castillo, the joy of songwriting isn\u2019t in mass appeal, but connecting on a deeper, more-personal level with his listeners. \u201cI want to write about real things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about writing the basic love songs where everybody can relate. I want to write about stuff that people out there listening can actually hold on to and say, \u201cThat\u2019s my song. That guy wrote that song about my life and what I\u2019m going through.\u201d His latest single, \u201cThe Flip Side of Sober,\u201d was released on July 4, and is apart of a full CD release entitled The Hombre that Castillo expects to be released in late September. Other songs on the 16-track album include the classic Leo Sayer hit, \u201cMore Than I Can Say\u201d (one of his mother\u2019s favorites), and unofficial Texas High School football anthem, \u201cAny Given Friday.\u201d \u201cSome of my fellow artists and writers are like, \u2018Man you\u2019re nuts. You\u2019re the only one who would serve up that many songs in one project,\u2019\u201d Castillo remarks. \u201cBut hey, it\u2019s music. I\u2019m cranking it out.

Though he remains among the most pop-friendly of today's singer-songwriters - his songs regularly appear in hit movie and TV soundtracks , fans say he has bridged the gulf between the modern folk sound and the populist traditions of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger more successfully than any of his songwriting peers. According to an article by Stephen Thanabalan in Rolling Stone Magazine, Paul's style has also been most notably influential in the late 1990s thru mid 2000s with his prescience vis a vis his unique music and sound: featuring a combination of dextrously deep and smooth vocals as well as raw guitar 'roots' stylistics; emulated most evidently in the industry in ensuing years with the mainstream emergence of melancholic rock and folk pop solo artistes like Rascal Flatts, James Blunt, Damien Rice and Jack Johnson.", "otherInfo": "ELLIS PAUL\u2019S TRAVELING MEDICINE SHOW Returns this Friday May 8th at 7:30pm EST on Facebook Live at Ellis Paul Music and More!

This principle governs Erelli\u2019s approach to his craft, and is uniquely evident on his latest release, Mixtape, which features revelatory reinterpretations of songs by the Grateful Dead, Neko Case, Roy Orbison and others.\n\nErelli\u2019s two decade career highlights include 11 solo albums, stints accompanying Josh Ritter, Paula Cole and Anais Mitchell, and a pair of records he produced for GRAMMY-winning songwriter Lori McKenna. Ever since Billboard magazine heralded the \u201csimple, atmospheric grace\u201d of his Signature Sounds debut, Erelli\u2019s belief in the sacredness of an examined life has driven him between the ostensible extremes of lullabies and murder ballads, western swing and protest anthems.

I loved Sergio Mendes\u2019 songs, liked John Hartford on the Glenn Campbell Show and really got into James Taylor and Joni Mitchell who I still consider my two main influences. I also loved the singer-songwriters of the time including Carole King and Laura Nyro and later fell in love with Steely Dan\u2019s music, and just wore out my copy of Hubert Laws\u2019 Rite Of Spring. I was completely self-taught, by llistening to records and playing them over and over, teaching myself tablature from a great James Taylor book and modal tunings from Joni Mitchell\u2019s For The Roses song book. I didn\u2019t really do anything but play guitar through my teenage years.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, KJ Denhert toured for six years as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist with an all-female band called Fire, playing rock and top-40 music throughout the US, Canada and Europe. After the group ran its course, she worked at a day job while continuing to write and play music. While working in Cleveland as a financial analyst, she started the Mother Cyclone label and made her first recording. Moving home to New York in 1997, she formed the NY Unit, a group that she still performs with. \u201cI look for players who have an ability to groove and have lots of drama in their playing.\n\nLucky 7 (which is set to be released in September 2007) is KJ Denhert\u2019s seventh recording to date. \u201cI left my day job three years ago and this is the record that I\u2019ve been wanting to record ever since. It combines all of the styles that I grew up with and enjoyed, going all the way back to Sergio Mendes. It has a bit of acoustic guitar, some r&b and it grooves in what I hope after seven recordings is a signature of my style. I took the chance to tip my hat to Steely Dan for the first time in a recording and James Taylor\u2019s influence comes through me in the solo guitar and voice rendition of Sad Song.\n\nLucky 7, was recorded and mixed by Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonatha Brooke) bringing more focus to KJ\u2019s vocals than previous recordings. She also teamed up with keyboardist and producer Bennett Paster to co-produce five tracks after they worked together in Italy last summer. There are 11 originals and a sensitive version of Over The Rainbow \u201dWhen people hear me perform that standard, they regularly ask me if I am going to put it on a CD, so I did\u201d. Among the many other highlights are the funky opener Little Problems the swinging Lucky Seven, the spirited He\u2019s Not Coming Home, the infectious three-part \u201cWhat\u201as My Name, the powerful I Got Time, the wistful Beautiful and Man As A Man, KJ\u2019s unaccompanied performance of Sad Song and the exuberant Rivera which has a passionate electric guitar solo from Sheryl Bailey.\n\nAmong KJ Denhert\u2019s many accomplishments, in addition to running her own band and label, are three highly successful appearances at Umbria Jazz (\u201cthe audience response was very gratifying\u201d), an ongoing residency since 1999 at The 55 Bar in NYC, winning many songwriting contests (including being named among the six winners of the Kerrville New Folk Song contest in June 2006 for Private Angel and the Mountain Stage Newsong contest in August 05 for Little Mary), and successful appearances at other festivals and clubs around the world. Her previous recording, Another Year Gone By, Live won the 2006 Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance.\n\n\u201c For me, the highpoints come from playing and working with people who I really respect.\nMy bassist, Mamadou Ba who is originally from Senegal, has been with me the longest since 1997 when I started the NY Unit. Other long term members include drummer Ray Levier and keyboardist Peter Vitalone, both of whom have been with KJ since\u201998 and \u201899. I am always interested in stretching myself and performing my music in different ways. The Lucky 7 recordings feature some wonderful pairings of great players that I don\u2019t always get to tour with but who have appeared in with me at The 55 and are wonderful friends too.\nKJ manages between 120-140 performances a year.

A self-described \u2018military brat\u2019, Welling\u2019s struggle to feel rooted in any one place carved a unharmonious path of heartbreak, doubt, and insecurity that defined her 20s and early 30s\u2026 a journey that lead to her soul-defining rebirth as an international touring artist with a place to call home in Nashville, TN.\n\nHer bold, sultry voice, reminiscent of Sheryl Crow\u2019s grit, Natalie Maines\u2019 twang, and Stevie Nicks\u2019 heart, is upstaged only by the genuine love and connection this natural performer has with her fans both on and off stage. But embracing confidence has not always been easy for this singer-songwriter, who speaks candidly about her battle to be good to herself, and to quiet the inner voice nagging her to be \u201cperfect\u201d. Through the process of creating her latest work, a collection of songs that encapsulate Carrie\u2019s determination to embrace self-love, self-care, and leave the past behind, she\u2019s found a place of peace and healing, recognizing that authenticity and vulnerability is the glue that binds us all.\n\nIn 2018, a few years after the release of her first solo EP, The Edge, Welling put out a Patreon campaign, embracing her dream to finally quit the side hustle and focus on music full-time. Her patrons, which Carrie refers to as her \u201cchampions\u201d, have proven to be an integral part of the artist\u2019s journey - not only supporting her online but also at live performances across the globe. \u201cMy Patreon champions started out as my fans and now we\u2019re all friends. Some of them I talk to everyday, and they give me music ideas! They keep me going,\u201d she says, reflecting on the creator-founded platform.\n\nMelodies rich in folksy, Americana roots, paired with empowering, honest lyrics are stunningly showcased in Welling\u2019s forthcoming, full length album High Heels and Heavy Things. Created in a home studio in Nashville with purely organic instruments, this raw and vulnerable record was produced by Eric Holljes (Delta Rae) and features songs co-written by the talented likes of Holljes, Mary Bragg, Alex Wong, and Matt Zavala.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things has been a long time labor of love since it\u2019s conception in 2015, to its birth in April 2020. In between studio sessions Carrie took to the stage, opening for notable artists such as Delta Rae and David Cook, and performing at popular music festivals including the the Island Hopper Music Festival (Ft. Meyers, FL). She\u2019ll be a featured artist at the \u201cSongwriters Island Showcase\u201d in Isla Mujeres, Mexico in 2020, and will be opening once again for Delta Rae and David Cook (Summer Tour 2020). In the interim she\u2019s logged countless hours on the road, performing at venues and house concerts across the US, as well as an international tour through Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things will be available on iTunes and Spotify worldwide in Summer of 2020.

Since the 1970s, Lovano has been one of the world's premiere tenor saxophone players, earning a Grammy award and several nods on Down Beat magazine's critics' and readers' polls.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Ohio, Lovano was exposed throughout his early life to jazz by his father, Tony \"Big T\" Lovano. John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, and Sonny Stitt were among his earlier influences. He developed further at Berklee College of Music, and then served a big band apprenticeship with Woody Herman's Thundering Herd and the Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra.\n\n\"Big T\" Lovano, a fine Cleveland tenorman, was his first inspiration. He taught Joe all the standards, how to lead a gig, how to pace a set, and to be versatile enough to always find work. Joe started on alto at age six and switched to tenor five years later. He attended Berklee before working with Jack McDuff and Dr. Lonnie Smith. After three years with Woody Herman's Orchestra, Lovano moved to New York and began playing regularly with Mel Lewis\u2019 Big Band. This influence is still present in his solos. He often plays lines that convey the rhythmic drive and punch of an entire horn section.\n\nOne of the top saxophonists of the 1990s, Joe Lovano continues to grow and explore as a musician. He has a husky tenor tone based in the tradition, but an approach to improvisation that is modern and daring. In the early \u201880s he began working in John Scofield\u2019s Quartet and a bass-less trio with Paul Motian and Bill Frisell. Steeped in the tradition of Ornette Coleman, Motian\u2019s recordings show off Lovano\u2019s avant-garde abilities. Scofield\u2019s Quartet straddled the line between \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d. These recordings feature some of Lovano\u2019s best work.\n\nLovano has enduring musical partnerships with John Scofield and Paul Motian, having participated in some of their most noteworthy projects over the years.\n\nHe is currently a jazz artist on the international level. His live work, specifically Quarterts at the Village Vanguard, garnered a Down Beat \"Jazz Album of the Year\" award. Other releases include Trio Fascination and 52nd Street Themes.", "otherInfo": "Described by DownBeat magazine as \u201cthe titan among us,\u201d GRAMMY-winning saxophonist Joe Lovano is one of the era\u2019s definitive improvisers and bandleaders.

It is a pure country voice through and through. Blessed with a Johnny Cash baritone and the wit of Jerry Reed, Ray displays both over the 11 songs on his fourth album, the self-titled Ray Scott. A mix of roadhouse foot-stompers, stone-cold country ballads and the sing-speak songs for which he\u2019s become known, Ray Scott flashes with the energy and verve that defined Ray\u2019s earlier hits \u201cMy Kind of Music\u201d and \u201cThose Jeans.\u201d\nBut the album is also a reintroduction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reboot\u2014or a Ray-boot, if you will,\u201d quips Ray, who dubbed his last album Rayality. \u201cIt is an evolution, but I think people will hear it and know it\u2019s the same guy from \u2018My Kind of Music\u2019 and \u2018Those Jeans.\u2019 Lyrically, I tend to say things a certain way. You can always tell it\u2019s me.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s good reason for that, aside from that rumbling voice. Save for a few trusted cowriters here and there, like Mark Stephen Jones, Tony Mullins and Brandy Clark, Ray prefers to write solo. In this era of five-plus writers collaborating on a single song, Ray is a true lone wolf.\n\u201cCollaboration is fun and some of my favorite things have been written with other people, but at the same time, if you can write by yourself, you should,\u201d Ray says. \u201cThere was a time in Nashville when people wrote alone. Some of my favorite old writers, the people who got me interested in doing this in the first place\u2014Harlan Howard and Bob McDill\u2014wrote alone.\u201d\nThe results of such a writing style are pure, unfiltered songs, the undiluted vision of the artist.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always recorded my own material because it\u2019s almost impossible for me to sell a song that someone else wrote. I was more or less made to tell stories through my own window\u2014and the window\u2019s pretty smudged sometimes,\u201d Ray laughs. \u201cBut if I can entertain myself, I feel like other people might be entertained as well.\u201d\nThe tracks on Ray Scott are certainly entertaining. These are story songs that, instead of just repeating a catch phrase over and over, actually go somewhere. \u201cPapa n Mama,\u201d a loping blues number, is the tale of a son who stops his father\u2014 permanently\u2014from abusing his mother, landing himself in the pen. \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Gonna Be You\u201d is a defiant kiss-off to a cheating lover, promising she\u2019ll never break this guy\u2019s heart again. The cinematic \u201cLeave This World,\u201d however, is the polar opposite: a love song of devotion elevated by Ray\u2019s Male Vocalist of the Year-worthy performance, proof that Ray\u2019s bread and butter isn\u2019t just in the spoken word.\nStill, there is magic in those recitation numbers, especially in \u201cTijuana Buzzkill.\u201d A true tale of a disastrous, if humorous, south-of-the-border adventure that ended with Ray and his buddy in jail, the track exemplifies Ray\u2019s gift for wry storytelling.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just as much an art to recitation as there is singing. It\u2019s all in how you emote, your emphasis and how you tell a story,\u201d he says. And it helps if you have comic timing, which Ray does in spades. In songs like the hazy bonus track \u201cWhat Works for Willie\u201d and the take-one-for-the-team anthem \u201cThe Ugly One,\u201d he delivers the pay-off lines with the cadence of a comedian.\n\u201cThe songs end up being a little on the polarizing side,\u201d Ray admits. \u201cBut I love that. Everything I\u2019ve ever had any luck with was a song that made people turn their head and go, \u2018Well, that\u2019s different\u2019 or \u2018That pisses me off.\u2019\u201d\nProduced by Dave Brainard (Brandy Clark\u2019s 12 Stories, Jerrod Niemann\u2019s Free the Music), Ray Scott excels in the details\u2014the swampy harmonica of lead-off track \u201cCookin\u2019\u201d; the mariachi horns of \u201cTijuana Buzzkill\u201d; and the hypnotic rhythm of the white-trash nursery rhyme \u201cWheels on the House.\u201d In the end, no two songs sound alike, and Ray cements himself as a deft performer, able to toggle between those funny tunes and serious fare like the staggering \u201cI Miss the Days.\u201d\nA bittersweet ballad about being young, \u201cI Miss the Days\u201d is a slice of nostalgia, both in subject matter and production. Sonically, it recalls the 1970s and \u201980s sound of country music.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we were going for. If you listen to an old Waylon Jennings record or something from that time period, a lot of those songs had a \u2018Luckenbach\u2019 vibe to them,\u201d says Ray, who agrees that today\u2019s country music frequently borrows some of the bombast of late \u201980s hard rock. \u201cBut I\u2019m a little more Waylon and a little less Warrant.\u201d\nIn the end, Ray Scott furthers Ray\u2019s identity as a modern day outlaw, not in image, but in his approach to the music industry.\n\u201cAfter all these years in Nashville I\u2019ve never been willing to compromise my artistic vision as far as writing goes or the way things are recorded and produced. I don\u2019t chase trends, which is not necessarily your quickest road to riches by any means,\u201d he says.\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, I\u2019d like to walk outside my trailer, look up at the sun and say, \u2018I did it the way I wanted.\u2019\u201d Ray stops to laugh. \u201cWhen the cops come to serve the warrant, at least I\u2019ll have my integrity\u2014integrity and a beer.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Yall join us for another mancave Jam this Friday on the Official Ray Scott Facebook page at 7:30PM cst!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The April Verch Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9057098.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Fiddler, singer, and stepdancer April Verch knows how relevant an old tune can be. She was raised surrounded by living, breathing roots music\u2014her father\u2019s country band rehearsing; the lively music at church and at community dances; the tunes she rocked out to win fiddle competitions. She thought every little girl learned to stepdance at the age of three and fiddle at the age of six. She knew nothing else and decided early on that she wanted to be a professional musician.\n\nShe took that leap, and for over two decades has been recording and captivating audiences worldwide, exploring new and nuanced places each step of the way. On April 12, 2019, Verch will release her twelfth recording, Once A Day, via Slab Town Records. A followup to her 2017 career-\u00ad\u2010 spanning release The April Verch Anthology, this new album is a heartfelt homage to 1950s and 60s classic country.\n\nRecorded in Nashville by Bil VornDick and produced by Doug Cox, Once A Day features the talents of country veterans including steel guitarist Al Perkins (Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris), guitarist Redd Volkaert (Merle Haggard) and fiddler Kenny Sears (Mel Tillis, Grand Ole Opry). From the title track, a hit debut single for Connie Smith, to Loretta Lynn\u2019s \u201cYou Ain\u2019t Woman Enough,\u201d and Webb Pierce\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re Not Mine Anymore,\u201d the album is a dynamic crash course in one of Country Music\u2019s most influential time periods. Her admiration for these musicians and this iconic era is evident from start to finish. Void of contemporary gimmicks and over-\u00ad\u2010production, Verch revels in the history and lets the music speak for itself.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, making this album was not a choice. It was something I felt I had to do. It has been more daunting than any other project I\u2019ve embarked on, because these songs, these artists, the history of this music matters to me on the deepest level. It is a love letter and a thank you letter in one, to the artists, songwriters, musicians, and industry professionals who created, perhaps in some cases without even realizing it, an era of music that speaks to me in a way that no other music does. If someone hears a song on this album and that prompts them to look up and love the original that will be the highest compliment I could receive,\u201d explains Verch.\n\nWhile Verch is perhaps best known for playing traditional fiddle styles from her native Ottawa Valley, Canada, her performances extend into old-\u00ad\u2010time American and Appalachian styles and far beyond, for a well-\u00ad\u2010rounded tour-\u00ad\u2010de-\u00ad\u2010force of North Americana sounds. Verch and her fellow trio members pare down their arrangements, highlighting the simple pleasures of upright bass, guitar, clawhammer banjo, voices, fiddle, and stepping in intimate conversation. At the heart lie Verch\u2019s delicate voice, energetic footwork, and stunning playing. Sometimes she sings, steps and fiddles all at once, with apparent ease and precision. Verch is -\u00ad\u2010 as they say -\u00ad\u2010 a triple threat in performance, her live show a beautiful companion to her music: versatile, robust, and masterfully executed.\n\nVerch began her full time touring career in 2000 and has performed around the world, including festival, theatre and performing arts centre appearances in Canada, USA, China, Australia, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, Spain, Czech Republic and the United Arab Emirates. She also presents workshops, master classes, and lectures as part of her tours and at selected music camps.\n\nVerch won\u2019t be the one to tell you about her championship titles, nominations, and awards, or the fact that she was one of 6 fiddlers who represented the Canadian fiddle tradition to the world at the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, as part of a segment called \"Fiddle Nation\u201d. Instead, in speaking with her, you\u2019ll hear about how passionate she is about sharing her music; in small gatherings in remote communities in Iqaluit, to large prestigious concert halls like Mozartsal in Vienna.\n\nEven as she plays with the tradition she inherited, Verch keeps the community-\u00ad\u2010fired celebratory side of her music at the forefront, honing a keen awareness of how to engage contemporary listeners. It\u2019s why Rolling Stone cited her \u201cOne of the 12 best things we saw at MerleFest in 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as contemporary bluegrass has Alison Krauss as an ambassador, the Ottawa Valley has April Verch,\u201d said NPR\u2019s Marco Werman on \u201cThe World.\u201d And Verch never forgets the roots of her music, that connection to the people out there in the audience, on the dance floor, to the community sparked by a good song. \u201cIt\u2019s about joining together to celebrate everyday life, through music. We\u2019re all in this together.\u201d Verch\u2019s ability to preserve the authentic folk traditions of the past and reintroduce them into the musical landscape of the present is a testament to her masterful musicianship and widespread appeal.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bethany Becker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8794332.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Pop Country, Country Pop, Pop, Country", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bethany Becker is a 20-year-old from Austin, TX, who lives and breathes pop country music.\n\nHer love for Taylor Swift initially led her to country music and the stories, realness, and vulnerability of the songs made her fall in love with it.

With chart-topping singles and engaging live shows, BHTM has sold over three million albums and packed major venues worldwide, including selling out their home state's historic Red Rocks Amphitheatre seven times, most recently in 2012. Most importantly, they've done it the old-fashioned way: with excellent songwriting, scorching guitar and fearless genre melding. The band's last release was 2011's \"100 Years Of Robert Johnson.\" Joined by special guests including B.B. King, Charlie Musselwhite, Hubert Sumlin, David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards and more, BHTM paid tribute to the blues legend both in the studio and on the road. The band recently recorded a new studio album in Chicago, set for release in 2014, with producer Steve Jordan (Bob Dylan, Cat Stevens) and engineer Niko Bolas (Neil Young, Warren Zevon). On 2012's \"Last Summer on Earth Tour,\" BHTM played some of the nation's biggest arenas alongside Barenaked Ladies and Blues Traveler. In August 2012, the band presented its inaugural Ride Festival in Telluride, CO. The lineup included Ben Harper, Lucinda Williams and The Lumineers, among others. At the 2nd Annual Ride Festival in July the lineup featured David Byrne and St. Vincent, Rodrigo y Gabriela, Cake and more. BHTM are giving their fans exactly what they want in 2013: cross-country stops at intimate theaters, and two full sets every night.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown!

They\u2019ve being nominated for Roots Artists of the Year by the British Columbia Country Music Association, have signed on with the country music power house management team at Sakamoto Entertainment and inked a recording deal Warner Music Canada/Slaight Music.\n\nThe Washboard Union are a sextet out of Vancouver, British Columbia that are led by principle members Aaron Grain, Chris Duncombe and David Roberts. The three share a very similar unconscious soundtrack and unbridled love for the art of songwriting and storytelling. The three have been friends seemingly forever and the music they make has set them apart as one of the most unique talents in country music today.\n\nDuncombe & Grain eventually packed up and left their hometown of Kelowna, BC. and ventured to Vancouver where they moved in to a magnificently beautiful 1920\u2019s Tudor style mansion. By coincidence Roberts was himself renting in the same mansion and would occasionally join the brothers for impromptu single malt fueled jam sessions. It was here the all three began writing and singing together. These early session would be the kernels of what would blossom and eventually give rise to The Washboard Union. Living there at that time Roberts would reminisce \u201cwas like living in a garden gone to seed.\u201d Grain provided guitar and vocals and Duncombe added his own voice and a banjo. Roberts, a singer and multi-instrumentalist with harmonica, guitar, mandolin and of course, the washboard in his arsenal, became the team\u2019s secret weapon.\n\nThe Washboard Union is an authentic blend of where country and bluegrass have come and where they are headed next. It is for that reason that the band has gathered so many fans along the way.\n\nServing notice that they are not about to confirm to convention, the band\u2019s independently released self-titled debut album was produced by noted rock producers GGGarth Richardson (Nickleback, Biffy Ckyro, Hedley) and Canadian Music Hall of famer Bob Ezrin (Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd) \u2013 on the track \u201cHalf Cree\u201d \u2013 whom the band are proud to call a friend and mentor. That record led to the band\u2019s BC Country Music Association nomination.\n\nIn January 2015, The Washboard Union returned to Nashville, Tennessee to record their latest EP In My Bones in the legendary RCA Studio A. Originally built in 1964 as the home for Chet Atkins, RCA has been home to some of the most prolific recording artists in Nashville\u2019s rich history including Dolly Parton, Tony Bennett, The Beach Boys, and more and more.\n\n\u201c\u2026 Standing in the great room you can literally hear a chorus in every wall. It remains as one of the most legendary music rooms in the world. I can tell you this, you don\u2019t sing in Studio A, Studio A sings to you\u201d says David Roberts.\n\nIn My Bones was produced by Trey Bruce (Faith Hill, Randy Travis, Diamond Rio), a name known well in Nashville circles and one of people responsible for saving RCA Studio A from potential demolition. The band met Trey after having written the song \u201cSomeday\u201d together earlier in 2014. Trey called the band immediately after that first session and demanded he take the producer helm for the bands next record. The answer, of course, was \u201cyes.\u201d The Washboard Union were joined on the recording of this album by a group of accomplished Nashville musicians including Bob Britt (Dixie Chicks) on guitar, Greg Morrow (George Strait , ZZ TOP) on drums, Michael Brignardello (Blake Shelton, Luke Bryan) on bass and long time guitar player Craig \u201dLong Haul\u201d McCaul.\n\nThe Washboard Union is a band that you simply have to see live to fully appreciate and in the summer of 2015 they will share the stage with some of the biggest names in country music including Keith Urban, Reba Macintyre, The Band Perry, Big N Rich and more.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/STARSairambulance"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Autumn Helene ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10364170.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Auburn, United States", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Soulful songbird.

When Natalia was 17, Loris Ceroni gave her the opportunity to be in a pop/rock group under his guidance, but when she wasn't sure, he encouraged her to go solo.\n\nAlthough LaFourcade didn't join the group, Loris Ceroni produced her first LP under the label of Sony Music.

That was mesmerizing to me. Alanis was all about raw, unapologetic emotion and power, and her lyrics were very dynamic while still retaining introspection.\"\n\nIn 2018, Crowe won the John Lennon Songwriting Contest for her song \"Breaking Things,\" which was co-written and co-produced with her partner and first songwriting collaborator Josh Anderson; a year later, she released her debut album Symptoms, the result of two and a half years of work with Anderson in Los Angeles on songs she'd originally written in her bedroom. \"It was my first chapter as a writer, producer, and artist,\" she states while discussing the album's origins. \"It was such a journey to have people around me and a team who could help guide me in this city.\"\n\nA deeply felt and expressive pop album, Symptoms was inspired by Lady Gaga's own approach to production and songwriting: \"She's a powerhouse performer. A lot of my production is inspired by her, along with songwriters like Sia and Taylor Swift\u2014strong women that are powerful, dynamic, and cathartic above all else.\"\n\nSymptoms' title track\u2014as well as the album as a whole\u2014draws from an abusive experience that took place before moving to the West Coast. \"After I went through that experience, my body went into shock and I started experiencing panic attacks and anxiety,\" she recalls. \"It was about telling myself that everything was going to be okay\u2014and a musical diary that revealed the ways I was coping with what I'd been through.\"\n\nThe transformative \u201cChess Game,\u201d co-written by Kailey Shaffer, zeroes in on the struggles that young women in the music industry often face, as well as how to transcend and evolve amidst such struggles. As young women in our industry, we felt like we were tired of playing everyone else\u2019s games,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe were inspired to write something uplifting\u2014an infectiously driven and empowering anthem in the face of adversity. The symbolism of the lyrics represents transformation, realizing your inner strength and having the courage to take back and own your true power.\u201d The song was an anthem and debuted in the Billboard Dance Charts.\n\n\"Each song is a different piece of a puzzle\u2014a symptom of who I am,\" Crowe continues. \"I took my traumatic experiences and turned them into these fun pop songs to help me get through what I've experienced.\" The latest single from Symptoms, \"Sky Is Falling,\" is particularly close to Crowe's heart; the epic, wide-open ballad finds her drawing from the pain and perseverance of her father's passing. \"It's my most personal song\u2014it encompasses all the things at the core of what I've gone through,\" she explains. I never had the chance to get any closure with him about what had happened to me, and I never got to say goodbye. All my anxiety turned into depression when he died. Because he studied the stars, the title itself is a double meaning. My world was crashing down around me, but I also wanted to make sure the song was uplifting and hopeful.\"\n\nThe accompanying music video for the single is next up, and in Crowe's words, the space-themed clip focuses on \"Finding a connection with that feeling after you experience loss\u2014with that person who may not even be there in the physical form anymore.\" What's next? More new music, starting with a duet with frequent collaborator Nick Mair, \"Can't Find Love\"\u2014as well as continuing to live through the highs and lows of existing, and helping her listeners do the same. \"A lot of things are hard to talk about that we go through, but we can all laugh and cry about it,\" she states. \"It's about letting yourself feel those emotions and coming out stronger from it\u2014feeling more self-assured about who you are.\"", "otherInfo": "Friday May 8th at 6pm Pacific\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ISRROCKSLIVE\n\nYou can help Indie Star Radio by becoming a Patron!

She tours every city in America from New York to San Francisco and is always a favorite at festivals such as Electric Forest, Hangout Fest, FunFunFun Fest, SXSW, and Bonnaroo, among many others.\n\nGay and proud, Big Freedia asserts that her (Freedia is a he but uses the feminine pronoun for her stage persona) sexuality has little to do with her music. \"All types of people\u2014gay, straight, rich, poor, black, white come to my shows. People just wanna get out and shake their azzzz and have a good time!\u201d\n\nBig Freedia has gone from a local New Orleans phenomenon to a national one over the past two years. After appearing in two episodes of HBO series \u2018Treme\u2019 [as herself] and in 2010, she released her debut EP on Scion A/V Presents: Big Freedia, produced by NOLA producer BlaqNmilD. The EP featured notables \u201cExcuse\u201d and \u201cAlmost Famous; other fan-favorites include \u201cGin in my System\u201d \u201cAzz Everwhere\u201d and \u201cY\u2019all Get Back Now.\u201d Adding to her catalog, this year she released \u201cNah Who Mad\u201d and \u201cBooty Whop,\u201d and she was featured on Spank Rock\u2019s Everything is Boring and Everyone is a Fucking Liar LP, on the track \u201cNasty.\u201d\n\nThis January, Freedia made her television network debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live! She appeared on \u201cLast Call with Carson Daly,\u201d FADERTV, PITCHFORK TV and has been lauded in press outlets such as The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Fader, RollingStone.com, SPIN, OffBeat, Chicago Tribune, Columbia Spectator, Pheonix New Times, San Francisco Chronicle, LA Times, LA Weekly, among many other media outlets.\n\nAlways pushing artistic boundaries, this year Big Freedia went hi-tech by releasing the Big Freedia Booty Battle Video Game, which Forbes magazine covered, calling it \u201c\u2026everything a great game should be.\u201d\n\nRaised on Josephine Street in uptown New Orleans, Big Freedia, born Freddie Ross, was raised by his mother, a hairdresser, and stepfather, a truck driver for Coca-Cola. When Freddie was 15, the family moved to a more upscale neighborhood in New Orleans. Freddie\u2014along with his brother Adam and sister Crystal Ross\u2014were immersed in music at home by their mother, who often sang along to her Gladys Knight and Patty LaBelle records around the house. But it was the Baptist church choir where a young Freddie flourished. \u201dMy mother made sure I never missed practice,\u201d recalls Freedia. It\u2019s no wonder that by the time he was 18, Freedia moved from member to director of the choir.\n\nA product of the hip-hop generation, Freedia was rocking RUN DMC, Salt \u2018n Pepa and Adidas Shell Tops as a teenager. One night in 1991 he heard \"Where Dey At\" by MC T Tucker, (what many believe to be the first recorded Bounce track) and he was transfixed. After starting as a back-up dancer for Katey Red, the original \u201cSissy Bounce\u201d rapper, Freedia knew Bounce was his calling and eventually broke out on his own.\n\nBig Freedia is in the studio wrapping up her new ep Queen of Bounce and her first TV series, Queen of Bounce will air this Oct on Fuse TV. Finally, in the works is her DVD: Big Freedia Presents: Twerk Bounce & Pop, featuring real Bounce dance instruction from Big Freedia and some of her best and noted Divas.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/bigfreedia"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sara Gazarek ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7343892.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Championed by some of music\u2019s most celebrated figures, Sara Gazarek has emerged as a strikingly original artist with limitless potential.

In 1964, she graduated from Sarah Lawrence College and in 1968 she founded The House, a company dedicated to an interdisciplinary approach to performance. Her performances influenced many artists, including Bruce Nauman, whom she met in San Francisco in 1968. In 1978 Monk formed the ensemble called Meredith Monk and Vocal Ensemble (modelled after similar ensembles of musical collagues such as Steve Reich and Philip Glass) to explore new and wider vocal textures and forms which often were contrasted with minimal instrumental textures. Powerful and influential pieces from this time include Dolmen Music (1979), which also was recorded for her first album released at Manfred Eicher's record label ECM in 1981. In the 1980s she wrote and directed two films, Ellis Island (1981), and Book of Days (1988), which developed from a single idea; \"One day during summer of 1984, as I was sweeping the floor of my house in the country, the image of a young girl (in black and white) and a medieval street in the Jewish community (also in black and white) came to me\", as Monk recounts in the liner notes of the ECM-recording. Apart from the film, different versions exist of this piece: two for the concert hall, and an album, explained by Meredith Monk and Manfred Eicher as \"a film for the ears.\" In the early 1990s Monk composed an opera - Atlas which premiered in Houston in 1991. More recently, while continuing her work for her ensemble, she began writing for instrumental ensembles and symphony orchestra - her first symphonic work, Possible Sky (2003), and Stringsongs (2004), commissioned by the Kronos Quartet. In 2005, events were held all over the world celebrating the 40th anniversary of her career. These included a concert in Carnegie Hall, featuring Bj\u00f6rk, whose singing is fundamentally indebted to Monk's, and others, including the composers Terry Riley, DJ Spooky (who has sampled her on his album \"Drums of Death\"), and John Zorn and the new music ensembles Alarm Will Sound and Bang on a Can All-Stars, along with the Pacific Mozart Ensemble.\n\n\nShe has won many awards including a MacArthur Fellowship, and she holds honorary Doctor of Arts degrees from Bard College, the University of the Arts (Philadelphia), The Julliard School, the San Francisco Art Institute and the Boston Conservatory.\n\nHer music was used in films by Joel and Ethan Coen (The Big Lebowski, 1998) and Jean-Luc Godard (Nouvelle Vague, 1990 and Notre musique, 2004).\n\nIn a recent interview she said that her favourite music includes Brazilian music, especially Caetano Veloso's recordings, the music by Mildred Bailey (\"the great jazz singer from the \u201830s and \u201840s\"), and Bartok's cycle for piano Mikrokosmos.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/virtuallemonaid"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "KDJabove HQ ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8705875.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Dub, House, Jazz Soul & Funk, Hip Hop", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "KDJ Above is a groundbreaking music performer straight out of Denver.

We eat gumbo in our flannel shirts, and we eat red beans and rice while head-banging!\u201d\n\nMusic was a huge part of Eva and Cedric\u2019s childhood, their first shared fandom being for \u201cTurn Your Love Around\u201d by iconic vocalist and guitarist George Benson, which they would dance to together every time the radio played it. They enjoyed looking in at what their older siblings were digging on MTV, such as Jay Z, Nirvana, Blind Melon, Michael Jackson, and \u201c90s pop music was awesome too! And R&B like SWV, En Vogue, etc.,\u201d Eva says. In high school their tastes had drifted; Eva was introduced to Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd. After high school she researched and grooved on the old blues and folk that had influenced those classic rock bands. At the same time, she and Cedric were also big World-Wide Wrestling fans \u2014 \u201cwe loved wrestling! Cedric loved it before I did, but then I became a fanatic too.\u201d They really enjoyed the hard rock music used in bouts, drawing them closer to heavy metal.\n\nAbout this time Cedric had started to play the drums and wanted to hear the songs that Eva was writing, which she found exciting. He matched drum parts to songs she had only worked out so far on guitar, later on getting a bass player and another guitarist. As soon as they had a few arranged, they were ready to start performing. They went through some changes: The Black Tones as a four piece only lasted for a while, then became a trio, \u201cbut Cedric and I were the founders and the only consistently reliable members, so now we just keep it as a duo, while hiring other musicians to play instruments live with us.\u201d Eva had also been in an all-girl punk band called BUST, but she ended up channeling everything into The Black Tones with Cedric.\n\nThrough countless shows supporting a few early singles, The Black Tones felt they finally got their first big breakthrough opening for Death Cab for Cutie in an anniversary benefit for the Paramount Theater. \u201cThat was the biggest show we\u2019ve done!\u201d Eva exclaims. She gives credit for reaching that height to NighTrain, the all black female punk band that she says discovered and championed them when they had freshly started.\n\nFor Cobain and Cornbread, The Black Tones are returning from their singles to work with the renowned, glorious grunge producer Jack Endino, introduced to them by Eva\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and music writer Jake Uitti. Jake had interviewed Jack and sent him their song \u201cWoman in Black\u201d without Eva\u2019s knowledge and Jack replied how much he loved it and wanted to work with The Black Tones.\n\n\u201cI was never really big on recording in a studio,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m a live show nut, I just love performing. Being in studios was always very stressful for me, but when we worked with Jack, that totally changed! It was the best recording experience I\u2019ve ever had. Jack is like a scientist, a chemist behind the soundboard. He had great ideas that strengthened each song. I\u2019ve never met anyone with an ear like his, it\u2019s unbelievable, though he\u2019s a calm, humble, kind, efficient, honest and very intelligent guy \u2014 I was so intimidated at first, I mean, here\u2019s the guy who recorded the Melvins, Nirvana, Soundgarden, and the list goes on. And now he\u2019s working with us and he\u2019s really into it!\u201d\n\nCobain and Cornbread also features help from their friend Mason Lowe from Bread & Butter, on \u201cChubby and Tubby\u201d (a frenetic garage rock instrumental ode to the landmark Seattle variety store) and \u201cWelcome Mr. Pink\u201d (the band\u2019s autobiographical anthem). \u201cMason has a great ear and was really amazing to work with.\u201d Ed Brooks mastered all the songs on the record, with Jack checking back in to make sure he was looped on everything. \u201cAs a band we are of course rooting for the record, but it\u2019s even more special when everyone else is as well!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something very unique about the songs (all originals save for a cover of \u201cRiver of Jordan\u201d) and sound unique about the minimalist sound Jack helped The Black Tones achieved, reminding one of the debuts from The Ramones to the Stooges to the Modern Lovers. Eva acknowledges the brute power of the album\u2019s sound, \u201cit\u2019s pretty vulnerable and raw and I like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are songs like \u2018Welcome Mr. Pink\u2019 where you can hear the click sound from me pressing down on the button to turn on my reverb pedal.\u201d Or in their righteous, ferocious Black Power anthem, \u201cKey of Black (They Want Us Dead),\u201d \u201cafter the second guitar chorus when I go back to the solo, I almost forgot to press my Wah Wah pedal back on so it comes in a little late.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not factory made or even ever scratch the surface of perfection, we\u2019re real people, this is real life and these little details remind me of the imperfections of life,\u201d she says. \u201cLife\u2019s real, life\u2019s the blues, coming from the heart.

She managed to record two full-length albums and tour with some of the music world's biggest names even before she hit the age of 20. Her first album drew rave reviews from most critics and put her on the often rocky road toward stardom.\n\nDevon was born in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in the spring of 1982. She grew up in a household filled with music and family and friends. She admits some of her influences include Bikini Kill, Frank Zappa, and even some of the classic rock & roll groups her parents loved, like the Beatles. At a young age, Devon practiced vocal harmony with her father. Later she used his old guitar to strum out her first tentative notes. By the time she was 15, she was putting her musical talents to work, playing in front of local places for change from those who stopped to listen. There was never any other dream in her mind but music, and luckily no one to tell her it was the kind of dream that was out of reach.\n\nWhen Devon was still in her teens, she recorded her debut album, a self-titled offering filled with original songs. That album -- really, her voice on that album -- drew a lot of interest, and in the end landed her a spot touring as a side act with the very popular Dave Matthews Band. One tour turned into two. For 2001, Devon released a second album, LONG SLEEVE STORY, under the Three Word Records label. She had some pretty impressive help on her sophomore release, such as drummer Nate Brown, bassist David Saull, trumpeter John D'earth, and bass player Stefan Lessard, who also served as producer for the album.\n\nDevon's 2003 CD, UPSTATE SONGS, (City Salvage Records) was included in Rolling Stone's \u201cCritics Top Albums of 2003\u201d. Critic Julie Gerstein called the record \u201cperhaps the sweetest and most honest folk-pop album recorded this year,\u201d and added, \u201cSproule's vocal and lyrical beauty is unmatched.\"\n\n2007 brought the release of her 'getting-married' (to songwriter Paul Curreri) CD, KEEP YOUR SILVER SHINED (City Salvage/Waterbug). Produced by Jeff Romano in the heart of Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge mountains, this CD highlights Sproule\u2019s talent for combining Appalachian, folk and jazz influences. From the front porch thump of \"Old Virginia Block\" to the high lonesome traditional \"The Weeping Willow,\u201d featuring fellow Virginia-native Mary Chapin Carpenter, the record finds Sproule making another important contribution to the Great American Songbook. The New Yorker magazine: The nimble singer-guitarist Devon Sproule chronicles her ongoing love affairs with humanity, nature, and the state of Virginia. She performs with a sweet, round diction that shines through even her most ornate imagery and rambunctious melodies. In July 2007 Devon graced the cover of fRoots magazine in the UK; the first American artist on the cover this decade.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Sherlocks ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7734421.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Brandon Crook - Drums, Josh Davidson - Lead Guitar, Kiaran Crook - Lead Vocals/Rhythm Guitar, Andy Davidson - Bass", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "We are a 4 piece indie/alternative band consisting of two sets of brothers", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Weird Milk ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9077604.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Indie Rock, Indie Pop", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Weird Milk are an exciting new London based band.

There are so many layers to Canadian-Colombian singer Lido Pimienta\u2019s identity that you might get lost in them. But if you did, you\u2019d be missing the point.\n\nHer multi-textural, mind-bending voice and music project what Canada\u2019s The Globe and Mail called her \u201cbold, brash, polarizing\u201d persona, which constantly confronts the powers that be. But it also reveals an embrace of the Afro- and Indigenous traditions that is at once defiant, delicate and sweetly nostalgic.\n\nPimienta\u2019s new album Miss Colombia takes her ecstatic hybridity to a new level, building on the \u201cnu\u201d intersection of electronica and cumbia established by her first two albums, Color, released in 2010, and the 2016 Polaris Prize-winning La Papessa as Canadian album of the year. The latter was the first 100% independently released, non- English or French album to win the $50,000 prize. Produced with Matt Smith, a/k/a Prince Nifty, Miss Colombia overflows with the kind of understated genius that promises yet another breakthrough.\n\nAs a Canadian global-beats trailblazer, Lido has an affinity for acts like A Tribe Called Red and Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq, but her work also resonates with British-Sri Lankan rapper MIA and she draws unabashed inspiration from the New York-bred Dominican-Trinidadian rap queen Cardi B. Miss Colombia has the effect of expanding the narrative about her dual Colombian/Canadian identity to her family\u2019s mixed roots in the Afro-Colombian and Indigenous Wayuu communities, while establishing an ambitious new sonic palette that brings her closer to home.\n\nWho or what exactly is Miss Colombia? Pimienta\u2019s new album\u2019s title was inspired by Miss Universe MC Steve Harvey\u2019s gaffe in 2015 when he mistakenly awarded the crown to Miss Colombia instead of the actual winner, Miss Philippines. The incident not only caused her to reflect on the anti-blackness she experienced as a child growing up in Barranquilla, but the fact that while her sister was groomed to be a beauty queen, she suffered through an awkward adolescence as the \u201cweird artistic tomboy\u201d of the family.\n\n\u201cSo I was like am I still Colombian or should I just keep calm and carry on because I\u2019m Canadian now?\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the premise and genesis of Miss Colombia.\u201d\n\nThe central mood of Miss Colombia coalesces around a series of moving, musical poems embracing how she\u2019s loved and lost. The journey magically documents an introspection tinged with sadness, yet still evoking a kind of optimism about experiencing the emotion in glorious repetition. \u201cTe Quer\u00eda,\u201d (I Wanted You) pulses with a kind of samba-like cumbia, floating in the memory of desire and denial. The narrator\u2019s \u201cwant\u201d is quickly dismissed by quoting 2018\u2019s Latin trap hit \u201cTe Bot\u00e9\u201d (I discarded you).\n\nAs Pimienta more firmly grounded herself in her return to the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where Miss Colombia was recorded \u201clive\u201d in rustic settings, her approach evolved from the opulent electronic crafting of La Papessa to something even more sensual and spiritual. The change in scenery helped her closer to her goal of re-contextualizing her music. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to control electronic music,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWhat\u2019s hard about electronic music is to make it sound emotional, make it sound beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe emblematic track \u201cEso Que Tu Haces,\u201d flows with an ethereal mysticism that fuses Lido\u2019s love for traditional porro and slow-building cumbia. Its unique orchestral swirl of wind instruments and synthetic sounds quickly sets the tone for Miss Colombia. On \u201cNada,\u201d she teams up with Bomba Estereo\u2019s Li Samuet, venturing further with her transcendent soprano, crafted with precision and clarity, and driven by sharp-edged metallic beats.\n\nLido clearly remembers the moment when she began her journey as a transnational, cultural mixing experiment as a singer. The brashly dynamic electro-cumbia diva had gone through several phases, starting in her early teens fronting punk and metal bands, and had become obsessed with trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack and Tricky.\n\n\u201cIt was before I moved to Canada, I was in this dance group called Cumb\u00e9 in Colombia,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy cousin was one of the drummers in the group and he told me, \u2018you know you have a really good voice, why would you waste that voice on this depressing music?\u201d\n\nPimienta\u2019s cousin then introduced her to an Afro-Colombian group called Sexteto Tabala, who she later collaborated with on the song \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves\u201d (I Want You To Save Me). Initially formed in 1996, Sexteto Tabal\u00e1 are the cultural heartbeat of Palenque and guardians of Afro-Latin musical history who can swing like a salsa band, groove like a fuji orchestra and serenade you all at the same time. They are one of the most representative musical expressions of the African communities in Colombia.\n\nPimienta credits her time in Sexteto with the development of her singing and overall aesthetic. \u201cThat\u2019s what shaped me, how I learned to have stage control,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because of some bar in Ontario; it was because I was in front of thousands of people singing Afro-Colombian spiritual music.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the flow of Miss Colombia so riveting and rewarding. Structurally it\u2019s bookended by two versions of \u201cPara Transcribir,\u201d one listed as \u201cSol,\u201d (Sun) and the other \u201cLuna\u201d (Moon), a song that tries to come to grips with Pimienta--who is fully bilingual--as a perpetual translator of cultures. The edgy playfulness of her love songs gives way to tracks like \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves,\u201d \u201cPelo Cucu,\u201d which celebrates the symbolic African texture of her hair, and \u201cResisto y Ya,\u201d which makes pointed reference to recent massive Colombian protests against the current government.\n\nWith the latter track, Lido wants to make it clear that while she shares the popular disdain for a \u201cpolitics of division\u201d that squeezes Colombians, she insists that just by being who she is, an Afro-Indigenous, queer feminist, and Canadian outsider, she has always been engaged in resistance.

His first club hit was Gym & Tonic, a track produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, featuring vocals illegally taken from a Jane Fonda fitness tape. The Bob Sinclar persona was based on a character from Philippe de Broca's film Le Magnifique.\n\nSinclar is famous for popularizing the \"french touch\" of house music, with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. His track \"Feel for You\", a tribute to french musician Cerrone, from his second album Champs Elys\u00e9es, hit #9 in the UK Top 40. On track \"Darlin'\", he worked with vocalist James \"D-Train\" Williams.\n\nSinclar has also worked under other pseudonyms. Under the aliases The Mighty Bop and Reminiscence Quartet, he has dabbled in hip-hop and acid jazz. He also created the Africanism project, where an ensemble of artists produce house music with a combination of latin, jazz, african and tribal flavors. In 2005 he scored a hit with his single \"Love Generation\", that reached #1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts and the German Media Control Single Charts in 2006. The song was a huge success throughout Europe, also peaking at no. 2 in the Dutch Top 40. The followup hit was \"World, Hold On\", that features Steve Edwards and also managed to chart in the top ten in most of the European countries. \"Rock this Party (Everybody Dance Now)\" followed on August 22, 2006.\n\nThe remix of \"World, Hold on\" by E-Smoove is nominated for a Grammy 2007 in the category \"Remixed Recording\". Also, \"World Hold on\" was chosen by Billboard Magazine as the number one Hot Dance Club Play Single of 2006, beating Madonna and Christina Aguilera.\n\nThe fourth single of the album 'Western Dream' called 'Tennessee' was supposed to be released in April 2007, but has been cancelled due to the rumour of a new album being released.\n\nThis album is Soundz Of Freedom. It came out in France on May 21st.

Her musical talent was discovered early on and fostered by Helena Guimar\u00e3es Galo and Arnaldo Estrella (student of Alfred Cortot and friend of Villa Lobos), at the Conservatory of Antwerp student of Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge, student of Arthur Schnabel>Leon Fleisher>Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge.\n\nShe played a first recital at the age of 5 in the Teatro Mesbla in Rio de Janeiro. First TV performance at age 6 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Alceo Bocchino with a Haydn concerto, and another two times the same concerto conducted by Eleazar de Carvalho and Isaac Karabtchevsky with the Orquestra Sinfonica Brasileira. At age 7 she performed Mozart KV488 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Edouard van Remoortel (Rio de Janeiro).\n\nIn the USA she received the \"special prize\" of the jury at the Van Cliburn competition, and she made an indelible impression with Beethoven\u00b4s piano concerto n.4 at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium.\n\nAfter the \"wonderkind\" and \"competitions\" happenings, she received invitations to perform in more than 25 countries. Her intelligence and brilliant musical feeling allow her to play a repertory of 61 piano concertos.\n\nIn 1990 she took up composing again, producing brilliant and at times mischievous cadenzas for her concertos. In 1994-95 she wrote her 15 Momentos Musicais and composed the Sonate Oubli\u00e9e with themes from her childhood. Her characteristics have remained unchanged: simplicity and spontaneity, feeling and imagination, technique, perfection without affectation, a delight for the eye and ear.\n\nIn February 1998 Rodrigues' Bach-CD was recorded. The critics describe her improvisations and paraphrases on works for the organ as: \"The sonorities go back to the scale of more than 3 centuries of piano literature and link perfectly well up with the richness in colour of an independent way of pianistic thinking, they have their own new life, a fascinating transfiguration, full of phantasy.\"\n\nAstonishment, admiration and even incredibility caused her Suite n.1 \"Rio de Janeiro\" for piano and orchestra, that was first performed on 9 August 2000. She plaid and recorded in St. Petersburg the 5 concerto's for piano from Sergei Prokofiev with the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n1998 - 2014 she is invited in a.o.

She has trained with Herbert Slegers (theory), Alexander Dmitriev, Edward Serov, Dmitri Liss and Juozas Domarkas (practical), Gloria Rodrigues-da Silva, prima ballerina (choreographer/kinematics).\n\nShe can now lead the orchestra to produce great classical compositions as she has already done for example with Beethoven\u2019s piano sonatas.\n\nEliane Rodrigues is professor on the Royal Conservatory of Antwerp.", "otherInfo": "Come join Eliane at home and listen to various pieces of her vast repertoire!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rinaly ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9178985.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Trance", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Rinaly is a Japanese music producer and DJ since 2014.

With Guest DJs such as Ferry Corsten, Ben Nicky, Mark Sixma, Ben Gold, Protoculture, RAM and Driftmoon, they consistently attracted around 1,000 clubbers and became the biggest Trance event in Japan.

He trained for ten years, developing a distinct passion for Jazz. Soon after the sound of Hip Hop provoked him to not only form his own band but also to start his foray into DJ'ing and production. Then came house as Satoshi became fascinated by the early Chicago mix-tapes he was hearing.\n\nA Japanese cosmetic company asked Satoshi to produce a track for their forthcoming promo parties where the legendary DJ Frankie Knuckles was performing. Knuckles saw the potential in Satoshi's music and asked if he was interested in collaborating. The final result of their partnership was \"Tears\", a defining moment in vocal house and a song now commonly regarded as an all time classic. Satoshi soon took the leap and moved to New York. Since his seminal hit \"Tears\" with Knuckles back in 1989, he has gone on to become a major part of the acclaimed Def Mix crew. Tomiie has remixed and worked with the likes of Photek, Kosheen, Simply Red, David Bowie, U2, Mariah Carey, and Misia (Japan's #1 R&B artist), just to name a few.\n\nIn 2000 Satoshi wrote and produced his debut album for Sony entitled \"Full Lick\" featuring performances by Kelli Ali, former front woman for the Sneaker Pimps, Diane Charlemagne, Robert Owens and others. The album has been met with critical acclaim by his fans and the press with each single enjoying top ten dance chart success. \"Up in Flames\", garnered a number one dance hit in the UK and included mixes from John Digweed. In the US, \"Up in Flames\" and \"Darkness\" established Satoshi's presence in the alternative music scene as well as the dance music scene. The Global Underground compilation mixed by John Digweed also featured \"Love in Traffic\" the most recognizable single from \"Full Lick\" in addition to three other \"Satoshi\" productions/ remixes.\n\nIn 2001, Satoshi Tomiie launched his own label \"SAW.RECORDINGS\". The word SAW comes from \"SAW is one of the names of the sound wave (Sine, Square, Triangle and so on). These are used by various kinds of electronic music producers regardless of the style; most of them use and tweak these waveforms to compose music. Regardless of the style, SAW.RECORDINGS would like to introduce quality music to the music scene. We also would like to be a tool for DJ's (as SAW).\" states Tomiie.\n\nIt was Satoshi's desire to create a platform from which he would be able to showcase ideas and creativity that are more experimental. SAW\u00d5s first single release \"Paranoize\" by Bipath caused major excitement from DJ's worldwide. Follow up singles, Madam \"Penetration\" and Tomiie\u00d5s own \"Virus\" gave SAW world recognition.\n\n2002 has brought forth singles and EP\u00d5s from the likes of Akadoma, Jerry Bonham and Tigerhook, with a debut production from the remix team Gabriel & Dresden entitled \"Lament\" at the end of the year Tomiie\u00d5s Saw label is forging ahead. 2003 brings Echomen \"Perpetual\" the first vocally driven record for the Label. Tomiie's ongoing philosophy to push the envelope and expose new talents has assisted in the launch of such new producer / dj\"s as Trendroids and Lexicon Avenue. If SAW.RECORDINGS is an example of the direction that Satoshi is heading in, he is acknowledging the changes in the dance music scene, thus shifting what House music is. House music never stops evolving and expanding its borders and Satoshi Tomiie is in the forefront of this movement.\n\nSatoshi is the first American based DJ to be asked to record a NuBreed album (#6) for International label Global Underground. Nubreed is known for only working with the leading cutting edge DJ's. With a world tour under way, Tomiie launched the North American leg with a Spundae party in San Francisco and continued traveling throughout the USA, Europe, of South America, Asia, and Australia. His Nubreed album is the fastest and highest selling Nubreed album to date.\n\nReceiving the highest honor as a DJ, in December Satoshi Tomiie was voted by the public into the #30 spot of the World\u00d5s Top 100 DJ List. Satoshi is also finding International recognition now as a Label owner besides his proven talents as a DJ, Producer / Artist and Musician. 2003 Satoshi has again launched his world tour on the west coast of the United States and will be touring well into the fall.\n\nHe released Satoshi Tomiie presents Ice entitled \"Scandal in New York\" and has just completed a DJ Mix compilation titled UNDULATION 1.

We've been mates since school but got the 'get a job, get a life' mantra drilled into us so we each went about getting a job and trying to get a life we enjoyed for a while.\n\nAlways jammed and played music, sometimes together - Spud went and played with Sack, toured with Morrissey and lived a little, Nipper and Neilo played garage music in Obi-Wan, Joe was a journo in New York for a while and Keith worked for Sky.\n\nLast year we got together and figured we'd prefer to have no job and enjoy life. Came together as Hybrasil and started writing and playing. Its been a good year - signed to FIFA Records, released our first EP - We Got Music (Top 40) and played with some pretty cool bands already - The La's (their first show in 10 years - got plastered with them so pay no attention to anyone that tells you Lee Mavers is a recluse - he's a pure gent), Wags (from The Happy Mondays), Idlewild, The Chalets.\n\nJust toured UK for the first time a few months back and the crowds went fairly nuts for us so that's where the near future lies for us. We Got Music got into the top ten in the UK college charts upon its release in February in the UK. Our next single, When I'm Yawning, will be out on July 27 with tours of Ireland and the UK to follow. That's about where we are now.\n\n---\n\nAnother Hybrasil was based in Boston, fronted by CHRISTIAN MCNEILL.

Between the house parties and the B-boy battles, Intel quickly made a name for himself across the Midwest.\n\nIntel still holds down the decks for the B-boys, but his scope and style--fueled by his limitless passion and innovation--have evolved. The kid honing his craft on hand-me-down tables now shares (or steals, depending on your perspective) the stage with Hip Hop legends (Lupe Fiasco, Afrika Bambaataa, Wu-Tang Clan, ?Love), EDM greats (Amon Tobin, Kid Koala, Nero, The Prodigy) and three time world DMC champion DJ Qbert, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. He holds down quite a few residencies in Chicago, including the world famous Smart Bar, rips up stages at huge music festivals (Lollapalooza, North Coast Music Fest, SXSW) and works everything from charitable events to openings to fashion shows for clients like: Adidas, Red Bull, Scion, AT&T and Microsoft.\n\nWNUR and the DJZTRIP.com community both voted DJ Intel \u2018Best MixTape DJ.\u2019 The New York Post and Entertainment Weekly both love him.

Townes (born January 22, 1965 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), also known as DJ Jazzy Jeff, is an American hip hop and R&B record producer and turntablist. He is best known for his early career with Will Smith as DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. DJ Jazzy Jeff graduated from John Bartram High School in Philadelphia where he is enshrined in the school's \"Wall of Fame\".\n\nHistory\n\nWhen he was growing up, he found that listening to his parents was unbearable. He got a job as a newspaper boy at age 7 to support his family. Once he grew up, he developed a reputation and following as a school and block party DJ extraordinaire, Jazzy Jeff was the feature of the duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. As a duo, they had several gold and platinum-selling albums and singles in the late 1980s and early 1990s, earning them the first rap Grammy ever presented in 1989 for Parents Just Don't Understand. When Smith branched out into television with the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Jazzy Jeff played a recurring character named \"Jazz\", Smith's best friend on the show. The two characters always greeted each other with their signature handshake (swinging mid-five, point-back/snap with both characters saying \"Pssh!\").\n\nJazz' trademarks include being physically ejected from the house by Uncle Phil (James Avery), screaming as he went flying out the front door. This was referenced in the song \"N.Y, N.Y.\" by Lloyd Banks from his second album Rotten Apple, with the lyric \"I throw a bitch out the crib like Jazzy Jeff\". [1]\n\nDJ Jazzy Jeff is not to be confused with Jeffrey Myree from the earlier hip hop group Funky Four Plus One, which in fact filed and won a lawsuit over the name Jazzy Jeff against Jeff Townes and Jive records when they signed DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince. After DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince broke up, Townes went on to become a prominent R&B, soul, and neo soul record producer, establishing the A Touch of Jazz production company in his native Philadelphia. Among the artists that Jazzy Jeff has helped develop are Jill Scott and Musiq. Even though he separated from Will Smith as music partners, they are still best friends and still occasionally work together. Some songs by Will Smith were produced by Jeff Townes (Ex. Here He Comes), and he has performed on some songs by Will Smith such as \"So Fresh\" and \"Potnas\". In addition, he appears in several of Smith's music videos such as \"Will2K\", \"Freakin' It\", and \"Party Starter\". On some occasions, he makes appearances with Smith on live concerts, producing DJ scratches.\n\nHe, along with DJ Cash Money, is credited with making the transform scratch famous.\n\nOn July 2, 2005, DJ Jazzy Jeff performed with Will Smith at the Live 8 concert in Philadelphia. In the past, Will has performed on concerts with DJ Jazzy Jeff for the scratches. Moreover, Will acknowledges him in his music like \"Comin' To The Stage\" from the album Lost & Found or \"Potnas\" in his album Willennium.\n\nHis 2007 release TROTM (The Return of the Magnificent) is a classic work which returns to the roots of hip-hop with a neo-soul mixture included. This album featured numerous collaborations with old school and new school artists including CL Smooth, Big Daddy Kane, Pos from De La Soul, Method Man, Peedi Crakk (a remake of Brand New Funk), Rhymefest, and Raheem DeVaughn.\n\nIn 2007, he appeared with Rhymefest in the video DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Fest directed by Konee Rok, in which he makes music in his home recording studio with Rhymefest and they reveal that they are working on an album together called \"I'm the DJ, I'm the Rapper\".\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nSolo work as DJ Jazzy Jeff\n\n* Unreleased album from Sony Records (1998)\n* One cut in Battle of DJs\n* The Magnificent (2002)\n* Soulheaven Presents Jazzy Jeff in the House (2004)\n* The Soul Mixtape Groovin' Records USA (2005)\n* Hip-Hop Forever II Rapster Records (2004)\n* Hip-Hop Forever III BBE Records (2006)\n* The Return of The Magnificent EP (2007)\n* The Return of the Magnificent (2007)\n* The Return of Hip Hop EP (2007)\n\n\nAs DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince\n\n* Rock the House (1987) #83 US (Gold)\n* He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper (1988) #4 US (3x Platinum)\n* And in This Corner\u2026 (1989) #39 US (Gold)\n* Homebase (1991) #12 US (Platinum)\n* Code Red (1993) #64 US (Gold)\n* Greatest Hits (1998) #144 US, #20 UK\n* Before The Willennium (1999)\n* The Very Best of D.J.

Over three albums and countless tours, the five British Columbians have developed their signature sound by taking inspiration from the mountains they hail from and the people who inhabit them. Shred Kelly has seamlessly fused traditional instrumentation with modern rock, presenting a sound that is both unique and compelling. Shred Kelly has produced their most ambitious project yet with their fourth album Archipelago. The collaborative song writing of Tim Newton, Sage McBride, Jordan Vlasschaert, Ty West, and Ian Page-Shiner have pulled inspiration through individual experiences and musical influences. The result is a dynamic and cohesive collection of dreamy, yet explosively exciting songs dipped in themes of relationships and the world in the modern age. Using traditional instrumentation at the base of the songwriting, the album explodes into a symphony of sounds incorporating banjos, ukuleles, synthesizers, guitar hooks, harmonies and pulsing beats. Their high-energy sound has allowed them to perform at many Canadian and international festivals, such as: NXNE, Reeperbahn, Winnipeg Folk Festival, Breakout West, Riverfest Elora, Ottawa Blues Fest, Shambhala, Evolve, Tall Tree Music Festival, Keloha and Salmon Arm Roots and Blues Festival. The group has also achieved a growing list of awards and recognition; five Kootenay Music Awards, one Western Canadian Music Award, over one million spotify plays, CBC recognition and media attention in Canada, USA, and Germany.

Bergson doesn't do predictable, but there's a visible thread of blues awareness running through the fabric of everything he writes, sings and plays: he is a concise and subtle guitarist and tough, grainy singer.\" The Blues Magazine (UK)\n\nWith MOJO Magazine's #1 Blues Album of 2008, Fall Changes, #2 Blues Album of 2011, Imitate the Sun, #3 Blues Album of 2014, Live at Jazz Standard and #3 Blues Album of 2017, Bitter Midnight , New York guitarist/singer Chris Bergson has established himself as \"one of the most inventive songwriters in modern blues music\" (All Music Guide), creating his own blend of blues, roots and soul. Chris Bergson has performed and/or shared the stage with Hubert Sumlin, Levon Helm, B.B. King, Norah Jones, John Hammond, Etta James, and Bettye LaVette, to name just a few.\n\n2014 CD RELEASE: LIVE AT JAZZ STANDARD\nLABEL: 2 SHIRTS / INNSBRUCK RECORDS MEDIA\n\nLive at Jazz Standard, the latest CD release from the Chris Bergson Band, was recorded live over two nights at NYC's Jazz Standard with Bergson's usual four-piece band (organ/wurlitzer, bass and drums) \"augmented with a horn section expert in the snap and crackle of bluesy soul.\" (The Blues Magazine UK) The fifteen song CD contains eight brand new original songs from New York guitarist/singer Chris Bergson \"...one of the most inventive songwriters in modern blues music.\" (All Music Guide) as well as new arrangements of five older originals from the band's back catalog. According to iTunes Editors' Notes:\n\n\"A fair number of hot shot guitarists can lay down licks with presence and panache, but that number shrinks drastically when you tally the ones who are also sharp-shooting singer/songwriters. That\u00eds what makes Chris Bergson an unusual triple threat and this live recording shines a spotlight on the strength of his material as well as the alternately simmering and fiery feel that he and his band serve up in a club setting. New York City native Chris Bergson is a bluesman of a distinctly urban stripe. Instead of swamps and rivers, his songs - many penned in collaboration with lyricist Kate Ross - are full of citified imagery from the midtown Manhattan locale of \"61st & 1st\" to the Brooklyn scenes of \"Gowanus Heights.\" The three-man horn section accentuates the soul leanings of tunes like \"The Only One\" and brings out the R&B shadings in Bergson's gritty growl. At times, the blend of Bergson's earthy vocals and terse, biting guitar with Craig Dreyer's organ evokes The Band. Yet whether the guitarist and his group are venturing into R&B, roots rock or straight blues, they create an invitingly organic feel on a recording that clearly captures the band in their element.\"\n\nSpecial guests include soul singer Ellis Hooks and a three piece horn section featuring baritone saxophonist Ian Hendrickson-Smith (Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings), tenor saxophonist David Luther (Bettye LaVette) and Grammy Award-winning trumpeter Freddie Hendrix performing horn arrangements by Jay Collins (Gregg Allman).\n\nJazz Standard has been a musical home for the Chris Bergson Band for the past ten years and provided an ideal venue for their first live record. The album was recorded and co-produced by award-winning producer/engineer Roman Klun whose credits include albums by the Spin Doctors, Joan Osborne and the Holmes Brothers.\n\nBergson has had the opportunity to play with two masters of American music - drummer/singer Levon Helm of The Band and Howlin' Wolf's guitarist Hubert Sumlin - and their influence can be heard throughout the album.\n\nNotable past performances include:\nMoulin Blues (Holland), Groningen Rhythm and Blues Night (Holland), Blues Open (Holland), Noct en Blues (Chaumont, France), Blues in Hell (Norway), Harvest Time Blues (Ireland), Leicester Blues Festival (UK), Waterfront Blues Festival (Portland, OR), Saratoga Jazz Festival (NY), Levon Helm's Midnight Rambles (Woodstock, NY), River to River Festival (NYC), Joe\u2019s Pub (NYC), The Blue Note (NYC), Jazz Standard (NYC), John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (DC), SXSW, and opening for B.B. King at B.B. King's Blues Club (NYC).\n\nBorn in New York City but raised in Somerville, Massachusetts, Chris Bergson returned to Manhattan in\n1995. While backing jazz singers Annie Ross, Dena DeRose, Sasha Dobson and Norah Jones, he released\nBlues for Some Friends of Mine and Wait for Spring on Juniper Records in 1997 and 2000,\nrespectively. In 2002 Bergson was appointed a Jazz Ambassador of the USA by the John F. Kennedy\nCenter for the Performing Arts and he toured Africa with his trio. Evolving to further embrace the blues\nwhile also adding pop influences, he followed up with Blues (2003), Another Day (2005) and his\ntriumphant artistic breakthrough, the widely acclaimed Fall Changes (2007) -- MOJO\u2019s #1 Blues Album\nof 2008 -- that established him as an eloquent, evocative and lyrical songwriter with a sharp urban vision.\nRecorded at Levon Helm\u2019s Woodstock studio, it led to Bergson being personally invited to perform at the\nfamed drummer\u2019s Midnight Rambles while opening the way for more stateside festivals and subsequent\ntours of Europe.\n\nClick here to read Kay Cordtz's in-depth profile of Chris Bergson in ROLL Magazine:\nwww.rollmagazine.com\n\nChris Bergson currently serves on the faculty of NYC's 92Y where he teaches Rock, Blues and Jazz guitar and is the music mentor for the Recanati-Kaplan Scholarship Program.\n\nBergson endorses McCurdy Guitars and Levy's Leathers Gig Bags.\n\nSelected Press\n\n\"Gut-busting, horn-bedecked NY blues...

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Monkey Union ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10359059.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Everything is a nuisance.", "otherInfo": "L\u00f6rdag 9/5 streamer vi tv\u00e5 grymma band direkt fr\u00e5n Lagret.

I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Spillane ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10338686.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "John Spillane", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "John Spillane is a musician, songwriter, performer, recording artist, storyteller, poet and dreamer.

The music needed to exist, and it was as much an emotional exercise as a creative one.\n\u201cI think every other record that I've written, I wrote knowing that the songs would have an outlet,\u201d Costa says \u201cAnd for this one, I really didn\u2019t. It was just a process I was going through, clearing myself of these feelings and thoughts.\u201d\nThe songs were like Costa\u2019s letters to himself, with the honesty and intimacy of something that was not meant to be heard. \u201c I feel really close to them for that reason,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of my favorite writing is like that - Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s Dear Theo, or Steinbeck\u2019s A Life in Letters. Those are really revealing, because it\u2019s not intended as part of their body of work. There\u2019s something really special about that. But at the same time, I write songs and perform for a living. So it's hard to think these songs will never see the light of day.\u201d\nAnd now, of course, they have. Yellow Coat is a masterpiece of heartbreak from a preternatural tunesmith, its raw emotion channeled into gently swinging, hooky love songs, most of them awash in strings and mellotron and harmonies and groove. From the insinuating acoustic riffs and lo-fi beats of \u201cAvenal\u201d and the snappy fatalism of \u201cSlow\u201d to the almost church-like fragility of \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d Yellow Coat is equal parts lost \u201860s AM radio hits, folk-pop beauty and dark night of the soul music.\nAt the time that Costa started writing, he had stripped things down not only emotionally, but in terms of his surroundings. He had moved into a Laguna Beach studio - as in the size of his living quarters, not a recording complex - with just the bare minimum of furniture and instruments. Instead of a bedside table, a Wurlitzer Sideman drum machine.\nThe Wurlitzer eventually got used and sampled on \u201cAvenal,\u201d which Costa and his friend Chase Perkowski (Iris and the Shade) wrote on a going-nowhere road trip a few hundred miles northeast of L.A. \u201cI was in a searching headspace,\u201d Costa says. \u201cRunning away from something, trying to find something, trying to find myself. We stopped at a gas station overlooking highway 5. Chase was strumming a few chords as the gas was pumping, and I sat under a tree humming a melody and frantically writing down lyrics. By the time the car was fully fueled I asked him to play back the chords to me as I sang the song.\u201d Back on the road, the next sign said \u201cAVENAL: 2 Miles\u201d and Costa had both his opening track and song title.\nThe 37 year-old Costa has a lot of music and artistic growth under his belt, particularly in the last six years. He was 21 when he made his first EP, having immersed himself in music after a bad skateboard landing sidetracked what might have been a pro career. Coming out of that world, he had a punk side, but also became enamored of Scottish folk, and Brian Jones\u2019 guitar style in the Rolling Stones.\n\u201cOne of my first shows that I played was with a band that was all about things like At The Drive-In,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI went up there with my acoustic guitar and played like a Pixies song, and a Donovan song, and then an original of mine. And I remember thinking, What am I? Do I even belong here?\u201d But at no point did he ever think, \u201cOkay, I'm just going to be a guy with a guitar. I always heard bigger arrangements.\u201d\nHe began his career on Jack Johnson\u2019s Brushfire Records, where both his 2006 debut, Songs We Sing, and 2008\u2019s Unfamiliar Faces were produced by No Doubt\u2019s Tom Dumont. Costa produced 2010\u2019s Mobile Chateau himself, while 2013\u2019s self-titled effort brought him to Scotland, where producer Tony Doogan (Beck, Air) assembled a backing band drawn from the ranks of Belle and Sebastian. In 2013, he began a several year period of restless wandering, working on soundtracks such as the 2017 documentary Orange Sunshine and releasing short EPs experimenting with different aspects of his artistry. Then, in 2018 with Santa Rosa Fangs, he found a new home at Dangerbird. The record, a winding story about a family of characters in Northern California, was a rebirth of sorts and a second act to a long and storied career.\n\u201cI've always had freedom in making my records and songs,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with Dangerbird, and the last records, they really trusted me to follow my instincts, which is a pretty special place to be.\u201d\nEven before writing \u201cAvenal,\u201d Costa had done a fair amount of home recording. Once an album seemed to be in the cards, the label suggested he connect with producer Alex Newport (At the Drive-In, Death Cab For Cutie, Bleached), as much because they would get along personally as creatively. They worked on three songs that were in varying states of completion, including \u201cLast Love Song\u201d (a simple home recording), \u201cSlow\u201d (a demo) and \u201cMake That Change\u201d (a bare-bones solo acoustic track that Costa and Newport fleshed out from start to finish). Then they kept on going.\nCosta plays a bit of everything on the record, but he also brought in touring drummer Cory Gash and one-woman string section Alexis Mahler (she plays both violin and cello). Costa and Mahler had previously done a lot of remote recording, but this time she came down to California for a week. \u201cWe worked up a bunch of arrangements together that lifted up a lot of the songs in a nice way,\u201d Costa says. \u201cI wanted to really pull up some of the emotional stuff with string and things\u201d (said \u2018things\u2019 being the mellotron, which can evoke so many different tones, as well as Costa\u2019s layered vocals).\nCosta had been playing \u201cSlow\u201d at solo shows before recording it, but it was first written around a rhythm track. With its snappy bass and doo-wop-inspired backing vocals, it feels like a song that could have been plucked from a Scorsese movie, except made in 2020. The sweeping, soulful \u201cJet Black Lake\u201d is equally cinematic, with Costa pushing his vocal range into falsetto.\nBut it\u2019s \u201cLet Love Heal\u201d and \u201cLast Love Song\u201d that are perhaps the heart of the record, bittersweet evocations of love\u2019s power to both soothe and devastate. When Costa first wrote what became \u201cLast Love Song,\u201d it had a different title, and was meant to be an anniversary gift. Instead, it turned into a break-up song, its sadness as palpable as the sound of Costa\u2019s fingers on guitar strings.\nLife does go on, however: the record ends with the last song Costa wrote for it, \u201cSo I Say Goodbye,\u201d which provides a sense of closure, its piano-driven tunefulness feeling both uplifting and melancholy. And since finishing Yellow Coat, Costa has written and released an even newer piece of music, \u201cHuman Kind of Song,\u201d which he lyrically crowd-sourced with fans on Instagram while sheltering in-place. Like every other songwriter, he doesn\u2019t know when he will next play live in front of people, so the experience provided some community. And while Yellow Coat may have started as an album about heartbreak, its sense of sadness, hope and perseverance also feels completely universal.\n\u201cEveryone's going through personal trials all the time,\u201d says Costa. \u201cAnd it can be isolating.

From pieces of broken mirrors there will be a crown bestowed upon his head. In reflections of shattered glass not only the seasons will turn, but also the change disguised by the lapse of time. His mind will have to come to bear the weight of everything that was left behind and forgotten. Archiving the inaccessible. Celebrating the abandoned and mourning the destroyed. The city burials.\u201d (Anders Nystr\u00f6m, Katatonia)\n\nRevered masters of melancholy for nearly 30 years, Katatonia have always pursued a profound emotional connection with their music and those who listen to it. Formed in Stockholm in 1991 by now vocalist Jonas Renkse and guitarist Anders Nystr\u00f6m, this most free-spirited of modern metal bands have taken a slow and steady but endless fascinating journey from primitive beginnings in the extreme metal underground to their current status as darlings of both the metal world and the progressive rock scene.\n\nFrom early attempts to channel their sorrow like seminal 1993 debut Dance Of December Souls and its much lauded follow-up Brave Murder Day (1994) through to post-millennial masterworks like Last Fair Deal Gone Down (2001) and Viva Emptiness (2003), Katatonia\u2019s ever-evolving sound and utterly unique atmospheric identity has cast its spell over generations of music fans, culminating in a recent run of flawless records and ever-more celebrated live performances that few modern bands could hope to match. Most recently, the Swedes\u2019 tenth full-length album The Fall Of Hearts (2016) was universally acclaimed and seemed to herald a long-deserved surge of popularity and prominence: acknowledgement, perhaps, that Katatonia have clicked into yet another higher gear.\n\nBut for all the momentum generated by their story so far, the band surprised their legions of admirers by taking an unexpected break from Katatonia, following the conclusion of the last album\u2019s tour cycle. Joyously, 2020 brings the news that they are not only back, but newly armed with arguably their finest album to date, the enormously vivid and powerful City Burials.\n\n\u201cAfter the whole tour cycle was over, we decided to have a little bit of a break,\u201d explains Renkse. \u201cIt was the first time we\u2019d ever done that with Katatonia. We\u2019d been doing the band for such a long time we thought we might all focus on something else for a while, to see if we still have the drive and the hunger to do Katatonia. As it turned out, we all missed it very much. It\u2019s been a good thing, because it really showed us that Katatonia is a very crucial part of our lives and we need to move forward with it.\u201d\n\nAlthough diehard fans will instantly recognise Katatonia\u2019s amorphous but unmistakable atmospheric imprint, City Burials is yet another example of how this band are in an exhilarating state of perpetual evolution. This time round, Jonas Renkse has written the vast majority of music and all of the lyrics, resulting in a record that is perhaps even more personal to the singer than previous efforts. Nonetheless, he assures us all that the band\u2019s collaborative instincts are as strong as ever.\n\n\u201cActually I had the ideas for this one. It\u2019s hard to explain, but it has never been like, \u2018I want you to write five songs and I\u2019ll write five songs!\u2019\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s more down to whoever is creative during that particular period and who\u2019s not. Anders, this time, didn\u2019t write very much, but he\u2019s been at my side at the production helm to make sure everything is right for the band. We still have very good cooperation within the band, even if I wrote all the music for this album.\u201d\n\nThe proof of Jonas and Anders\u2019 enduring artistic bond is displayed throughout City Burials\u2019 absorbing 58 minutes of meticulously crafted melodies and inspired, idiosyncratic arrangements. From the spine-tingling dynamics of opener Heart Set To Divide through and the simmering menace of Lacquer to the wildly evocative sorrow-scapes of City Glaciers and the exquisitely delicate Vanishers (featuring a guest vocal from Anni Bernhard, of Stockholm art rockers Full Of Keys) Katatonia\u2019s eleventh studio album is a showcase for a partnership that was magical from the very start. Recorded at three different studios, with vocals being recorded at Jonas\u2019 own home studio, and produced by the band themselves, City Burials is both a reaffirmation of musical values and a brave leap forward.\n\n\u201cWhenever me or Anders come up with something that is in the Katatonia frame, it\u2019s always going to end up sounding like Katatonia, even if it\u2019s a side-step or an unexpected musical turn \u2013 it will always end up sounding like something very natural,\u201d Jonas notes. \u201cI think it\u2019s because our relationship goes back many, many years and we\u2019ve known each other for such a long time. We\u2019ve collaborate musically since we were kids, basically. So we know exactly what to expect from the other person, and we know what to add to each other\u2019s ideas to make them even better. We totally trust each other.\u201d\n\nBeyond their core creative duo, Katatonia are very much a full-blown band, and the chemistry between Jonas, Anders and their band mates \u2013 bassist Niklas Sandin, drummer Daniel Moilanen and most recent recruit, guitarist Roger \u00d6jersson \u2013 has never sounded more potent. As Jonas points out, City Burials is the first album Katatonia have made since \u00d6jersson became a full-time member, and his contributions have been extremely significant.\n\n\u201cRoger started playing with us right after the previous album was mixed. He actually did a couple of solos on that album but everything else was already recorded when he joined the band. So it means he\u2019s been with us for about four years and this was the first album he actually played on. It was really nice to have a full band with two guitar players again, and also having his expertise in the studio, because he\u2019s a really good guitar player.\u201d\n\nInspired by an injection of fresh blood into Katatonia\u2019s creative brew, City Burials is an album that sees the band reclaim part of their heavy metal roots, via several moments of exuberant, old school classicism, deftly woven into these new songs\u2019 kaleidoscopic fabric. Although songs like Behind The Blood and Rein are as heart-rending and immersive as any in Katatonia\u2019s illustrious catalogue, it is both a surprise and a thrill to hear the band throwing caution to the wind and kicking some serious ass, albeit in moderation...\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a little bit unexpected for us to do that, but it\u2019s something that we wanted to play around with a little bit,\u201d Jonas grins. \u201cWe\u2019re not the youngest guys anymore and we all grew up with heavy metal music. On the last tour we did, we played a Judas Priest cover every night, Night Comes Down, and it was so fun to do it, we thought that maybe we should have some \u201880s heavy metal stuff thrown into our music for the hell of it and see how it works out. I think it works really well. it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll probably enjoy doing live, that kind of riffing and the solos. It\u2019ll be fun to take that to the stage.\u201d\n\nThe music on City Burials may boast some of Katatonia\u2019s most direct and explosive moments to date, but these songs dwell firmly in the band\u2019s perennially enigmatic and ill-defined conceptual world, wherein the power of emotions \u2013 of loss, of love, of sadness and joy \u2013 are always too overwhelming for specifics or prosaic declarations. Instead, the thematic red line that runs from Heart Set To Divide through to Untrodden speaks of the intensity of fragile emotions unsettled by the passing of time.\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re both from Stockholm, we grew up here and we explored it when we were younger,\u201d Jonas explains. \u201cWe don\u2019t know all of it but certain parts of this town are very well known to us. I was thinking about it once when I was walking through where I used to live when I was a kid, and I started thinking that I had so many memories from certain streets or even specific houses in this particular part of town, and I thought that everything that\u2019s a memory now feels somehow buried. Every memory is a loss, in a way, because it\u2019s something you can\u2019t grab anymore. We\u2019re reaching that age where the end of life is within our reach, so maybe you start thinking about the things you\u2019ve seen and experienced.\u201d\n\nAs Jonas notes with a wry chuckle, City Burials is \u201cnot a comeback!\u201d Katatonia simply took a breather and subsequently realised that their shared urge to make extraordinary music had, if anything, intensified over the years. The result is an album that looks certain to push the band ever further into the spotlight. With grand plans for extensive touring around the world in support of their latest and perhaps greatest album, Katatonia are wringing fresh hope from life\u2019s gloom-sodden tapestry. And it sounds incredible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited to present this album to the world,\u201d Jonas concludes. \u201cI guess people from our generation are still waiting for great albums, they still have the attention span for it. But even with my own kids, it\u2019s very different these days. They just listen to the same songs over and over again. The album as a concept is unknown to them. But you have to respect that as well. We can\u2019t change that. But hopefully if people hear a song on this album and they like it, they might try a few more!\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Amaranthe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9104810.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Modern Melodic Metal", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "These are the voyages of the visionary band AMARANTHE. Their ultimate mission: to explore the opaque realms between extreme metal and electronic tunes, to pioneer the invention of new approaches of joining two traditionally contradicting musical worlds, to boldly go where no metal band has gone before.\n\nEvolution requires visionaries. One of the biggest bangs of the modern metal universe happened in the fall of 2008.\n\nIt was the Finland-based label Spinefarm Records that took the proverbial cake. In April 2011 the band released their eponymous debut album to worldwide acclaim, charting high in Sweden and Finland. Right off the bat tapping the vein of the digital music revolution, AMARANTHE was the 84th most played album on Spotify in the whole world, all genres included. After 92 live shows in support of the eponymous debut, AMARANTHE returned to their creative home, Hansen Studios in Ribe, Denmark where the magic of the debut album was originally bottled.\n\nWith THE NEXUS album, released in March 2013, and its life cycle everything went up another notch: the album featured more of melodic / edgier metal, and even more brazenly techno-influenced hard rock. The release was followed by a longer tour.\n\nWasting no time, the band returned to Ribe to concoct another potion of power. Consequently, in October 2014 Spinefarm released the 3rd AMARANTHE outing, MASSIVE ADDICTIVE. The album also yielded AMARANTHE\u2019s first major single hit with \u201cDrop Dead Cynical\u201d.\n\nOne of the hardest working bands in the genre, the band released their 4th album MAXIMALISM already in October 2016.\n\nDeservedly revered as trailblazers of the genre, AMARANTHE, ever the visionaries, always seem to take the next bold step into realms unknown before anyone else does. AMARANTHE is the driving force of a modern metal revolution.\n\nWith their electrifying 5th album HELIX now on the brink of its release AMARANTHE take another leap in their sonic evolution. Their most focused work to date, Helix proves the band has refined their melodic sensibilities ever further whilst retaining their cutting-edge metal assault as massively aggressive as ever.\n\nNow, armed with an album with unprecedented crossover potential, AMARANTHE is ready to tear down the walls of musical separation.

Folk music doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d - Mary Gauthier\n\nA modern folksinger whose music nods to the genre's 1970s glory days, Amy Speace has spent two decades chronicling the high marks, heartbreaks, and hard roads of a life logged on the road. She's been a tireless traveler, chasing the dream from the coffeehouses of New York City to larger stages across the globe. Along the way, she's built an international audience without the help of a major label, relying instead upon a touring schedule whose milestones include the Glastonbury Festival, NPR's Mountain Stage, and a yearly average of 150 shows.\n\nMe And The Ghost Of Charlemagne finds Speace focusing on the other side of that so-called dream. The real side, filled with an ever-shifting balance of struggle and joy. Produced by longtime collaborator Neilson Hubbard and recorded during the final weeks of Speace's pregnancy with her first son, Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne captures Amy Speace at her most nakedly honest, with sparsely-decorated songs that double down on her larger-than-life voice and detail-rich songwriting. It\u2019s an album about the colliding of dreams and reality, full of characters making sense of their lives when something is lost and then found. Really, it's an album about the trials and triumphs of an artist's journey \u2014 a journey that's no longer focused upon the destination, but upon the actual trip itself.\n\nDiscovered and mentored by folk-pop icon Judy Collins during the early 2000s, Speace left her career as a classically-trained Shakespearean actress and, instead, kicked off a string of acclaimed albums, including Songs for Bright Street, The Killer in Me, and How to Sleep in a Stormy Boat. Championed by The New York Times, NPR and other taste-making outlets for her solo work, she received further acclaim as a member of Applewood Road, a harmony-heavy trio whose self-titled album became a critical success in the UK, earning a five-star review from The London Sunday Times.\n\nYears before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Speace was one of the genre's earliest champions, mixing the best parts of American roots music \u2014 gospel, alt-country, folk, classic pop \u2014 into her own songs. Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne follows in that diverse tradition, but it also shines its light on a new Amy Speace: a clear-eyed, reenergized songwriter who's done with chasing things that don't matter\u2026but isn't anywhere close to being done with her art.", "otherInfo": "Each Saturday I'll be playing a lunchtime concert on FACEBOOK.COM/AMYSPEACE from my Closet (or screened in porch) during this strange time.

In the fall of \u201999 she moved to Salzgitter, Germany where she collaborated on a commercial pop project, marking her first experience singing in a professional studio. In May 2000 she returned to Austin to explore performing and song writing. Following her role as supporting vocalist and dancer for the Austin high-energy rock band Young Heart Attack in 2001, Martin launched her solo career in 2002 with an opening slot for Wilco and her debut album Pretty Things. Shortly after the album\u2019s release, she moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia and had her first commercial success when two of her songs were placed in the award-winning British-Canadian two-part drama Sex Traffic (2004) and in the TV drama series Snakes and Ladders (2004).\n\nWith her second album, Two Hearts (2008), Martin gained considerable attention as a hot up-and-coming artist with several East Coast Music Awards and Nominations. Her Two Hearts music video rose to #5 on the Much More Music Countdown, leading to tours across Canada, the US and Ireland. She performed high-profile shows with Canadian rock icon Matt Mays and sang on Parliament Hill in Ottawa for The Queen of England. You Come Home was placed in the internationally distributed teen drama series The Best Years (2010). Two Hearts won Martin two 2008 Music Nova Scotia Awards, and a 2009 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\nHer third album I Can Too (2010) received rave reviews and includes a collaboration with Blue Rodeo\u2019s Greg Keelor on her rendering of Andrew Sisk\u2019s Subject To Change. \u201cWhat sets I Can Too apart is Martin\u2019s commitment to honestly exploring complicated relationships.\u201d (Exclaim Magazine, October 2010). Following multiple East Coast Music Award Nominations and extensive touring across Canada with Juno nominated indie rock band Cuff The Duke, Martin began touring independently in Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nIn 2011 Martin worked on building her label Come Undone Records, and focused on developing a global online presence with fans via community-based projects. She worked with PledgeMusic.com to release A House Concert (2011) containing fourteen live acoustic versions of songs from her first three studio albums. Martin was nominated at the 2011 Music Nova Scotia Awards for Digital Artist of the Year and A House Concert was nominated at the 2012 East Coast Music Awards for Folk Recording of the Year. This project also raised awareness and funds for the Canadian Mental Health Association. During 2011-2012 Christina continued her community development initiatives with a yearlong Artist in Residency through Geriatric Medicine Research (GMR) at Dalhousie University and The Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 2014 she released an EP titled Remember Me, featuring five songs inspired by and dedicated to individuals affected by dementia. Co-produced and written by Dale Murray, the EP won the 2014 Music Nova Scotia Award for Inspirational Recording of the Year.\n\nSleeping With A Stranger (2012), Martin\u02bcs fifth award-winning album, reflects the artist\u2019s coming of age lyrically and musically. \u201cIt\u02bcs one of those rare albums where you have to listen to it all in one sitting. Like a good book that\u2019s hard to put down, Sleeping With A Stranger tickles the ears and within three bars you\u2019re completely hooked.\u201d (Americana UK, October 2012). The album won her the 2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Recording of the Year Award. It was nominated for three East Coast Music Awards Come Undone Records was nominated for Music Nova Scotia Company of the Year. What I Always Knew was placed in the CBC television drama Heartland and her single Falling For You remained on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 countdown for five months.\n\nMartin returned home from Europe in the spring of 2014, following eighty concert dates which included a performance at Rolling Stone Weekender Festival, a publicity partnership with PopUp Records in Hamburg, and an endorsement from the esteemed Duesenberg Custom Guitar Shop in Hannover, Germany. She secured relationships for her future from her home base as Artist in Residence in the city of Dachau, Germany.\n\nIt\u2019ll Be Alright (2015) found Christina attaining what her music has always suggested, a place where the ghosts of her musical heroes freely mingle with the architecture of modern music. Working closely with her long-time producer and guitarist Dale Murray, drummer Brian Murray and bassist Jason Vautour, Martin made a conscious effort to confound the expectations of those who have categorized her in the past. This record utilizes far more sonic textures, allowing Martin to explore the many sides of her musical personality. The album won a 2016 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year and her It\u2019ll Be Alright single rose to #6 on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 chart. You Ran From Me was voted the #14 most played Canadian song on Sonica for 2015, and Somewhere With You was placed in the CBC Television show Heartland.\n\nFollowing two years of touring across Germany, Poland, The Netherlands, The UK, Switzerland, Austria, France and Canada, Martin returned home briefly in 2016 to write her newest album. A fervent anthem for those who are lost and longing, Lungs Are Burning was the first single from her album Impossible To Hold (Released March 23, 2018). The first single was triggered by the rising Fentanyl drug crisis killing thousands of Canadians, with Christina\u2019s lyrics set to music by her and Dale Murray. With lyrics like \u201cwhile I\u2019m watching the babies\u201d and \u201cgot to go out and get some, baby\u201d, Martin captures the desperation of \u201cchasing the dream\u201d and the horror of living it. Murray\u2019s stately production brings that stark reality home with a bite. Martin: \u201cThe song is an modest attempt to bring light to the heavy topic of addiction, and reflects my own personal sense of loss, longing and a deep void, and the ache I feel from losing my brother and friends to addiction and mental illness.\u201d For her Canadian tour dates, Christina has partnered with Center for Addiction and Mental Health to increase engagement and awareness.\n\n\u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is Martin\u2019s sixth and strongest studio album, achieving a perfect balance between organic ambience and impeccable production. \u201cI\u2019m writing about faith and love more than ever with songs like \u2018Keep Me Calm\u2019 and \u2018Always Reminding\u2019, but I haven\u2019t shaken the need to write about the darker things that are part of our human journey\u201d. Combining good taste, passionate singing and thoughtful lyrics, \u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is where music and poetry meet. The album won the 2018 Music Nova Scotia Award for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\n\nAWARDS\n\n2018 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Impossible To Hold)\n2016 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (It\u2019ll Be Alright)\n2014 Music Nova Scotia Inspirational Recording of the Year (Remember Me \u2013 EP)\n2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Sleeping With A Stranger)\n2009 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n\nARTIST IN RESIDENCIES COMPLETED\n\n2013-2015 Dachau, Germany\n\n2010-2011 Halifax NS, Canada \u2013 Dalhousie Geriatric Medical Research & Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN)\n\nFESTIVALS/CONFERENCES\n\n2019 Ottawa Blues Fest - Ottawa ON, Canada\n2019 Area506 - Saint John NB, Canada\n2018 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto, Canada\n2017 Sonder Fest \u2013 Manchester, United Kingdom\n2016 Reeperbahn Festival \u2013 Hamburg, Germany\n2016 Rising Tide Festival @ Fundy National Park- Alma NB, Canada\n2016 Harmony Bazaar Festival \u2013 Lockeport NS, Canada\n2016 Maverick Festival \u2013 Suffolk, United Kingdom\n2013 Rolling Stone Weekender Festival \u2013 Weissenh\u00e4user Strand, Germany\n2011 Winter Olympics @ Atlantic Canada House \u2013 Vancouver BC, Canada\n2011 Canada Games \u2013 Halifax NS, Canada\n2011 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2010 Belfast Nashville Songwriters Festival \u2013 Belfast, Ireland\n2009 Folk Alliance \u2013 Memphis TN, USA\n2009 North By North East \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2009 Stan Rogers Festival \u2013 Canso NS, Canada\n2002 SXSW - Austin TX, USA", "otherInfo": "Join us for a Live Stream (on Facebook).\n\nChristina would have been performing at New Scotland Brewing in Dartmouth NS.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON). The Allaire Show features John sharing the stage with local and up-and-coming talent as well as more experienced and established musicians, some who\u2019ve come from as far away as Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\n\nAWARDS\n- American Songwriter Assoc. \"Best Lyrics\" Award 2009 for \"Magnets\" (Nashville, TN)\n\n- Toronto Independent Music Awards \"Best Live Act\" (2009)\n\n- CBC Telefest top independent music video in Ontario (1989)\n\n- Top independent video in Canada 1989 as selected by MuchMusic\n\n- Canadian College and University Radio Assoc. top album of the month - \"All's Well\" (1989)\n\n- PROCAN (now SOCAN) independent songwriter award for \"Cry at Night\" (1987)", "otherInfo": "The (World Famous) ALLAIRE SHOW!!! 3pm-5pm Saturdays\n\nNow streaming live on The ALLAIRE SHOW Facebook page @theallaireshow 3pm Saturdays."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Set It Off ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9609744.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Orchestral Pop Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Every day that you wake up, you have a choice. A choice of who you are, how you present yourself, and how you want to be remembered. And in the face of those daily choices \u2013 and ahead of the release of Upside Down \u2013 Set It Off has simply chosen to be more. More ambitious. More unified. More confident. More open-minded. More collaborative. And above all, more authentic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten stronger. We really have. As a whole. As a unit. We feel more together. When you go through struggle and you make it through, your bond strengthens. That\u2019s what Upside Down is about. That\u2019s the theme of this album. Going through struggle, and instead of taking it as defeat or a sign to give up \u2013 turning it into a positive and moving forward,\u201d declares Set It Off frontman Cody Carson. \u201cWe go through a lot every year, we\u2019re in the music industry, that\u2019s gonna happen. So we decided to band together, and just push forward.\u201d\n\nThe Tampa, FL-based band released Upside Down, their third full-length, on October 7th via Equal Vision Records. The album was recorded in Los Angeles, CA with producers Brandon Paddock (Panic! At The Disco, Avril Lavigne, Pentatonix), Erik Ron (Saosin, Panic! At The Disco) and Mike Green (5 Seconds of Summer, All Time Low, Cassadee Pope). The release was noted as one of the \u201cMost Anticipated Albums of 2016\u201d by Alternative Press Magazine and follows the band\u2019s sophomore album, Duality, which debuted at No. 18 on the Billboard Independent Chart, No. 81 on the Billboard Top Current Chart, and No. 86 on the Billboard Top 200 Chart; And the band\u2019s debut full-length, Cinematics, that was released in September 2012, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard South Atlantic Heatseekers Regional Chart, No. 4 on Billboard Heatseekers Chart, No. 9 on Billboard Next Big Sound Chart, No. 38 Independent Chart, and even broke into the Billboard Top 200 chart at No. 174. Set It Off formed in 2008 and is comprised of Cody Carson (vocals), Dan Clermont (guitar), Zach DeWall (guitar) and Maxx Danziger (drums).\n\nUpside Down sonically takes a brighter sound than previous releases and offers the band\u2019s most pop-driven anthems to date. Bold electronic elements guide loud, driving rock instrumentations with guitar riffs as catchy as the choruses and an overall feel-good, dance-worthy vibe throughout. On Upside Down, Set It Off commands attention and brings authenticity back to pop music in a bold and unapologetic way.\n\n\u201cI felt like a change was needed for Upside Down, so we decided to go back to our roots. Instead of focusing on what we think everyone else should hear from us or how they should perceive us, we went back to the roots of writing songs for the sake of wanting to write a good song. Opening our minds up to doing more co-writes and to collaborating more and just doing whatever it takes to chase that perfect song,\u201d he shares. \u201cAnd I feel like once we got out of our darker, more theatrical Cinematics era, writing became easier because we weren\u2019t inside of a box. So with Duality, the first time we started making the transition [to our roots], we started to open our minds to what Set It Off could become if we just didn\u2019t put any boundaries on ourselves and just wrote whatever came out of our minds and our hearts at that moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWriting Duality really showed me that a vibe is everything in writing. If I\u2019m excited and I\u2019m getting into it, then I\u2019m going to write better melodies. If I\u2019m feeling confident, I\u2019m going to write better melodies and have better ideas. I\u2019ve always heard that songwriting and producing is 99% confidence \u2013 and it\u2019s so true. Brandon [Paddock] brought out a writing side of us and a confidence that we\u2019ve never had. And I immediately became a better writer from that,\u201d notes Carson.\nDuality was our learning process of getting better and Upside Down is us \u2013 our system is on point now.\"\n\nDiscussing the band\u2019s hardships with people they\u2019ve worked with, how they\u2019ve coped with current events going on in the world, and reflecting on past personal relationships of past and present, Upside Down covers a wide spectrum lyrically \u2013 creating a dynamic and distinctly human experience. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s important to be honest, to be yourself. To me, I like how genuine the album is, I love the guys in my band because of the people they are and how real they are, and how real we are with everyone else. That\u2019s what I like with our connection with our fanbase too. And that\u2019s what I want people to take away from all of this...people just seeing us as people.

Fronted by self-confessed contrarian Phil Labonte, the band has experimented with a range of styles including pop, rock and caustic metalcore with just one objective \u2013 to create great songs that come straight from the heart.\n\n\u201cOur goal has always been to write songs that we like,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cAll That Remains has seen a lot of criticism about the songs that we\u2019ve written and what people think we\u2019re supposed to do. We started as a very underground death metal kind of band, we\u2019ve since moved away from that and have never apologized for it. The music we\u2019ve written has been reflective of that and I think the lyrics, the ideas, have always been reflective of that as well.\u201d\n\nAnd through it all, All That Remains have experienced considerable success. The band\u2019s last album 2015\u2019s The Order of Things reached #3 on the Billboard U.S. Hard Rock Albums chart and #5 on their Top Rock Albums chart. And to date, All That Remains have sold over a million albums Worldwide. The band has headlined across the world and played major festivals, including the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Fest.\n\nYet along the way, All That Remains have taken flak from just about everybody: extreme metal purists who accused the group of selling out, rock fans that don\u2019t get the screamy stuff, liberals who object to Labonte\u2019s right-of-center lyrics and conservatives that can\u2019t understand the singer\u2019s non-violent, Libertarian ways. Labonte\u2019s response \u2013 bring it on!\n\nMadness, All That Remains\u2019 eighth album, is the band\u2019s most musically eclectic, provocative release to date \u2013 full of undeniable hooks, incisive riffs, electronic samples and a variety of vocal styles. And, of course, the range of subject matter addressed pushes the band\u2019s limits further than ever.\n\n\"I don't mind if I piss off if it gets them to think about things. People know that I have strong opinions and I disagree with things. That's my whole deal.\"\n\nAs contrary as he wants to be, Labonte still values quality over confrontation. Madness, produced by Grammy award winning Howard Benson (Halestorm, Papa Roach, Chris Cornell), is All That Remains at their best, offering a level of accessibility and diversity lacking from much of today\u2019s hard rock and metal. The first single and title track, \u201cMadness,\u201d is a microcosm for the rest of the album.\n\nThe song starts on an experimental note with a barrage of amp static and the buzzing of ungrounded electricity accompanied by a sharp, simple drum intro. A pause later, the whole band kicks into gear, blending a propulsive rhythm with a kinetic groove that swings like a rope ladder in a thunderstorm. As the vocals enter, the guitars drop out, replaced by a delicate keyboard melody and electronic beats. Then, after Labonte sings, \u201cWhy should we escape ourselves? We are who we are in the end,\u201d the tone shifts back in a heavier direction, leading to a monster chorus more infectious than influenza.\u201d In true Labonte style, the tune is neither a love song nor a euphoric anthem about rocking out. \u201cIt\u2019s about socialism,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the repetition of bad ideas.\u201d\n\nOther songs on Madness are far more variegated. The leadoff track \u201cSafe House,\u201d which is about a man who lures robbers into his home and then kills them, is the heaviest track All That Remains has written since they played melodic death metal in the first half of the aughts. Driven by barreling beats, thrashy guitars, a crushing breakdown and metalcore screaming, the track pulverizes even as haunting keyboards and clanging percussion offer a brief respite from the jackhammer pounding.\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cFar From Home,\u201d which shifts between ringing acoustic guitars and forlorn vocals about being lost and alone, and a euphoric rock passage that shows that there\u2019s always light in the darkness.\n\nThroughout Madness All That Remains revisits the dichotomy between savagery and sensitivity. \u201cTrust and Believe\u201d contrasts double-bass drums, chugging riffs and melodic guitar licks with soaring guitar melodies and an anthemic chant-along chorus and \u201cHalo\u201d opens with a speedy electronic passage that sounds like a violin on hyper drive, then develops into a blazing number that balances melodic vocals with pain stricken howls.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted this record to be different,\u201d Labonte says,\u201d explaining the inclusion of electronic samples and the dramatic juxtaposition between roaring chaos and accessible craftsmanship. \u201cWe wanted to really push ourselves and push the boundaries of what we\u2019re allowed to do. We\u2019ve always pushed that envelope, but we wanted to push it more.\u201d\n\nAll That Remains started working on Madness in the spring of 2016, then in April Labonte flew from his home in Western Massachusetts to Los Angeles to start working on vocal melodies and lyrics with Benson. It was the first time the band didn\u2019t have fleshed out riffs and fully written rhythms to serve as guideposts for the vocals. At first, the process was difficult and the band members were uncomfortable, but the more they worked on the record the more excited they became about the way the songs were coming out. For the first time in years, they felt genuinely challenged and inspired to learn new ways to create.\n\n\u201cMe, Mike and Oli are the primary writers and we\u2019ve always written songs on guitars because we\u2019re all guitar players,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cIt was a totally different way to write songs. And I feel like it was really, really cool to do that because it gave us a fresh perspective. I\u2019d bring Mike and Oli the vocals and they\u2019d use what I had come up with to construct the riffs instead of the other way around.\u201d\n\nThe most difficult song for Labonte to create was \u201cRivercity.\u201d The song begins with a ringing telephone and progresses through an electronic beat, a melancholy, ballad-like guitar line and plaintive vocals. The track changes in intensity numerous times and injects various rhythm shifts before ending like it began. When he was working on \u201cRivercity,\u201d Labonte\u2019s then-wife was deployed in the Middle East in the Marines and the singer was left helpless at home while she risked her life on the front lines.\n\nWhile the title \u201cRivercity\u201d sounds like an innocent enough name for a song \u2013 the kind of title John Mellencamp might use about childhood memories -- for Labonte the term was very real and frightening. \u201cRivercity stands for \u2018reduced communications,\u2019 he explains. \u201cMe and my ex would be on the phone and she\u2019d be like, \u201cYo, the base is getting mortared. I gotta go.\u2019 If someone dies, they shut off communications until they can notify the families of the people that die. So we\u2019d be talking and she would say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to rivercity and hang up, and I wouldn\u2019t talk to her for three or four days and I wouldn\u2019t know what happened. The base is getting mortared. She might have taken a round or died. Being on the other end of that is agonizing.\u201d\n\nIntegrating excruciating personal experiences, political rants and controversial commentary with music that\u2019s just as confrontational, Madness is an unapologetic showcase of honesty and ingenuity. Inducing gentle head-bobbing one moment and inciting teeth-clenching fist pounding the next, All That Remains have created about 50 minutes of attitude-laden rock music. Pick a song: \u201cOpen Grave,\u201d their version of Garth Brook\u2019s \u201cThe Thunder Rolls,\u201d \u201cBack at You, \u201cLouder.\u201d There\u2019s something there to surprise, antagonize or incentivize.\n\n\u201cIf you ask someone, \u2018Is this what you expected?\u2019 It\u2019s always a \u2018no,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cAnd that makes me happy. Is anyone challenging what the listener expects anymore? We don\u2019t do stuff because we\u2019re supposed to.\u201d\n\nLabonte accepts he\u2019ll continue to be misunderstood. Some will love Madness, some won\u2019t, but the album will make an impression on everyone who gives it an honest listen. Asked how he\u2019d like to viewed, Labonte responds, \u201cI want to be the guy that really challenges people\u2019s ideas. I\u2019m fucking punk rock. Punk rock hasn\u2019t been punk rock for 30 years. For too long metal has been bullshit, milky pandering crap. What happened to metal? What happened to punk rock? What happened to being anti-establishment?

The band\u2019s seventh album, Wildness, their first in seven years, entered the UK charts at Number Two, went gold, and kept them on tour around the world for the best part of 18 months.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gigging time, but also a lot of thinking time.\n\n\u201cWhere did it all go right?\u201d echoes Lighbtody. \u201cNo idea!\u201d the singer and songwriter laughs. \u201cAfter 10 years of no success, no one \u2013 least of all us \u2013 expected us these last 15 years to sell 17 million albums, headline festivals and play to thousands of people all over the world.\u201d\nAdd to that: one billion global track streams, five UK platinum albums, an Ivor Novello award and Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominations. And, in the shape of Chasing Cars, a modern classic recently anointed by the PPL as the most played song on UK radio of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWhen we released Final Straw in 2003, I think there was general goodwill around us from the media,\u201d continues Lightbody, \u201cas people knew the story of the previous 10 years and were kinda glad for us to get a shot on a major label,\" he notes of their move from indie Jeepster (also original home of Belle and Sebastian) to discerning Polydor imprint Fiction. That \u201csea-change\u201d set in motion the next phase of the band\u2019s existence. Still, in music, as in life, nothing is a given. \u201cOf course the good grace of the press is hard won and easy lost, but radio kept on playing us. That\u2019s been the real key to our success, I firmly believe. Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. On those shows we did some of the songs close to how they sound on the Reworked album \u2013 for example, the new version of You\u2019re All I Have came directly out of playing those acoustic shows.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re All I Have is the opening track from 2006\u2019s Eyes Open, the album that also featured Chasing Cars. On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain. Iain came up with the beautiful, John Martyn-style guitar, and his version floored me when I heard it the first time. Iain\u2019s guitar playing has always been a joy to listen to and to have it feature so prominently on this album is just amazing.\"\n\nAlso presented in simple acoustic simplicity is Chocolate, the third single from Final Straw, and produced here in classy, \u201ctime-stopping\u201d style by McDaid. \u201cChocolate has been a live favourite since we released it. It\u2019s a song all Snow Patrol fans know \u2013 I can\u2019t attest that they all love it but they know it!\u201d its co-author laughs. \u201cAnd we wanted to rework the songs that the fans are the most familiar with. There's not much point in reworking songs people don\u2019t really know as there's not really a stark contrast.\u201d\nThat said, \u201cwe will be doing something with the first two albums before the release of Reworked as those two albums do not feature for that same reason,\u201d Lightbody teases.\nWhat of the recent Twitter \u201caccusation\u201d that SP have \u201cdisowned\u201d those albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It\u2019s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2001), because they don\u2019t play the songs live?\n\u201cNot true at all,\u201d he replies with a shake of the head. \u201cWe are very proud of them. It\u2019s just that when we play those songs live they negatively affect the atmosphere of the gig. And as Star Trek taught us: \u2018The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat need to entertain and surprise also informed the approach taken to Called Out In The Dark. The curtain-raiser from 2011's Fallen Empires now comes with an inventive synth throb that echoes the original.\n\u201cI had worried a little that the whole record was getting very downtempo,\u201d admits Lightbody. \u201cThe nature of recording in hotel rooms and dressing rooms is that things will invariably be low-key. Hard to rock out with a family of four in the next hotel room trying to sleep!\n\u201cSo when it came to some of the songs we recorded towards the end of the new album, we wanted to explore a slightly higher tempo \u2013 without, of course, leaning too heavy into the original version. Called Out\u2026 is certainly the closest to the original version of any song on Reworked, but I think distinct enough to warrant its place. It has an electro bent like the original but steers clear of any of its predecessor\u2019s tropes. I asked Iain to lift it up and he sure did.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the three new songs. First up, the lovely, heart-stopping Time Won\u2019t Go Slowly.\n\u201cJohnny and I wrote this in his house in LA. We\u2019re both massive fans of Frank Ocean, so we wanted it to sound like Frank Ocean crossed with Frank Sinatra. All the Franks! It\u2019s a classic crooner track. We just wanted to try something starkly different from anything we have done before.\n\"As for the lyrics, I guess I\u2019ve not written about love for a while and needed a fix,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI like the idea of the inherent tragedy woven into the fabric of time: time speeds up when we're having a great time and slows down when we're miserable. Although it\u2019s all perception, of course, not reality. And I like that, too. That distortion. Our minds are powerful and sometimes terrible things. I guess the song tries to wrap its head around that great cosmic joke. Also it\u2019s just a love song.\"\nThen there\u2019s I Think of Home, a folk-flavoured piano ballad with vivid, evocative and deeply personal lyrics. Lightbody wrote it in 2014, as part of a five-song contribution \u201cto a night dedicated to my greatest literary hero Seamus Heaney when he opened the Seamus Heaney Home Place in Magherafelt. They wanted me to play a few songs at the opening night.\n\u201cI set my own rules for the songs\u2019 content,\" he expands. \"They had to be inspired by what Heaney had been inspired by: home, family, Ireland, The Troubles, hope, the soil\u2026\u201d\nI Think of Home was later considered for inclusion on Wildness, but none of the versions the band tried out in the studio fitted.\n\u201cBut then we went on tour with Wildness and at shows in Ireland and Irish strongholds like Boston, New York, Sydney and Melbourne, I would play I Think Of Home acoustically on my own in the middle of gigs. It would always go down well.\n\u201cSo when it came to Reworked we had lived with the song enough to feel like we could do a great version of it. And Johnny produced a stunning version of it. I had been playing it a certain way for so long it was hard for me to hear it any other way. That can be dangerous \u2013 stagnation can set in. So when that happens you have to let someone you trust take it from you and remake it. So, in the spirit of what we were doing, it was great to get a reworked version of a song that had never even been released.\"\nThe third new song is Made Of Something Different Now, which is quietly sweeping, quietly epic and wholly devastating.\n\u201cOne of my favourite tracks we have done in ages,\" nods Lightbody. \"In keeping with the Reworked attitude of trying new things, it\u2019s unlike much of what we\u2019ve done before. Lyrically, it\u2019s the story of a dear friend\u2019s heartbreak. My own heart, having not been in a relationship in ten years, is unrisked so unbroken. A damning self-portrait if ever there was one! Writing this song \u2013 with Johnny \u2013 made me realise my own lack of bravery in that department. Hasn\u2019t effected any change yet, mind you, but it did start me thinking at least\u2026 Anyway, as us Celts say, it\u2019s a belter,\u201d he grins.\n\nThe final word should go to Take Back The City. Gary Lightbody\u2019s hymn to Belfast is the song that opens Reworked and is sure to be an emotive live highlight when Snow Patrol take Reworked on the road later this year. As he reflects on 25 years of Snow Patrol, how have his feelings about the city changed in the 11 years since the song was released?\n\u201cWell, as the song says, I love Belfast tonight and always. There are still things that drive me crazy about the place. But I think that's the same for everyone\u2019s home city \u2013 although my home town, of course, is Bangor.\n\u201cMy love has deepened though not waned. I see the conflict that still goes on in people\u2019s hearts, my own included, and yet there is this drive in most people \u2013 most people \u2013 to put the past behind us and move on. To lift each other up.\n\u201cWe need that now more than ever with the looming clusterfuck that is Brexit and the devastation it has the potential to bring to the whole of UK, but to Northern Ireland more than anywhere else. We need that will to put the past behind us and lift each other.\u201d\n\nHear, hear. Equally, with these 16 inspiring, enveloping tracks, this is also moment to embrace the past \u2013 and, like the man said, to use it to lift each other. This is Reworked. This is Snow Patrol\u2019s history, and their legacy. And it\u2019s their inspired next step.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Pretty Reckless ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9739869.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Between 2013 and 2015, The Pretty Reckless traveled the globe touring in support of their second album, the raucous, roaring, Catholic guilt-inspired Going To Hell. A bruising blend of ferocious rock and roll and inky blues, the album debuted in the Top 5 on the Billboard Top 200 and spun off three No. 1 Mainstream Rock singles, \u201cFucked Up World,\u201d \u201cFollow Me Down\u201d and 2014\u2019s most successful song at the format, \u201cHeaven Knows,\u201d which spent a total of 18 weeks in the top spot. Going to Hell\u2019s success meant strong live demand for the New York City band, which is anchored by its songwriters, singer-guitarist Taylor Momsen and guitarist Ben Phillips, who have been making music together in partnership for ten years, and rounded out by bassist Mark Damon and drummer Jamie Perkins. The Going To Hell Tour sent The Pretty Reckless off on four separate jaunts across North America and three trips to Europe. Their explosive shows earned them legions of new fans at home and overseas. Despite feeling physically and emotionally spent after returning from their two-year odyssey, Momsen and Phillips jumped right into writing the songs for their third album, the scorching yet soulful Who You Selling For, which will be released by Razor & Tie in October. \u201cWe had so much we wanted to say, it was like shaking a can of soda on tour, and then when we started writing we cracked the seal,\u201d says Momsen. \u201cThe touring life is very isolating. You look at the world through a bus or airplane window. But music is the healing factor. It\u2019s the one thing that is grounding and a true companion through the forest. It saved us \u2014 again.\u201d The necessity of music as a balm for the soul is a theme that threads its way through Who You Selling For, which finds Momsen and Phillips dealing with emotions ranging from confusion and frustration to depression and despair. \u201cI think we felt a dire need to express those thoughts,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cAnd they\u2019re things I think most humans feel on a daily basis but don\u2019t always have an outlet to express. In the end we\u2019re saying, \u2018Don\u2019t give up, your soul is all you have, so you\u2019ve got to hang onto that.\u2019\u201d The album\u2019s opening track, \u201cHangman\u201d (which was inspired by a poem by Chidiock Tichborne written on the eve of his execution), tells a story of having control over your own mind and soul no matter what is happening to you. From there, Who You Selling For delves deep into the psyche of Momsen and Phillips \u2014 two artists who believe very much in the fiery redemptive power of rock and roll. The album\u2019s first single, \u201cTake Me Down,\u201d is a story of desperation, with Momsen delivering such lyrics as \u201cI spend all night and day / How much harder can I play? / You know I gave my life to rock and roll?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about wanting something so much you\u2019d sell your soul for it,\u201d Momsen says, adding that she and Phillips were inspired by blues artist Robert Johnson\u2019s song \u201cCrossroads,\u201d which some have interpreted as Johnson singing about selling his soul to the Devil in exchange for his musical ability. \u201cBack To The River\u201d is about the desire to get away from everything, to go where no one can reach you, while the strutting \u201cWild City\u201d is influenced by being young and on your own in New York (\u201cWe wrote it while walking down Rivington Street on the Lower East Side,\u201d Momsen says). The most aggressive song on the album is \u201cOh My God,\u201d which Momsen describes as \u201cself-confession right out of a journal. I think it speaks for itself.\u201d And finally \u201cWho You Selling For\u201d testifies to music being a form of salvation and describes how the rest of the album reaches into all forms of rock and roll looking for \u201cThe Answer.\u201d The song inspired the album\u2019s title, asking listeners to take a look at their own lives with its provocative query. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a question that challenges what I\u2019m doing with my life,\u201d Momsen says. \u201cIt questions the meaning of my actions whatever they are. It also defines the record in a grander way by asking the listener to look into the meaning of each song past the obvious.\u201d Sonically, Who You Selling For alternates between blistering hard rock (\u201cOh My God,\u201d \u201cPrisoner,\u201d \u201cWild City,\u201d \u201cLiving In The Storm\u201d) and gentler, more downtempo moments (\u201cThe Walls Are Closing In,\u201d \u201cTake Me Down,\u201d \u201cBack To The River,\u201d \u201cWho You Selling For,\u201d acoustic ballad \u201cBedroom Window,\u201d and closing track \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Back\u201d), giving Momsen a platform to showcase the power and versatility of her voice. She is one of rock\u2019s most compelling contemporary frontpersons, capable of being both brash and confrontational and sultry and seductive, daring listeners to ignore her at their own peril with a fiery swagger that has only grown more fascinating as Momsen gets older. (She was 15 when The Pretty Reckless wrote and recorded their rock-grunge-blues debut album Light Me Up, which was released in 2010.) Momsen\u2019s voice sounds all the more intimate thanks to the unvarnished way that she and Phillips, along with their long-time producer Kato Khandwala, recorded the songs. \u201cIt\u2019s the most natural recording possible,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cIt\u2019s all performance-based, nothing was fixed.

Their journey began back in 2003 with marathon jam sessions on a farm belonging to Greiner\u2019s family in the egg refrigerator. Embracing a diehard Rust Belt work ethic, they tirelessly pushed towards the top of heavy music with a series of critically acclaimed albums and countless gigs. A hard-earned high watermark, 2015's Found In Far Away Places marked their second consecutive Top 10 debut on the Billboard Top 200. The single \"Identity\" notched a GRAMMY\u00ae Award nod in the category of \"Best Metal Performance.\" A streaming juggernaut, both \"Identity\" and \"Ghosts\" [feat. Jeremy McKinnon] crossed the 3-million mark on Spotify. When it came time to record their eighth full-length Phantom Anthem [Fearless Records] with longtime producers Carson Slovak and Grant McFarland, the game didn't change. The musicians put their heads down and rallied around the same shared goal, uncorking a barrage of infectious intensity, the boys augmented and amplified the touchstones of their signature style on Phantom Anthem.

The group -- which is composed of vocalist Briton Bond, guitarist/vocalist Cody Quistad, guitarist Seth Blake, bassist Chris Gaylord and drummer Stephen Kluesener -- formed in Ocala, Florida, in 2013 and instantly started playing all over the area, quickly getting signed to Fearless Records the old fashioned way: By sending a song to the label. From there the group linked up with the production team of Andrew Wade (Neck Deep, Motionless In White) and A Day To Remember vocalist Jeremy McKinnon who produced their 2015 debut Blueprints together and returned to produce the sophomore full-length Deadweight, which the band started writing immediately after they finished their debut. \"I'm very proud of Blueprints but a lot of those songs were written seven years ago so who we are as people and musicians these days is drastically different,\" Quistad explains -- and a listen to Deadweight confirms that statement. \"I think a big strength of this new record is the continuity of sitting in a room together and playing instead of trying to send files back and forth,\" he continues. \"We were truly grinding out songs and I think this album still sounds like Wage War but at the same it has some of our most melodic moments as well as some of the heaviest.\" The latter is evidenced on songs like \"Stitch\" which is certain to incite frenzied mosh pits for years to come and displays an aggression that the band have only hinted at in the past. \"We really tried to not overthink things on this record and just do whatever worked for the song, even if it was something that people might not necessarily expect,\" Quistad says. For this reason the band decided it made sense to enlist the aforementioned producers who truly understood Wage War on a deep level. \"There were so many early mornings and late nights making this record and it was such a pleasure to work with Andrew and Jeremy again because you could tell that they really cared about it and would go to any ends to make it the best that it could be.\" From the explosive production to the alternately screamed and sung vocals of \"Don't Let Me Fade Away,\" all seven of the people involved in the making of TBA worked as one unit in working toward the same collective goal. Lyrically, Deadweight sees the band exploring both personal to political issues in a way that's as raw and honest as the music that supports them. \"This record is very much a snapshot of the past year; we are all very positive people but in 2016 we went through so much from seeing the world for the first time to scraping the bottom at some point emotionally or with relationships,\" Quistad admits. From 3 a.m. run-ins with refugees in Europe to flying home only to be confronted with the aftermath of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, there was no shortage of content to draw from this time around. \"We didn't hold anything back when it came to this record, so hopefully it's as therapeutic for listeners as it was for us.\" In a heavy music scene that's increasingly formulaic, Wage War pride themselves on the fact that they listen to a diverse range of music. \"I'm a big fan of country music which surprises a lot of people and other guitarist Seth is really into pop music,\" Quistad explains. \"We have an appreciation for all kinds of stuff and I think that all of it bleeds into the album in some way even if it's not always blatant.\" Take the song \"Johnny Cash\" which recalls the country tradition of paying homage to a pioneer of a genre while still retaining the heaviness of the act. \"We get called metalcore a lot but we've never pledged allegiance to any genre because we always want to do something beyond that in the sense that we just listen to what we love and try to incorporate that into Wage War.\" More than anything though, the band can't wait to get back on the road and start playing the songs from Deadweight live. \"We played three hometown shows at the end of last year where we would include a new song and it was so cool to see the crowd react to the new material,\" Quistad says \u2013 and it's obvious that palpable excitement goes both ways. \"This album is the truest representation of Wage War in the sense that we wanted to put every part of us under the microscope and come up with something that we're not only proud of but also encompasses what we want to be as a band and the kind of musical statement we want to lay down,\" he summarizes. \"I would say this is a defining album for our band.\" Second album Deadweight featuring 'Witness' available now on Fearless Records.

When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do. Having already established themselves both as melodic songwriters (2004\u2019s RIAA-Certified Gold record They\u2019re Only Chasing Safety) and as ambitious power merchants (2006\u2019s stentorian, gold-selling Define The Great Line and its majestic follow-up, 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound Of Separation), the evolution detailed on Erase Me finds them using the sonic dialects they\u2019ve crafted to reveal where they are now. Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems. Even with a comeback title seemingly marinating in self-fulfilling prophecy, nobody in their right mind would dare delete Under\u00f8ath\u2019s measurable contribution to the advancement of post-hardcore and heavy rock. The only thing you need to erase is your patience with their pretenders. Accept no substitutes and your culture won\u2019t feel destitute.

She\u2019s like the music scene\u2019s version of the protagonist in the film, \u201cThe Natural,\u201d having spent the \u201cprime of her career\u201d out of the spotlight -- in her case, tending to her family -- only to return from absolutely nowhere to wow and amaze. Where Robert Redford made all the fans sit up and cheer with mammoth home runs, Kerri Powers is going to make people listening to this album do the exact same thing with exceptional songwriting and equally exceptional delivery.\u201d -- Chip McCabe, Lonesome Noise\n\nKerri Powers was destined to be a musician from the start. While most kids her age spent their childhoods following frivolous pursuits, she spent hers reading, painting, writing stories, learning guitar and composing her first songs at the tender age of nine. By her own admission, she was a shy child, but her creative pursuits gave her an appreciation of the larger world around her. Those instincts seemed to have been bred naturally, given that there was undeniable talent embedded in her genes. Bing Crosby was a distant relative on her father\u2019s side, while her mother\u2019s relatives were said to be descended from author Herman Melville. Notably, too, Powers\u2019 paternal grandmother made her living by playing piano and providing musical accompaniment for silent films, making her a show business standby back in the day.\n\nNot surprisingly then, Powers was encouraged to pursue her own creative ambitions while still in adolescence. Her mother, a talented visual artist in her own right, owned an extensive record collection, which gave Kerri her initial exposure to irrefutable icons like Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and John Prine. \u201cI would sit in a wicker rocking chair by the record player and sing along to the songs,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI remember hearing John Prine\u2019s \u201cHello in There\u201d for the first time and feeling that something magical was happening. It was a momentary yet memorable trip to a sad but hopeful place of lonely old faces.\u201d\n\nPowers started playing professionally in local coffeehouses throughout her native New England and went on to release several well-received albums in the new millennium, culminating in Faith in the Shadows in 2009. Two of her songs were later featured on the Fox series \u201cRescue Me\u201d starring Denis Leary. After taking time off to get married and raise her young son she returned to performing, counting among her credits the Boston Folk Festival, Philadelphia Folk Festival, and Telluride Bluegrass Festival, among other prestigious gatherings. She\u2019s also toured Europe while opening for Canadian singer/songwriter Fred Eaglesmith in The Netherlands, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThis flurry of activity recently culminated in a new self-titled album, her first effort in five years. With a track list that includes eight searing self-penned songs along with incisive covers of Janis Ian\u2019s \u201cJesse,\u201d and The Bee Gees\u2019 \u201cTo Love Somebody,\u201d it ranks as Powers\u2019 most accomplished collection to date. \u201cThe recording was a last minute decision,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe idea was to cut a couple of tracks simply to see how it would go.\u201d\n\nThe results \u2013 a sound that\u2019s homespun, sparse and understated -- provide another ideal showcase for Powers\u2019 intimate and expressive songwriting, as well as her adroit ability to interpret the works of others.\n\nFully reenergized and excited about rebooting her career, Powers is looking forward to a return to touring both here and overseas. Clearly, the creative spark that was ignited so early on is fully fuelled once again.\n\nLee Zimmerman\n\nBooking Requests:\n\nNicholas DiSpagna/Airtight Management\n617-997-2131\nsilentgbooking@gmail.com\n\nEddie Camolli/ Hungry Ear Agency\n207-333-0281\nhungryearagency@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Wage War ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10058033.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Metal, Metalcore", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "If you think that you've already heard it all when it comes to heavy music, you just haven't heard Wage War. The group -- which is composed of vocalist Briton Bond, guitarist/vocalist Cody Quistad, guitarist Seth Blake, bassist Chris Gaylord and drummer Stephen Kluesener -- formed in Ocala, Florida, in 2013 and instantly started playing all over the area, quickly getting signed to Fearless Records the old fashioned way: By sending a song to the label. From there the group linked up with the production team of Andrew Wade (Neck Deep, Motionless In White) and A Day To Remember vocalist Jeremy McKinnon who produced their 2015 debut Blueprints together and returned to produce the sophomore full-length Deadweight, which the band started writing immediately after they finished their debut. \"I'm very proud of Blueprints but a lot of those songs were written seven years ago so who we are as people and musicians these days is drastically different,\" Quistad explains -- and a listen to Deadweight confirms that statement. \"I think a big strength of this new record is the continuity of sitting in a room together and playing instead of trying to send files back and forth,\" he continues. \"We were truly grinding out songs and I think this album still sounds like Wage War but at the same it has some of our most melodic moments as well as some of the heaviest.\" The latter is evidenced on songs like \"Stitch\" which is certain to incite frenzied mosh pits for years to come and displays an aggression that the band have only hinted at in the past. \"We really tried to not overthink things on this record and just do whatever worked for the song, even if it was something that people might not necessarily expect,\" Quistad says. For this reason the band decided it made sense to enlist the aforementioned producers who truly understood Wage War on a deep level. \"There were so many early mornings and late nights making this record and it was such a pleasure to work with Andrew and Jeremy again because you could tell that they really cared about it and would go to any ends to make it the best that it could be.\" From the explosive production to the alternately screamed and sung vocals of \"Don't Let Me Fade Away,\" all seven of the people involved in the making of TBA worked as one unit in working toward the same collective goal. Lyrically, Deadweight sees the band exploring both personal to political issues in a way that's as raw and honest as the music that supports them. \"This record is very much a snapshot of the past year; we are all very positive people but in 2016 we went through so much from seeing the world for the first time to scraping the bottom at some point emotionally or with relationships,\" Quistad admits. From 3 a.m. run-ins with refugees in Europe to flying home only to be confronted with the aftermath of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, there was no shortage of content to draw from this time around. \"We didn't hold anything back when it came to this record, so hopefully it's as therapeutic for listeners as it was for us.\" In a heavy music scene that's increasingly formulaic, Wage War pride themselves on the fact that they listen to a diverse range of music. \"I'm a big fan of country music which surprises a lot of people and other guitarist Seth is really into pop music,\" Quistad explains. \"We have an appreciation for all kinds of stuff and I think that all of it bleeds into the album in some way even if it's not always blatant.\" Take the song \"Johnny Cash\" which recalls the country tradition of paying homage to a pioneer of a genre while still retaining the heaviness of the act. \"We get called metalcore a lot but we've never pledged allegiance to any genre because we always want to do something beyond that in the sense that we just listen to what we love and try to incorporate that into Wage War.\" More than anything though, the band can't wait to get back on the road and start playing the songs from Deadweight live. \"We played three hometown shows at the end of last year where we would include a new song and it was so cool to see the crowd react to the new material,\" Quistad says \u2013 and it's obvious that palpable excitement goes both ways. \"This album is the truest representation of Wage War in the sense that we wanted to put every part of us under the microscope and come up with something that we're not only proud of but also encompasses what we want to be as a band and the kind of musical statement we want to lay down,\" he summarizes. \"I would say this is a defining album for our band.\" Second album Deadweight featuring 'Witness' available now on Fearless Records.

The 26-year-old is home in her native Rochester, New York, reflecting on Delivery, her highly anticipated full-length album, as well as the hard journey the classically trained, defiantly original harpist had to travel to become the writer AND performer, she was meant to be.\n\n\u201cA lot of these songs came from feeling stuck and also like people were pulling me in a bunch of different directions,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cI wanted to say, \u2018Just wait for me. I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\nMikaela\u2019s plea for patience\u2013\u2013a little bit sweet, a little bit angry and raw\u2013\u2013fed a fierce 10-song collection. A joyride that pulls from rock, 70s and 80s pop, and funk, Delivery manages to be both daring and comfortable, full of not just risks, but hooks.\n\nProduced by Grammy winner John Congleton (St. Vincent, Angel Olsen, David Byrne, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah), Delivery is a triumphant next chapter. \u201cJohn tries to find that moment instead of the perfect take,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cThat made it all sound really special.\u201d Childhood friend Alex Cot\u00e9 (drums, percussion) and Shane McCarthy (bass) play on the record - already close from years of touring. Recently, Mikaela\u2019s ensemble became a family affair with the addition of Shane\u2019s older brother Cian McCarthy on guitar.\n\nMikaela\u2019s unconventional path to working songwriter began before high school, growing up in Rochester. With plans to join a symphony, she studied harp performance at Crane School of Music, but halfway through, she decided the traditional harpist\u2019s path wasn\u2019t for her. Following graduation, Mikaela moved to Brooklyn, following in the footsteps of artists who\u2019ve come before her. But in the city, she could never quite find her footing. She kept busy, toured, and recorded an album that would eventually be shelved. Feeling confused and alone, she retreated back to Rochester, unsure of her next move.\n\nThen, the last place Mikaela wanted to be saved her. Rochester\u2019s artistic community embraced her, encouraged by bandmates including Alex Cot\u00e9 and the group Joywave, she hit her stride. Rochester became Mikaela\u2019s sanctuary.\n\nDelivery benefits from it all. \u201cNow, these songs kind of wonder what I should be doing\u2013\u2013it\u2019s me trying to get myself back to why I started writing in the first place,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cWriting made me feel better and safe when the world around me was falling apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust let my songs resonate with you somehow. That would make me so happy.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sarah Brightman ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8643718.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Classical", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "International singing superstar, Sarah Brightman is the world\u2019s biggest selling Soprano.

But singer-guitarist Art Alexakis isn\u2019t about to start phoning it in now.\n\nAlthough the band hasn\u2019t released a new studio album since 2015\u2019s triumphant Black Is The New Black, Everclear continues to tour actively, in conjunction with a series of past-release anniversary dates and the annual Summerland Tour, which Alexakis created and has been running since 2012, featuring a rotating cast of \u201990s alt rock favorites. And while it\u2019s a virtual surety that no Everclear gig is complete without a rendition of \u201cSanta Monica\u201d and \u201cFather of Mine,\u201d lately the band has found that exploring the full range of past material\u2014especially the \u201cdeep cuts\u201d\u2014not only gives fans a rare treat, it also injects new life into the band\u2019s live dynamic.\n\n\u201cBy mixing it up and digging into the catalogue, it still makes it fun and relevant for us, and I think for the fans as well,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cIt\u2019s still important to play the hits, but by playing those other songs as well, it makes it all seem more vibrant and real. Even though I recorded some of those songs 20 years ago, I haven\u2019t played them in a long time, so it\u2019s like reinventing the wheel. I\u2019m having more fun now than I have in years. I think all of us are.\u201d\n\nFormed by Alexakis in 1991 in Portland, Oregon, Everclear has enjoyed a lengthy career spanning 11 studio releases, numerous videos, thousands of shows and accolades that include a 1998 Grammy nomination. Like a true survivor, Alexakis has soldiered on through multiple lineup changes over the years: During the \u201cclassic\u201d era, the band also included Craig Montoya on Bass and Greg Eklund on drums; the current touring lineup features longtime members Dave French (guitar) and Freddy Herrera (bass), as well as drummer Brian Nolan (also with American Hi-Fi), who has performed with Everclear on multiple past tours.\n\nThis incarnation of the band will hit the road for the 2018 Summerland Tour. As in prior years, Everclear will headline the latest installment of the festival, this time supported by Marcy Playground and Local H, and also featuring a special DJ set Alexakis will contribute, which honors the \u201990s in a refreshingly old-school way.\n\n\u201cThe Summerland Tours are all unique; they all have a different kind of feel to them,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cI think this year will be really cool, because it\u2019s usually guitar-based, but Marcy Playground is more acoustic-based, yet they still rock in their own way. Local H is just two guys, meanwhile, and they\u2019re great, too. So, it\u2019s just a different look at \u201990s alternative this year\u2026different facets of what it\u2019s about. With Everclear, we\u2019re going to play the hits we always play, but we\u2019re also going to mix it up. Every night will be a little different; there\u2019ll be a few surprises every show.\u201d\n\nFor Alexakis and Co., it\u2019s a continuation of a hectic couple of years. Everclear spent May and June of 2017 touring in honor of the 20th anniversary of So Much For The Afterglow, the band\u2019s massively successful sophomore major-label release. The 40-date run was an incredibly emotional and personally satisfying experience for Alexakis, who was able to perform obscure cuts from that time period for the first time in many years. Connecting with fans in that setting also reinforced the lasting impression the album has made.\n\n\u201cThe tour was phenomenal. It left me and the band stunned at how important that record was to so many people, and to be a part of that, both then and now,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cThe legacy of it is still vibrant for so many people. It was great just watching people react when we were playing not just the hits, but deeper songs on that record. I always liked the deeper songs\u2014they were usually my favorite songs\u2014and when the band would play those, it would be really exciting and important for me. That was fun, seeing that reaction, and just talking to people after the show.\u201d\n\nPrior to that, Everclear experienced a career resurgence thanks to 2015\u2019s Black Is The New Black, which not only proved the band could still rock, but also that Everclear remains creatively relevant, decades after their platinum years. As is common for many artists these days, Black didn\u2019t set records for traditional album sales, but the release did see significant streaming activity and sparked a heightened social media presence, putting the group firmly back in the listening public\u2019s mind. The band continues to ride this latest wave of interest.\n\n\u201cI personally think [Black] is one of the best records Everclear has ever made,\u201d Alexakis says. \u201cIt sounds like both old Everclear and new Everclear: It has a contemporary production sound, but it\u2019s just old-school, angry rock songs. It\u2019s kind of dark, very reminiscent of the early stuff. The sales weren\u2019t great on it, but a lot of people streamed it. It got millions and millions of streams, so people were listening to it, and it resonated.\u201d\n\nBut when you\u2019ve been a prolific band for more than a quarter-century, it\u2019s all part of the journey. Right now, Alexakis is feeling a reflective pull for the 25th anniversary of World Of Noise, the band\u2019s indie debut, which was recorded for $400 in a friend\u2019s basement in Portland. Although no official commemorative tour dates are confirmed as of this writing, Alexakis says he\u2019s considering playing some smaller, select shows this year as a tribute to the release. Much of the material rarely sees the light of day, but the 1993 album continues to enjoy a special place in Everclear history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d just had a baby, I was on public assistance and was working part-time jobs, I was very frustrated and very angry and there were a lot of emotions going on,\u201d Alexakis reflects. \u201cI made that record for $400, because that\u2019s all I had. I got this guy who had a basement studio to give me 40 hours\u2019 worth of recording at $10 an hour. We had 10 or 11 songs, so we went in and recorded them in a week and mixed them, and that\u2019s the album.\u2026From there we just hit the ground running. I still haven\u2019t stopped.\u201d\n\nThat rough and raw first attempt was just the nexus of the massive body of work Everclear and Alexakis have contributed since that humble beginning. When it comes to recording new material, at the moment Alexakis is focused primarily on writing and recording his first solo album, due out later this year. That precludes a new Everclear release\u2026for now.\n\n\u201cWe might make another record in a couple years,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe later on this year I\u2019ll feel like it. I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n\nThat said, the band\u2019s live itinerary certainly makes up for its recent studio absence. As the group prepares for another Summerland run, as well as numerous other future dates, Alexakis is excited to revisit songs from fan favorite records like Afterglow, Sparkle and Fade and the double album Songs From The American Movie, but also compositions from more underrated collections, like 2012\u2019s Invisible Stars.\n\n\u201cThere are people asking for songs, so we\u2019ll just try and learn songs as we go,\u201d Alexakis says. \u201cIf we get a lot of response from people to play a certain song, we\u2019re going to learn it and go on the road and play it. You don\u2019t think, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t sing that high anymore.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to worry about it. We\u2019re going to play some rock n\u2019 roll, and just do it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "JesseyJoy ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Luke Appleton ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10144750.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Metal, Rock, Acoustic", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Musician/Songwriter\nBassist of Iced Earth & Fury UK\nGuitarist of Absolva\nAcoustic singer/songwriter\nEndorsements : Gallien Krueger Amplification, Chapman Guitars, D'addario Strings, Vocalzone, Ortega & Spiral Direct.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ Francis James ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9571757.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Progressive Trance, Electronica, Progressive House, Deep House, Melodic House, New Wave", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "DJ Francis James is an experienced DJ/Producer with over (25) years of industry experience.

He quickly learned that his versatility and knowledge of music were both an asset and the key to getting a crowd on the dance floor in any environment or party.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Michael League, producer for David Crosby, Susana Baca, Bokant\u00e9, and all 13 Snarky Puppy albums, walks (quickly) through each step of the production process from start to finish, taking a simple idea from an iPhone voice note and showing its progression all the way to the final master.

PALAYE ROYALE draw as much inspiration from cinema and philosophy as they do from their musical muses, building a story with libertine reverence for Alan Watts and debauchery-fueled nights at the Chateau Marmont, for Johnny Thunders and The Stooges. This band is equally at home in the hallways of Los Angeles Fashion Week or climbing the lighting tresses at the Vans Warped Tour. They sold out theaters on their first-ever headlining tour and steal the show at each major festival.\nEach member of PALAYE ROYALE doubles as musician and visionary. The Pirate, The Vampire, and The Gentleman inspire a level of devotion reserved for My Chemical Romance or Twenty One Pilots, as their deep fan connection crosses genre-divides.\nKerrang! declared the band to be \u201con the cusp of next-level stardom\u201d and with good reason. PAYALE ROYALE went from support act on any tour that would have them to the cover of Rock Sound and Alternative Press. \u201cMorning Light,\u201d \u201cMr. Doctor Man,\u201d \u201cGet Higher,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Feel Quite Right,\u201d and \u201cMa Ch\u00e9rie\u201d amassed 30 million YouTube views (and counting). Boom Boom Room (Side A) paved the way for this year\u2019s hotly- anticipated follow-up, Boom Boom Room (Side B), heralded by the arrival of the overnight smash lead single, \u201cYou\u2019ll Be Fine.\u201d PALAYE ROYALE brought the juxtaposition of the glitz and grime of their teenage years spent in Las Vegas, when they relocated to Los Angeles in 2011. The ghost of Charlie Chaplin was surely some sort of unseen guide as they took up residence in his old home and rehearsed continuously in a basement. By the time they hit the road, borrowing their mother\u2019s Cadillac Escalade, Remington Leith, Sebastian Danzig, and Emerson Barrett were a tightly wound creative force. (Not long ago, they slept in that SUV outside a Motel 6, unable to afford to rent a room.)\nIt was Alex Burdon, daughter of The Animals singer Eric Burdon, who insisted Sumerian\u2019s founder see the band. (The label offered them a contract the same night.) Los Angeles radio personality and tastemaker Rodney Bingenheimer introduced PALAYE ROYALE to rock industry legend Kim Fowley, another strong supporter. James Iha of The Smashing Pumpkins/A Perfect Circle and Corey Taylor of Slipknot/Stone Sour also count themselves among the band\u2019s true believers, having worked with them as a producer and taken them out on tour, respectively. Sleeping With Sirens\u2019 Kellin Quinn made a guest appearance on Boom Boom Room (Side A). As their moniker itself evokes (Palaye Royale is the name of the Toronto dancehall where their grandparents met in the \u201850s), the brotherly trio is eager to connect themselves and this generation to the spirit of the past, but reinvigorated for today with eclecticism and fierce individuality. Their tours are like a traveling circus. Clad in scarves, hats, paisley shirts, and makeup, as the Soldiers of the Royal Council attest, it\u2019s the PALAYE ROYALE lifestyle. Gretsch guitar tones that shimmer with reverb, drums that shake and pound, vocals that claw forth with the electric urgency of the early punk movement, all swirling together with the swinging cool of the 1960s and the swagger of latter day Brit Pop bands such as The Libertines and early Arctic Monkeys. Each show comes with an element of unpredictability and danger, with the three guys playing as if their lives depended on it, pure showmanship over perfectionism.\nAs Classic Rock Magazine wrote, \u201cIf you want theatrics, these boys deliver in spades \u2013 and not just in their headline-grabbing threads and eye-popping stage show.\u201d The Rolling Stones, The Black Crowes, and The Doors collide with The Ramones and Iggy Pop within their songs, with a hint of the early blues that inspired Led Zeppelin. It\u2019s fast-paced dirty rock n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s glam and grime, spectacle and sweat, showmanship and songwriting. Rock Sound\u2019s in-depth cover story, drawn from an intense 72-hours with the brothers, called PALAYE ROYALE \u201cRock\u2019s Next Superstars,\u201d predicting they \u201cmight just change it all.\u201d Even as 2016\u2019s Boom Boom Room (Side A) and 2018\u2019s Boom Boom Room (Side B) document the story thus far, PALAYE ROYALE remain focused on the bigger picture. They\u2019ve built something grander than a band. It\u2019s an artistic movement. Ever self- assured in their ambition and staunch in their support of individuality, PALAYE ROYALE are \u201coutfitting the revolution\u201d (as they like to say).", "otherInfo": "We'll be performing live at Homeschool Festival on Saturday, May 9th at 8:25pm BST (12:25pm PT/3:25 ET) on the Alt Stage!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Jive Aces ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9160947.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Jazz, Rockabilly, Jazz Blues, Jive, Trad Jazz, Blues, Swing, Skiffle", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The UK's No.1 jive and swing band, more info at http://www.jiveaces.com/meet-the-band", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/jiveaces"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Crystal Skies ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9928074.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Electronic Dance Music, Electronic", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Melodic Bass Music.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.twitch.tv/cardinalnow"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nordgarden ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10364395.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Country, Soul, Blues, Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cThe closest a new Norwegian singer/songwriter has come the timeless qualities of Ryan Adams\u201d (Stein Ostboe, VG, Norway)\nHome: www.nordgarden.info", "otherInfo": "Finally we\u2019ll playing a concert with the entire band again!\n\nThis Saturday at the Lillehammer Mikrobryggeri at 10pm: https://facebook.com/events/s/live-fra-lmb-med-nordgarden-og/2827389270722962/?ti=icl\n\nwww.nordgarden.info"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hot Dub Time Machine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7032815.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Electronic, Dub, Reggae", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Best.

While filming the movie, her musical GOOD Ol' GIRLS (adapted from the fiction of Lee Smith and Jill McCorkle, featuring songs by Matraca Berg and Marshall) opened Off-Broadway. That fall, Chapman simultaneously released a new book (THEY CAME TO NASHVILLE) and new CD (BIG LONESOME).

Her album, IT'S ABOUT TIME... (Island, 1995), recorded live at the Tennessee State Prison for Women, drew rave reviews from Time, USA Today, and the Village Voice.

All the while, Avery kept honing her craft as a vocalist of rare talent, which has led to an impressive list of career-accomplishments on her musical resume.\n\nThat talent caught the ears of award-winning Canadian producer/songwriter/musician Greg Kavanagh, in 2017, and their eventual collaboration of work has led to outstanding original songs that not only were featured on \u2018My Heart Away\u2019, but also on her second solo album, \u2018Without A Little Rain\u2019. That album debuted on the iTunes Canada Top 200 RnB/Soul album chart at #31.\n\nBeyond acquiring media attention, Avery\u2019s music consistently receives glowing reviews and continued airplay across Canada, and into the United States, affording her opportunities to perform her music across North America. From New York to Newport to Toronto and beyond, including venues and renowned music festivals, Avery continues to wow audiences with her fresh style and powerful vocal performances.\n\nAvery is compassionate as well, volunteering her time to regularly perform at sports, government, and charity events, donating her talents. She\u2019s even sung the anthem in front of 43,000 people at a Toronto Blue Jays Baseball game.\n\nOf course, she also has a passion for supporting causes close to her heart such as anti-bullying (going into schools talking and performing for students), and music education. To that extent, Heart of Indie Radio in the US, has named a scholarship in her honour. That scholarship, every year for the next 10 years, awards an individual in Canada, and one in the United States, with $500 USD towards their arts or music education.\n\nAvery continues to compose new music, challenging herself to appeal to multiple genres and audiences, and constantly performing and improving her craft. She also co-hosts an online radio show on heartofindieradio.com, talking about and playing music she loves from an era that still influences so many artists today.\n\nWhile constantly performing, and with new music always in production, especially with the support of successful artist-producers like Stonebridge and Greg Kavanagh, Avery is poised to be the breakout artist she is destined to become!", "otherInfo": "Join me and some of my artist friends for anoteher episode of Quarantini Cocktail Hour.

Assimilating a world-class band of musicians and a dozen songs that harken back to the golden age of country music, 'This Highway' is an album that gives a reverent nod to the past before blazing a brand new interstate through the gridlock of contemporary country.

Now 23 years old, Emmett admits to having been seduced by music from a very early age. His foray into the world of music began with guitar, piano and drum lessons when he was just six years old. He first met his longtime voice teacher, Terence Goff, when he turned eight and began formal voice training at that stage. While he was still in High School, Emmett made the decision to pursue a future in music, specifically singing. Since then he has received a Bachelors Degree in Voice from the College-Conservatory of Music at the University of Cincinnati, where he also performed as a soloist with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. Once he received his undergraduate degree in music, Emmett went on to join the prestigious Julliard School in New York, where he is currently completing a Masters Degree in Voice, studying under the tutelage of Dr. Robert C. White Jr. He also recently took part in the \u201cJulliard in Paris\u201d project, sponsored by the Edmond de Rothschild Foundation. Last season, Emmett also performed in both productions in Julliard Opera\u2019s double bill, Britten\u2019s Curlew River and Vaughan Williams\u2019 Riders to the Sea, as well as in this season\u2019s Metropolitan Opera workshop production of The Sorrows of Frederick. At present, he is preparing for the role of Onegin in Tchaikovsky\u2019s Eugene Onegin. Emmet has also participated in many Classical training programs and has also been an apprentice artist in the Bel Canto Young Artist Mentoring Program at Caramoor. Emmett is not the only musical member of his family. His mother, who hails from Carrick-on Suir in Co. Tipperary, and his father who comes from Co. Armagh, both sang and were involved with theater from an early age; his elder brother and younger sister have also both studied music at University. In addition to his passion for music, Emmett is an avid sportsman, who loves to surf and snowboard. He is also a huge fan of American football, baseball and most watersports, which he follows with a keen interest. Emmett first met Celtic Thunder producer Sharon Browne in New York City, where she invited him to audition for the show. He is a natural fit with the rest of the soloists in Celtic Thunder, young, energetic and extremely talented, Emmett is looking forward to his next adventure and to touring with Celtic Thunder for the first time ever on the Celtic Thunder Cruise 2014 and as part of the USA Fall Tour this November.

Classical and pop sensibilities produce soundtracks that are both artistic and accessible. Often compared to the likes of Fiona Apple, Cat Power, and Tori Amos, ADALINE takes her place among these artists as one who is also inspired by the craft of songwriting and the power of performance.\n\nADALINE studied music during her school years in Whitby, Ontario and into her post-secondary studies in Vancouver, British Columbia, where she now calls home. Her studies and home life created the music-saturated environment in which her love of music developed and matured. She says, \"I have always known that music is life. As I grow older, I see more of what that means. I know that when writing a piece of music I am creating something that is intimately mine, yet overwhelmingly yours.

With a voice that touches somewhere deep inside, Alyssa\u2019s soulful sound and powerful lyrics will send you jet-setting into a broad range of human emotions. Growing up on the open roads of America, with her RCA country recording artists parents, Baillie & The Boys, made it impossible for Alyssa not to witness the power and magic of music. At just 3 weeks old, her cradle was the gentle rocking of a tour bus. Her play ground encompassed sound checks at fairs and festivals and back stage dressing rooms at a slew of different venues including the Grand Ole Opry and Country Music Award shows, and her \u201cextended family\u201d consisted of managers, promoters, roadies, musicians and other fellow mainstream country artists.\n\nAt the age of 3, Alyssa performed on the Ralph Emory television show, Nashville Now. Where her version of the Leslie Gore classic; It\u2019s My Party brought the house down in front of millions of national viewers. At age 10, one of those major acts, Kenny Rogers, decided Alyssa was the perfect child singer to record a duet with him on his Christmas CD, Christmas From The Heart. By age 13, Alyssa had her first batch of songs written and received an endorsement from Gretsch Guitars. She had figured out her own unique style of guitar playing with open tunings inspired by Joni Mitchell. By age 16 she landed her first 50 date tour opening up for Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives. It soon became obvious that she was the real deal, not only as a musician and singer but as a prolific songwriter as well.\n\nWhile in high-school, Alyssa became a go-to session singer for people like Christian artist Matt Maher, where she created her own layered harmony vocal approach from years of hearing her parents sing together. Her songs started finding their way into television shows, (Switched! on ABC Family, MTV), movies, as well as getting her first cuts on other artists projects.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Alyssa received a full scholarship from Sennheiser to Paul McCartney\u2019s Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts in Liverpool England, where she would spend the next three years earning a degree in Sound Technology while continuing to perform in local venues throughout Europe. While playing at a venue called The Zanzibar in Liverpool, Alyssa was spotted by Liverpool Rock Star Pete Wylie and was asked to join his band playing electric guitar and singing background vocals. Alyssa of course said yes, and experienced what most artists never experience; a private performance requested by the Queen to help support one of Liverpool\u2019s local charities. A performance with Ringo Starr at the 800th Anniversary of Liverpool\u2019s, \u201cCapital Of Culture 2008\u201d event; a performance slot at one of the UK\u2019s largest music festivals; Knowsley Hall on the same bill as The Who, and from there on scored her own slots performing on the Acoustic stage at Glastonbury in 2009, and a UK tour opening for Raul Malo of The Mavericks.\n\nWhile at LIPA, Alyssa was inspired by their music community and the extreme amount of talented people attending the school. She lived in Lennon Studios, an apartment complex that used to be the old maternity ward where John Lennon was born. Her incredibly unique experiences abroad inspired her debut album, The English Diaries, an all acoustic intimate collection of songs she produced and recorded herself in her one bedroom Beatles inspired flat.\n\nAfter graduating LIPA and receiving her diploma from Paul McCartney himself, Alyssa returned to Nashville and signed her first publishing deal with Rondor Music. While signed to Rondor, she produced and released her sophomore album Love Hard which was backed by a 10k dollar Kickstarter Campaign and landed one of the biggest nationwide commercial placements of 2012 with her song, \u201cI Make My Own Sunshine,\u201d inspired by Liverpool\u2019s rainy weather. It was featured in a Lowe\u2019s commercial, earning over 50,000 downloads in its first 3 months and over 1 million plays on Spotify. She had no idea at the time that her song would later be heard by Steven Tyler and recorded on his first ever solo album, We\u2019re All Somebody From Somewhere and that she would be the only solo writer on his debut #1 billboard Country album.\n\nAlyssa\u2019s many other accomplishments in the singer/songwriter community include: Writing with Jeffrey Steele, Michelle Branch, Hunter Hayes, and JD Souther, writing three songs on Jessie James Decker\u2019s top 5 Billboard Country album \u201cComin\u2019 Home\u201d and co-writing top 40 billboard country radio single, \u201cLights Down Low\u201d, winning Canadian songwriter of the year and song of the year for \u201cI Only Smoke When I Drink\u201d by the Small Town Pistols, co-writing Jana Kramer\u2019s latest country radio single \u201cCircles\u201d and a #17 AC Billboard Chart Christmas duet with Matthew & Gunner Nelson called \u201cThis Christmas\u201d which she wrote with the twins and her father, Michael Bonagura. She\u2019s also had three #1 hits in Australia with Morgan Evans and Chelsea Basham and produced music for Jo Dee Messina & Rachel Reinert of Gloriana.\n\nAt 28 years old, Alyssa has become a songwriting seamstress for a number of artists, a producer, and a band member of the west coast folk & classic rock n\u2019 roll sounds of The Sisterhood Band with friend Ruby Stewart, all while simultaneously having a career as a solo artist. She\u2019s created life long friendships with fellow songwriters, artists and musicians, and has been called \u201cA fixture on Nashville\u2019s indie singer-songwriter scene\u201d by Rolling Stone. It\u2019s been over 4 years since she\u2019s released a solo project, but when you hear her newest record Road Less Traveled, you\u2019ll know it was worth the wait.\n\nAfter an entire summer of recording plans with an outside producer had fallen through, Alyssa turned to her boyfriend Graham Whitford for guidance on what was the best way forward for the songs she so much believed in. They decided to call long time friend and engineer Mark Petaccia to see if he was available to help record at his studio Petti Sound in Berry Hill. By a simple twist of fate, he had 7 days free.\n\nHer closest friends and family who are all a part of the Nashville underground music community decided to come together and help her create Road Less Traveled without the help of a label and purely for the love and support of their friend. The entire album was recorded live, produced by Alyssa & Mark Petaccia, Mastered by Richard Dodd and executive produced by Karen Whitford. Alyssa showcases her multi-instrumental talents by playing acoustic guitar in her signature open tunings, Piano, Ukulele, Lap Steel, Electric guitar, Bass, B3 and Harmonica. She\u2019s backed by Graham Whitford, Caleb Crosby, and Noah Denney (3/4ths of Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown), String arrangers and players Eleonore Denig and Molly Cherryholmes (Mountain Heart), Kevin McGowan, Tarka Layman, fellow artist and songwriter Davis Naish, and her father Michael Bonagura on Electric guitar.\n\nRoad Less Traveled showcases Alyssa as a solo artist in her truest form to date and shares the journey of finding her own voice and paving her own path as an independent Country artist. It encompasses elements of early Sheryl Crow mixed with Joni Mitchell like vocals. You'll hear so many iconic female influences on this project. Alyssa blends them all extremely well to come up with a sound that is familiar in its harkening back to the greats from multiple decades, yet completely unique and unlike anything else one would hear today.

The Army of Broken Toys's stage show exorcises personal tragedies and cleaves its audience's hearts with rollicking apocalyptic waltzes and powerful rock ballads that seem to emerge from under their ringmaster Walter Sickert\u2019s top hat. While The Toys are on stage one feels psychically kidnapped to their \u2018Portable Carnival\u2019. The WIREFOREST boasts 7 musicians (guitars, upright bass, drums, viola, mandolin, broken toys, melodica, accordion, ukulele, flute...) and rolls with a surreal troupe of any number of midway and burlesque performers, The Bunny Collaborative. The Army of Broken Toys offers a unique rock club run-away to the circus experience.\n\nWalter Sickert & The Army of Broken Toys have been making as much noise nationally as they do locally. With a steady foundation of coverage by Boston press including The Boston Globe, The Boston Herald, the Noise and The Phoenix; the Army of Toys has also been featured nationally on NPR\u2019s Here and Now, All Songs Considered and on MuchMusic. Walter Sickert was named Best Artist 2011 and 2012 in the Boston Phoenix Reader's Poll and his visual art was part of the Art is Evil touring stage/music/art show and art book sponsored by Amanda Palmer\u2019s million dollar Kickstarter with a small group of artists like Frances Bean Cobain, Neil Gaiman, DJ Spooky, Shepard Fairey, David Mack etc. Walter has also been featured for the last six years as a part of the RPM challenge sponsored by New Hampshire\u2019s The Wire. The band has continued to participate in the challenge every year since its inception. The Toys have successfully funded two Kickstarter campaigns, and produced a 40+ show run of their original 'steampunk musical for people who hate musicals,' \"28 Seeds\" a cautionary tale for our time writ by the band's resident playwright/mustache, Meff and produced by Liars and Believers. The play originated from the \"last radio show\" RPM '10 project.\n\nThe \u201crollicking, raunchy sideshow of jolly, wheezing menace and delight\u201d live experience of Walter Sickert & The Army of Broken Toys have taken the band across the US and beyond, playing such revered venues as the Hynes Convention Center for First Night for four years, The Boston Center for The Arts, Boston Symphony Hall, 930 Club in DC, Webster Hall in NYC, Royce Hall in LA, Mod Club in Toronto, the Stone Pony in NJ, and the Melkweg in Amsterdam etc. Their live antics have earned them a Boston Music Award nomination for Best Live Act and headlining spots at Steampunk World\u2019s Faire. They have garnered opening spots alongside international contemporaries the Tiger Lillies, Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys, The Humans (featuring Toyah Wilcox, Bill Rieflin and Chris Wong), The Dresden Dolls, Amanda Palmer (solo), Chester French, etc. at several venues.\n\nWith their newest album, Soft Time Traveler and tour plans in the US and Europe, there is so much more to come from the BRoken TOys!\n\n\n(((((((((THE PRESS MONSTER))))))))))))\n\n\u201cThrough it all, Walter Sickert anchors the performance pounding out strong melodies and baying these fierce, fuming lyrics and damn if it doesn\u2019t come off as revelry...

Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage. Whether Love Saves The Day makes one dollar or a million isn\u2019t a big concern to him. It stands as a huge success because he made the gritty, honest album that he intended by \u201ckeeping it raw, keeping it immediate, keeping it real.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that he has honed over the years: \u201cbe original and be true to what you do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To Benefit Music Farm, Charleston"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Guitar Mash ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9837672.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "To contribute what we can for collective sanity and joy, Guitar Mash is thrilled to announce #HomeMadeMusic, a series of Virtual Campfires.

And that makes Rodg one of the rare-breed. The humble Dutchman is one of the best kept Armada Music secrets, delivering top-notch releases on a regular basis.\n\nAn impressive string of features on various Armada compilations proved to be the stepping stone for Rodg, renowned for a sound that sticks out. Since, he has put out a slew of genre-defying cuts, changing the game entirely through massive collaborations and solid remixes for artists such as Paul Oakenfold, Armin van Buuren, Solid Stone, Cosmic Gate and Ruben de Ronde.\n\nThanks to extensive support from a gamut of top-tier performers (e.g. Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Above & Beyond, Markus Schulz, Gareth Emery, Nicky Romero, W&W, Andrew Rayel and even Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and David Guetta), Rodg has been getting the recognition he deserves, even touted \u201cOne of the best producers of 2016\u201d by Armin van Buuren. Seeing his in-studio diligence pay off, Rodg released his debut album in mid-2016 and grabbed early support from Armin van Buuren, Gareth Emery and Above & Beyond, all the while riding the US airwaves with title track \u2018High On Life\u2019, which accumulated over two million streams on Spotify to date.\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t stop there. After countless collaborations with long-time friend and production partner Ruben de Ronde, on came a collaborative effort that dropped jaws and pushed their sound to an even higher level. With their joint album called \u2018Togetherr\u2019, Rodg and Ruben de Ronde emerged with a body of work that serves as a testament to their consistent high-quality output and became Mixmag\u2019s \u201calbum of the month\u201d with a 9 out of 10 rating.\n\nOn the live front, the Rodg sound has become inseparable from Armin van Buuren\u2019s live sets and the Dutchman himself has since brandished his own sonic blend at A State Of Trance shows in Utrecht, Ibiza, and Mexico, Armada Nights, and various other unforgettable shows at H\u00ef Ibiza, Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival and more. He is the workhorse of the Armada family and a mainstay on countless worldwide Dance compilations. He is the present and the future of Electronic Dance Music, yet seemingly always underrated.

Singer. Banjo player. Ashley Campbell juggles all three roles, armed with the ability not only to dream up a modern country song, but to deliver it, too.\n\nAlready known for her work alongside her father, country legend Glen Campbell \u2014 who, during his final years as a touring musician, leaned heavily on his youngest daughter as a banjo player, keyboardist and harmony vocalist \u2014 Ashley is now stepping out on her own. Her music is a mix of her wide-ranging influences, combining the old-school country sound popularized by her fa-ther during the '60s and '70s with contemporary Americana, rootsy folk and country-pop. Glen Campbell's longtime fans may hear something familiar in Ashley's melodies as she embraces these similarities while distinguishing herself as a talented frontwoman.\n\nGrowing up, Ashley's parents encouraged her to sing and play the piano. She did both, adding the acoustic guitar to the mix once she hit high school. A theater kid with comedic chops, she also landed roles in local musicals and improv groups, eventually heading to college as a theater major during her late teens. When a director cast Ashley in a role that required her to learn the banjo, though, she fell in love with the instrument. Inspired, and with the help of her godfather, legendary banjo player Carl Jackson, she began mastering her banjo technique, then started writing her own songs. No wonder Glen asked her to join him on his farewell tour not long after she graduated college, a tour that would eventually take his band \u2014 Ashley included \u2014 on a three-year ride around the world. The banjo sounded timeless, reminding her of the music she'd heard as a child.\n\nAshley kept writing new material during her days on the road. By the time her father retired from touring in 2012, she was ready to make her introduction not only as a sideman, but as a solo art-ist in her own right. Dot Records, an imprint of the Big Machine Label Group, was ready, too, signing Ashley to a roster that also includes Maddie & Tae, Steven Tyler and Drake White. She is currently working on her debut record. All of the tracks \u2014 including \"Remembering,\" a poignant tribute to her Dad that doubled as the first single of her career \u2014 were either written or co-written by Ashley, who also played multiple instruments throughout the recording process. The goal wasn't to create a perfect-sounding album featuring the best session musicians from Nashville. The goal was to be authentic and real, shining a light on a do-it-yourself artist who's carved out her own sound.\n\nAshley Campbell is a multi-talented entertainer. A singer and songwriter who plays her own in-struments. A newcomer with years of heavy touring under her belt. There's no denying her icon-ic country pedigree, but Ashley is attracting the spotlight these days with her style, talent and a unique sound all her own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Condition Oakland ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9762396.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Folk, Alt-country, Emo, Punk, Post Hardcore, Folk Rock, Indie, Alternative", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Post Folk Power Violence", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jasmine Solano ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7561658.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Hip Hop", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "From creating and touring worldwide as half of the DJ Party Duo Electric Punanny with MeLo-X, to hosting her own MTV series \"Scratch the Surface\", Jasmine Solano has solidified her career as an international music influencer across multiple media platforms.

Classified as an inspirational rapper, Serious is often told she sounds and looks like Grammy rapper/producer Missy Elliott, but Serious is just a different brand of artist once you partake in the \"experience\". The award-winning rapper was recently showcased in national publication ESSENCE MAGAZINE for her versatility. In March 2016, her music video for Thirsty, which has garnered over 18,000 views was showcased at the SXSW Video Screening for Wix.com.\n\nSerious knew from the age of 12 that she was created to rap. She didn\u2019t know how things would work out but kept working on her craft.\n\nShe was 21 years old, on missionary work in Johannesburg, South Africa and was asked by the perform at a stadium concert. After giving up on her gift for over 10 years she was very reluctant, but was obedient. That day Serious impacted many and knew that she would never give up on her gift.\nAfter her missionary work was complete, she headed home to record YES, a song tha took many locals in the New York Tri-state area by storm in 2000.Then in 2009 she felt the very strong urge to take her music to the next level and began to seek out better producers, management and the like.\nIn 2011 she signed a deal with Holywood Records, a Florida based label. During that year she auditioned for the Staten Island Gospel Fest and became a finalist and was honored to minister to folks from across the tri-state area. That same year, coordinators at WIADCA, a notable \u201csecular\u201d Caribbean organization that furnished scholarships to youngsters in addition to taking part in the Labor Day festivities in NYC invited Serious as the first and only female Christian rapper to perform on the Brooklyn Museum stage for the WIADCA GospelFest.\nSerious released Are You Serious Vol 1 in January 2012. The mixtape was available on all major Christian hip hop sites and Datpiff, garnering over 11k downloads.\nIn August of 2012, Serious was nominated as Female Rap Minister by the Kingdom Choice Awards Committee. Since the nomination, she has successfully toured various parts of Texas with her SAAB message, touching the hearts of women by simply testifying and sharing her music.\nNow under the label Serious PPL Music, which is headed by Christopher James, Serious continues to tour and do local and national shows.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s positive or optimistic or whatever, but that's what's going on with me.\u201d\n\nBrendan Benson finds himself in an enviable spot as he enters the third decade of a remarkably creative, consistently idiosyncratic career \u2013 an accomplished frontman, musician, songwriter, producer, band member, husband, and dad. Benson\u2019s seventh solo album, and first new LP in almost seven years, DEAR LIFE is this consummate polymath\u2019s most inventive and upbeat work thus far, an 11-track song cycle about life, love, family, fatherhood, and the pure joy of making music. Produced and almost entirely performed by Benson at his own Readymade Studio in Nashville, the album sees the Michigan-born, Nashville-based artist \u2013 and co-founder, with Jack White, of The Raconteurs \u2013 reveling in a more modernist approach than ever before, fueled by a heady brew of cannabis, hip-hop, and a newly discovered interest in software drum programming. The result is an untapped playfulness that elevates expertly crafted songs like the opener, \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d and the first single, \u201cGood To Be Alive,\u201d with voluble arrangements, elastic grooves, and incandescent power. Imbued with revitalized ambition and confidence, DEAR LIFE is Brendan Benson at his very best.\n\nBeginning with his now-classic 1996 major label debut, ONE MISSISSIPPI \u2013 recently reissued by Third Man in its first-ever vinyl pressing \u2013 and its masterful 2002 follow-up, LAPALCO, Benson has always infused classic craftsmanship with contemporary invention. Along with his own critically acclaimed canon, Benson is of course co-founder \u2013 with Jack White, Jack Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler \u2013 of The Raconteurs. The band first convened in 2006, winning worldwide acclaim, GRAMMY\u00ae Award nominations, and a chart-topping smash single in \u201cSteady As She Goes,\u201d with their now-classic debut album, BROKEN BOY SOLDIERS. The Raconteurs returned two short years later with 2008\u2019s CONSOLERS OF THE LONELY. Like its predecessor, the LP proved a popular and critical phenomenon, earning the GRAMMY\u00ae Award for \u201cBest Engineered Non-Classical Album\u201d as well as a nomination as \u201cBest Rock Album.\u201d\n\nDEAR LIFE came about gradually and organically after a self-imposed creative hiatus rooted in the happy arrival of his son and later, a daughter. Having spent the majority of his adult life on the road, Benson decided he\u2019d prefer to stay home for a change and just be a dad.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so enamored with my kids, I just sort of lost touch with my career. I just didn\u2019t want to go back to work.\u201d\n\nInstead, Benson directed his musical energies elsewhere and fast proved an in-demand producer/engineer (Robyn Hitchcock, Young The Giant, Trapper Schoepp, The Greenhornes) and collaborative songwriter, with a CV that includes partnerships with Jake Bugg, Iain Archer (Snow Patrol), and The Kooks\u2019 Luke Pritchard, among others. Despite his successes, after a few years in this voluntary wilderness, Benson surprised himself in 2017 by writing and recording the rocker \u201cHalf A Boy (And Half A Man).\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just felt really good,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like I was like born again. Seriously, it was almost a religious experience, like, oh my God, I love making music. I had forgotten. That\u2019s how it started. It was kind of a spark. A re-ignition.\u201d\n\nThough Benson wasn\u2019t \u201cconsciously making a record,\u201d the songs kept coming. Rather than overthink every move, he simply let go. He got stoned in his studio and worked on music simply because it made him happy.\n\n\u201cI started dreaming again,\u201d Benson says. \u201cGetting lost in the music and just letting it take me. Not being so serious, not thinking I was some sort of great writer or producer. I just enjoyed myself. I wasn\u2019t racking my brain on how to from one chord to the next. I wasn\u2019t trying to come up with the best lyrics ever. I was just having fun.\u201d\n\nBenson worked with surprising intensity, most days skipping meals until long after dark. Determined to keep moving forward, he opted to play virtually every instrument on his own. Though a skilled drummer in his own right, Benson began working with Pro Tools and an array of other drum programming software.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a self-taught only child,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go elsewhere for things. If I want drums, I think, OK, how do I create drums? Well, I\u2019ve got to play them or I\u2019ve got to program them. It\u2019s all happening really quickly. I don\u2019t have time to wait for some guy to come over and learn the song, all that crap.\u201d\n\nWorking with programming helped free Benson from his previous creative habits, opening up uncharted paths and new approaches towards making his music.\n\n\u201cI may never go back to playing the drums,\u201d Benson says. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true, but it is a lot of fun. It\u2019s a different discipline entirely. On the drum kit, you feel it out, see what feels good or whatever. But with software drums, you\u2019re constructing beats with your hands, with a mouse, and with a keyboard. It\u2019s really weird. So of course you do things that you wouldn\u2019t do on a drum kit. It\u2019s like, wow, I never would have played that beat. And then the options are limitless. Everything is right at your fingertips.\u201d\n\nUnrestrained by anything other than his own imagination, Benson drew less from genre and more from his own instincts, melding jangle and crunch, hook and riff, pomp and subtlety, into something original and his own. Sonic motivation came from a range of unexpected sources, spanning hip-hop icons like Vince Staples and Kendrick Lamar to the top 40 hits his kids played around the house.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always kind of battling cynicism,\u201d he adds, \u201cbeing a cynic about music. So listening to what my kids listen to, it helps me break down the barriers in myself. The kids put on Justin Bieber and my knee jerk reaction is to turn it off. But I don\u2019t. I\u2019m forced to listen in and by God, I start liking it. I find something good in it and then that maybe pops up in my music.\u201d\n\nWith the aesthetic doors blown open, Benson saw his songs grow more complex, multi-tiered, and rhapsodic. From the future funk-fueled \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d through \u201cGood To Be Alive\u201d and the madcap \u201cFreak Out,\u201d to the elegiac finale, \u201cWho\u2019s Gonna Love You,\u201d his long vaunted knack for pure pop craftsmanship is paired with a progressive, left-of-center dynamism unlike anything in his body of work.\n\nWhile tracks like \u201cDear Life\u201d and the ecstatic \u201cRichest Man Alive\u201d are undeniably animated and even joyful, Benson is quick to note that there\u2019s more going on than necessarily meets the ear. The buoyant melodies and irrepressible hooks are tinted with self-doubt and instinctive irony, their affirmative messages colored by encroaching middle age and the songwriter\u2019s own mortality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just singing about me,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI\u2019m almost 50 and it\u2019s freaking me out so that\u2019s kind of coming up in the songs.\u201d\n\nAfter almost two years, DEAR LIFE was finally approaching completion. Benson signed on with new management and began talking with labels, ready at last to return to the fray. And then Jack called.\n\n\u201cMy wife was like, OK, off you go,\u201d he says. \u201cSeriously, I was stoked. That band is fun. I get to be in a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band, that\u2019s my dream. And I get to share it all with a bunch of guys that I love and respect.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a decade, The Raconteurs finally returned to action in 2019 with their critically acclaimed, chart-topping third LP, HELP US STRANGER, highlighted in part by a couple of songs Benson had been kicking around for his own LP, \u201cOnly Child\u201d and \u201cSomedays (I Don\u2019t Feel Like Trying).\u201d The Raconteurs\u2019 epic 2019 world tour proved equally successful, playing to ecstatic sold-out houses from Nashville to New Zealand and all points in-between. Still buzzing with big rock energy, Benson returned home and recorded two more for DEAR LIFE: the short, sharp \u201cI\u2019m In Love\u201d and the persistent slacker anthem, \u201cI Quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Raconteurs helped me get off my ass and get back into the swing of things,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI got to exercise that muscle again. I came home really excited just to get back to my thing. Whereas before, I think I was a little overwhelmed. It\u2019s daunting to make a record and get a band together and tour an album. But now I\u2019m really ready. It\u2019s not so daunting.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Benson is currently considering how to bring DEAR LIFE to life. Having made a record he can take unabashed pride in, he is determined to continue defying expectations and resisting easy pigeonholes. DEAR LIFE marks a milestone on what has already been an atypical artistic journey as well as a bold signpost towards future triumphs, a showcase for Benson\u2019s matchless gifts for wry introspection, insightful wordplay, and powerhouse melody, once again affirming his place among the finest singer-songwriters of this or any era.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Judah & The Lion ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8988380.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Country, Folk-hop, Bluegrass", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Over My Head: https://jatl.lnk.to/overmyhead", "otherInfo": "FRIENDS AT HOME FEST!

His band in high school, M!ND fURY, wrote and recorded 100 songs, all of them good (lol). Out of high school he formed the band Digma while he also DJd raves around the Midwest. Digma tracked their ep at Smart Studios in Madison, WI. The famed studio Nirvana rehearsed what would become Nevermind, and The Smashing Pumpkins tracked their debut album.\n\n\n\nIn 2002 Voidova moved north to Minneapolis and formed Xerus. Over the next 6 years Xerus would tour the nation, have songs on college radio coast to coast, play SXSW and release two e.p.'s on their label, SkinCell Record Group.\n\n\n\nWith Xerus taking a break 2008, Voidova set his sights on a city where music business is actually a thing that is happening. In 2009 he moved to Los Angeles and joined an arena rock band called Machine Empire. Taking on the roll of only singing for the first time, Voidova made his mark on the soon to be extinct Sunset Strip Metal scene. Machine Empire's fan base began to grow, and a documentary film was being shot of the band, to be shopped to major networks. Alas, the band imploded and the footage never saw the light of day, except for one trailer. Opening for LA Guns at the now closed Knitting Factory was one of many highlights of the early days of Machine Empire.\n\n\nOver the next few years, Voidova bounced from project to project. Wrapped up in work, life, and love, putting together another band wasn't a priority. Now living in Santa Monica with his beautiful lady, he settled in and began writing what would become his next incarnation, Salt Altar. \"each/other\" was released on Bandcamp in 2014. A music video for his take on Madonna's \"Open Your Heart,\" from the viewpoint of a male stalker was released to promote the album.\n\n\nIn 2015 Voidova moved to San Francisco for work. He wrote and recorded what would become the Park Regent e.p. After having friends listen to it, the urge to release it and get it out to the masses struck. He moved back to Santa Monica, and through a friend he found HRDRV, the indie label he is now signed to. The rest is history being written right now. New Voidova music is in the works. The first single, \"Desire\" off of the new album, \"Broken Clouds,\" is scheduled to be released 5/1/20 on all major streaming platforms. \"Broken Clouds\" will be released shortly after, in late May/early June.

Leaving the past where it belongs, accepting there\u2019s no way to know what\u2019s ahead, and challenging himself to be present in both love and life. It\u2019s heady stuff. It also rocks.\n\nWith a career full of critical acclaim and popular success, Carll could\u2019ve played it safe on this, his sixth record, but he didn\u2019t. The result is a musically ambitious and lyrically deep statement of an artist in his creative prime.\n\nHayes Carll\u2019s list of accomplishments is long. His third album, 2008\u2019s Trouble In Mind, earned him an Americana Music Association Award for Song of the Year (for \u201cShe Left Me for Jesus\u201d). The follow-up, KMAG YOYO was the most played album on the Americana Chart in 2011 and spawned covers by artists as varied as Hard Working Americans and Lee Ann Womack, whose version of \u201cChances Are\u201d garnered Carll a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers swept the Austin Music Awards, and was his fourth record in a row to reach #1 on the Americana Airplay chart. Kelly Willis and Kenny Chesney have chosen to record his songs and his television appearances include The Tonight Show, Austin City Limits, and Later w/Jools Holland. Carll is the rare artist who can rock a packed dancehall one night and hold a listening room at rapt attention the next.\n\n\u201cRepeating myself creatively would ultimately leave me empty. Covering new ground, exploring, and taking chances gives me juice and keeps me interested.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wanted to find the next level. On What It Is, he clearly has.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessarily easy to get there. Carll\u2019s last release, 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers was an artistic and commercial risk \u2014 a bold move which eschewed the tempo and humor of much of his previous work. The record revealed a more serious singer-songwriter dealing with more serious subjects \u2014 divorce, new love in the middle of life, parenting, the worth of work. What It Is finds him now on the other side, revived and happy, but resolute \u2014 no longer under the impression that any of it comes for free.\n\n\u201cI want to dig in so this life doesn\u2019t just pass me by. The more engaged I am the more meaning it all has. I want that to be reflected in the work.\u201d\n\nAnd meaning there is. Carll sings \u201cbut I try because I want to,\u201d on the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cNone\u2019Ya.\u201d He\u2019s not looking back lamenting love lost, rather, finding joy and purpose in the one he\u2019s got and hanging on to the woman who sometimes leaves him delightedly scratching his head. \u201cIf I May Be So Bold,\u201d finds him standing on similar ground \u2014 lyrically taking on the challenge of participating fully in life rather than discontentedly letting life happen.\n\nBold enough to not surrender bold enough to give a damn\n\nBold enough to keep on going or to stay right where I am\n\nThere\u2019s a whole world out there waiting full of stories to be told\n\nI\u2019ll heed the call and tell\u2019em all if I may be so bold\n\nThere\u2019s no wishy washy here and he\u2019s not on the sidelines. In fact, he\u2019s neck-deep in life. On the rambunctious, fiddle-punctuated, \u201cTimes Like These,\u201d he laments political division in America while delivering a rapid-fire plea to \u201cdo my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor, while keeping all my joie de vivre.\u201d Carll\u2019s signature cleverness and aptitude for so-personal-you-might-miss-it political commentary is as strong as ever. The stark, \u201cFragile Men,\u201d co-written with singer-songwriter Lolo, uses humor and dripping sarcasm to examine his gender\u2019s resistance to change in less than three minutes of string-laden, almost Jacques Brel invoking drama. It\u2019s new musical territory for Carll, and the result is powerful. His voice is strong and resonant on these songs, and it\u2019s thrilling to hear him use it with a new authority. He is alternately commanding and tender, yet always soulful.\n\nCarll returned to trusted producer Brad Jones (producer of 2008\u2019s Trouble in Mind and 2011\u2019s KMAG YOYO) and Alex the Great Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to record What It Is, and recruited singer-songwriter, author, and fiancee Allison Moorer as co-producer. The production is adventurous while keeping the focus on the singer and his songs and providing a path for him to go where he wants to go. Where that is, is forward.\n\nThat\u2019s evident in the songwriting. Carll continues to hone his singular voice, but is also a flexible co-writer. Matraca Berg, Charlie Mars, Adam Landry, and Moorer have co-writing credits here, but it was Moorer\u2019s inspiration that provided the largest impact.\n\n\u201cOn the songwriting front she\u2019s just a pro. She helps me cut through the noise and she does it with wit and style.\u201d\n\nCarll\u2019s own wit and style has never been more evident. Whether it\u2019s with the put-you-in-picture detail of, \u201cBeautiful Thing,\u201d the not quite sheepish enough, dude-esque defense of dishonesty in, \u201cThings You Don\u2019t Wanna Know,\u201d or the strong as a tree trunk declaration of love on, \u201cI Will Stay,\u201d he displays an increasing command of his poetic lexicon.\n\nWriters most often wrestle with experience and expectations, either romanticizing the past or telling us how good it\u2019s going to be when they get where they\u2019re going. What It Is is a record that is rooted solidly in the present, revealing an artist in the emotional and intellectual here and now.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Champagne Drip ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8996159.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Champagne Drip, the newest musical incarnation of Los Angeles-based producer Sam Pool, was born out of a philosophy that innovation springs from inspiration. Pool had carved out a unique place for himself in the bass music community; performing under the moniker of SPL for over 10 years and releasing drum & bass, dubstep, and trap-oriented music on respected labels such as Barcode, Tech Itch, Evol Intent, Sub Human, Rottunn, and SMOG Recordings. SPL\u2019s music was fully immersed in sound design, a musical landscape comprised of melodic, dark, and refined touches. By the Summer of 2014, Pool came to the realization that he had pushed the SPL project to its sonic boundaries and in order to evolve musically, he would need a new project to explore lighter textures and richer melodies. Rooted in jungle and bass music and built around elements of blippy 8-bit sounds, arpeggios, and lush 80s synths, Champagne Drip launched as a decidedly tropical and uplifting sounding project. Operating at first in anonymity, Champagne Drip made a big splash thru the release of official remixes of Bassnectar (Amorphous Music) and Elliphant (Mad Decent). Shortly thereafter, he released his debut EP \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d on Mad Decent in September of 2014. Over the first year of the project\u2019s history, press outlets were fascinated with the unique sound, but also with uncovering the identity of the secretive producer behind the music. \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d was subsequently remixed by electronic upstarts Big Wild, Lazerdisk, Mayhem, and Son of Kick and released in the Spring of 2015 as \u201cRemix Bikini\u201d. In the Fall of 2015, Champagne Drip released his 2nd EP for Mad Decent, \u201cJourney Into The Champagne Sea\u201d. Whereas his first EP explored more overtly tropical overtones, \u201cJourney\u201d went into deeper and darker musical territory. After spending one full year refining his sound in the studio, he finally revealed himself as the former SPL in 2016; performing across the US at such festivals as Mysteryland, WTFest?, Imagine, Enchanted Forest, and Lights All Night. Building up anticipation for his next original recordings, Champagne Drip released the stand alone single \u201cOpen Your Eyes\u201d, which was featured on the official Bernie Sanders Presidential campaign fundraising compilation \u201cRave4Bernie\u201d. Official remixes for Grandtheft (Mad Decent), Cardinox (Warner Brothers), and Dillon Francis & NGHTMRE (Mad Decent) followed. Champagne Drip capped off an already busy 2016 with the release of two new EPs; \u201cPoseidon\u201d via Quality Goods Records and \u201cOf Course I Still Love You\u201d via Saturate Records. Official remixes for Zeds Dead & Diplo, UZ, and DAWN all saw early 2017 releases. Champagne Drip is set to have his biggest year yet in 2017, with multiple EPs scheduled for release on Deadbeats Records as well as forthcoming remixes for 12th Planet and Mayhem, which are due for Summer releases. https://twitter.com/champagnedrip https://soundcloud.com/champagnedrip https://www.instagram.com/champagnedrip Bookings: champagnedripbookings@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.twitch.tv/cardinalnow"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Earth, Wind ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mr. V ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10337125.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Electronic, House Music, Edm", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Experiencing Mr. V\u2019s DJ sets, original productions, or remixes is like taking a trip back in time to dance music\u2019s golden age.

The two continue to share the spotlight as the band's co-songwriters and co-lead singers. Ed has sung lead on some of the band's biggest hits, including \"One Week\", \"Pinch Me\", and \"If I Had $1,000,000\", as well as the band's most recent single, \"Easy\", off of their 8th studio record, 'Barenaked Ladies Are Me'.\n\nWhen not with Barenaked Ladies, Ed remains active in music. He has produced for the Canadian band The Waltons, as well as the solo-project of The Waltons' lead singer, Jason Plumb. Ed also co-wrote the song \"Satellite\", which appeared on Jason's record. Ed has also written songs with country singer John Berry (\"He Makes Me Want Her Again\"), Andy Kim, and the band Hanson. He has also lent his vocal skills to duets with fellow Canadian artists Holly Cole, Melanie Doane, and YAP, as well as the side-projects of fellow band members Tyler Stewart (Don't Talk Dance) and Jim Creeggan (The Brothers Creeggan). More recently, Ed also wrote and sang the \"Wiggle Song\" that can currently be heard on the international television ad campaign for Jell-O products. On rare occasions, he does solo shows himself, where he will feature some of the music he's written with artists outside of BNL, as well as some of BNL's best-known songs. However, Ed insists that, unlike his other 4 band members, he has no intention of starting a side project or solo album of his own.\n\nEd has also ventured outside of the world of music, modeling for designer Harry Rosen, and acting in two feature films, Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle and the award-winning indie film, Love, Sex, and Eating the Bones, where he had a prominent supporting role.\n\nIn the fall of 2006, Canada's Outdoor Life Network will begin showing Ed's Up, a reality show featuring Ed, a licensed pilot, flying his Cessna all over Canada, performing everyday, \"blue-collar\" jobs. The show was filmed in the summer of 2006, and while filming, Ed performed a number of small, impromptu solo concerts, including one in a small town in Newfoundland which helped raise money for some recently orphaned children, whom Ed is also helping by backing the establishment of a trust fund.\n\nEd lives in the suburbs of Toronto with his wife, 3 children, and a couple of pets.\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.BNLBlog.com or http://www.BNLMusic.com\n\nFor unashamed drooling, visit http://www.dystopiary.com/ed", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brandy Clark ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10140296.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The new single #GirlNextDoor is now available: http://smarturl.it/BCGNDI", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/martinguitar"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Devin Dawson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7772871.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Americana, Soul, R&b, Folk, Country, Rock, Rnb-soul, R&b/soul", "Time": "10:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Warner Music Nashville / Atlantic Records artist Devin Dawson is not your typical country artist.

Arriving in Nashville in 2012, he put his unique skills to use authoring songs for other artists. When it came time to put together his own debut album, he teamed with equally daring producer Jay Joyce (Eric Church, Little Big Town, Brothers Osborne). Having co-written every track, the result is a mix of organic roots and high-voltage country, full of romance and delivered with a distinctive saw-toothed vocal.

Inspired by the dramatic landscape and vast seasonal changes that range as much in temperature as they do in color, she reaches for the earth itself in its various forms to give her a sense of belonging. As the daughter of musicians and missionaries, this brought her to experience pivotal years of her childhood in Central America. Naturally, music became a tool through which she could make sense of the world and put down roots, despite a lingering feeling of displacement.\nAs evidenced in her songs, there is a lustrous display of tension and relief; a relationship between vulnerability and strength, death and rebirth, pain and love. Existing in performance as much as in song, this ongoing conflict allows audiences to gain a glimpse of Sabella\u2019s true persona; she may break your heart, but shortly thereafter will invite you in for a cup of tea, enjoyed most with whiskey.\nAfter experimenting with fresh palets and uncharted terrain, Sabella has established a sound she\u2019s been ever yearning for with Forgive the Birds, the second full-length studio album, to be released this April.

Three years ago, the Chicago-based trio parted ways with their indie rock roots to record their own take on the hip hop classic \u201cSummertime.\u201d With a smooth bed of 808s and hand claps, the song made the rounds on lists of must-download summer songs and landed the band on Comedy Central\u2019s Tosh.0. But the American reception to the song paled in comparison to an unlikely spot on the map: Lithuania. While the band continued to wage the American DIY-band battle for attention at small club shows around the US, the situation was much different in the former member of the USSR. The band had become a household name, and the song\u2019s accompanying video had racked up more than one million views. \u201cWe started to get all these messages from fans in Eastern Europe about how much they loved the song,\u201d lead singer David McMillin says. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t think that we were catching on somewhere halfway around the world.\u201d Fast forward to 2015, and there was a big reason to start to believe their own hype: the US Embassy in Lithuania offered to bring Fort Frances to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, to headline one of the city\u2019s biggest summer festivals, Loftas Fest. The lineup included Mercury Prize-winning Young Fathers and XL/Terrible Records rapper Le1f. \u201cHere we are, this unknown band with our name alongside some of these huge artists from around the world,\u201d bassist Jeff Piper says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even believe we were going until we were on the plane.\u201d When the band touched down, they stepped into a scene reminiscent of Rodriguez discovering his fans in \u201cSearching for Sugar Man.\u201d The band\u2019s name was plastered on billboards and street signs. They appeared on \u201cGood Morning, Lithuania.\u201d They headlined the sold-out opening night of the festival. It was clear the band had found a second home. \u201cOur week in Lithuania was one of the most rewarding times of my life,\u201d McMillin says. \u201cYou start playing music in a garage without a clue of where it can take you. I never would have expected the road could lead us to a stage in the former Eastern Bloc.\u201d That same road brought them back home to put the finishing touches on a new full-length album with Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter, Lake Street Dive) in a studio tucked away in the woods of Parsonsfield, Maine with a refreshed outlook on creative exploration. The New England retreat gave the band an opportunity to cross into unfamiliar sonic territory. \u201cThere are moments on this record I never would have imagined we would have been able to make a few years ago,\u201d drummer Aaron Kiser says. The crunchy guitar-monies layered behind the falsetto phrasing of \u201cTake the Wheel\u201d, the marimba-sub synth combo of \u201cEverything is Starting to Make Sense\u201d, the frantic pacing of \u201cThe Light Years\u201d \u2014 this cast of songs puts the spotlight on a band that is growing increasingly comfortable with loosening its roots in the past. \u201cMemories are not meant to be kept inside a frame, so before we drive out to the coast tonight, I will drive myself insane,\u201d McMillin sings on lead single \u201cBuilding A Wall.\u201d \u201cOver the past year, I feel like we\u2019ve taken some big steps for the band,\u201d McMillin says. \u201cThe time overseas helped us open the door to welcome a world of new possibilities.\u201d When it came time to choose a title the album, the choice was clear. \u201cAlio\u201d is Lithuanian for hello. www.fortfrancesmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ Mel ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6608334.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "House, Electronic", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cMel-ting pot of talent!\u201d- Female DJ List DJ Mel has taken the industry by storm with her versatility and eruption of dancefloors; she\u2019s now one of Australia\u2019s fastest and youngest risers within the electronic dance music scene.

Bearing witness to small details and fleeting moments is what dignifies our everyday stories, rendering the mundane profound. This principle governs Erelli\u2019s approach to his craft, and is uniquely evident on his latest release, Mixtape, which features revelatory reinterpretations of songs by the Grateful Dead, Neko Case, Roy Orbison and others.\n\nErelli\u2019s two decade career highlights include 11 solo albums, stints accompanying Josh Ritter, Paula Cole and Anais Mitchell, and a pair of records he produced for GRAMMY-winning songwriter Lori McKenna. Ever since Billboard magazine heralded the \u201csimple, atmospheric grace\u201d of his Signature Sounds debut, Erelli\u2019s belief in the sacredness of an examined life has driven him between the ostensible extremes of lullabies and murder ballads, western swing and protest anthems.

On Italian Ice, the New Jersey-bred singer/songwriter conjures the romance and danger and wild magic of a place especially close to her heart: the Jersey Shore in all its scrappy beauty. Inspired by the boardwalk\u2019s many curiosities\u2014the crumbling Victorian mansions, the legendary funhouse, the Asbury Park rock-and-roll scene she played a key part in reviving\u2014Atkins transforms her neverending fascination into a wonderland of her own making.\n\nFor help in capturing the shore\u2019s kinetic spirit, Atkins assembled a studio band whose lineup feels almost mythical. Recorded at the iconic Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama, Italian Ice finds the Nashville-based artist joined by Spooner Oldham and David Hood (both members of The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, who played on classic records from the likes of Aretha Franklin and Etta James), Binky Griptite of The Dap Kings, Jim Sclavunos and Dave Sherman of The Bad Seeds, and drummer McKenzie Smith (St. Vincent, Midlake). With special guests including Spoon frontman Britt Daniel, Seth Avett of The Avett Brothers, Erin Rae, and John Paul White, the album is a testament to Atkins\u2019s uncommon talent for uniting musicians of radically different sensibilities. As Atkins explains, the abundance of collaborations on Italian Ice partly stems from a freak accident in which she stumbled into a sinkhole in a Knoxville parking lot\u2014an incident that left her with a profound longing to fill her life with the people and experiences that bring her the most joy.\n\nCo-produced by Atkins and Ben Tanner of Alabama Shakes, Italian Ice makes brilliant use of its A-list personnel, unfolding in a kaleidoscopic sound that Atkins likens to \u201can acid trip through my record collection.\u201d At turns as opulent as symphonic pop and gritty as garage punk, the album wanders into shades of psych-rock and honky-tonk and girl-group melodrama, endlessly spotlighting the tightly honed musicianship and unbridled originality at heart of Atkins\u2019s artistry.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Barrie Dempsey ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7656763.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Blues, Folk, Americana", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Award winning singer/songwriter Barrie Dempsey plays more than just electric and acoustic guitar.

It will absolutely, totally, kick your ass.\u201d\n- BLURT MAGAZINE\n\n\u201cMichelle Malone\u2019s Slings and Arrows isn\u2019t a great album because it challenges so many of the assumptions / presumptions / misconceptions about female artists. It\u2019s just a great album; one that also happens to do do those things. It's Outrageously good. While the vocals and songs on Slings and Arrows are outstanding, the slide guitar work is the real revelation. \u201d NO DEPRESSION\n\nABOUT MICHELLE MALONE\n\nMichelle Malone is an award-winning American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and producer in the rock, folk, blues and pop idioms. She is also the founder of SBS Records.\n\nMalone was born and raised in Atlanta, GA by a musician mom with whom she toured in the summers. She grew up listening to her mother and grandmother sing in the church choir every Sunday when they werent on the road. She dropped out of high school at 16 to begin work on her rock and roll degree. After a few brushes with the law and some unsavory characters, Michelle decided to go back to high school and became the valedictorian for a small class. She attended Agnes Scott College with dreams of becoming a doctor, but was offered a record deal with Clive Davis at Arista Records, which looked alot more interesting to her than more school.\n\nWhen it came time to craft her own sound, she took those religious and secular roots, blended in enough folk, blues and rock to satisfy, and came up with a rootsy high-spirited sound that brings acoustic and electric slide and passionate vocals together harkening back to the lost recordings of Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi, and Lucinda Williams.\n\nAfter several major label releases, Malone is now an independent artist with 15 studio records to date and an impressive resume which includes hi profile performances with everyone from Gregg Allman to John Mayer, the Atlanta Symphony to Ellen Degeneres, various awards including best albums, 4x best singer, 3x best acoustic guitarist, and 2 Grammy ballot nominations. Her songs have appeared in such films as Bam Bam and Celeste, All Over Me, Shotgun Jesus and television programs True Blood, Dawson's Creek, Felicity, Brooklyn South. They have been recorded by Indigo Girls (for which she received both gold and platinum records), Antigone Rising, and Vistoso Bosses.\n\nMalone has always made time for philanthropic endeavors such as running the Paris marathon for Team In Training/The Leukemia Society, and cycling with Team Earth Challenge from Atlanta to Yucca Mountain, NV in protest of the nuclear waste dumping. In 2012 she started a college scholarship fund for girls in need. She currently contributes to various women's and children's non-profit organizations, and donates time to local Georgia music organizations and schools.\n\nMalone has performed for TedX Peachtree, sang the National Anthem for The Atlanta Braves and The Houston Comets, been honored with a Signature guitar slide modeled and named after her by Rocky Mountain Slides, was the keynote speaker at a SoCal high school graduation, has been the rhythm guitarist and mandolin player for Kristian Bush (Sugarland), a satellite member of the Indigo Girls, is endorsed by Supro USA Guitars and amps Reunion Blues, and Breedlove guitars and mandolins. Michelle's latest recording, Slings and Arrows, was released March 2018 and debuted at #8 on the Billboard Blues charts.\n\nFor tour dates, info and booking or, please visit www.michellemalone.com/contact", "otherInfo": "Michelle Malone\u2019s Friends and Family Birthday show!

It's the same kind of self-assurance the soft-spoken Rodgers displays on his second independently released EP, available January 19th. Produced by Mickey Jack Cones (Dustin Lynch, Joe Nichols) and Chris Farren, the five-song collection showcases him as both a talented writer and interpreter, merging the electrified rock he heard on the baseball diamond with the thoughtful lyricism of country. Well before he was singing for his supper, the Batesville, Mississippi native was an accomplished baseball player who was a scholarship athlete at Northwest Mississippi Community College. Raised in the midst of country's '90s commercial heyday \u2013 his first concert was Garth Brooks at the Pyramid in Memphis \u2013 Rodgers always had an inkling that he might end up living in Music City, he just didn't know how or when. \"I can remember in high school I would tell people \u2013 this was before I played guitar or anything \u2013 I would just be like, 'Yeah, I'm gonna move to Nashville one day,'\" he recalls. And so he did, departing Mississippi with one of his college buddies to see if he could make it in Music City. Through the countless open mic nights and lean years that inevitably followed, Rodgers was able to develop the songwriting voice that would eventually earn his first publishing deal with Combustion Music. \"I went into songwriting boot camp,\" he says. \"That's all I did. I hardly played any shows or anything. I just focused on writing.\" In the meantime, Rodgers scored his first cut on Florida Georgia Line's Dig Your Roots, with \"Wish You Were on It.\" He also released his self-titled EP, featuring the streaming hit \"Midnight Daydream.\" All that intense focus shows on his second self titled EP. Opening track \"Ain't Really Over\" depicts a man in the hangover stage of a rough breakup and trying to move on. Framed by surging, distorted electric guitars and Rodgers' bluesy howl, it sets the tone for his melody-rich, introspective style of songwriting. On \"Cold Case,\" Rodgers draws a line between himself and country's long tradition of clever wordplay. Bouncing off the title's suggestion of criminal investigations, he's popping tops and pining over a woman who's up and vanished from his life. His solution? Downing as many beers as he can handle. \"'Cold Case' was just one of those things \u2013 somebody started playing a guitar and one of us just spit it out,\" says Rodgers. \"It kind of fell out of thin air.\" Rodgers' clear sense of his artistic identity also shines through on the outside songs \"Like You've Been There Before\" and \"Some Girls.\" It's easy to envision Rodgers singing about a younger version of himself in \"Like You've Been There Before,\" a rebellious kid getting some sage advice from his father to play it cool whether he's knocking a fastball over the fences or cautiously taking his first trip around the bases with a young woman. He sings it with the easy confidence of a seasoned vet, or as he says in the chorus, \"like it ain't no thing.\" \"Some Girls,\" on the other hand, calls back to \"Ain't Really Over\" except this time he's ended things and she's not handling it well \u2013 talking behind his back and playing childish games on social media. \"Some girls make it easy on you,\" he sighs, \"and some girls never do.\" The female woes reach their apex in the Rodgers co-write \"Missing One,\" which flips the title phrase on its head. Initially it's a missing copy of the Eagles' Desperado that she took when she left, then a single smoke from a pack of cigarettes that she forced him to give up. But it turns out he's actually missing something else most of all. Rodgers wrote the tune with pals Smith Ahnquist and Hunter Phelps, taking months to get it right. \"We started it in January and we didn't finish it until May,\" he says. \"We knew it was gonna be a clever idea, but we had to get it right. It was a hard one, but a fun one.\" That dedication, coupled with Rodgers' finely-tuned ear for songs, makes him perfectly suited to lean forward into Nashville's ever-shifting winds while honoring his roots. \"I want to be known as the dude with good songs,\" he says. \"If a song gives you chill bumps or if it makes you cry or if it makes you happy, it's done its job.\" That may sound like a relatively humble mission for a performer with such promise, but hey, sometimes you just know.", "otherInfo": "Saturday Nights Live"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alex Mendenall ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9148102.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Jazz, Indie, Soul, Alternative", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Alex Mendenall is a nationally touring songwriter based in Detroit, MI.

Taylor Powell had this to say about the new record:\n\n\u201cHurricane Harvey definitely changed a lot of things for us,\u201d explains Taylor Powell. \u201cThe plans we had been making for the previous few months were completely wiped out. As we were tearing down our childhood home, there were definitely many moments of despair. But as they say, when you are going through hell, keep on going. Looking back, it actually wiped the slate clean, and gave us an opportunity to do something much greater than we had planned before. We decided to use this as a sign that it was time to make the record we had always wanted to make.\u201d\n\nThe first radio single off the new album was \u201cComing Home,\u201d a love letter to Taylor and Blake Powell\u2019s hometown of Houston, Texas.

The four original members, Scott Blasey (vocals, acoustic guitar), Rob James (6 and 12-string electric guitars, vocals), Greg Joseph (bass, vocals) and David Minarik (drums, vocals) are joined by fellow touring mates Gary Jacob, Skip Sanders and Noah Minarik, tossing out some spanking pedal steel, Hammond organ and tasty guitar. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had more fun composing and recording songs,\u201d says bass player Greg Joseph. \u201cWith our storied recording history, it\u2019s really heartening to know that music can still captivate the band as much as it has on this album.\u201d\n\nWith a highlight reel that includes the Late Show with David Letterman, The Simpsons, and others, The Clarks are enjoying their stage time together now more than ever. \u201cIt\u2019s one big extended family,\u201d says guitarist Rob James. \u201cDave\u2019s son Noah plays on this album, and with us live, so saying that isn\u2019t just a metaphor, it\u2019s fact!\u201d Singing and playing the songs of Madly In Love At The End Of The World has rekindled a fire in The Clarks\u2019 sometimes broken, sometimes mended hearts.\n\nThe Clarks are:\nScott Blasey: Lead Vocals, Electric & Acoustic Guitars\nRobert James: Electric & Acoustic Guitars, Vocals\nGreg Joseph: Bass Guitar, Vocals\nDave Minarik: Drums, Vocals", "otherInfo": "Scott hosting his weekly Live from the Blasement Facebook live stream."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "B\u00e9lO Ayiti ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9127536.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "World Music", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "B\u00e9lO has been hailed as Haiti\u2019s musical ambassador to the world.

Critics and fans are already responding with praise. The Washington Post called it \"One of the year's best roots-rock releases.\"\n\nLuke is not your typical rock star. Though he appears to have all of the ingredients included in the modern recipe; young, good looking, rebel dress and incredible talent, his music draws from another time - it is reminiscent of artists some decades ago who focused on the timeless art of songwriting.\n\nMarried to his high school sweetheart (a la Bono and fellow Jersey born rocker Jon Bon Jovi), compassion and the challenge of keeping love alive in a modern and dangerous world are recurring themes in Luke's music and his life. They recently took on the added challenge of a foster child born to a drug-addicted mother. His life-long pursuit of music has led him to travels in West Africa, Brazil and Eastern Europe and consistent touring across the country. He studied guitar at Rutgers with Ken Wessel, guitarist with free jazz pioneer Ornette Coleman, and built his main guitar himself. He is also one of the owners of Jammin' Java - a 200 seat music club recently named one of the Top 100 Clubs in the World by Pollstar Magazine.\n\nWhen asked about his influences he names artists from the classic singer/songwriter pantheon such as Dylan, Neil Young and Van Morrison, the straightforward American songwriters like Springsteen, Tom Petty and Paul Westerberg, the elegance of Nick Drake and early Bruce Cockburn, the rawness and simplicity of early American and British punk, the intricate and revolutionary guitar work of D'Gary, Michael Hedges and Ali Farka Toure, modern songwriters like Joe Purdy, Josh Ritter and Patty Griffin and but also authors and poets like Thomas Merton, Rilke, James Wright, and Rumi.\n\nNo - definitely not typical.\n\nInspired by the early Motown recordings and the classic 70's singer/songwriters records, the entire record was recorded live in the studio with minimal overdubs in only three days. Luke entered the studio in Fall 2006 with a collection of new songs and a stellar band of DC-area musicians including a horn section, brother Daniel on keyboards, and brother-in-law Jared Bartlett as producer. The result is \"a well-crafted and fairly seamless production, a collection of tunes that consistently makes the most of Brindley's raspy voice, soulful delivery and impressive guitar work\", says the Washington Post.", "otherInfo": "Luke Brindley\nChristian Sedelmyer\nS\u00e9amus Egan\nTammy Lynne Hall"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "New local ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8635194.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Rock, Cover Band, Classic Rock, Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "New Local is a cover band from Charlotte, North Carolina.

The band got things up and running pretty quickly as they played a handful of shows by the early part of 2013. Unfortunately, things were put on hold as fast as they started because the lead singer/lead guitar player decided to take a break from music to start a family. The remaining two members decided to keep the vision of Grunge DNA alive and found some quick luck as the band discovered two new members in very short order to join the band and to fill the void. Grunge DNA officially became a four piece band moving forward. Kevin Harper joined the band as the lead singer and Josh Nichols joined the band as the lead guitarist in May of 2013 making the band complete once again and better than ever. Grunge DNA had really found something going forward and the music really began to take off as these four members performed together at well over 200 shows from 2013 to 2018. In the latter months of 2018, another line up change took place as Kevin Harper and Brian Cahill left the band in November to pursue other musical ventures. David and Josh quickly put their thinking caps on and recruited Patrick Ziemak to take over on lead vocals and Jim Black to take over on bass guitar. The two newest, full-time members were easy selections as they had already been associate members of the band and friends of David and Josh for quite some time with a history of playing the same brand of music.

But before moving to the DC area, Jorma and family lived in the Philippines and other locales as he followed his father's career from assignment to assignment before returning to the place of his birth. As a teenager in Washington he and future Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady (who at the time played six-string guitar) formed a band named The Triumphs. Kaukonen departed Washington for studies at Antioch College where friend Ian Buchanan taught him fingerstyle guitar playing. Buchanan also introduced Kaukonen to the music of Reverend Gary Davis, whose songs have remained important parts of Kaukonen's repertoire throughout his career.\n\nIn 1962 Kaukonen moved to the San Francisco bay area and enrolled in Santa Clara University. During this time he taught guitar lessons in a small music store in San Jose. As a self-described blues purist, Kaukonen never had any ambition to play in a rock band. He played as a solo act in coffee houses and can be heard accompanying a young Janis Joplin on acoustic guitar on an historic 1964 recording (known as \"The Typewriter Tapes\" because of the obtrusive sound of Kaukonen's first wife Margareta typing in the background). Invited to attend a Jefferson Airplane rehearsal by founding member Paul Kantner, Kaukonen found his imagination excited by the arsenal of effects available to electric guitar and later said, \"I was sucked in by technology.\"\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nKaukonen's electric guitar work was distinctive and widely emulated by other Bay Area guitarists. Notable work with Jefferson Airplane includes \"Greasy Heart\", \"If You Feel\", \"Hey Frederick\" (which culminates in an extended lead guitar duet with himself), \"Wooden Ships\" and his original composition, \"Feel So Good\". Rolling Stone named Kaukonen the 54th greatest rock guitarist of all time and 16th greatest acoustic guitarist.\n\nThough never a prolific singer and songwriter during his Airplane tenure, Kaukonen contributed some distinctive material. \"Embryonic Journey\" showcased his fingerstyle acoustic guitar virtuosity. On the next Jefferson Airplane album, After Bathing at Baxter's, his playing developed a harder-edged sound inspired by Mike Bloomfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Cream and other groups that visited San Francisco. These stylistic changes are prominent in the acid rocker \"The Last Wall of the Castle\", as well as the instrumental \"Spare Chaynge\", co-written with bassist Jack Casady and drummer Spencer Dryden. Clocking in at 9:12 minutes, this improvisational style was further explored on the free-form extended jams \"Thing\" and \"Bear Melt\", both live instrumentals recorded in 1968. Kaukonen insists, however, on the liner notes of the Live at the Fillmore East album that these jams were not chaotic \"free for alls\" but in fact \"complex rehearsed arrangements.\" Two notable songs that were later to become Hot Tuna signature tunes were also recorded during the 1968-1969 period. These were the traditionals \"Rock Me Baby \" and the gospel ballad \"Good Shepherd.\" Other original compositions with the Airplane appeared on the 1971 album \"Bark\", the instrumental \"Wild Turkey\" and \"Feel So good\", as well as the acoustic autobiographical \"Third Week in the Chelsea\" detailing his feelings about the disintegration of the band.\n\nHot Tuna and solo career\n\nIn 1969-70, Kaukonen and Jack Casady formed Hot Tuna, a spin-off group that allowed them to play as long as they liked. An early incarnation of Hot Tuna included Airplane vocalist Marty Balin and featured Joey Covington on drums and vocals. This grouping came to an end after an unsuccessful recording jaunt to Jamaica, the sessions of which have never been released. Pared down to Kaukonen and Casady, Hot Tuna lived on as a vehicle for Kaukonen to show off his Piedmont style acoustic blues fingerpicking skills. The self-titled first album was all acoustic and recorded live. With the dissolution of Jefferson Airplane in 1972, Hot Tuna went electric, with Airplane fiddler Papa John Creach joining for the next two albums. Hot Tuna scored an FM hit with \"Ja Da (Keep On Truckin')\" from their third (and first studio) album, Burgers. At this time, Kaukonen's song-writing began to dominate, as further evidenced by the next album, The Phosphorescent Rat, which only featured one cover song. Beginning with their fifth album, America's Choice (1974), the addition of drummer Bob Steeler encouraged a rise in volume and a change of band personality -- a rampaging, Cream-like rock with often quasi-mystical lyrics courtesy of Kaukonen. During this period, the power trio was known for its very long live sets and instrumental jamming.\n\nIn 1974, Kaukonen recorded the first and most successful of several solo albums, Quah, together with Tom Hobson. Produced by Jack Casady, and featuring (somewhat surprisingly) string overdubs on some tracks, this album contained some of Kaukonen's most deft fingerpicking work, especially on \"Hamar Promenade\", \"Blue Prelude\", \"Genesis\" and \" Flying Clouds\". The curious picture that adorns Quah's cover is today on display at Donkey Coffe and Espresso, a coffee shop in Athens, Ohio.\n\nKaukonen toured vigorously throughout the 1970s in both the United States and Europe, but with Hot Tuna's break up in 1978, the first phase of the band's career ended. Casady left to form the new wave band \"SVT\", while Kaukonen released his second solo album, Jorma, a mix of electric guitar and acoustic fingerstyle in 1979. Meanwhile, he had formed the band \"Vital Parts\".\n\nVital Parts featured bassist Denny DeGorio, who had played in a San Francisco band called the \"Offs\" with ex-Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler. Kaukonen, experimenting with a new image, not only cut his hair but dyed it purple then bright orange, and had extensive tattoos adorn his body, back and arms. The album Barbeque King was released in 1980. Kaukonen's traditional fan base did not warm to this new, perceived to be \"punk\" image, and sales of the album were so disappointing that Jorma was soon dropped from RCA records.\n\nHe continued playing as a solo artist throughout the 1980s at such venues as The Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia, The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey and in Port Chester, New York. As in his Hot Tuna days, he played very long sets, usually beginning with an hour-long acoustic set followed by a long intermission and then a two hour electric set, sometimes accompanied by bass and drums. Hot Tuna themselves reformed in the late 1980s. At a 1987 Hot Tuna performance, Kaukonen surprised fellow Airplane alumnus Paul Kantner, who was sitting in, with a surprise appearance by his estranged lover Grace Slick; the success of this performance helped to pave the way for a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and record in 1989.\n\nIn 1980, Kaukonen appeared on Robert Hunter's Amagamalin Street. This was the third album released by Relix Records, a label, founded by Les Kippel, that specialized in bands from the San Francisco Bay Area. Relix also released Splashdown, featuring a rare performance by Hot Tuna on WQIV, a defunct radio station in New York. Kippel was instrumental in reuniting Kaukonen and Casady in 1985 for a Hot Tuna theater tour. Relix Records was Hot Tuna's record company until 2000, and also released Classic Hot Tuna Acoustic, Classic Hot Tuna Electric, Live at Sweetwater, and Live at Sweetwater 2.\n\nTwo notable outside projects Kaukonen played on were the David Crosby album \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\" (1971) and Warren Zevon's \"Transverse City\" (1989). In 1993, he collaborated with ex-Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten in recording numerous arrangements of \"Embryonic Journey\". The resulting tracks were released as an album 1994 on the Relix label. In 1999, he played several gigs with Phil Lesh and Friends. In 2000, he appeared with jam band Widespread Panic during their summer tour.\n\nWith his wife Vanessa, Kaukonen currently owns and operates the Fur Peace Ranch, a 119 acre music and guitar camp in the hills of southeast Ohio, north of Pomeroy; complete with a 32 track studio. He is currently under contract as a solo artist to Red House Records and still records and tours with Jack Casady and other friends such as Barry Mitterhof as Hot Tuna. His 2002 album Blue Country Heart was widely acclaimed by critics as one of the definitive examples of American \"Depression Era \" music and features Kaukonen backed by an all-star Nashville bluegrass band. The album was nominated for a Grammy. His latest album, Stars In My Crown, was released in March 2007.", "otherInfo": "Quarantine Concert #6 Livestream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bok1vPD9y5w"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lil guillotine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9874956.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 10 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-10", "Genre": "Hip Hop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Raised in extreme poverty by a single mother with five siblings, Lil Guillotine makes music aimed at empowering the wretched of the earth.

An acoustic re-imagining of the songs from the rock record, the tracks are presented in stark, stripped-down contrast to its predecessors.\n\n\u201cOnce Upon a Hell of a Time... is a Saturday night record,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThis version is for the hangover on Sunday.\u201d\n\nRe-contextualizing the songs offers a new window into the lyrics. What he once described as a \u201cparty-rock record for the brokenhearted\u201d transforms into a reflective and beautiful dive into false escapism, grief, love, and loss. \"The stripped-down record lends clarity and depth to his already nuanced lyrics, revealing a deep thinker who seeks honesty in his craft, and in life.\" - Beatroute\n\nThe recording came amidst a particularly busy time for Matt Mays. During a period when he headlined his first Massey Hall concert and supported sold out shows with The Gaslight Anthem all over North America, Matt teamed up with co-producer Eric Ratz to record at studios around Toronto between touring commitments.\n\nTwice Upon a Hell of a Time\u2026 was originally conceived as a straight-up solo interpretation, similar to the iTunes Session recorded with Ratz in 2011. As the songs took shape, however, Matt decided to incorporate extra vocals and instrumentation. Tapping musicians Aaron Goldstein (Daniel Romano, Lee Harvey Osmond) on pedal steel, Anthony Carone (Arkells) on piano, and guest singers Andrew Rodriguez, Kate Dyke, and Melissa Payne, the album\u2019s arrangements are lush and large without straying from the \u2018unplugged\u2019 vibe he sought from the outset.\n\nLead track \u201cOla Volo\u201d is inspired by a Vancouver-based mural artist of the same name who also created the original album art for both records. \u201cHer paintings and drawings all have a theme that I picked up on,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nature. To me, it\u2019s from another dimension, a very curious dimension that draws me in. Her pieces are very edgy and real-life at the same time. I had this feeling that I\u2019d like to be in one of her paintings, to live in that world that she\u2019s created.\u201d\n\nAfter departing seminal alt-country collective The Guthries back in 2002, Matt Mays alternated between solo projects (his self-titled debut, the unfinished film soundtrack \u2026When the Angels Make Contact) and band projects (the eponymous Matt Mays & El Torpedo record and 2008\u2019s Terminal Romance). Following the dissolution of Matt Mays & El Torpedo in 2009, Matt released Coyote in 2012 to much acclaim, including a JUNO Award win for Rock Album of the Year.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}]
