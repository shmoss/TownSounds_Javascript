The right vocalist can make you fall in love at first listen, elicit tears, or bring you back to a different era altogether. A microphone and a stage remain the only necessities. That holds true for New York-based singer and songwriter Morgan James. On her full-length debut for Epic Records, Hunter, she casts an unbreakable spell with a powerhouse voice equally inspired by smoky soul, swaggering R&B, theatrical swing, and a virtuosic classical poise.\n\nThe Idaho native discovered her passion for music early on and pursued it\nwholeheartedly at the prestigious Juilliard School. While in the midst of the institution's rigorous academic program, she soon realized that her path would diverge from the classical world. \"I didn't want a career in opera, but Juilliard still shaped me,\" she confesses. \"The traditional training really made me a disciplined singer. I carry that with me to this day.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Morgan spent the next few years facing the proverbial struggles of being a young artist in New York. Low on money, she bounced back and forth between bartending and restaurant gigs while fighting to survive. Immersed in classic sixties and seventies soul records, she concurrently experienced a pivotal revelation. \"Out of that frustration came this other voice,\" she says. \"It was my true voice, and I feel like I discovered it in the middle of so much hardship just trying to be heard. I embraced who I was at that very moment.\"\n\nSoon, she would be heard in a big way. In 2008, Morgan booked her first Broadway show\u2014appearing in The Addams Family alongside Nathan Lane, as well as in prominent and leading roles in Wonderland, Godspell (Turn Back, O Man), and Berry Gordy's Motown The Musical as Teena Marie. The latter set the stage for her to\nproperly launch her solo career. Gordy recognized the vocalist's immense talent, and introduced her to Doug Morris and L.A. Reid, opening the door for a deal with Epic Records in 2012.\n\nAround the same time, Morgan booked a landmark show at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, where she paid tribute to Nina Simone with a set of songs that were closely associated with the legendary artist. The incendiary show was recorded and released as the critically acclaimed Morgan James Live on Epic Records. It also proved to be the perfect segue for her first studio album, released in June of 2014.\n\n\"I always knew to make a neo-soul pop record,\" Morgan says. \"The foundation is all real ingredients, and those roots of soul and R&B are pretty strong. It's the culmination of my musical life up to this point. The painful songs are straight out of a bad relationship with someone from my past. The joyful moments are wonderful memories. It's all coming from me. I've lived every one of these stories, and I love the genres I'm representing. It's one point-of-view\u2014mine.\"\n\nThe title track and album opener \"Hunter\" boasts a seductive hook with cinematic noir flair. Flaunting the singer's immense delivery and dynamic presence, it's an undeniable and classy come-on that proves as animalistic as it does magnetic. \"From a woman's perspective, it's such an empowering and sexy song,\" she smiles. \"It totally makes me feel like a warrior! Music is so sensual and life-affirming. That's what I look for. You don't often see a girl take this position, and that's what I love about it!\"\n\nMorgan assumed co-writing duties on eight of the collection's fourteen tracks and even performed all of her own background vocals and harmonies. From the empowering farewell of \"Fed Up On You\" to the mournful rumination of \"You Never Lied\", she continually bares it all\u2014both emotionally and musically. \"I sing like I'm never going to sing ever again,\" Morgan affirms. \"I wanted to capture that power and passion every time. At some moments, it might sound flawless; at others, it might sound like it's going to break. I'm revealing something about myself with\nevery song. You've got to do that. My favorite artists, whether Joni Mitchell or Michael Jackson, are and were, always honest.\"\n\nThere's a unique structure to the album. The first five songs boast electronic elements, while the last six don't have any. \"There's a gradient of the record that goes down,\" she says. \"By the time you get to the last song, it's just piano and voice. It starts with a song about power and ego, and it ends on one about surrender and selflessness. I have all of that in me. Maybe we all do.\"\n\nUltimately, her honesty permeates everything that Morgan James does, and it's why you'll always remember her voice. \"I want people to walk away from this album feeling fulfilled. That's the way it used to be. Often, I think I'm from another time,\u201d she says, her voice trailing off. \u201cI just want to bring back the power of the singular legacy voice.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "The Trouble Notes ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9908633.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Wed Apr 1 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-01", "Genre": "Instrumental Rock, Instrumental, Instrumental Folk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Pioneering a new genre through a common tale of dedication, passion, and sacrifice.\nThe Berlin-based band The Trouble Notes is Bennet Cerven violin, Florian Eisenschmidt guitar, Oliver Maguire percussion, and Stefan Bielik bass.

The Verve Recording artist continues to reign at his weekly residency in New York, as well as appear on television programs and in special performances across the United States and Europe.\nNewman is known for his impeccable horn playing and rendition of romantic favorites. But what sets him apart is his ability to command a room not only with his musical talent, but as a bandleader who makes each person in the audience feel as if they are a part of his performance.

The album confronts the ongoing mental health and familial trials that have plagued the 22-year-old artist since pre-pubescence, presenting listeners with an uncompromisingly honest self-portrait, and reminding us exactly why her critically-acclaimed debut, 2018\u2019s Clean, made her a hero to many. Wise beyond her years, Allison is a songwriter capable of capturing the fleeting moments of bliss that make an embattled existence temporarily beautiful. With color theory, Allison\u2019s fraught past becomes a lens through which we might begin to understand what it means to be resilient.\n\nClean demonstrated Allison\u2019s nuanced approach to lyricism and her disinterest in reducing complex emotional worlds into easily-digestible sound bites. On it, she projected the image of a confused but exceedingly mature teenager -- the type to offer up life-saving advice while cutting class under the bleachers. Clean led Soccer Mommy to sell out tour dates and play major music festivals around the world on top of opening for the likes of Kacey Musgraves, Vampire Weekend, and Paramore. A grueling touring schedule made it so that Allison had to get used to writing on the road, a challenge that exhilarated her. She wrote dozens of songs in hotels, green rooms, and in the backseat of the van. The ones that make up color theory were recorded in her hometown of Nashville at Alex The Great, a modest studio where the likes of Yo La Tengo have recorded, just two miles from her childhood home. Produced by Gabe Wax and engineered by Lars Stalfors (Mars Volta, HEALTH, St. Vincent), color theory\u2019s sonic landscape is vast and dextrous, illustrating how much Allison has evolved as a musician and matured as a person over the past year. The melodies on color theory shimmer on the surface, but they reveal an unsettling darkness with each progressive listen.\n\n\u201cI wanted the experience of listening to color theory to feel like finding a dusty old cassette tape that has become messed up over time, because that\u2019s what this album is: an expression of all the things that have slowly degraded me personally,\u201d Allison says. \u201cThe production warps, the guitar solos occasionally glitch, the melodies can be poppy and deceptively cheerful. To me, it sounds like the music of my childhood distressed and, in some instances, decaying.\u201d Allison used a sampling keyboard and string arrangements drawn from old floppy discs to lend color theory a timeworn aesthetic. She also opted to enlist her band in the recording process, which hadn\u2019t been the case on any of her earlier releases. \u201cAt the base of every song on color theory is a live take done to tape. This album reflects our live performance, which I\u2019ve grown really happy with,\u201d she says.\n\ncolor theory is thematically subdivided into three sections, each of which is named for a color that distills the mood Allison wanted to freeze in time. We begin with blue, a color that evokes a certain melancholy, and for Allison, illuminates depressive episodes and memories of inflicting self-harm. On \u201ccircle the drain,\u201d she admits that \u201cthe days thin me out or just burn me straight through\u201d over a swirling, guitar-driven arrangement that inspires a sense of ease in spite of the distressing lyrical content. The next section is represented by yellow, a color that points to illness, both mental and physical. \u201cMy mom has been terminally ill since I was a pre-teen, and I never really found a way to deal with it,\u201d Allison says. \u201cOn \u2018yellow is the color of her eyes,\u2019 I sing about a period when I was on an international tour and kept feeling like my time with her was ticking away.\u201d Lackadaisical from the outset, the song marries its relaxed arrangement with gutting lyrics that will ring true to anyone who has ever witnessed a loved one\u2019s health decline.\n\nThe final section, represented by grey, addresses that fear of loss directly. \u201cWatching my parents age and witnessing sickness take its toll made me think a lot about the cycle of life, and forced me to confront the paranoid sense that death is coming for me,\u201d Allison says. On the color theory\u2019s closer, \u201cgrey light,\u201d she doesn\u2019t shrink from the terrifying promise of death\u2019s inevitability and instead gives herself over to it completely. Atop a faded, oceanic bed of instrumentation, she unflinchingly admits, \u201cI see the noose/ It follows me closely whatever I do.\u201d But it\u2019s not all tragic, and moments of lightness appear on this album, too. Take lead single \u201clucy,\u201d which navigates an all-consuming dread with cunning wit and showcases Allison\u2019s deft songwriting prowess. Here, she pleads with a devilish character and succumbs to his cruelty just as easily as she delights in his attention. \u201cThat irks me -- that I\u2019m falling down/ From heaven through the Earth/ To hellfire to wear his crown,\u201d she sings, the twinkling instrumentation taking on an eerie, unsettling bent as the song progresses.\n\ncolor theory investigates a traumatic past in exacting detail; in doing so, Allison finds inroads for healing through self-acceptance, and occasionally, humor. (\u201cI\u2019m the princess of screwing up!\u201d she declares at one point.) This isn\u2019t a quest to uncover some long-since forgotten happiness so much as it is an effort to stare-down the turmoil of adolescence that can haunt a person well into adulthood. Allison is a gifted storyteller, one who is able to take personal experience and project it to universal scale. On color theory, she beckons in outsiders, rejects, and anyone who has ever felt desperately alone in this world, lending them a place to unburden themselves and be momentarily free.", "otherInfo": "due to the evolving coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic, this show will be postponed. we are working on scheduling a new date and will update you as soon as we can. hold onto your tickets, they will be valid for the rescheduled date but refunds will be issued at point of purchase if you can no longer attend. thank you for understanding, stay safe and healthy \u2764\ufe0f"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Damien Escobar ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8310600.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Fri Apr 3 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-03", "Genre": "Contemporary Soul", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Internet", "moreBioInfo": "Easy come, easy go; was the lesson two-time Emmy Award winning violinist, Damien Escobar learned when he and his brother walked away from a multi-million dollar brand that took ten years to build. The now 27-year-old's claim to fame came early on in his teens when he, alongside his brother, appeared on \"America's Got Talent\" as Nuttin' but Stringz. Two urban kids from Jamaica, Queens, playing a blend of hip hop and classical melodies with a violin was somewhat surprising to viewers, and unique to say the very least; and the duo quickly shot to stardom-- appearing in commercials and movies, touring, and even adding a platinum selling album to their accolades. But growing creative differences eventually became too much for the pair to bear, and the success of Nuttin' but Stringz came to an end-- shattering the name and reputation Damien worked hard to establish, and forcing him to rebuild from rock bottom.\n\nAfter the fall, Damien is reveling in the climb. Since re-launching his career, Escobar boasts of 200K downloads from his first R&B mixtape, \"Sensual Melodies\"; and has more than a few notable solo headliner performances under his belt including: CBS Upfront Presentation, Food & Wine Magazine\u2019s Best New Chef Awards, Indy Car Championship Awards, Major League Baseball Annual Golf Fundraiser Event, Angela Simmons \"Electric Daze\" Fashion Show, Russell Simmons\u2019 Hip Hop Inaugural Ball, and corporate concerts for FRIDAYS, Walmart, Target, and more.\n\nEscobar, once a self-proclaimed retired violinist, is now on everyone\u2019s radar; and has even obtained online success with viral videos picked up by media giants such as WorldStarHipHop.com, Huffington post, CNN, and Allhiphop.com. A recent feature in PEOPLE Magazine elevated Escobar to new heights in his solo career; highlighting his movement of giving back to others by doing random acts of kindness.The star even found his way back on national television, accepting an invitation to appear as a performer in WEtv\u2019s \u201cDavid Tutera\u2019s: Unveiled\u201d. And since then invitations to appear on television haven\u2019t ceased; landing Escobar in the interviewee chair at Fox News and NBC, with other appearances lined up for the remainder of 2014.\n\nAs a veteran, knowing the ups and downs of the industry, Escobar has committed to centering his career around the loyal fans he refers to as \"good people,\" who constantly remind him of why he got back into music. His appreciation for the support system he feels sustains him, spawned his Pop-Up Performance campaign. Armed with a giant speaker, a mic, and his violin, Escobar set out to surprise unsuspecting New Yorkers with a pop-up concert experience. The response to his documented journey was overwhelmingly positive, and resulted in Damien announcing a seven city pop-up performance tour this summer.\nCurrently, Escobar is appreciating his journey as a fresh new artist, with the recent release of his high-energy, inspirational single \"Freedom\" which he debuted on The Katie Couric show in support of Kennedy\u2019s Cause, that single subsequently went on to open up at #15 on the iTunes dance charts. The artist has also tapped into the book industry, penning his first children\u2019s book entitled \u201cThe Sound of Strings.\u201d He will begin his book tour at the start of the new school year.\n\nIn 2012 Nuttin' But Stringz disbanded and Damien Escobar emerged as a solo artist out to make a name for himself. Humble in his dealings but confident in his craft, Damien makes it no secret that he's determined to gain recognition for being the \"dopest\" violinist to crossover into mainstream music. In an industry not overpopulated by instrumentalist, the Hip-Hop violinist is looking to change the game. He's a pioneer with a plan, and the future of music rest in his hands.", "otherInfo": "We may be in period of social distancing but the music music must still go on!

It\u2019s a musical relationship that has endured for over two decades, with band members playing in numerous projects together and apart. Following the 2012 release of their freewheeling Sounds Like This, the band took time off to work on various side projects. Zach Gill (keys/vocals) toured the world with the band\u2019s college pal Jack Johnson; Dan \u201cLebo\u201d Lebowitz (guitar/vocals) played shows with the Grateful Dead\u2019s Phil Lesh; Steve Adams (bass/vocals) toured and recorded with Nicki Bluhm & the Gramblers; Dave Brogan (drums/vocals) joined up with Utah band, Mokie. These and other endeavors have influenced the band\u2019s new album Tangle Of Time.\n\nMore than previous releases, Tangle Of Time really taps into what makes ALO unique. It\u2019s that special blend of classic songwriting and the ability to stretch out jams and distill dance floor grooves. It's heartfelt lyrics that make you smile, reflect and just want to sing along either way. It's four great musicians who all write and sing. And four friends who've been through a lot together and still support, challenge and inspire one another.\n\nEntering Allegiant Records in San Anselmo, California this past January with co-producer Dave Simon-Baker, the four members decided they\u2019d take a different recording approach. Instead of spending pre-production days jamming and co-writing, each member brought in their own demos, roughly three dozen in total, for the group to listen to, pick apart and eventually whittle down to the 11 songs that make up Tangle Of Time. Once they narrowed their focus, they turned their attention to arrangements and production techniques. Songs were tightened up, layers made more experimental and the end results validated their new approach.\n\nLebo described the shared respect and admiration the band felt during the recording process this way: \"There are four strong opinions in the room, but playing together for so long we've all become pretty good at the empathy thing at this point; we can be very Zen about it. We truly value being together at this point in our careers, and whatever we get from our solo and side gigs, no matter how much fun we have, it's not this.\"\n\nThat sort of maturity, the ability to take stock of your friends, loved ones, and collaborators, and truly appreciate them is certainly one of the cornerstones of Tangle Of Time. Lebo, Adams and Gill first started playing music together in middle school, and then with Brogan right after college. Somehow, these relationships have lasted, evolved and been made stronger every year. One can almost hear the group releasing a satisfied existential sigh throughout the album, finding acceptance, love and contentment with the world they've built.\n\n\"I really appreciate the guys right now, more so than ever,\" Gill shared, excitedly adding, \"Years ago the feeling was, 'I wanna get to my songs and see how they sound while we're all here', whereas now I'm rooting for everyone else's songs. It's great.\"\n\nThat approach of supporting each other\u2019s songs worked like a charm, capturing each member\u2019s distinct songwriting voice, while simultaneously expanding the notion of what an ALO song or album can be. Take for instance the one-two-punch of the synth-filled, spacey jam vehicle \"The Ticket\" and the pedal steel-driven easy-going happiness of \"Simple Times\". Although two ends of the sonic spectrum, both are classic Gill songs at their core but stretched wide and far by the band\u2019s collective effort.\n\nNot to be outdone, Lebo's guitar epic \"Undertow\" is a song that practically begs to be stretched out live, with its swirling double guitar outro intoxicating the listener to such a degree that you might find yourself on the band's website, dreamily purchasing tickets for an entire run of shows just to see where the song ventures live. Lebo pairs this with \"Push\", a jaunty yet thoughtful number with a playful guitar riff that's basically the musical equivalent of joy.\n\n\"Not Old Yet\" and \"Keep On\", Adams\u2019 contributions to the album, are also touchstones to the spirit of Tangle Of Time. The first is a light-hearted romp about keeping a positive perspective on life\u2019s long road of hurdles and surprises, while the second is an upbeat, forward-thinking sing-along with lines that could be the album's mantra: \"Wherever this takes us, I know/That we've got each other, we've still got a long way to go.\"\n\nBrogan's \"Coast To Coast\" is among the most intriguing songs on the record. He, along with co-writer buddy Ben Malan, came up with a layer-upon-layer soundscape consisting of beautifully esoteric textures. The funky but ominous track tells the surreal tale of a band on the run, with more ideas and energy than know-how. Brogan shared that the theme of \u201ctangled time\u201d materialized unexpectedly over the course of the sessions, elaborating: \"There's a point where there is more behind you than ahead of you, and you realize that time becomes a limiting factor.\"\n\nPut the record on your turntable, and you can clearly hear the band\u2019s excitement to get back on the road and explore these songs with their audience. Improvisation is a staple of what the band does, and as Adams stated: \"Being in that unknown is such a great life lesson beyond just the music. For all the careful planning and preparing we do, being in the moment is really when it all matters.\"\n\nThe band is also planning new ways to expand the theatrical shenanigans that have become a fantastic complement to the live show. From confetti canons to 12-foot beach balls, pre-show skits to elaborate theme nights, bubble suits to a laser-shooting ukulele (yes, really)... ALO is always on the hunt for new and exciting ways to interact with fans to make their shows truly special. Gill, the band's head prankster, put it this way: \"I want people to come to a show expecting to be engaged in a fun and creative way. When I see someone dancing or singing along or reaching out to hit a giant beach ball, I start playing to the dancer and at that point, it's really a circle of energy traveling back and forth from the stage. The larger theatrical concepts are ways of interacting with the audience on another level.\"\n\nOn Tangle Of Time the band has reached that other level, and are ready to bring everyone along.", "otherInfo": "Ages 21+"}, {"Address": "85 Ave A, New York, NY 10009", "Artist": "Elif Sanchez ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9071103.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9843, 40.725256], "Date": "Fri Apr 3 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-03", "Genre": "Latin, Folk, Jazz, World Fusion", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Drom", "moreBioInfo": "Elif is a Turkish singer, who blends her folkloric roots with jazz and latin music.

While other children dreamt of being astronauts or building rocket ships out of mega blocks, Dan was ready to jam on stage with the greatest of the great.\n\nWhen he got a bit older, he accompanied his brother Michael to Sam Ash music store, where he needed to pick up a saxophone for middle school band. They may have been at the store for his brother, but that day will forever be the one where Dan\u2019s daycare dreams began to grow into a reality.\n\nThere, standing in the guitar department, Dan was encouraged to pick up and strum along to the beat inside his soul, and his passion began to take shape.\n\nAs years passed, Dan became more and more accustomed to the guitar, and fell more and more in love with performing. He surrounded himself with mentors from diverse backgrounds \u2013 Dennis DelGaudio (Billy Joel), Chris Justino (Broadway), Artie Blaurock (Sweet Revenge, Dorian Grey, Needulhed), & Rick Stone (Jazz Guitar at Hofstra University). Each of these amazing talents provided him with a unique perspective on guitar stylings and teachings.\n\nTaking that knowledge to the next level, Dan joined the likes of Indie/Alternative Rock band Face the King (CI Records) and performed across the continental US for a multitude of shows, including a full leg of Vans Warped Tour, Rockstar UPROAR Festival, the main stage at the CBGB Festival in Times Square, NY (with Billy Idol and Jane\u2019s Addiction!), as well as the world\u2019s largest music festival - Summerfest, in Milwaukee, WI.\n\nFace the King was chosen as a National Finalist for the Ernie Ball Vans Warped Tour competition alongside PVRIS, and are three-time winners of the Ernie Ball Battle of the Bands.

The right vocalist can make you fall in love at first listen, elicit tears, or bring you back to a different era altogether. A microphone and a stage remain the only necessities. That holds true for New York-based singer and songwriter Morgan James. On her full-length debut for Epic Records, Hunter, she casts an unbreakable spell with a powerhouse voice equally inspired by smoky soul, swaggering R&B, theatrical swing, and a virtuosic classical poise.\n\nThe Idaho native discovered her passion for music early on and pursued it\nwholeheartedly at the prestigious Juilliard School. While in the midst of the institution's rigorous academic program, she soon realized that her path would diverge from the classical world. \"I didn't want a career in opera, but Juilliard still shaped me,\" she confesses. \"The traditional training really made me a disciplined singer. I carry that with me to this day.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Morgan spent the next few years facing the proverbial struggles of being a young artist in New York. Low on money, she bounced back and forth between bartending and restaurant gigs while fighting to survive. Immersed in classic sixties and seventies soul records, she concurrently experienced a pivotal revelation. \"Out of that frustration came this other voice,\" she says. \"It was my true voice, and I feel like I discovered it in the middle of so much hardship just trying to be heard. I embraced who I was at that very moment.\"\n\nSoon, she would be heard in a big way. In 2008, Morgan booked her first Broadway show\u2014appearing in The Addams Family alongside Nathan Lane, as well as in prominent and leading roles in Wonderland, Godspell (Turn Back, O Man), and Berry Gordy's Motown The Musical as Teena Marie. The latter set the stage for her to\nproperly launch her solo career. Gordy recognized the vocalist's immense talent, and introduced her to Doug Morris and L.A. Reid, opening the door for a deal with Epic Records in 2012.\n\nAround the same time, Morgan booked a landmark show at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, where she paid tribute to Nina Simone with a set of songs that were closely associated with the legendary artist. The incendiary show was recorded and released as the critically acclaimed Morgan James Live on Epic Records. It also proved to be the perfect segue for her first studio album, released in June of 2014.\n\n\"I always knew to make a neo-soul pop record,\" Morgan says. \"The foundation is all real ingredients, and those roots of soul and R&B are pretty strong. It's the culmination of my musical life up to this point. The painful songs are straight out of a bad relationship with someone from my past. The joyful moments are wonderful memories. It's all coming from me. I've lived every one of these stories, and I love the genres I'm representing. It's one point-of-view\u2014mine.\"\n\nThe title track and album opener \"Hunter\" boasts a seductive hook with cinematic noir flair. Flaunting the singer's immense delivery and dynamic presence, it's an undeniable and classy come-on that proves as animalistic as it does magnetic. \"From a woman's perspective, it's such an empowering and sexy song,\" she smiles. \"It totally makes me feel like a warrior! Music is so sensual and life-affirming. That's what I look for. You don't often see a girl take this position, and that's what I love about it!\"\n\nMorgan assumed co-writing duties on eight of the collection's fourteen tracks and even performed all of her own background vocals and harmonies. From the empowering farewell of \"Fed Up On You\" to the mournful rumination of \"You Never Lied\", she continually bares it all\u2014both emotionally and musically. \"I sing like I'm never going to sing ever again,\" Morgan affirms. \"I wanted to capture that power and passion every time. At some moments, it might sound flawless; at others, it might sound like it's going to break. I'm revealing something about myself with\nevery song. You've got to do that. My favorite artists, whether Joni Mitchell or Michael Jackson, are and were, always honest.\"\n\nThere's a unique structure to the album. The first five songs boast electronic elements, while the last six don't have any. \"There's a gradient of the record that goes down,\" she says. \"By the time you get to the last song, it's just piano and voice. It starts with a song about power and ego, and it ends on one about surrender and selflessness. I have all of that in me. Maybe we all do.\"\n\nUltimately, her honesty permeates everything that Morgan James does, and it's why you'll always remember her voice. \"I want people to walk away from this album feeling fulfilled. That's the way it used to be. Often, I think I'm from another time,\u201d she says, her voice trailing off. \u201cI just want to bring back the power of the singular legacy voice.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "123 W 43rd St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "The Magnetic Fields ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7487637.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.984563, 40.756023], "Date": "Sat Apr 4 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-04", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "5:45 PM", "Venue": "The Town Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Band.

Soulful is the word\"-- Wall Street Journal\n\n\"Washburn stomped and skipped through fiery Appalachian takes on the local songs of Sichuan. Her bilingualism's no gimmick; she nails the dips and peaks of pitch while leading her band in scorching variations on simple, repetitive traditional melodies\u2026\u201d \u2013 L.A. Times\n\n\u201c{Abigail Washburn is} an artist who best embodies the notion of Americana as a worldwide musical language\" \u2013 The Tennessean\n\nBeijing. A smoke-filled club bustling with people, clanging of bottles, chatter. There is a woman on stage with her banjo. She begins to sing old-time Appalachian music in Chinese. The effect produced is entirely original, a cultural mash-up between two distant yet not so different worlds. The crowd quiets down to listen.\n\nAbigail Washburn never set out to be a songwriter, recording artist or a producer. Her performance at that smoke-filled Beijing club would prove to be an important step toward international acclaim and attention from discerning critics. Abigail has created a new sound \u2013 a sound that challenges traditional notions of culture and countries.\n\nAbigail planned to move to China after a road trip up the east coast, but instead she stumbled upon a professional music career. This east coast trip included a stop at the International Bluegrass Music Association conference in Louisville, KY where she intended to learn a few banjo tunes but walked away with a demo session for a record deal in Nashville, TN. She canceled her one-way ticket to China and moved to Nashville. Shortly thereafter in 2004 she joined Uncle Earl. The \"all G'earl\" group released two records on the Rounder label, She Waits for Night (2005) and Waterloo, TN, (2007) the latter of which was produced by John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin.\n\nIn the midst of touring with Uncle Earl, Washburn released her first solo debut, and bilingual album, Song of the Traveling Daughter, (Nettwerk). At that point, Abigail joined cellist, Ben Sollee, in performing her music around the globe. In 2005 Abigail, Ben and a few talented friends (B\u00e9la Fleck on banjo and Casey Driessen on fiddle) formed the Sparrow Quartet and toured China. In 2006, the US State Department and the American Center for Educational Exchange requested that the group come back to lead the first official tour of a US band in Tibet.\n\nIn May 2008, the Sparrow Quartet released Abigail Washburn & the Sparrow Quartet (Nettwerk) which was praised by critics and appeared on several \u201cbest of\u201d lists from prominent publications. Produced by B\u00e9la Fleck and composed/arranged by the unconventional foursome, Abigail Washburn & The Sparrow Quartet became an \"intimate exploration of crossing global and cultural lines,\" says Abigail, who feels a reverence for both American and Chinese cultures. The unprecedented combination of two banjos (clawhammer and three-finger-style), cello and five-string fiddle unfolds -live and on record- in a dreamlike chamber suite. From the flawless \u2018Overture\" and harrowing revival, \"Strange Things,\" to the interplanetary, Puccini-inspired old-time fairy tale, \"Great Big Wall in China,\" this record highlights the brilliant musicianship of each individual, but is at the same time much larger than the sum of its parts.\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, Abigail Washburn and the Sparrow Quartet toured extensively throughout the US and Canada with appearances at festivals including New Orleans Jazz & Heritage, Merlefest, Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, Vancouver Folk Festival and many more. They were invited by the US State Department to play in China including several performances in Beijing during the 2008 Olympic games. In addition, the were filmed on National Geographic Live in Washington, DC and were invited to be a part of the Clearwater Concert, a benefit concert in celebration of Pete Seeger's 90th birthday along with a line-up of some of the most prominent, established musicians in the world. For Abigail and the Sparrow Quartet, 2008 was a year full of accomplishments and successes.\nBut Abigail does not stop. She is a force of nature that continually attracts others to become a part of her art. Enter The Shanghai Restoration Project (SRP) producer Dave Liang. Abigail and Dave first collaborated to produce two electronic remixes of Sparrow Quartet songs released in April 2009.\nIn December 2008, Abigail served as a resident teacher at the Sichuan University Art School teaching traditional US music. In the hours after school was finished, she volunteered for Sichuan Quake Relief performing at earthquake relocation schools. The experience with the students and teachers after the performances left her wanting to do something to help.\nIn early March, 2009, Abigail had the idea to create Afterquake, a benefit EP in memory of the May 12, 2008 Sichuan Earthquake which left more than 5 million people homeless and hundreds of thousands dead. Abigail and The Shanghai Restoration Project united again to go to Sichuan Province, to the relocation schools and into the disaster zone to capture the voices of those affected by the earthquake and sample sounds from the schools and the disaster zone. They sampled, recorded and produced Afterquake in two and a half weeks in Sichuan province. The final result is a beautiful, timeless, intelligent and accessible musical document that blends folk and electronic sounds with post-earthquake samples. A portion of all proceeds will go to the Sichuan Quake Relief organization.\nWhether playing her banjo, or producing an electronic album, there is an undeniable element of Abigail Washburn in every project she embraces. Abigail's spirit and philosophy translate from language to language and bind countries, cultures and genres.\n\"As more and more people engage in this struggle for a new direction for the human spirit, we'll recognize that we're morphing into a global species.\"\n---Abigail Washburn", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "29 Harvard Ave, Richmond County, NY 10301", "Artist": "Steve Poltz ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9961547.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.090492, 40.642876], "Date": "Sat Apr 4 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-04", "Genre": "Acoustic, Americana, Folk", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Hamilton Park House Concerts", "moreBioInfo": "DISCLAIMER 1: The \u201cofficial\u201d Wikipedia for Steve Poltz describes the material contained therein as \u201ccontentious,\u201d not to mention \u201cunsourced or poorly sourced.\u201d We can wholeheartedly assure you Steve remains sourced and rarely contends. Either way, allow us to present the real story from the horse\u2019s (man\u2019s) mouth\u2026\n\nDISCLAIMER 2: (No animals were harmed in the making of this bio.)\n\nThroughout over three decades in music, Steve Poltz did it all and more\u2014often shared by way of his rockin\u2019 countrified folk slices of sardonic Americana (hatched in Halifax). Of course, he co-wrote Jewel\u2019s multiplatinum Hot 100-topping megahit \u201cYou Were Meant For Me,\u201d but he also went on a whale watch with her and a few federales that turned into a drug bust. The two still share the story at every festival they play together. He made his bones as the frontman for underground legends The Rugburns, who burned rubber crisscrossing the continent on marathon tours and still pop up once in a while for the rare and quickly sold out reunion gig.\n\nIn 20 years since his full-length solo debut, One Left Shoe, he blessed the world\u2019s ears with twelve solo records, spanning the acclaimed 2010 Dreamhouse and most recently Folk Singer in 2015. NPR summed it up best, \u201cCritics and fans alike now regard Poltz as a talented and prolific songwriter.\u201d By 2016, he survived a stroke, endured anything the music industry could throw at him, and still performed like \u201c280 days a year.\u201d\n\nHowever, he still never lived in Nashville, which represents a turning point in the story and the genesis of his 2018 Red House Records debut, Shine On\u2026\n\n\u201cMy girlfriend Sharon sold the condo we were living in, and I was ready to live in a van, which seemed like a good idea for one night\u2014then I decided I wanted a kitchen and a closet,\u201d he admits. \u201cSharon wanted to move to Nashville, because she thought it would be good for me. It caused a huge fight. I\u2019d been in San Diego since 1980, and that\u2019s where I cut my musical teeth. I thought I\u2019d never leave. In fact, at the height of our fight, I said, \u2018I\u2019m not leaving San Diego. I am San Diego!\u2019 This makes me laugh now. As soon as I got to Nashville, I immediately knew I wanted to make a record in \u2018Music City\u2019.\u201d\nSo, the man who once protested \u201cI am San Diego\u201d made Shine On in his new home of Nashville with one of its elder statesman behind the board, Will Kimbrough [Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell]. Holing up in the studio at Kimbrough\u2019s house, nothing would be off limits. Together, they unlocked the kind of creative chemistry you only hear about in band bios\u2014but for real.\n\n\u201cI respect Will so much, and I\u2019d always wanted to work with him,\u201d says Steve. \u201cLike two mad scientists, we just took our time and had fun. We didn\u2019t overthink things. Everything felt organic. We ate soul food and drank lots of really good coffee. We tried out weird sounds, and the songs always started with voice and guitar\u2014no click track, just how I\u2019d play them. I road tested many of them, and they were ripe for the picking when recording time came around.\u201d\n\nEvoking themes of \u201chope, love, contemplation, celebration of Wednesday, pharmacists, and the fact that windows are not inanimate objects and they sometimes have conversations with each other,\u201d the record represents Steve at his most inspired and insightful. The opener and title track \u201cShine On\u201d pairs a delicate vocal with lithely plucked acoustic strings as he urges, \u201cShine on, shine on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe song was a gift,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI woke up really early in Encinitas, California at Sharon\u2019s sister\u2019s house. The sun was just coming up. I was all alone in perfect solitude. My guitar was there. The sky was gorgeous. I wrote it as a poem. Everyone always told me, \u2018Never start a record with a really slow song.\u2019 So, seeing that I have O.D.D. (Oppositional Defiance Disorder), I started my record with one. I love the mood it sets. It\u2019s almost like my mission statement, trying to find some semblance of positivity and light in a sometimes ruthless world.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cPharmacist,\u201d rustling guitar and harmonica propel a tale of \u201cthis dude having a crush on his pharmacist.\u201d It also serves as an extension of his friendship with neighbor Scot Sax\u2014with whom he shares the podcast \u201cOne Hit Neighbors\u201d (since they\u2019ve both had one hit song). Meanwhile, he joined forces with Molly Tuttle on \u201c4th of July,\u201d which, of course, came to life on the 3rd of July. \u201cBallin On Wednesday\u201d drew its title and chorus from a diner checkout girl (with a super cool gold tooth) who Steve paid with a $100 bill and she replied, \u201cOooh, ballin\u2019 on a Wednsday.\u201d The finale \u201cAll Things Shine\u201d skips along on sparse instrumentation as Steve sends a message.\n\n\u201c\u2018All Things Shine\u2019 came about after one of the many mass shootings on this planet,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI was feeling overwhelmed. So, I wanted to put my feelings into words and melody. I was thinking that even if we\u2019re feeling hopeless that there is still beauty. All things shine in their own way.\u201d\nWho could contend that?\n\nIn the end, for everything you can call him \u201csearcher, smartass, movie freak, lover of technology, news junkie, baseball fan to nth degree, lapsed catholic who still believes in god even though all his friends are atheists and think he\u2019s an idiot, and maker of fun,\u201d you might just call Steve that little light in the dark we all need in this day and age.\n\nOr Nashville\u2019s Canadian Jiminy Cricket\u2026\n\n\u201cI hope Shine On makes listeners smile and feel welcome, and they want to share it with their friends,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cMusic means energy to me. All things. It connects us, makes us move, helps us relax, and inspires us to change things up.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Svetlana ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9301408.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9808, 40.7648], "Date": "Sat Apr 4 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-04", "Genre": "Jazz, Sophisti-pop, Swing", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Center for the Arts at New Jersey City University  CANCELLED", "moreBioInfo": "\"Breakfast at Tiffany's Meets Some Like It Hot\" (Lucid Culture)\n\"Outstanding vocalist\" (Wall Street Journal)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "201 Union Ln, Brielle, NJ 08730", "Artist": "Thomas Vincent ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9456719.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.052411, 40.107332], "Date": "Sat Apr 4 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-04", "Genre": "Little Falls, New Jersey", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Pig & Parrot", "moreBioInfo": "Singer/Songwriter from NJ.

While other children dreamt of being astronauts or building rocket ships out of mega blocks, Dan was ready to jam on stage with the greatest of the great.\n\nWhen he got a bit older, he accompanied his brother Michael to Sam Ash music store, where he needed to pick up a saxophone for middle school band. They may have been at the store for his brother, but that day will forever be the one where Dan\u2019s daycare dreams began to grow into a reality.\n\nThere, standing in the guitar department, Dan was encouraged to pick up and strum along to the beat inside his soul, and his passion began to take shape.\n\nAs years passed, Dan became more and more accustomed to the guitar, and fell more and more in love with performing. He surrounded himself with mentors from diverse backgrounds \u2013 Dennis DelGaudio (Billy Joel), Chris Justino (Broadway), Artie Blaurock (Sweet Revenge, Dorian Grey, Needulhed), & Rick Stone (Jazz Guitar at Hofstra University). Each of these amazing talents provided him with a unique perspective on guitar stylings and teachings.\n\nTaking that knowledge to the next level, Dan joined the likes of Indie/Alternative Rock band Face the King (CI Records) and performed across the continental US for a multitude of shows, including a full leg of Vans Warped Tour, Rockstar UPROAR Festival, the main stage at the CBGB Festival in Times Square, NY (with Billy Idol and Jane\u2019s Addiction!), as well as the world\u2019s largest music festival - Summerfest, in Milwaukee, WI.\n\nFace the King was chosen as a National Finalist for the Ernie Ball Vans Warped Tour competition alongside PVRIS, and are three-time winners of the Ernie Ball Battle of the Bands. Their full-length album, \u201cOnce More Is All I Am,\u201d was released in November of 2017.\n\nDan is also collaborating on songwriting and performing with two up-and-coming Alt/Indie groups, Don\u2019t Believe in Ghosts (Forward Thinking Records), and A Second Life. These bands have received high acclaim, as shown by their multiple plays on retail radio playlists and on Spotify, national plays on Sirius XM Radio, and a number of live shows including Bowery Ballroom, The Paramount, NYC Marathon, and an upcoming appearance at the world-famous South By Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, TX.\n\nIn 2017, Don\u2019t Believe In Ghosts released their debut full-length album, \u201cGive it Meaning\u201d, and A Second Life released their first four singles, \u201cCivil War\u201d, \u201cJust Whisper\u201d, \u201cBeautiful Distraction\u201d, and \u201cYou\u2019re Missing From Me\u201d.\n\nTo take a listen to the alt-vibes of Face the King, Don\u2019t Believe in Ghosts, and A Second Life, check them out on Spotify:\n\nFace the King: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Rg22QdAlQc1KrhWuNwGWq\n\nDon\u2019t Believe in Ghosts: https://open.spotify.com/artist/5uLKc9jyRkcyoTNF1JLWe1\n\nA Second Life: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1FJj42V3fVy1sdxs0OgTQ5\n\nAs a session musician, Dan has performed with countless artists from different Genres \u2013 Robbie Rosen (American Idol), MarissaAnn (The Voice), Alessandra Guercio (The Voice), The Frankel Sisters (X Factor), Julia Lambert, Nicoletta Slapo, Sammi Rae Murciano, The 00\u2019s Band, and with Hank Lane Music Productions for weddings in the tri-state area. As a result he has shared the stage with those who top the charts today and in years past, some who include \u2013 Shawn Mendes, Ed Sheeran, Kings of Leon, Jake Miller, Coheed & Cambria, Shinedown, Staind, Billy Idol, Jane\u2019s Addiction, and countless others.\n\nLiving a life of performance, especially that of music, means you never quite know what or where your next gig will be. To steal a line from Dan\u2019s favorite movie, Forrest Gump \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know if we each have a destiny, or if we\u2019re just floating around accidental \u2013 like on a breeze. But I think maybe it\u2019s both.\u201d\n\nIn Dan\u2019s case, it is most definitely a touch of both. A destiny come true, thanks to years of training and mentorships, as well as a dream that started at the age of 5 and blossomed into today\u2019s amazing career.\nBut the dream doesn\u2019t stop here. Dan DelVecchio is always looking for new opportunities to expand his horizons in music, to follow the breeze and see where it takes him. Are you interested in learning from or playing with Dan?
