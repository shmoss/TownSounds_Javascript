I flunked out of college. I learned to play the guitar, lived on the beach, lived in the French Quarter, finally got laid, and didn't go to Viet Nam. I got back into school, started a band, got a job on Bourbon Street, graduated from college, flunked my draft physical, broke up my band, and went out on the road solo. I signed a record deal, got married, moved to Nashville, had my guitars stolen, bought a Mercedes, worked at Billboard Magazine, put out my first album, went broke, wrecked the Mercedes, got divorced, and moved to Key West. I sang and worked on a fishing boat, went totally crazy, did a lot of dope, met the right girl, made another record, had a hit, bought a boat, and sailed away to the Carribean. I started another band, worked the road, had my second and last hit, bought a house in Aspen, started spending summers in New England, got married, broke my leg three times in one year, had a baby girl, made more records, bought a bigger boat, and sailed away to St. Barts. I got seperated from the right girl, sold the boat, sold the house in Aspen, moved back to Key West, worked the road, and made more records. I rented an apartment in Paris, went to Brazil for Carnival, learned to fly, went into therapy, quit doing dope, bought my first seaplane, flew all over the Carribean, almost got a second divorce, moved to Malibu for more therapy, and got back with the right girl. I worked the road, moved back to Nashville, took off in an F-14 from an aircraft carrier, bought a summer home on Long Island, had another baby girl. I found the perfect seaplane and moved back to Florida. Cameron Marley joined me in the house of women. I built a home on Long Island, crashed the perfect seaplane, lived through it thanks to Navy training, tried to slow down a little, woke up one morning and I was looking at fifty, trying to figure what comes next. You have to take the best from whatever the situation is and go on. That's the whole point of the music to me. All through American history populist singers and humorists have served as the nation's tickle spot, people like Will Rogers and Mark Twain. I see myself in that vein and fulfilling that sort of responsibility. I give people a few shots. It's as much a satirical pinprick as anything else. You just have to remind people of the day-to-day funny things. When I write songs, I look for interesting little innuendoes or pieces of situations everybody has experienced.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mega Ran ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8796843.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Hip-hop, Soul, Video Music, Chiptunes", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"Random's proven he can excel in storytelling, punchlines, poignancy, freestyling and, well, pretty much any other way you can measure an MC.\" - LA Weekly\n\nMega Ran, aka Raheem Jarbo of Philadelphia is arguably the world's most well known video-game influenced performance artist.

The multi-million selling country icon is set to embark on a tour commemorating the 30th anniversary of his groundbreaking debut album Killin\u2019 Time, which all but altered the landscape of country music. Three decades later, Clint remains humble as ever about the massive influence he has had on the genre.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really feel like I was leading a change in country music,\u201d Clint remarks. \u201cIt just felt like big success to me. I would hear things like, \u2018So-and-so is going to record, and they\u2019re using their own band because you did.\u2019 Or, \u2018So-and-so wants to write more of their own songs, because you did.\u2019 But I don\u2019t feel like I changed anything, other than contributing my work to the big picture. It\u2019s hard to look at myself and see the impact I\u2019ve had. I do know that my songs have touched a lot of people.\u201d\n\nIf Black won\u2019t say it outright, his staggering career speaks for itself. His is one of the most storied careers in modern music. Black surged to superstardom as part of the fabled Class of '89, reaching #1 with five consecutive singles from his triple-platinum debut, Killin' Time. He followed that with the triple-platinum Put Yourself in My Shoes, and then a string of platinum and gold albums throughout the '90s. Perhaps most impressively, Clint wrote or co-wrote every one of his more than three dozen chart hits, including \"A Better Man,\" \"Where Are You Now,\" \"When My Ship Comes In,\" \"A Good Run of Bad Luck,\" \"Summer's Comin',\" \"Like the Rain\" and \"Nothin' But the Taillights,\" part of a catalog that produced 22 #1 singles and made him one of the most successful singer/songwriters of the modern era. Along the way, he\u2019s earned more than a dozen gold and platinum awards in the U.S. and Canada, landed nearly two dozen major awards and nominations, won a GRAMMY Award, countless Country Music Association, American Music Awards and Academy of Country Music Awards, as well as a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nRaised in the suburbs of Houston, Texas, Clint Black is the youngest of four brothers. He began performing with brother, Kevin at the family\u2019s backyard barbecues. After high school, he spent 10 years on the local nightclub circuit and in 1989, he led a movement of young talent that transformed country music leading into the \u201890s.\n\nIn 2004, he scaled the top of the charts by trading lines with Buffett, Alan Jackson, George Strait, Toby Keith and Kenny Chesney on the Hank Williams classic \u201cHey Good Looking.\u2019\u201d He contributed \u201cThe Great Mississippi Flood\" to the 2005 post-Katrina charity album Hurricane Relief: Come Together Now. He released albums in 2004, 2005 and 2007.\n\nHis interest in releasing new music waned when his record label closed its doors in 2008. He explains, \u201cI had interest from major companies to sign deals, but declined\u201d.\nClint Black has hardly been idle since then. He\u2019s written and produced songs for Hasbro\u2019s children\u2019s shows and in 2010 and 2012 starred in the films Flicka 2 and Flicka: Country Pride, the latter with his wife and daughter.\n\nIn 2013, the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain began marketing an album of Black\u2019s hits, which continues to sell strongly and in early 2015, he collaborated with Joe Nichols on a Superstar Duets NBC-TV special for the Academy of Country Music.\nIn 2015 released On Purpose, his first studio album of new material in nearly a decade. He dedicated the album to his father, who passed away in 2012.\n\n\u201cMy dad was a huge country fan and is the first reason I listen to country music. He is probably the reason I\u2019m a songwriter today. He was my introduction to \"who\u2019s behind the music\". I grew up wanting to be the writer behind the song. That really all started with him.\u201d\n2018 was a particularly busy year for the Class of \u201889 alum. Always finding ways to challenge himself creatively, Clint produced his first ever holiday musical, titled Looking For Christmas, which focuses on family, love, and the magic of Christmas. It\u2019s expected to tour in 2019.\n\n\u201cThis has been in the works for a while now and it was great to see the audience reaction. Working with James Sasser has been both a blessing and a learning experience and I believe that the story is relatable to many Americans, both young and old.\u201d\nNow, with the 30th anniversary of Killin\u2019 Time approaching, Clint has earned the right to sit back, and let his body of work speak for itself.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jeff Lane ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10336188.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Folk, Folk Rock, Americana, Alt-country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Combining soul-infused folk with a country-blues edge, Tennessee native Jeff Lane puts big stories to song from a common man's point of view.

This is due to his well-known ability to work with any genre of music, or combination of multiple genres at one time, to produce dynamic and high energy music sets. In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture. As the resident DJ since 2004 of some of Vegas\u2019 hottest clubs and lounges including Rum Jungle, Jet Nightclub & Koi Nightclub inside of the Planet Hollywood. Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip. Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cWEST COAST WEDNESDAYS\u201d EVERY WEDNESDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

They have pushed forward with a passion, and unrelenting drive that will see Renegade Station become a name that anyone hearing their unique pop and rock-infused brand of country music is unlikely to forget.\nOriginally known as Domino, the band came together almost accidentally as husband and wife duo of singer/bassist Luanne and guitarist Russell Carl began attending and performing at a town variety show in Stettler, not long after moving to the rural Alberta community. There they met guitarist/vocalist Kent Nixon and drummer Scott McKnight at the popular event and decided to create a band to play local dances and parties becoming the \u2018go to\u2019 act on the circuit.\n\u201cWe were the backing band at this event and decided to take the show on the road, playing a lot of rodeo dances and weddings. But after a few years we realized we had something special. We just gelled as musicians and our voices harmonized so well together that we all just felt we needed to do more. So, we acquired ourselves a professional manager and began recording some originals and some songs that were gifted to us,\u201d said Luanne.\nTheir new name is symbolic of the group\u2019s unconventional approach to their music and sense of independence. They are unabashed about injecting their original music and the songs presented to them by other noted songwriters with healthy doses of pop and classic rock nuances \u2013 with a focus on lushly produced and beautiful layered vocal harmonies which owe as much to Fleetwood Mac as they do to Lady Antebellum.\nThe \u201cStation\u201d part of their name is a nod to vintage working steam train that is a tourist attraction in Stettler and which is a throwback to the region\u2019s pioneering past. Therefore, a name that is reverent towards tradition, but which also alludes to a desire to go one\u2019s own way is ideal for the band approaches their craft.\nAs proof of Renegade Station\u2019s commitment to excellence, for the recording of Along for the Ride, they worked with respected industry veteran Johnny Gasparic (Gord Bamford, George Canyon, Snoop Dogg) at Dave Temple\u2019s MCC Recording Studio in Calgary. It was the second time working with Gasparic, but this time around Luanne said he became more integral to the creative process as well as the recording process.\n\u201cWe collaborated a lot more with him on the production side and it was awesome. He brings an amazing background and experience with him. He knows that we are very much a vocal band and a harmony band, and he really helped to emphasize that, but was also able to get us to do some things vocally that we hadn\u2019t done before. He really got us to relax and open up. I don\u2019t think we have ever sounded this good,\u201d she said.\nThe lead-off single, Who\u2019s Gonna Love Me Tonight, fits into the more adventurous approach that is Renegade Station\u2019s hallmark. Sung by Kent who shares lead vocal duties with Luanne, it\u2019s a mature, somewhat saucy but very true-to-life take on modern romance.\n\u201cWe were really drawn to the song at first because of the amazing harmonies, but then once we got a sense of the meaning and message we knew we had to record it. It\u2019s a little different and a little more risqu\u00e9 than a traditional country romantic song. It\u2019s not the normal \u2018I love you and you love me\u2019 song. It\u2019s a little more mature and realistic. Who is going to go home with who? Who is the strong person in the song, and who is the one going to just give in to the temptation of the moment,\u201d Luanne said.\nDon\u2019t Hold Your Breath was penned primarily by Nashville-based Canadian singer/songwriter Jaida Dreyer and, again, the breathtakingly infectious harmonies fit the Renegade Station sound so well, they could not resist putting it on Along for the Ride.\n\u201cThe song has this Little Big Town vibe, with an incredible melody and when we first harmonized together to the song we all just looked at each other with these amazed expressions. It is such a good song for us to really show off not only our country influences but how we can really bring that together with our pop and rock background. And I personally love this song because it\u2019s about being a strong woman,\u201d she said.\nProving that there is true musical versatility in Renegade Station, the song Rodeo Road is written by Joni Delaurier and pays tribute to the western rodeo lifestyle, which has special meaning for Nixon that comes across in his passionate vocal performance.\n\u201cKent\u2019s grandfather is in the Canadian Professional Rodeo Hall of Fame. His father in law is in the Hall of Fame. His three brothers in laws are Canadian Pro Rodeo Champion\u2019s and there is a long line of cowboys and rodeo competitors in his family. That song was so special to him and we all loved it too and wanted it there as a sort of throwback to that gritty traditional country sound that we all grew up with. It represents a big part of the Alberta mystique and the importance of rural life, the rodeo circuit and the country dances that are part of so many people\u2019s lives here,\u201d Luanne said.\nThe rock-solid foundation that was built as Domino is not being shunted aside as the talented quartet moves forward. Renegade Station\u2019s legacy is etched deep into the firmament of the western Canadian music scene and that can never be taken from them. In recent years they have won back to back Association of Country Music in Alberta, as Group of the Year (2015 and 2016) as well as the ACMA Fan\u2019s Choice of the Year in 2015. They also garnered a CCMA nomination for songwriter of the year for their tune 2:15 and Luanne was also nominated for CCMA Bass Player of the Year for 2016.\nThe band has shared the stage with a who\u2019s who of Canadian and international country music luminaries, from George Canyon and Carolyn Dawn Johnson, to David Lee Murphy, Emerson Drive, and Bobby Wills.\nAlong for the Ride is a bold statement by a collection of talented musicians and songwriters that is infused with authenticity, impressive vocal performances and insistent melodies that will stick with you for days.\nAnd with this impressive collection of new songs, a live show that never fails to enchant and entertain, and an unparalleled creative drive, Renegade Station is truly poised to break through to a national and international stage.", "otherInfo": "Joining us tonight for Match Game will be Rob and James from the amazing group, The Dungarees!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mari\u00e1n Oviedo ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Wengie ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Joel Dasilva ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CantStopTheBlues"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alex Lucero & The Live Again Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9696432.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Soul, Alternative Rock, Funk, Blues, Southern Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "For over 6 years Live Again has been portraying their love of music to fans and audience members all around California.

For all those years of effort, Rick made a truly spectacular arrival in 1992: In less than twelve months, he rose from relative obscurity to become one of the biggest names in Australian pop music, dominating the upper reaches of that country's charts for most of the year and making a high-profile debut in several countries overseas. With Epic Records' U.S. release of Heaven Knows, Rick hopes to keep the fire burning.\n\n\"I'm really hoping that the album does well there,\" he says. \"A lot of my musical heroes are American, and of course the album was largely written and recorded there as well. But I don't have all my hopes pinned on my first album becoming a huge hit in America. I'm going to make many more albums and hopefully many more songs that people can get into. As long as I can gain a foothold, I'll be happy.\"\n\nNo doubt Rick would be pleased to match the success he enjoyed in Australia, where in April of last year Heaven Knows entered the charts at No. 3 and remained in the Top 40 for the remainder of 1992. The album soared on the strength of its first two singles, both of which broke the Australian Top 5: the rousing \"Not A Day Goes By,\" and the title track, an ethereal ballad with piano accompaniment that calls for the return of a lost love.\n\nSongcraft and sensuality fuse together in Heaven Knows to portray a world of stormy and rapturous love, regret and rejuvenation. Whatever the mood, Rick Price is an insightful pop storyteller, able to turn a musical phrase and illuminate a simple but subtle truth. \"What's Wrong with That Girl\" is a bluesy outback rocker with biting guitars that seem to give warning of a \"dangerous attraction,\" while \"Life Without You\" surges with the anguish of words left unsaid. \"A House Divided\" is propelled by its uplifting, gospel-tinged chorus; the haunting \"Fragile\" is an acoustic fireside ode to a distant angel in the night. Rick had a hand in co-writing every song on Heaven Knows with the sole exception of the tenth track, a cover of the Left Banke classic \"Walk Away Renee.\"\n\nRick is now preparing to meet the challenge of promoting his music, a process with which he is already well familiar. In the wake of a month-long Australian tour last August, \"Heaven Knows\" was released as a single in 23 international territories and supported by literally hundreds of TV appearances, press interviews, and in-stores throughout Europe and Asia. Over a span of six months, Rick made three separate trips to Europe, as well as several side trips to Asia: In one 36-hour stopover in Manila, he squeezed in six TV spots, two radio interviews, and a handful of press interviews.\n\nThe results of this sustained public relations blitz were truly the stuff of dreams. In Malaysia, \"Heaven Knows\" held the top spot for four consecutive weeks, while \"Not A Day Goes By\" peaked close behind in the Top 5. In the Philippines, \"Heaven Knows\" sat at No. 1 for all of November and December while making strong chart showings in other Asian markets. The album charted in Norway and Switzerland, and Rick's inspiring rendition of \"Walk Away Renee\" breached the Top 40 in Germany.\n\n\"It was an exhausting experience,\" Rick recalls of the extensive touring, \"but it was stimulating at the same time. It was all new to me, going to places I'd never been and doing things I'd never done, so I certainly didn't get tired of it. I particularly enjoyed going into radio stations around the world and just picking up my guitar and singing. I also played at a lot of press conferences in Asia. When you do these things on your own, they can be very intimidating--it throws you back on your skills as an entertainer. I learned a lot from it.\"\n\nRick closed 1992 on another high note when he won Australia's prestigious APRA award for Song of the Year with \"Heaven Knows.\" Back on the artist's home turf, the album continues to garner sustained Australian sales--owing, in large part, to the warm reception given Rick's first full-length Australian tour last November.\n\nAs part of a new and hungry breed of dedicated, internationally conscious rock musicians, Rick Price maintains his position as one of the hottest acts in his homeland. He looks forward to gracing the American musical landscape with his inventive and sincere brand of pop rock. The story of Rick Price, \"overnight sensation,\" is only just beginning with Heaven Knows.", "otherInfo": "We've got a really special night planned for you tonight (in Nashville)/this afternoon (in Australia).

It only took eight years of waiting for one of the most unique artists to finally deliver a new dose of contemporary electro pyrotechnics and a worthy successor to the smashing Total. During those eight years, SebastiAn successfully completed a 360\u00b0 turn. Plus, it\u2019s been eight years of putting his talent to the good use of others (Frank Ocean, Philippe Katerine, Charlotte Gainsbourg) to help him get to where he wants to be today. From European electro to American R&B via classic pop, Thirst sets ablaze all genres. His taste for explosive mechanisms (like his well-known \u201cturbine\u201d techno sub-genre label-mates at Ed Banger) made Total an elegantly revolutionary debut album that captivatingly took things to the extreme, while being as frightening as a ticking bomb. But now, the wait is over. Thirst bursts forward providing an amazing opening to brand new worlds. This 14-track adventure narrates the journey of how he mastered machines, his own demons and even several time zones.\n\n\u201cThe general approach to this record corresponds to the time when Frank Ocean called me in Paris, telling me I had to be in Los Angeles the next day to work alongside him,\u201d reveals SebastiAn. \u201cAt the same time, I\u2019d met Charlotte Gainsbourg to produce her latest album. So I found myself working with these two opposing personalities: on one side you\u2019ve got Frank Ocean, who\u2019s ultra charismatic and fanciful, while on the other, Charlotte Gainsbourg is both an introvert yet so openly real. When Charlotte moved to New York, Frank landed in London, and so the work process suddenly switched. I found this really interesting. My record came about from all the encounters I made going between these two projects.\u201d The energy from such contrasts brought this project to life, provoking SebastiAn to call upon an impressive list of artists to feature on Thirst (Syd from The Internet, Mayer Hawthorne, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Allan Kingdom, Sevdaliza, Cautious Clay, Sunni Col\u00f2n, Sparks, Gallant and Loota). \u201cFrom Ed Banger to Jean-Louis Costes and Katerine, or Frank Ocean to Charlotte Gainsbourg, my music has always looked to build bridges,\u201d outlines the self-confessed fan of DJ Premier, Giorgio Moroder and Suicide, who\u2019s managed to bring different styles together as one on this record. From this head-on collision between cold European techno and the warm tones of R&B, hip-hop and American gospel comes a series of explosions which progressively topple towards unchartered territories. With a certain Slavic melancholy that\u2019s an homage to his roots, SebastiAn makes the single Beograd evolve from metronomic dirty disco to a melody of cinematographic stature worthy of De Roubaix, entangled in a Chopin-esque lamenting sonata. The art of SebastiAn is certainly the art of suspense. He\u2019s like a tightrope walker, juggling a balancing act from the intimate to the epic (just take Run For Me which is a tour de force), and from minimalism to baroque to create a mystical form of electronic music. Thirst has such a contemporary edge to it, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s not aiming for a total collision between music\u2019s major current trends (electro and R&B), but in fact he\u2019s looking to rearrange the rules, settling alight the history of pop (The Beach Boys-eque Better Now) and rock (Handcuffed To A Parking Meter reaching dizzying heights with his idols Sparks), and a certain classicism in a recurring dialogue between strings, piano and knob-twiddling machines.\n\nIn 2011, for the cover work for Total, Jean-Baptiste Mondino captured SebastiAn as a modern-day Narcissus, photographing the musician kissing his alter ego. Eight years later, the same photographer once again depicts the artist with his double, however this time the love affair has ended and it\u2019s fists up ready for a fight. To sum up this game of metaphors, Thirst is a beefed-up declaration of love - not of SebastiAn to himself, but to the world around him. Thirst leaves you thirsty for more.", "otherInfo": "Meditate with Stuart"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SK Shlomo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10359673.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Beatbox, Electronic", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "After collaborating with Ed Sheeran, Bjork and Damon Albarn, award winning singer-songwriter, beatboxer, producer & live looping technologist SK Shlomo's acclaimed debut solo album 'Surrender' is out now raising #MentalHealthAwareness: http://skshlomo.com/listen", "otherInfo": "This Thursday, and for the next 6 Thursdays at 2pm BST, I'm launching a weekly livestream called Homeskool Beatbox Adventures to help isolated families and raise funds for NHS Charities Together.\n\nWe're partnering with 80 music venues to simulcast the livestream to thousands of homes worldwide, with weekly special guests including Basement Jaxx, Bastille, Bill Bailey, Jason Mraz, KT Tunstall and Radio 1\u2019s Dr Radha helping me to raise a target of \u00a32500 to help frontline staff, patients and families affected by COVID19.\n\nThe show will be livestreamed on our brand new beatboxadventures.com website, on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nAnd you can be part of the show!\n\nEach week I am inviting a virtual studio audience of up to 50 lucky families to join me in our digital theatre - also known as the \u2018Zoom Room\u2019.

In 2019 he released his biggest yet, 'Milk It' with Carla Monroe, landing him a first play on Radio 1 by Diplo, a selection by Stella McCartney to soundtrack her catwalk at Paris Fashion Week and major syncs such as O2 and Nickelodeon, resulting in a spot at the Billboard Dance charts. Kicking things off for the new decade, Rony has since made his debut on Kitsun\u00e9 Musique with \u2018Drip\u2019, soundtracked a new commercial for Yves Saint Laurent and collaborated with the one and only GFOTY of PC Music on \u2018Mile High\u2019.\n\nWith humble beginnings throwing parties in his parents\u2019 house (and getting busted for doing so), Rony Rex has been an extrovert on the decks since day zero.

A child of immigrant parents - a child of Brooklyn, NY - Garz\u00f3n-Montano\u2019s aesthetic is an extension of his French-Colombian heritage, a pastiche of Bach sonatas, cumbia records, and the machine gun funk that echoes to this day from behind half-rolled tints up and down Nostrand Ave. His mother, a member of the Philip Glass ensemble in the 1990\u2019s, instilled within him a painstaking attention to detail that remains a hallmark of his process. \u201cMy mother is the reason I love music,\u201d he says. Her rigorous classical instruction served as his creative engine as he honed his skills over the course of years in the lab, copping Stevie's changes, studying Prince's lyrics, and absorbing the beat theses of Timbaland, Dilla, and Pete Rock. Jard\u00edn comes on the heels of three intense years of touring, writing and recording. Soon after the 2014 release of his debut EP, Bishoun\u00e9: Alma del Huila, Gabriel was invited out on the road by rock legend Lenny Kravitz, as direct support on 23 concerts across Europe. The day after playing Wembley Arena, he received a call notifying him that his song \"6 8\" would be sampled by Drake on his full-length If You're Reading This, It's Too Late. The months following these cosigns Garz\u00f3n-Montano was featured at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, and Austin City Limits, and on back-to-back tours with English indie-rockers Glass Animals and Stones Throw label mate Mayer Hawthorne. In 2016, he returned to Waterfront Studios in Hudson, NY, to record Jard\u00edn with his mentor, analog guru Henry Hirsch. A capable multi-instrumentalist, Gabriel tracked drums, bass, guitar, piano, and synthesizers direct to 2\" tape, adding percussion, digital programming, and several layers of his own vocals to create a lush sonic environment that recalls a contemporary, streetwise Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants. \"I wanted to make music that would remind people how beautiful life is - how delicate their hearts are,\" says Garz\u00f3n-Montano. \"A garden is full of life, and growth, and beauty. I named the album Jard\u00edn hoping for it to create a space for healing when people put it on. I've always wanted to make music that is healing, comforting, and funky.\" This intention is, perhaps, what has always attracted listeners to his music. Fans of Bishoun\u00e9 will find familiar ground in the organic sounds and impressionist narratives of Jard\u00edn: the Moog-heavy \"Fruitflies\" reads as a lyrical epilogue to \"Keep on Running,\" while \"The Game\" brings the folkloric percussion of \"Me Alone\" home from Cartagena to Crown Heights. The enduring choruses of \"Sour Mango,\" \"Crawl,\" and \"My Balloon\" exhibit a melodic and compositional craftsmanship reminiscent of the fan favorite \"Everything is Everything,\" confirming Garz\u00f3n-Montano's innate pop sensibilities, and his indisputable knack for fusing a wide range of classic influences and cutting-edge ideas to create a sound all his own. https://soundcloud.com/gabriel-garzonmontano", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Craig Mabbit ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Chip Richter ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10389216.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Youngstown, Ohio", "Time": "4:05 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Chip Richter is an Award Winning singer-songwriter for kids & families performing in schools, libraries, churches, theaters and festivals.

This fresh-faced native of Southampton, England, was merely playing into his love of funkadelic hip-hop and crooning urban stylings when he started writing songs as a teenager. His love for Terence Trent D'Arby, Sisqo, and Donnell Jones allowed him to put his creative love for art, culture, and history into a musical beat all his own. And the new millennium belonged to him and garage had been redefined.\n\nBorn Craig Ashley David on May 5, 1981, David was slicing and dicing ragga and R&B on the local station PCRS 106.5FM and found himself playing club gigs prior to rubbing elbows with some of music's finest. It was during this time he hooked with Artful Dodger's Mark Hill. After winning a national writing competition, Craig was more than ready to start producing with Hill. His big break came when he put his own additives on Damage's \"I'm Ready,\" a B-side to \"Wonderful Tonight.\" Soon thereafter he remixed his own version of Human League's \"Human\" and started himself a regular spot in area clubs during the weekends. \"Rewind\" was another underground smash, specifically a definitive move for David. His respect for Stevie Wonder, Faith Evans, and R. Kelly was most apparent, however his own vocal talent was beginning to shine. He and Hill's specialty show on Capital Radio provided another outlet for David to shape his musical work of genius. \"Fill Me In\" proved yet another hit, shooting straight to number one in summer 2000. David was now the youngest British male solo artist to have a number one single. He was 19-years-old.\n\nA deal with Wildstar Records in the U.K. sparked toward the end of the summer as \"Re-Rewind\" and \"7 Days\" gained praise in late November. A stateside agreement with Atlantic also led to more global hype. He had sold 3.5 million records worldwide and garage was finally becoming massive overseas and it was David's debut Born to Do It that was at the head.\n\nBut not all were pulling for this R&B prodigy. Aside from winning three awards at the MOBO's in October, Craig David walked away empty handed at the 2000 Brit Awards in February 2001. He was up for six nominations, including Best British Male Solo Artist, Best British Newcomer, and Best British Single for \"7 Days,\" but industry politics fell into operation. Many mainstream stars came to David's defense, artists such as Elton John, U2, and Robbie Williams, professing their disgust for the ill recognition for David and his musical efforts in the past year. Death threats soon followed for the superstar in spring 2001 as he took the stage in a show in London. An anonymous caller claimed a soldier would injure David with tear gas and hand grenades. Still, his record sales continued to soar in the U.K. with sales of Born to Do It increasing over 100 percent after his dismal beginning months of 2001. He bombared American Shores with a deal with Atlantic and released Born to Do It stateside in summer 2001. Mainstream radio flocked to him immediately. Missy Elliott, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, and Usher called themselves fans.\n\nThe next year, things didn't simmer down for the now international pop star. Craig David returned with a sophomore effort Slicker Than Your Average in November 2002. This particular album saw a much grittier side from David. Debut single \"What's Your Flava?\" also became one of the year's hottest singles.\n\nIn 2005 he released his 3rd album \"The Story Goes...\", the first single of the album, \"All The Way\", returned him to the top three, and the second single, \"Don't Love You No More (I'm Sorry)\", tied with \"7 Days\" as his longest running single in the charts since \"Rewind\", spending 15 weeks inside the UK top 75. However, the album's third single, \"Unbelievable\", debuted and peaked at #18 in March 2006.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated with UK rapper Kano on his upcoming album London Town, for the single \"This is the Girl\". The track was released on August 27, 2007 and debuted at #18 on the UK charts.\n\nThe first single \"Hot Stuff\" from the album Trust Me, was released on November 5, 2007 . The single was a top ten hit, whilst the album charted at #18 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\"6 of 1 Thing\", the second single to be taken from Trust Me charted at thirty-nine on the UK Singles Chart, becoming his second lowest charting single to date.\n\nHis UK tour will start in June 2008, details of which can be found on the official website.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Maria Moon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9032628.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Rock Violinist, Video Game Music, Electric Violin, Film Music, Keyboardist, Classical, Covers, Violinist, Cover Band, Violin Live Music", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hello!

We hope Canada will share her with us.\u201d (Hot Indie Music Review) Krystle Dos Santos has taken her experience from the Canadian College of Performing Arts, and transformed it into the beginnings of a career already full of achievements. Unveiling her talents to the public with her 2008 full length self-titled debut, Dos Santos was instantly recognized as a force by the Western Canadian Music Awards, winning the Urban Recording of the Year. That same album charted for six weeks on CJSR FM88\u2019s Urban chart and was top ten on 92.5 The X in Kamloops, BC. One of the single\u2019s from the album even appeared in an Episode of ABC\u2019s Samantha Who? But to simply classify Dos Santos as a recording artist would be neglecting one of the most intriguing aspects of her talents. Whether facing the crowd on her own or with her full ensemble of band-mates as she is more accustomed, Dos Santos uses a sultry tone and eccentric array of melodies to create an intimately magnetic connection with her audience. She is able to further engage her audience by shifting seamlessly through genres, embodying her musical influences-Nina Simone, Etta James, Alicia Keys-culminating into a powerful live experience that fuses jazz, soul, pop, funk and blues into an arena of styles and sounds that takes listeners from mid-20th century Harlem, right up to present day L.A. With key performances at the Edmonton International Jazz Festival, Whistler International Film Festival, and the Honey Jam Showcase in Toronto, Krystle has had many opportunities to put her live shows on full display. She has already toured extensively throughout western Canada, singing stories of pain and love, joy and redemption, all told through a voice that precisely reflects the emotion of her music. It is nearly impossible to be a true fan of Krystle Dos Santos without taking part in the experience she creates with her live performances. Dos Santos completed her second album in the first quarter of 2011. Femme Fatale, as it was aptly titled, again revealed Dos Santos versatility and her ability to capture the audience with an eclectic mix of dance and funk, but always with the soulful jazz vocals for which she has quickly become renowned. Dos Santos\u2019 interpretation of her influences has made it difficult to categorize her style. Compared presently to Jill Scott or Corrine-Bailey Rae or even Erykah Badu, Krystle is able to personalize her sound and message, adding her own character to her music to create a uniquely refreshing sound. Her vibrant personality has been utilized outside of music in various add campaigns and modeling opportunities. It also helps that Krystle is as stunning as she is talented; one of those rare beauties that command attention with little more than a moments glance. But make no mistake, Krystle Dos Santos is a musician first and foremost. With a smoky voice that can fluctuate to fit any style and a live show that demands the audience stand-up and take notice, Dos Santos is ready for the masses to feel her music. She is currently working on her third studio release, and will no doubt continue to strive until her name and her music is known to the world.

Along with Andy Johns (Led Zeppelin and Rolling Stones mixing-engineer) they spent several years creating music together and shopping the material.

After 20 stellar years with Feeder -including 8 gold and platinum albums and over 3 million album sales- for Grant Nicholas that moment came after his band\u2019s sell out show at Brixton Academy on 23rd November 2012. \u201cWhen you have a formula which you know works it can be difficult to stop,\u201d he explains with typical candour. \u201cFeeder is a great band to be in, but it requires a certain head space. I wanted to clear my head for a bit and write some songs, and this album just came along. It felt so natural because there were no expectations.\u201d As with so many of his peers (Noel Gallagher, Damon Albarn) this lifting of the commercial burden sparked an outpouring of fresh music and ideas. Recorded over fourteen months in various studios on both sides of the Atlantic, Yorktown Heights is that rarest of beasts- an album which evokes the carefree spirit of Laurel Canyon in the \u201870\u2019s while also sounding bang up date. Ambitious, largely acoustic, and full of head-spinning melodies, it\u2019s also Grant\u2019s most personal work to date. \u201cI definitely had a 70\u2019s vibe in my head for this record,\u201d he says, citing Nick Drake, Neil Young and James Taylor as inspirations. \u201cI love the fact they weren\u2019t always the best singers, but their songs sounded so believable.\u201d Grant\u2019s ability to match these songwriting legends is clear from opening track \u2018Soul Mates\u2019. A beautiful acoustic lament -which comes with a video shot in Queens Wood, close to Grant\u2019s North London home- it\u2019s a heartfelt hymn of mutual need. \u201cEven though it\u2019s just an acoustic guitar and a vocal, it\u2019s immediately got a reaction from people. It\u2019s easy to criticise simple songs, but if you strike a chord with someone, that\u2019s gold.\u201d A strident \u2018Hitori\u2019 reflects on life, loneliness and relationships. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of my own feelings and what my friends are going through- losing parents, divorces,\u201c says Grant of lyrics like: \u2018Sorrow will find me everywhere I go.\u2019 \u201cI know it sounds awful, but as a songwriter I feed off of that.\u201d If the reflective \u2018Father To Son\u2019 is self-explanatory and the propulsive \u2018Robots\u2019 tackles technology\u2019s insidious grip on our lives, gothic murder ballad \u2018Joan Of Arc\u2019 is a reminder that Grant is also in demand as a songwriter for both rock and pop acts (who shall remain nameless). \u201cThat song is a mixture of influences- everything from Johnny Cash, to spaghetti Westerns to Paris itself. I think it would work perfectly on a film soundtrack. And I\u2019m sure Nick Cave could do a decent version!\u201d \u2018Vampires\u2019 is equally expansive, and acts as a noir-ish nod to his songwriting past. \u201cIt\u2019s about a girl who feels she\u2019s surrounded by the wrong people in the big city. She feels lost and awkward in society. It\u2019s almost a love song.\u2019 Fans of the euphoric, punch-the-air choruses which are Grant\u2019s trademark, meanwhile, will be in raptures on hearing \u2018Hope\u2019 and \u2018Time Stood Still\u2019. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of being anthemic,\u201d he says, citing Tom Petty as inspiration for these stadium-sized interludes. \u201cThere\u2019s a directness to his writing which I love. \u2018Hope\u2019 is about my memories of growing up near Chepstow, on the Welsh borders. When things go wrong in life, with friends or family, you can always go home, and I think everyone can relate to that.\u201d If Yorktown Heights\u2019 lyrics offer up both personal insights and classy ruminations on modern life, its sonic character comes from where the tracks were laid down. While sessions at his own home studio (The Treehouse), Angelic Studios in Banbury and The Crypt (London) were vital staging posts, the album takes its name from the district of upstate New York where the songs came into focus. \u201cThe bulk of it was done at Tiny Pocket in Yorktown Heights with Brian Sperber (Julian Casablancas, Dinosaur Jr) and Sam Miller,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s only about an hour directly north of Manhattan but you feel like you\u2019re in the middle of nowhere.\u201d It was this sense of isolation -surrounded by nothing but woodland and the roar of passing pick-up trucks- which resulted in the sparse but beautiful textures of \u2018Tall Trees\u2019. \u201cWhen I first arrived at the studio it was deep snow,\u201d recalls Grant. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t get out of the house. I was getting cabin fever after a while. \u2018Tall Trees\u2019 came from that. It\u2019s not a redneck area but it\u2019s got that feel, which I think is reflected in the music. In fact, that\u2019s what I call it- redneck indie!\u201d The final piece in the jigsaw came with a mastering session in Los Angeles with Brian \u2018Big Bass\u2019 Gardner, famed for his work with everyone from Alice Cooper to Dr Dre. \u201cI think he\u2019s got a magic button under the desk which suddenly brings a new depth to everything,\u201d says Grant with a grin. \u201cHe gave the record a real \u201970\u2018s warmth, which is so important.\u201d It\u2019s this attention to the smallest sonic details you\u2019d expect from a master craftsman who worked as a studio engineer before Feeder took off. Future plans include intimate live shows, uploading full length visuals for every song online and a new touring band..Right now, though, it\u2019s all about getting the songs a fair hearing. \u201cThis record is very important to me,\u201d he says, explaining that the album is also a family affair- the sleeve illustrations were hand drawn by his nine year old daughter. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time on it and I want people to hear it. And if it takes off, then of course that\u2019s a nice problem to have.\u201d Don\u2019t bet against it.

A characteristically wry yet lyrical, offbeat yet heartfelt paean to his adopted home town - marking 20 years since Napier arrived from his Highland birthplace \u2013 it features freshly-penned, instantly memorable originals alongside classic and contemporary gems from the city\u2019s rich ballad canon. Continuing their fruitful collaboration on VIP, revered UK songsmith Boo Hewerdine reprises his roles as producer and co-writer.\n\nFrom modern-day vignettes like opener \u2018Young Goths In the Necropolis\u2019 - its bittersweet emotional charge evoking a Caledonian Loudon Wainwright - to the tenderly imagined love-story of \u2018The Locarno, Sauchiehall St 1928\u2019, reminiscent of the late great Michael Marra (whose wonderfully whimsical \u2018King Kong\u2019s Visit to Glasgow\u2019 is also covered), the album\u2019s musical map spans shipyards and late-night chippies, wily street veterans and warring football fans, patron saints and musical icons.\n\nOther covers include a terrifically gallus (Scots for \u2018bold, mischievous, cheeky\u2019 - ie quintessentially Glaswegian) version of Hamish Imlach\u2019s \u2018Cod Liver Oil and the Orange Juice\u2019; a dreamily ardent rendering of The Blue Nile\u2019s \u2018A Walk Across the Rooftops\u2019, and a gorgeous new ballad, \u2018Marchtown\u2019, by ex-Delgado Emma Pollock.\n\nWith accompaniment mostly distilled to artful acoustic guitar, plus occasional piano and Donna Maciocia\u2019s delicate backing vocals, Napier\u2019s remarkable voice \u2013 by turns burly, gritty, fierce and forlorn, bitingly acerbic and exquisitely nuanced \u2013 is rightfully foregrounded throughout, capturing scenes and characters as potently as the CD cover image by Pulitzer Prize-winning Magnum photographer Raymond Depardon.\n\nNapier\u2019s fast-growing stature as one of the UK\u2019s most distinctively gifted contemporary folk artists builds on his previous band work with Back of the Moon and The Bar Room Mountaineers, also reflecting his long-time immersion in the vibrant stylistic melting-pot of Glasgow\u2019s world-famous music scene. As promoter of the decade-old Hazy Recollections concert series and founder of the Glasgow Songwriting Festival, he\u2019s been particularly influential in fostering cross-fertilisation between the city\u2019s folk and indie communities.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Benzi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9017067.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Banguers, Classics, Girl Trapz, Mashups, Future Bass, Bootlegs, Bass Music, Moombahton, Jams, Hip-hop, Trap, Twerk, Edits, House, Edats, Dingers", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Benzi is a busy man.

The band\u2019s seventh album, Wildness, their first in seven years, entered the UK charts at Number Two, went gold, and kept them on tour around the world for the best part of 18 months.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gigging time, but also a lot of thinking time.\n\n\u201cWhere did it all go right?\u201d echoes Lighbtody. \u201cNo idea!\u201d the singer and songwriter laughs. \u201cAfter 10 years of no success, no one \u2013 least of all us \u2013 expected us these last 15 years to sell 17 million albums, headline festivals and play to thousands of people all over the world.\u201d\nAdd to that: one billion global track streams, five UK platinum albums, an Ivor Novello award and Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominations. And, in the shape of Chasing Cars, a modern classic recently anointed by the PPL as the most played song on UK radio of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWhen we released Final Straw in 2003, I think there was general goodwill around us from the media,\u201d continues Lightbody, \u201cas people knew the story of the previous 10 years and were kinda glad for us to get a shot on a major label,\" he notes of their move from indie Jeepster (also original home of Belle and Sebastian) to discerning Polydor imprint Fiction. That \u201csea-change\u201d set in motion the next phase of the band\u2019s existence. Still, in music, as in life, nothing is a given. \u201cOf course the good grace of the press is hard won and easy lost, but radio kept on playing us. That\u2019s been the real key to our success, I firmly believe. Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. On those shows we did some of the songs close to how they sound on the Reworked album \u2013 for example, the new version of You\u2019re All I Have came directly out of playing those acoustic shows.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re All I Have is the opening track from 2006\u2019s Eyes Open, the album that also featured Chasing Cars. On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain. Iain came up with the beautiful, John Martyn-style guitar, and his version floored me when I heard it the first time. Iain\u2019s guitar playing has always been a joy to listen to and to have it feature so prominently on this album is just amazing.\"\n\nAlso presented in simple acoustic simplicity is Chocolate, the third single from Final Straw, and produced here in classy, \u201ctime-stopping\u201d style by McDaid. \u201cChocolate has been a live favourite since we released it. It\u2019s a song all Snow Patrol fans know \u2013 I can\u2019t attest that they all love it but they know it!\u201d its co-author laughs. \u201cAnd we wanted to rework the songs that the fans are the most familiar with. There's not much point in reworking songs people don\u2019t really know as there's not really a stark contrast.\u201d\nThat said, \u201cwe will be doing something with the first two albums before the release of Reworked as those two albums do not feature for that same reason,\u201d Lightbody teases.\nWhat of the recent Twitter \u201caccusation\u201d that SP have \u201cdisowned\u201d those albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It\u2019s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2001), because they don\u2019t play the songs live?\n\u201cNot true at all,\u201d he replies with a shake of the head. \u201cWe are very proud of them. It\u2019s just that when we play those songs live they negatively affect the atmosphere of the gig. And as Star Trek taught us: \u2018The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat need to entertain and surprise also informed the approach taken to Called Out In The Dark. The curtain-raiser from 2011's Fallen Empires now comes with an inventive synth throb that echoes the original.\n\u201cI had worried a little that the whole record was getting very downtempo,\u201d admits Lightbody. \u201cThe nature of recording in hotel rooms and dressing rooms is that things will invariably be low-key. Hard to rock out with a family of four in the next hotel room trying to sleep!\n\u201cSo when it came to some of the songs we recorded towards the end of the new album, we wanted to explore a slightly higher tempo \u2013 without, of course, leaning too heavy into the original version. Called Out\u2026 is certainly the closest to the original version of any song on Reworked, but I think distinct enough to warrant its place. It has an electro bent like the original but steers clear of any of its predecessor\u2019s tropes. I asked Iain to lift it up and he sure did.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the three new songs. First up, the lovely, heart-stopping Time Won\u2019t Go Slowly.\n\u201cJohnny and I wrote this in his house in LA. We\u2019re both massive fans of Frank Ocean, so we wanted it to sound like Frank Ocean crossed with Frank Sinatra. All the Franks! It\u2019s a classic crooner track. We just wanted to try something starkly different from anything we have done before.\n\"As for the lyrics, I guess I\u2019ve not written about love for a while and needed a fix,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI like the idea of the inherent tragedy woven into the fabric of time: time speeds up when we're having a great time and slows down when we're miserable. Although it\u2019s all perception, of course, not reality. And I like that, too. That distortion. Our minds are powerful and sometimes terrible things. I guess the song tries to wrap its head around that great cosmic joke. Also it\u2019s just a love song.\"\nThen there\u2019s I Think of Home, a folk-flavoured piano ballad with vivid, evocative and deeply personal lyrics. Lightbody wrote it in 2014, as part of a five-song contribution \u201cto a night dedicated to my greatest literary hero Seamus Heaney when he opened the Seamus Heaney Home Place in Magherafelt. They wanted me to play a few songs at the opening night.\n\u201cI set my own rules for the songs\u2019 content,\" he expands. \"They had to be inspired by what Heaney had been inspired by: home, family, Ireland, The Troubles, hope, the soil\u2026\u201d\nI Think of Home was later considered for inclusion on Wildness, but none of the versions the band tried out in the studio fitted.\n\u201cBut then we went on tour with Wildness and at shows in Ireland and Irish strongholds like Boston, New York, Sydney and Melbourne, I would play I Think Of Home acoustically on my own in the middle of gigs. It would always go down well.\n\u201cSo when it came to Reworked we had lived with the song enough to feel like we could do a great version of it. And Johnny produced a stunning version of it. I had been playing it a certain way for so long it was hard for me to hear it any other way. That can be dangerous \u2013 stagnation can set in. So when that happens you have to let someone you trust take it from you and remake it. So, in the spirit of what we were doing, it was great to get a reworked version of a song that had never even been released.\"\nThe third new song is Made Of Something Different Now, which is quietly sweeping, quietly epic and wholly devastating.\n\u201cOne of my favourite tracks we have done in ages,\" nods Lightbody. \"In keeping with the Reworked attitude of trying new things, it\u2019s unlike much of what we\u2019ve done before. Lyrically, it\u2019s the story of a dear friend\u2019s heartbreak. My own heart, having not been in a relationship in ten years, is unrisked so unbroken. A damning self-portrait if ever there was one! Writing this song \u2013 with Johnny \u2013 made me realise my own lack of bravery in that department. Hasn\u2019t effected any change yet, mind you, but it did start me thinking at least\u2026 Anyway, as us Celts say, it\u2019s a belter,\u201d he grins.\n\nThe final word should go to Take Back The City. Gary Lightbody\u2019s hymn to Belfast is the song that opens Reworked and is sure to be an emotive live highlight when Snow Patrol take Reworked on the road later this year. As he reflects on 25 years of Snow Patrol, how have his feelings about the city changed in the 11 years since the song was released?\n\u201cWell, as the song says, I love Belfast tonight and always. There are still things that drive me crazy about the place. But I think that's the same for everyone\u2019s home city \u2013 although my home town, of course, is Bangor.\n\u201cMy love has deepened though not waned. I see the conflict that still goes on in people\u2019s hearts, my own included, and yet there is this drive in most people \u2013 most people \u2013 to put the past behind us and move on. To lift each other up.\n\u201cWe need that now more than ever with the looming clusterfuck that is Brexit and the devastation it has the potential to bring to the whole of UK, but to Northern Ireland more than anywhere else. We need that will to put the past behind us and lift each other.\u201d\n\nHear, hear. Equally, with these 16 inspiring, enveloping tracks, this is also moment to embrace the past \u2013 and, like the man said, to use it to lift each other. This is Reworked. This is Snow Patrol\u2019s history, and their legacy. And it\u2019s their inspired next step.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "FLETT ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10359320.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Virtual weekly open mic hosted by FLETT and Infireworks Music."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Moddi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8487109.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Norwegian, International, Songwriter And Storyteller, Folk", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Mostly harmless.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Scarypoolparty ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9761613.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Los Angeles, United States", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Debut album Exit Form out now!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Manila Luzon ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Findlay Napier ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6177867.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Acoustic, Folk, Roots, Singer Songwriter, Scottish", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "FINDLAY NAPIER: GLASGOW\n\nSECOND SOLO ALBUM FROM ACCLAIMED SCOTTISH SINGER-SONGWRITER\n\nPRODUCED BY BOO HEWERDINE\n\nOUT ON CHEERYGROOVE RECORDS 13th October 2017\n\u201cSongcraft and wit in the Difford & Tilbrook tradition\u201d (Sunday Herald)\n\n\u201cA beautiful amalgam of Scottish soul, funk and folk\u201d (Irish American Times)\n\nFollowing huge acclaim for his 2015 solo debut VIP: Very Interesting Persons, Scotland\u2019s Findlay Napier again unites superb songwriting, magpie-minded imagination and compellingly vivid vocals on his new album Glasgow.

But it was in the sweaty climes of the Lock Up Stage at Reading and Leeds 2008 that his solo career really started to take off. Inside the packed out tents, heaving with adoring fans and intrigued passers-by, Frank led the congregation in a mass sing-a-long; a stirring set that not only sparked the interest of the British mainstream but resonated unassumingly across the pond as a wealth of American punk bands watched approvingly from the sidelines.\n\nNo stranger to the festival, Frank had not only played the Lock Up Tent with former hardcore band Million Dead back in 2005 but also as a tentative solo artist in 2007 when debut album \u2018Sleep Is For The Week\u2019 was just an underground success. Within the following year, Frank\u2019s popularity grew with yet more touring and the release of second album 'Love Ire & Song' in March 08. He started to play larger headline shows and develop the live band that he was looking for.\n\nThe profits of all his hard work came together that festival weekend; it kicked started a new wave of interest and thanks to the unwavering support from Radio 1 DJs Mike Davies and Steve Lamacq, the rest of Radio 1 began to follow suit. Soon enough when Frank\u2019s single 'Long Live The Queen' \u2013 taken from \u2018Love Ire & Song' \u2013 was released in October, it made the R1 C-list, was Single Of The Week on Sara Cox\u2019s show and helped sell out Frank\u2019s largest UK headline tour culminating in a bursting-over-capacity-finale at London\u2019s Scala. The following single 'Reasons Not To Be An Idiot' released in January of this year eclipsed those successes by graduating to the R1\u2019s B-list, 6Music\u2019s A-list and XFM\u2019s daytime playlist, prompted a Live Lounge session for Sara Cox, a Hub Session for George Lamb as well as making iTunes Single Of The Week all helping to recruit a new army of Frank followers.\n\nIt was also during this time that sections of the US punk fraternity began to take notice. Having watched the infamous Lock Up Stage set at Reading and Leeds, Vinnie from Less Than Jake got in contact asking to release 'The First Three Years' album (a collection of all early and previously unreleased material, live tracks and b-sides released in the UK in December 08 on his vinyl label Paper and Plastick. Chuck Ragan took him on the Revival Tour with Tim Barry across America, he did a few shows with up and coming stars Fake Problems and New Jersey boys The Gaslight Anthem invited him to support them on their huge UK and European dates in the early part of this year. It was evident that word was spreading throughout the punk scenes both sides of the Atlantic and by the time Frank flew in to Austin, Texas for the annual industry showcase SXSW in March, a whole new chapter in his story was about to begin.\n\nFrank\u2019s brand of folk songwriting, catchy melodies and punk passion had reached the ears of the CEO of US independent label Epitaph Records, Bad Religion\u2019s legendary guitarist: Brett Gurewitz. Excited by what he had heard and seen when Frank headlined LA\u2019s notorious Viper Rooms in March, Gurewitz got in contact and soon enough plans were formulated and a worldwide deal was inked. With loyalty and integrity firmly intact, Frank kept his relationship with his existing label Xtra Mile Recordings for all releases in the UK and Ireland and so the two labels will work closely for what will undoubtedly be an exciting new era in Frank\u2019s ever evolving career.\n\n\u201cFrank Turner\u2019s music is a revelation to me,\u201d says Gurewitz. \u201cI can\u2019t stop listening to it. It\u2019s a real privilege to get out there and help Xtra Mile spread the Frank Turner gospel.\u201d\n\nEpitaph is the perfect home for Frank. With its fiercely independent spirit, rich in punk and hardcore history it is also home to the song-writing talents of Nick Cave and Tom Waits on sister label Anti; mirroring Frank\u2019s cross-over appeal of punk ethics and strong song-writing abilities. Inspired by the likes of Bad Religion as a kid, this really is a dream come true for Frank.\n\nSo with this exciting plot in place the year ahead is looking pretty good. His third studio album, \u2018Poetry Of The Deed\u2019, released worldwide in September, sees Frank venture in a more rock direction recruiting his outstanding band for the recording process. Performing live has always been at the very heart of the Frank Turner experience and whilst he\u2019s still writing all the songs, they will be recorded live to help bring that experience to the album. Grammy nominated producer Alex Newport \u2013 who has previously worked with Death Cab For Cutie, At The Drive-In, Two Gallants \u2013 is on production duties after contacting Frank directly asking if they could work together. Coinciding nicely with the release are tours in America and Europe as well as the massive UK headline tour in October, where having previously supported The Gaslight Anthem at London\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, he will return triumphantly to headline for the last night of the tour.\n\nBefore that though, another summer of further touring and festivals lies ahead. He will jet off to the East Coast of America to support The Offspring for 12 dates of their tour in July, performing solo to potentially 30,000 people. He\u2019ll play at Camp Bestival and Jersey Live fest and return full circle to this year\u2019s Reading and Leeds Festival. This time, however, he will play the larger Radio 1/NME tent midway through the afternoon and judging by what happened last year it\u2019ll be another defining moment in this story of one beardy man and his acoustic guitar.

The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label.

In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

Growing up, Barry was a committed member of his school\u2019s choir and devoted much of his time performing in school productions or competing in various solo singing feis\u2019. At the age of 5 he joined the Seamus Kerrigan School of Traditional Irish Dance where he stayed until the age of 18. Here Barry had the amazing opportunity to travel throughout Ireland taking part in a range of competitions, such as the All Ireland Dancing championships and Sc\u00f3r to name a few. A triple threat, Barry can also add acting to his ever increasing list of talents after the years he spent as a member of the Hazel Wand drama school in his hometown of Omagh. No stranger to the stage, Barry was destined to return and seize the spotlight later on in life. At age 11, Barry fell in love with drumming and excelled from grade 1-8 within the space of five years. His passion for the instrument led him to further study in London at Drumtech college, part of the British and Irish Modern Music Institute (BIMM) schools. Shortly after college Barry decided to join his father\u2019s band as his drummer and provided backing vocals for over 4 years. Constantly growing as a musician, Barry left Dominic\u2019s band in September 2010 and had the opportunity to live with his brother Colm in Nashville. During his time in the US he stayed with close friends, American country duo Joey & Rory where he had the incredible honour to play drums for 4 of their US shows. As January 2011 came to a close Barry had began to work with Ireland\u2019s princess of country, Lisa McHugh and performed with her until September 2011 before becoming the drummer and backing vocalist for the hit recording artist Derek Ryan. During his 4 and a half years working with the Derek Ryan band, Barry toured all around Ireland, the U.K and Australia. With every show in every city, Barry\u2019s desires became more apparent and in February 2016 he left the Derek Ryan band to pursue his own dream of a solo career in the Irish country music scene.

With his deep, beyond-his-years original lyrics and melodies, raw, soulful vocals, and powerful live performances, Sawyer seemed an unlikely match for reality tv, but having been scouted by casting directors at 15, he quickly won over broad audiences with his genuine delivery and unique arrangements of classic songs, going on to win season 8 of NBC's The Voice.\nFresh from that whirlwind, Fredericks went forward with the release of his major label debut, A Good Storm, with Republic Records, an impressive blend of soulful Folk, blues, and rock, entirely written or co-written by Sawyer. Choosing to go independent, for more creative freedom, his 2018 Hide Your Ghost, fully written and produced by Fredericks, sheds the high gloss major label treatment, and stays true to Fredericks\u2019s honest and elegantly stripped down style, a self-described \u201cfree range folk\u201d, incorporating elements of blues, roots rock, and jazz with live instrumental arrangements throughout. Considered one of the top ten Americana Albums of 2018, Chris Griffy, writing for No Depression and AXS magazine, calls Hide Your Ghost \u201ca bluesy folk rocker with a no-frills production that relies on Fredericks' raw voice to carry the emotional weight.\u201d\n2019 saw Sawyer and his band with official showcases at SXSW, AmericanaFest, Folk Alliance International, and BMI's Island Hopper Songwriter Fest. In November, Fredericks released the title track for his upcoming full length album, Flowers For You. The song, which strongly represents the direction of the anticipated album, harkens back to the signature blues infused roots rock that first drew the nation's attention, alternating heavily featured musicianship with biting self-deprecating lyrics sung with all the fierceness, rage, and frustration of a young man calling out his own shallowness and hypocrisy. The album, slated for release May 1, 2020, is recorded fully to analog tape at Dreamland Recording Studios in Woodstock, NY.", "otherInfo": "This week's Live at Five brings in one of our favorites Sawyer Fredericks!\n\nThis week's show once again is benefitting Feed Albany - COVID-19 Relief!

Yet it was a rocky roadto Unbreakable, as singer Ash Costello explains: \u201cIf I had to look at my life like a timeline of colors, when I wrote our last album, Malevolence (2015), it was pitch, charcoal black. But in the last couple years, the band cut off toxic people, built a new business team, and we\u2019re stronger than we\u2019ve ever been. So when we went to make Unbreakable, I wanted the process to be fun, to reflect our renewed vibe and energy,\u201d she says. \u201cWe set out to write the poppiest metal album, or the most metal pop album.\u201d\n\nOn Unbreakable, that mission is accomplished. It\u2019s a dozen intense, boundary-melding songs that may touch on metal or goth, but are ultimately undeniable modern rock \u2018n\u2019 roll tunes, no-holds-barred, done\nthe New Years Day way. The public got its first taste of Unbreakable in November 2018, with the booming, ultra-dynamic \u201cSkeletons.\u201d The song surpassed 1 million worldwide streams, the first proof that Unbreakable was going to be unbeatable. \u201cShut Up,\u201d with ultra-melodic, breathy vocals and a hardcore message, plus the dark taunt and industrial grind of \u2018Come For Me,\u201d with its irresistible chorus, capture a young band in its creative prime, and a singer solidly in charge of her vision. Costello, raised in Anaheim, grew up worshiping the powerful voice and presence of another local girl:No Doubt\u2019s Gwen Stefani. Like her childhood idol, Costello was singing in bands by high school. But it wasn\u2019t until a few years into NYD\u2019s career that everything gelled. \u201cI feel like New Years Day was really born when our EP Epidemic (2014) came out; it was the first taste of who we really are,\u201d Costello says. \u201cEverything before that feels like a different band, and technically was. Then Malevolence came out, it was sort of our punch in the dick to the music industry, and we did our first\nheadlining tour in 2015.\u201d Malevolence hit #45 on the Billboard 200, thanks to the radio hits \"Defame Me\" and \u201cKill Or Be Killed.\" In 2017, the band headlined the Vans Warped Tour; did a month-longfestival run with Halestorm; and appeared on the Punk Goes Pop compilation, covering Kehlani's \"Gangsta\" from the movie Suicide Squad.Unbreakable showcases a New Years Day stripped bare\u2014literally. The \u201cboys in the band\u201d left behind their white face makeup, which all admit was somewhat of a \u201csafety blanket.\u201d Likewise, Costello stripped down her songwriting. \u201cI used to think lyrics needed to have metaphorical veils and be super-dense and paint a picture but leave it up to the interpretation.\u201d But for Unbreakable, she says with characteristic forthrightness: \u201cI was, \u2018fuck that, I\u2019m literally going to say exactly what I want to say.\u2019 Yeah, there\u2019s some metaphorical stuff, but this is me moving into a more literal direction.\u201d\n\nSongs like \u201cShut Up\u201d blend a musical vulnerability with tough lyrics, not an easy task. But thanks in part to doing covers\u2014of Kehalni, Pantera and others\u2014New Years Day discovered their own versatility and creativity. \u201cWe made those songs work for our band, and that was the first time I realized we could go that direction in our own writing, make the super-melodic and the dirty, ratchety stuff work together.\n\u2018Shut Up\u2019 was written in a day, which just doesn\u2019t happen. I was going through some heavy personal stuff, and I was just, \u2018don\u2019t tell me what I want, shut up and give it to me!\u2019\u201d\nIf \u201cShut Up\u201d was nearly instantaneous, \u201cCome For Me\u201d took a year to write. It\u2019s truly a fight song-- \u201cIf you have a problem with me, I\u2019ll put you on the guest list, come for me; we\u2019ll fight it out,\u201d offers up\nCostello. But? \u201cIt also sounds dirty,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to write songs that strippers can strip to: a good beat and some sexy-ass lyrics!\u201d\nThe dichotomy between Costello\u2019s two sides\u2014embodied in her red and black hair, and even her tattoos (one side inked, the other not) has coalesced in the songs on Unbreakable. But the painful part of the\ncreative journey to Unbreakable began long before \u201cSkeletons\u201d was written. Before writing \u201cSkeletons\u201d in 2018, NYD did an album\u2019s worth of songs\u2026. then threw them out. Literally.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t someone who else told us they didn\u2019t like our record. It was US, the band, saying \u2018THIS IS NOT IT,\u2019\u201d Costello recalls. New Years Day weren\u2019t feeling that elusive \u201cit\u201d midway through the\nprocess. Yet Costello \u201cwas trying to be hopeful and stick it out.\u201d The turning point came in 2017 when NYD listened to their effort from start to finish with their old business team, and it didn\u2019t feel good or right. So, in a moment of bravery\u2014 \u201ca very scary moment,\u201d NYD canned the record and their business affiliations. \u201cI trust the universe,\u201d says Costello. \u201cAnd it took us where we needed to go. That door was meant to close that day. That group of songs are gone. But Unbreakable came out of it, and also our\nnew label and management. \u201cIt was about taking control of our art. We did, and everything good followed.\u201d\nA couple of those good things were writers/producers Mitch Marlow (All That Remains, In This Moment) and Scott Stevens (Halestorm, Shinedown). Each were writing with Costello, but she brought\nthe pair, who had never met, together. \u201cBoth became producers and ended up splitting the album, which is unheard of. But they were super passionate about me as an artist and the band, the record, and what\nwe have built,\u201d Costello says. \u201cThey fit like puzzle pieces. Marlow brings the blood and guts, Stevens the melodies. \u201cYou put the two guys together, and I\u2019m the person who embodies both sides, musically.\nI\u2019m a little horror, a little blood and guts, and a little \u2018I love Mickey Mouse\u2019 happy. It\u2019s a little ugly, it\u2019s a little pretty. Now the music is finally reflecting that. \u201cThe risk New Years Day\u2019s took has earned them copious rewards, and those \u201cpitch, charcoal\u201d days\u2014which were equally daunting times for guitarist Nikki Misery and bassist Frankie Sil\u2014are in the\nrear view. There were times when Costello felt she might not survive\u2014\u201dand it shows in Malevolence. But the past couple years, the communication among the band is incredible. We\u2019ve got this shit. We\u2019re\ntight. We\u2019ve lifted ourselves out of the dirt.\u201d The reignited band unity and honesty boosted the creation of Unbreakable, resulting in an album that\ntough critic Misery calls \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d There were the times when Costello would \u201ccall Nikki or Frankie, looking for a pep talk. I don\u2019t ever want to be stagnant; I wanted to push myself vocally, in my writing, better melodies, everything. So I put the pressure on myself.\u201d\n\nMisery, in keeping with his rebellious punky energy, is a \u201ctough love kind of person.\u201d But he had his singer\u2019s back. \u201cHe can pick me up. There aren\u2019t a lot of people I\u2019ll listen to in this world; I\u2019ve learned so much on my own, school of hard knocks, but Nikki can tell me the truth and I\u2019ll listen,\u201d says\nCostello. Ditto Frankie, who describes two his band mates as \u201cbest friends. It\u2019s a Mick Jagger/Keith Richards sort of relationship; they have this insane chemistry.\u201d With lead guitarist Austin Ingerman bringing his\nmulti-faceted musicality to NYD (he cites everyone from Randy Rhoads to Slash to Stevie Ray Vaughan as influences) the members of New Years Day finally feel \u201cUnbreakable.\u201d Bascially, title track says it all: \u201cI stepped on broken glass / Walking through the past / Feeling every cut that crippled me / Been through it all before / Won\u2019t go back anymore / I\u2019ve gone too far \u2026 You can\u2019t shatter me now / I\u2019m Unbreakable.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Zomanno ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8333428.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Edm, Funk, Rap, Turntablism", "Time": "9:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "LA Residencies - Soho House Malibu, Soho House West Hollywood, The LINE Hotel\nNotable performances - 2017 UMF Korea, 2017 SXSW, 2017 Buku Fest, 2016 Camp Flog Gnaw", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cassidy-Rae Wilson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9497281.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Country Pop", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Cassidy-Rae - a name you\u2019ll want to remember.

Very rarely though, do we see this happen in a live environment.\n\nSince 2005, John Rotellini has captivated audiences around the world by doing the impossible. A childhood love for magic paired with an eclectic collection of interests led John to develop what has become an obsession. By merging sleight of hand magic and illusions with other disciplines - psychology, con artistry, film, music and theatre, John has created live, interactive events that more closely resemble Hollywood blockbusters rather than traditional magic shows. No longer is the world of the impossible limited to the silver screen.\n\nJohn now resides in Las Vegas, Nevada where he can be found performing select dates in some of the Strip's most critically acclaimed productions and entertaining some of today's hottest stars when not on his own U.S. Tours.\n\nWhether it be performing live in front of thousands, entertaining small groups or executing death-defying large scale stunts, John's performances will be sure to leave you speechless. After all, how often do you get to live the impossible?\n\n\nHistory:\n\nWhen it comes to his shows, John has a very unique way of thinking. Rather than using a traditional audience/performer relationship, John has developed interactive experiences where the audience become the stars of the show. This allows each show to be different than the last and makes for many off-the-cuff and unique moments between John and his volunteers.\n\nAfter several years of honing his craft and performing for people in his home state of Wyoming, John launched his first headlining tour, Locked UP in April of 2009. The show, which opened to sold out crowds included a very special stunt. The spectacle, Rotellini's first venture into stunt work, was entitled -B L I N D- and required John to spend a day without sight, wrapping up with a blind drive through the streets of his hometown in a 2009 Pontiac Solstice roadster.\n\nThree years later, in January of 2012, the show transitioned from it's original Locked UP format into the TOURPOCALYPSE brand.

Luna Guitars bestowed her with their Shining Star award in 2011, and 360 Magazine called her vocals \"seamless\" and her compositions \"effortless\".\n\nAlex continues to develop her unique solo repertoire, reveling in a vision that is still introspective and sensitive, yet equally strong, enigmatic and haunting. With her latest EP Black Roses, Alex has added an electric edge to her acoustic singer/songwriter persona, resulting in a more blunt sound akin to Evanescence and Grace Potter, with a touch of Heart. The new record has a distinctly rock feel that brings a new dimension to her heartfelt songs without alienating longtime fans of Alex's introspective compositions. Her stories of heartbreak, inner turmoil, and life's complications are now told from the perspective of a woman with more edge, a dreamer who has walked a few more miles down her own road.\n\nWhether performing solo, duo, or with a full band, Alex brings a fun yet sophisticated ambiance to her live performances. Her connection to her audience is very real and her stage presence natural and comfortable. You can expect that everyone in the room will feel like they are a close and personal friend by the end of the evening.\n\nAlex is releasing brand new music in 2019, starting with \"Silent Storm\" on August 23rd, followed by more single releases towards the end of 2019 and into 2020.

It's decided that we should respect each band and we should have separate groups for both bands.\n\n\nPopular French rock group Dolly got together in Nantes, a town in the west of France, in 1991. Their formation came about thanks to drummer Thierry Lacroix and singer Emmanuelle Monet - aka Manu - who shared a mutual passion for English and American music. The Anglophile duo teamed up with two musician friends - bass-player Mick Chamberlin and guitarist Nicolas Bonniere (who was just 15 at the time!) - and went on to make a name for themselves on the local music scene as Dolly and C\u00b0.\n\nDolly and C\u00b0's early influences might have been lifted from the best chapters of an English/American rock compendium - indeed, the group's sound was heavily influenced by the likes of Blondie, Prince, the Pixies and the Smashing Pumpkins. But lead singer Manu's greatest source of inspiration was the work of English indie diva PJ Harvey. The young French singer was fascinated by Harvey's deep, melancholy vocals and, after seeing PJ in concert, Manu decided to accompany her own singing on guitar. Performing extensively on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 soon began to build up an extensive repertoire (most of which was written by Manu). And before long the group attracted a massive following of fans.\n\nEncouraged by this early success on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 went into the studio to begin work on their d\u00e9but album. After producing a mini album (featuring six tracks), Dolly and C\u00b0 went on to produce their first full-length album themselves. (The album, entitled simply \"Dolly and C\u00b0, actually scored a considerable hit on the national music scene, selling over 85,000 copies).\n\nShortly after the release of their d\u00e9but album, the group underwent several major changes in their line-up, re-inventing themselves as Dolly. The new-look Dolly went on to sign a recording deal with the East West label and then returned to the studio to set to work on a new CD album.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nDolly (\u30c9\u30ea\u30a3, \uff24\uff4f\uff4c\uff4c\uff59) is an japanese rock band.\nThey started their activities in 2005.\n\nMember:\nVocals: Mitsu\nGuitar: Masa\nGuitar: Yuina (ex Luecie)\nBass : Hachi\nDrums : Takashi (ex Plastic Tree)\n\nThe release Ussetsu Drop had their first proper PV with more of a budget than the previous.\nNow they have just released the Red and White singles of the tricolore opera trilogy making a total of 3 pvs and 9 songs.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tanika Charles ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10380142.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Toronto,Canada", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cTanika Charles modernizes classic soul\u201d -AfroPunk\n\nSince emerging on the international scene in 2017 with her debut Soul Run, Tanika Charles has revealed herself to be one of the best kept secrets in soul music. Both on stage and off, Toronto-based Charles presents an immutable charm, at times endearingly abrasive and honest in her vulnerabilities. Tanika returns in 2019 battle tested and ready to reveal the latest chapters of her life since graduating from local favourite to international success.\n\nIn early 2016 Tanika independently released Soul Run within Canada. The album went on to receive nominations for the Polaris Music Prize and a Juno Awards nomination for best R&B/Soul Recording of the Year. In 2017 Soul Run was released internationally by Italian funk/soul label Record Kicks. The critical reception was overwhelmingly positive with Now Magazine giving it a 4/5, Exclaim! Magazine rating it an 8/10 and Music Republic Magazine giving it a perfect 5/5. Songs such as \u201cEndless Chain\u201d, \u201cLove Fool\u201d and \u201cSoul Run\u201d received regular radio rotation in the Canada, the US, the UK and France.\n\n\u201cI heard Tanika Charles and it just reminded me of that Beastie Boys deep funk, raw soul era\u201d - NPR\u2019s What\u2019s Good with Stretch and Bobbito\n\nTanika\u2019s sophomore album The Gumption was released May 10th, 2019 through Record Kicks. It picks up where Soul Run left off, continuing her tradition of marrying classic soul with modern production styles. Across a dozen songs spanning 38 minutes, Tanika addresses moments of vindication, uncertain love, forbidden fruit and the state of the world today. \u201cIt\u2019s a little more mature,\u201d Tanika reflects on the album overall. \u201cIt\u2019s not feeling guilty about being up front, not being afraid to address situations that aren\u2019t comfortable for me. I\u2019m comfortable in my skin now in a way I never was before.\u201d\n\nPredominately guitar-driven mid-tempo soul, with a handful of dance floor friendly tunes and some psychedelic leanings, production on The Gumption was steered by DJ Kemo (Kardinal Offishall, Akon) and Chin Injeti (DJ Khalil, Eminem, Drake), Daniel Lee (Hooded Fang, Phedre) who previously contributed to Soul Run, multi-instrumentalist Kevin Henkel (Patch Banks & Sound sample library, sampled by T.I. and Young Thug) and solo artist Marlon James (Jessie Reyez, Iman Omari) who has played bass alongside Tanika for many years.\n\n\u201cImpressive vocal qualities, winningly honest lyrics, and a contemporary twist on classic soul sounds all point to great things\u201d - Albumism\n\nBacked by her band The Wonderfuls, Tanika has embarked on 5 tours since the release of Soul Run. Those tours took her across Canada many times over, as well as into eight other countries. Together they impressed crowds at such festivals as Rennes Trans Musicales, NXNE, L\u00e4rz Fusion, Pop Montreal, Canarias Jazz Festival, CBC Music Fest, TD Toronto Jazz Fest, Birmingham\u2019s Mostly Funk, Soul and Jazz Festival, the Pan Am Games, and many more.\n\nTanika has also appeared on television both as a reoccurring guest on CBC Kids, and as a lounge singer on Global TV\u2019s Bomb Girls drama series. Her music has been featured on HBO\u2019s Less Than Kind, ABC\u2019s Rookie Blue, The CW\u2019s Seed, CTV\u2019s Saving Hope, CBC\u2019s Kim\u2019s Convenience and Workin\u2019 Moms as well as in a nationally broadcast KFC commercial.

Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week.

Dav was lucky enough to fall into playing house parties for the huge MSU Ski Club, which led directly to working with a popular local cover band named Insol. The band introduced the East Lansing, MI bar scene to the up and coming DJ. Within the next few years Dav began mixing on turntables and became a regular at numerous spots around Michigan, all while calling Lansing home. This is when he began forming his unique style, mixing anything from Hip Hop and Old School, to House, to Disco and 80's! In 2007, DJ Dav was chosen by StudentCity.com and American Eagle Clothing to be their Acapulco, Mexico spring break DJ. On top of rocking the decks for 28 days straight he was also able to work with DJ AM, DJ Skribble and Fat Joe. He moved to Park City, UT in 2008 and quickly became a go to DJ in the popular destination resort town. Within the first few months the local paper was quoted as writing, \"With chops like his, people are bound to catch on quickly\". In 2011 he moved back to Detroit, the birthplace of techno, and began getting back into the technical aspects of DJing. Since winning the 2013 Michigan DJ Olympics in Lansing, MI, DJ Dav has become a highly sought after DJ in Detroit's open format scene. In the fall of 2014, he was selected by Grant Nelson to be a part of an amazing new online radio station, www.d3ep.com!

And for Emarosa, that means turning the page and and introducing the world to the band\u2019s newest chapter\u2014the one that best represents where they\u2019ve grown and where they\u2019re going. \u201cWe\u2019re at that point where we\u2019ve realized that there\u2019s no consequences for making whatever record we want to make,\u201d frontman Bradley Walden explains. \u201cWe started writing, and it felt like the book was being thrown out the window. There are no rules.\u201d\n\nOut February 8 on Hopeless Records, Peach Club makes the most of Emarosa\u2019s eclectic influences, marking their sixth studio effort as their most pop-laden and personal album to date. The 11-track record throws it back to the massive pop hits of the \u201880s and the powerhouse artists that ruled \u201890s R&B, which also happens to be where Walden looked to as he penned the album. \u201cI think a lot of it was based on what we were raised listening to,\u201d Walden says. \u201cMy mother raised me on female pop and R&B. It was Paula Abdul. It was Michael Jackson. It was Janet. It was even some Shania Twain.\u201d These influences ring true with the opening track and first single, \u201cGivin\u2019 Up,\u201d The 1975-vibing song which revels in glitter-soaked guitar and bursts with orchestral elements that introduces\u2014and cements\u2014the band\u2019s standing in the alt-pop world.\n\nThe affecting and undeniably arresting \u201cDon\u2019t Cry\u201d was the first song Emarosa wrote with producer Courtney Ballard (5 Seconds of Summer, Jessie J). Ballard, whose background is rooted in pop, helped guide the band as they united their alt-rock past with their pop-leaning present. \u201cI knew after writing the first song that he\u2019s the one that I wanted to do the record,\u201d Walden says. \u201cHe understood where we wanted to go and and where we were ready to depart from.\u201d His pop touch, combined with Walden\u2019s powerhouse vocals and potent songwriting, result in anthem-ready hits that are expertly weaved throughout the record. \u201cSo Bad\u201d bursts with boppy bass lines and dance-ready beats, and \u201cCautious\u201d combines the band\u2019s hooky take on rock and Fickle Friends\u2019 exuberant synth pop.\n\nEven more than the bold sonic shift, though, is the new lyrical perspective Emarosa embraces on Peach Club. While there\u2019s no denying that tracks like \u201cComfortable\u201d still have shades of heartbreak guised under beautiful melodies, Walden wanted to give this record a change in tone. \u201cI was tired of writing sad records. That\u2019s what I used as my way of dealing with things,\u201d Walden says. \u201cWhile this record is a lot of realizations and accepting faults, it\u2019s also not all sad. You don\u2019t have to be miserable.\u201d The record\u2019s light-hearted notes shine through with tracks like the stripped-down \u201cxo,\u201d the love song that taps into Walden\u2019s stunning vocals, along with the record\u2019s hidden gem \u201cIW2DWY,\u201d which takes a dreamy, lullaby-esque approach to experimental electro-pop.\n\nAs a body of work, Peach Club takes full advantage of Emarosa\u2019s biggest strengths. The band\u2019s familiar and fervent alt-rock energy flows through tracks like the riffy \u201cHelp You Out\u201d and explosive \u201cHell Of It.\u201d And the soul-bearing \u201cGet Back Up\u201d might just be one of the band\u2019s most powerful tracks to date. \u201cThat\u2019s my favorite song on the record,\u201d Walden says. \u201cI wrote that song for my mom. There was always something that took us down a peg. But if she hadn\u2019t gotten back up every single time we got knocked down, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am. And I wouldn\u2019t be the person I am.\u201d The track combats the sadness with a sonic message that lifts listeners up, invoking hope rather than sadness.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the beauty of Peach Club. At its core, the record represents more than just a sonic shift and sincere step forward. It represents the fact that Emarosa is exactly where they want to be, and it embodies the band\u2019s growing family listeners. It\u2019s a brave record that sees Emarosa showing their fans where they\u2019re going and inviting them to join them on the journey.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Peter Lehndorff's Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8710793.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Americana, Humor, Folk, Acoustic, Jazz Folk", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "PETER LEHNDORFF writes folk and jazz songs about everyday life.

A philosophy derived from the Japanese art of repairing cracked ceramics with gold to highlight flaws instead of hiding them, kintsugi speaks to the way an object's history is part of its aesthetic value. \"Considering what we were going through internally, and with what a lot of the lyrics are about, it had a great deal of resonance for us \u2014 the idea of figuring out how to repair breaks and make them a thing of beauty,\" says bassist Nick Harmer, who suggested the name to singer-guitarist Ben Gibbard and drummer Jason McGerr. \"Philosophically, spiritually, emotionally, it seems perfect for this group of songs.\"\nLong before they gave the album its name, the band embarked on a process that forced them to do things differently than they ever had before. For instance, in the course of making their seven previous albums, the Seattle band hadn't written much in the studio together. They had always preferred to hone their arrangements separately, or with just two or three of them playing at once. But when it came time to record Kintsugi, Death Cab for Cutie went into the studio with the openest of minds. Their willingness to try anything \u2014 including a twenty-minute exploration that evolved into one of the album's finest tracks, \"The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive\" \u2014 yields Death Cab's most compelling new work in years: an album that packs as much sonic as it does emotional wallop.\nKintsugi is the band's first time recording with a producer other than their own Chris Walla, the guitarist and multi-instrumentalist whose talents behind the board had helped shape Death Cab's sound since Gibbard released the You Can Play These Songs With Chords cassette in 1997. For Kintsugi, they worked with Rich Costey (whose production credits include albums by Franz Ferdinand, Muse, and Interpol), recording at his Los Angeles studio Eldorado over the course of twelve weeks in the first half of 2014. \"He was all in in a way that I don't think a lot of producers are nowadays,\" says Gibbard. \"We couldn't have landed on a better collaborator for this record. He accomplished what we've always attempted, which is to make Death Cab sound on a record how we sound live. And we're a rock band live. The difficulty now for the live show is making them rock as hard as they rock on the record. That's a new quagmire for this band.\"\nWork on Kintsugi began back in early 2013, as all Death Cab LPs have, with Gibbard writing and demoing the songs on his own before arranging and recording them with his band mates. They initially convened in fall of 2013 at Walla's Hall Of Justice studio in Seattle. Ten days into recording, Chris decided to step down as producer. Says Gibbard. \"Nothing dramatic, he just said, 'I don't think I'm the right guy to do this album and we should find someone else.'\" The band all felt that they needed to shake things up a bit. \"We challenged each other more and left no stone unturned. That was as gratifying as it was frustrating at times, but I couldn't be happier with the end product,\" says McGerr. Walla has since decided to leave the band but participated in the recording process as fully and vitally as he had on their previous albums. In fact, Costey didn't even know Walla was leaving the band until after Kintsugi was finished. Chris played his final show with the band in September at Rifflandia Festival in British Columbia.\nWhen they started recording, there weren't any rules at all. They'd work on a song for a while and then regroup with Costey to figure out elements to expand or elaborate. \"These guys have a chemistry that's existed for a long time, and that chemistry can't be ignored,\" says Costey. \"When you have a band that can play as well as they can play with each other, having them jam together in real time can actually be the quickest way to try a bunch of ideas and get them on tape.\" Songs such as the instantly memorable \"Good Help (Is So Hard To Find),\" the warm and vulnerable \"Little Wanderer\" and the brooding lead single \"Black Sun\" were all tracked with the four members of the band playing together in a room, reacting to each other in real time, adding layers \u2014 and later subtracting some. \"All four of us being on the floor together in the studio was something that hadn't happened in years, because Chris was always behind the glass or in the control room,\" says McGerr. \"But this was more like when we're onstage, where everyone has their eyes closed and we're playing in the moment. With 'The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive,' it turned into a twenty-minute thing they captured in the control room on a two-track. We had started it in Seattle months prior and it just wasn't getting there. Rich brought us into the control room and was like, 'This is our song.'\"\nCostey credits another element of their production set-up with helping achieve the perfect balance of their classic approach and the new one: \"My studio has one big live recording space and two control rooms,\" he says. \"Once we got basic tracks together, Chris would work on them in the other control room. And he would end up doing completely different versions of the songs. For 'Black Sun,' Chris did all this super old school sequenced synth stuff that we used on the final track, and it really brought that song to another level.\"\n\"Black Sun\" is also a perfect example of Gibbard's customarily honest, fearless approach to writing about affairs of the heart. \"'Black Sun' is about divorce and the ugliness and conflicting emotions that come with that: anger, sadness, finger-pointing, acceptance, forgiveness, understanding. To me, the idea of a black sun has multiple meanings: The black sun could be an eclipse, where one thing eclipses another. The sun is supposed to be a radiating light on the world but in this instance it is blacked out. We've all been that at some point in our life when we're supposed to be shining upon someone giving them support, but for some reason are unable to do that. I am the black sun, and the song is as much an indictment of myself as anything.\"\nAlthough, in the case of \"Black Sun,\" Gibbard says he's willing to elaborate on the elements of the song that are autobiographical, he's never been one to reveal the precise meaning behind his lyrics. \"I know that people will assume these songs are about certain things, and in some instances they are going to be correct,\" he says. \"But I'm not going to give people a road map.\"\nGibbard acknowledges that, early on in the process of writing this group of songs, as he was still trying to make sense of the major changes happening in his life, he had to remind himself not to change his creative process. \"If there's a reason people can relate to my songwriting, maybe it's they feel like they're getting an honest, fearless approach to writing about affairs of the heart. I'm certainly not going to censor that just because people think they know something about my personal life. I would be cowardly as a songwriter and not be true to what I've always done if I shy away from these events in my life because I was in relationship with a public figure.\n\"I know the lyrics aren't 100% fiction and they're not 100% nonfiction, and only Ben knows what that blend is,\" says Harmer. \"But with this group of songs, I do think he is writing from a genuinely vulnerable and honest place and I'm proud of him for putting himself out there and being fearless about it.\"\nOne of the songs on Kintsugi that Gibbard says he holds closest to his heart is \"Little Wanderer,\" where he sings, \"You sent a photo out of your window of Paris of what you wished that I could see. But someone's gotta be the lighthouse and that someone's gotta be me.\" He explains: \"There are innumerable songs about, like, 'The road ain't no place to start a family.' 'Home Sweet Home' by Motley Crue, 'Gone Til November,' by Wyclef Jean, and so on. But nobody ever writes a song about sitting at home, waiting for someone to come back. And for so much of my life, I've been the one off somewhere in the world trying to maintain a connection through digital portals. Now, being with someone who travels pretty much all the time, I feel like I've gotten a taste of my own medicine. All the songs are personal, but that one is personal in a way that is very tender to me.\"\nHere, too, \"The Ghosts of Beverly Drive\" encapsulates important elements of the album's larger theme \u2014 embracing flaws and being open to change. \"If only you had known me before the accident,\" it begins, \"for with that grand collision came a grave consequence.\" Says Gibbard: \"There's this charade you play with someone when you start seeing each other, that no one has ever made you feel this way before,\" says Gibbard. \"'The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive' is about when you say to the person you're with, 'Let's just acknowledge that we are not the first people to feel this way. Let's be honest with each other that we've been in love before or that we've fallen out of love with people before, and that's OK.'\"", "otherInfo": "5/28 is the last weekly show, tune in at 4pm PT!

Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week. I only made it through one semester of college, but being around these amazing songwriters here in Austin\u2026 It\u2019s like getting an education.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Clay Whittington ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10154118.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-28", "Genre": "Country, Pop, Jazz, Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "An accomplished vocalist and pianist, Clay Whittington is an energetic, passionate entertainer who delivers an unrivaled solo performance.

Yet the homespun, heartwarming music of family-oriented indie folk group GoldenOak provides evidence that the dense woods of the Pine Tree State might just be a better muse than the slick streets of New York and LA.\n\nGoldenOak is driven by the songwriting and harmonies of the brother-sister duo Zak and Lena Kendall. After a bit of a recording hiatus and a shift in personnel, the group is back with an enchanting pair of songs. \u201cRiver\u201d and \u201cPoet And The Painter\u201d find this collective simultaneously building on previous strengths while also striking out in an interesting new direction.\n\nZak Kendall explains that he and his sister had a heart-to-heart about how the band should sound once some intra-band changes took place. \u201cWith the original lineup, we were very much a four-piece group. Everybody had similar roles in the band and there was not really much of a lead, per se. As the band evolved and those two bandmates left, Lena and I kind of sat down and said, \u2018What we were doing is changing up, but what\u2019s staying the same is our relationship to each other, our musical journey as siblings.\u2019 I think with this music we\u2019ve kind of settled into that role. We\u2019ve learned to really understand and work with each other, write together more, bounce ideas off each other.\u201d\n\nThe pair leaned into the family-oriented dynamic when they dove into the new material, recorded at Rustic Studios in Portland. \u201cThe new stuff is built around that relationship and particularly our vocals and our harmonies,\u201d Zak says. \u201cLike on \u2018Poet And The Painter\u2019, there\u2019s no lead vocals on it. It\u2019s us singing harmonies the whole time, kind of like Simon & Garfunkel\u2019s early stuff. When I wrote \u2018River\u2019, I said to Lena, \u201cI\u2019m writing this song, but I want you to sing it.\u201d That was the first time that I had written lyrics for Lena to sing. And so it really became the closest to a partnership that it\u2019s ever been for us. We were really working closely together on this new stuff.\u201d\n\nEven as Zak and Lena found a new direction by honoring their musical bond, which they first started to form during campfire singalongs as youngsters, the new members of the band, bassist Mike Knowles and drummer Jackson Cromwell, also helped determine the sound of this single. Zak explains the process since the release of the band\u2019s 2017 EP Foxgloves: \u201cIt\u2019s been like a year-and-a-half or so since we released music. We were touring with a cellist and a trumpet player at the time. They were big focal points of a lot of our arrangements and a lot of our writing. When they left, we started playing with Mike and Jackson. And they started shaping the direction of what we were going to be putting out, because we wanted it to sound like our live set was sounding. It took a long period before we started working on new stuff because we were adjusting to having a new lineup and getting to know each other as musicians and bandmates. As we felt we were starting to click, we started working on a new stuff.\u201d\nSpeaking of that new stuff, \u201cRiver\u201d manages to seamlessly connect two different pieces of music that Zak had been writing. The moody music, accompanying verses about how political shifts are mirrored by the changing seasons, segues into a more upbeat outro, connected by a gorgeous moment of brother and sister singing a cappella, \u201cI\u2019ve come to witness the things I can\u2019t see.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cPoet And The Painter\u201d find the two in close-harmony throughout, but the shuffle of the rhythm section adds some momentum to the lyrical musings on the potency of nature.\n\nIn many ways, the themes of GoldenOak\u2019s music are driven by their home base. \u201cMaine is such an interesting place to be an artist,\u201d Zak says. \u201cIt\u2019s so remote in a lot of ways. And the landscape and the woods are so inspiring. People are often spread out, but there\u2019s also this amazing artistic community, not only in Portland but also in the towns all over Maine.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing in a place like Maine, we\u2019re not surrounded by buildings. I think the art is very reflective of the landscape, the nature of Maine. As you walk through the woods, you never see the same thing twice. And I think that represents the Maine music scene in a perfect way.\u201d\n\nThat music scene has thrown its arms around GoldenOak, and, in return, the band is helping to draw more attention to it with these excellent new songs. \u201cThe Portland music scene is so friendly and welcoming,\u201d Zak says. \u201cI think, unfortunately, a lot of music scenes get competitive by nature. But that\u2019s something you just don\u2019t find in Portland. There\u2019s just a lot of fantastic people involved in it that kind of have that \u2018Mainer\u2019 attitude to help each other out and support each other.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "FINNEAS ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9284121.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Dark Croon", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Johnson Crook ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9191293.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Alternative Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "What the quartet\u2014Noel Johnson (rhythm guitars/vocals), brothers Nathan (lead guitar/vocals) and Trevor Crook (drums/vocals) and Jared Craig (bass/vocals)\u2014share is a love of pure, honest music stemming from their small-town backgrounds.

At age 12 she was appearing on Knoxville TV, and at 13, she was recording on a small label and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. When she graduated from high school in 1964 she moved to Nashville, taking many traditional elements of folklore and popular music from East Tennessee with her.\n\nParton's initial success came as a songwriter, with her songs being covered by Kitty Wells, Hank Williams, Jr., Skeeter Davis, and a number of others. She signed with Monument Records in late 1965, where she was initially pitched as a bubblegum pop singer, earning only one national chart single, \"Happy, Happy Birthday Baby,\" which did not crack the Billboard Top 100. Additional pop singles also failed to chart.\n\nThe label agreed to have Parton sing country music after her composition \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\" as recorded by Bill Phillips (and with Parton, uncredited, on harmony) went to No. 6 on the country charts in 1966. Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but didn't write), reached No. 24 country 1967, followed later the same year with \"Something Fishy,\" which went to No. 17. The two songs anchored her first full-length album, Hello I'm Dolly, that same year.\n\nIn 1967, Parton was asked to join the weekly syndicated country music TV program hosted by Porter Wagoner, replacing Norma Jean. She also signed with RCA Records, Wagoner's label, during this period, where she would remain for the next two decades. Wagoner and Parton immediately began a hugely successful career as a vocal duet in addition to their solo work and their first single together, a cover of Tom Paxton's \"The Last Thing on My Mind,\" reached the top ten on the U.S. country charts in late 1967, and was the first of over a dozen duet singles to chart for them during the next several years.\n\nParton is a hugely successful songwriter, having begun by writing country songs with strong elements of folk music in them based upon her upbringing in humble mountain surroundings. Her songs \"Coat of Many Colors\" and \"Jolene\" have become classics in the field, as have a number of others. As a composer, she is also regarded as one of country music's most gifted storytellers, with many of her narrative songs based on persons and events from her childhood.\n\nIn 1987, Parton left her longtime label, RCA, and signed with Columbia Records, where her recording career continued to prosper, but by the mid 1990s, Parton, along with many other performers of her generation, found that her new music was not welcome on country radio playlists. She recorded a series of critically acclaimed bluegrass albums, beginning with \"The Grass is Blue\" (1999) and \"Little Sparrow\" (2001), both of which won Grammy Awards. Her 2002 album \"Halos and Horns\" included a bluegrass version of the Led Zeppelin classic Stairway to Heaven. In 2005, Parton released Those Were The Days, her interpretation of hits from the folk-rock era of the late 1960s through early 1970s. The CD featured such classics as John Lennon's \"Imagine,\" Cat Stevens' \"Where Do The Children Play,\" Tommy James' \"Crimson & Clover,\" and the folk classic \"Where Have All The Flowers Gone\", as well as the title track.\n\nIn 2007, Dolly paved new musical ground by forming her own record label, Dolly Records. The label's first release - Backwoods Barbie - debuted at #2 on the Billboard country albums charts and marks Parton's first mainstream country album in 17 years. Parton is touring North America and Europe throughout 2008 in support of her latest release.", "otherInfo": "\u201cGoodnight With Dolly\u201d will feature Dolly Parton reading a series of Imagination Library books"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bobby Bowen ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9361144.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Country Gospel, Christian Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Husband, Father, Country Gospel Singer.\nMost of all I love Jesus.", "otherInfo": "Donations: Paypal.me/bobbybowenfamily\n\nOnline Store: www.bobbybowen.com/online-store"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dave Matthews Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8479504.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Dave Matthews Band formed in Charlottesville, Virginia, in early 1991, when vocalist/guitarist Dave Matthews decided to put some songs he had written on tape. Instead of simply recording himself with a guitar, he opted to bring in some instrumental help to give his musical ideas more depth. Dave found assistance in drummer Carter Beauford and saxophonist LeRoi Moore, who were both accomplished jazz musicians in the local Charlottesville music scene. Based on the recommendation of distinguished local jazz guru John D\u2019earth, 16-year-old musical prodigy Stefan Lessard came on board to play bass. Completing the band was keyboard player Peter Griesar, who left the band after a couple of years, as well as the talented and classically trained violinist, Boyd Tinsley.\n\nThe first public performance of Dave Matthews Band occurred at the City of Charlottesville\u2019s Earth Day Festival in April 1991. The first official gig for the newly conceived Dave Matthews Band was May 11, 1991, at a private party held on the rooftop of the pink warehouse on South Street in downtown Charlottesville. Local weekly gigs soon followed at Eastern Standard and then Trax nightclub, and within a little time, word of the band\u2019s contagious new sound spread like wildfire throughout the region. Clubs started to fill up, tours began to cover more territory, and the fan base grew at an incredible rate.\n\nOn November 9, 1993, DMB released its first album, Remember Two Things, on its Bama Rags label. The album was recorded live at The Muse Music Club on Nantucket Island, in August of 1993. The album debuted on College charts as the highest independent entry, and went on to be certified gold by the RIAA -- a significant accomplishment for an independent album. Meanwhile, the band kept touring and its fan base continued to grow. By allowing fans to tape shows for their personal use, DMB created a highly interactive community that continues in spirit today.\n\nDuring the first part of 1994, Dave Matthews Band recorded its RCA debut, Under The Table and Dreaming. Just before the album\u2019s release on September 27, 1994, Dave Matthews Band hit the road for their first official national tour. The tour lasted well over a year and included sold out theater dates across the country, a trip to Europe, and two summers playing on the main stage of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival. By the fall of 1995, when the band returned to the studio to record its next album, Under The Table and Dreaming had been certified four times platinum by the RIAA.\n\nCrash, Dave Matthews Band\u2019s second RCA studio album, was released on April 30, 1996, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. The band continued with a steady schedule of touring throughout 1997, headlining sold-out amphitheater dates across North America. DMB, though elevated to the level of national pop stardom, continued to do things precisely as it had from day one: organically, with a grass roots mentality.\n\nOn October 28, 1997, Bama Rags/RCA label released an official double-disc live Dave Matthews Band album, entitled Live at Red Rocks 8-15-95. Without any marketing or promotion, Live at Red Rocks debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 chart and was instantly certified platinum. The album provided fans with a high quality and reasonably priced alternative to the over-priced, ill produced, and illegal live DMB CDs that were beginning to flood the bootleg black-market. The overwhelming success of Live at Red Rocks, combined with the band\u2019s tremendous touring achievements, proved that Dave Matthews Band had grown from a grass roots phenomenon to one of the hottest bands in America.\n\nOn April 28, 1998, RCA released Dave Matthews Band\u2019s third studio album, Before These Crowded Streets. The critically acclaimed recording debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart; it was the band\u2019s strongest debut to date. DMB spent the following year and a half on the road, selling out stadiums, arenas, and amphitheaters across the country.\n\nOn January 19, 1999, Bama Rags/RCA released Live at Luther College: An Acoustic Performance by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds. Tim Reynolds was a guest guitarist on all of the Dave Matthews Band albums, and toured with the band as a guest musician. Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds toured as an acoustic duo during the winters of \u201996, \u201997, and \u201999. The second in a series of live Dave Matthews Band-related releases, Live at Luther College debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and has since been certified platinum by the RIAA . As with Live at Red Rocks, the success of this second live album was based solely on word-of-mouth buzz.\n\nThe third installment in the ongoing live album series, Listener Supported, was released by Bama Rags/RCA on November 23, 1999. The album was recorded live at New Jersey's Continental Airlines Arena in September 1999, and a video of the performance, also titled \"Listener Supported\", was released at the same time. The double-disc album was quickly certified double platinum, and the video has sold over a million copies as well.\n\nThe band spent much of 2000 on tour, finishing as the top-grossing touring band in the U.S. In the fall, Dave Matthews joined legendary producer Glen Ballard in Los Angeles to fine-tune song arrangements for a new album, and the pair wound up co-writing 12 new songs in a matter of days. From this explosion of creative chemistry came the band's fourth studio album, Everyday, released February 27, 2001. Matthews played electric guitar for the first time, and Ballard helped the band focus and tighten their arrangements, resulting in the phenomenal success of Everyday, which has since gone triple platinum.\n\nDMB spent the summer of 2001 touring the country and exposing sold-out audiences to songs from Everyday. On August 21, \"Dave Matthews Band, The Videos 1994-2001\", was released on DVD and VHS. For the first time, the entire collection of Dave Matthews Band videos (the first 12) was presented together, along with director commentary and behind the scenes footage.\n\nOn October 23, 2001, the band released its fourth live release, Live In Chicago, 12.19.98, featuring guest musicians such as Victor Wooten, Maceo Parker, and a full set with Tim Reynolds.\n\nThe band regrouped in January 2002 at the familiar Plant Studios in Sausalito, CA where they had recorded their 3rd RCA release Before These Crowded Streets. The band revisited tracks they had previously written and recorded in 2000 and collaborated on a couple of new tunes that had debuted in recent months. The resultant creation, Busted Stuff, was made available July 16, 2002. Busted Stuff is a landmark record for DMB; for the first time ever, this album is without any musical guests. Included on the album are road-tested fan favorites such as \u201cBartender\u201d, \u201cGrey Street\u201d, \u201cWhere Are You Going\u201d, and \"Grace Is Gone\".\n\nFollowing a successful tour throughout the US in Summer 2002, Dave Matthews Band released Live At Folsom Field, Boulder CO, the band's 5th live release overall. This double CD / DVD / VHS from the band's 7/11/01 performance, contains first ever live versions of songs from Everyday and Busted Stuff, such as \"When The World Ends,\" \"So Right,\" \"What You Are,\" \"If I Had It All,\" \"Angel,\" \"The Space Between,\" \"Everyday\" \"Big Eyed Fish,\" \"Digging A Ditch,\" and \"Bartender.\" The DVD utilizes footage taken from 22 cameras, was recorded in 5.1 surround sound, and presents the finest audio quality of any DMB live release to date. A short tour in several US cities in December of 2002 was highlighted by 2 sold out performances at Madison Square Garden. On 12/21 at MSG, to the surprise and delight of the audience, Dave Matthews Band was joined on stage by James Brown.\n\nThe band's 2003 summer tour culminated with a performance in New York\u2019s Central Park in front of an estimated crowd of in excess of 100,000 fans. The concert helped raise $2 Million for public education and parks in New York City. In November 2003 The Central Park Concert was released on DVD and CD. Captured by 30 cameras in High Definition Widescreen video and recorded in stereo and 5.1 audio, the DVD was directed by Larry Jordan, who worked with the band previously on their Listener Supported.\n\nSummer/Fall 2003 also saw the release of the first solo projects from DMB with the release of Boyd's True Reflections and Dave's Some Devil. The first single from Some Devil, entitled \"Gravedigger,\" earned Dave a Grammy Award for \"Best Male Rock Vocal Performance\".\n\nDave Matthews began a tour in December 2003 to promote his album Some Devil. Dubbed \"Dave Matthews and Friends\" tour, Dave's \"Friends\" included: Trey Anastasio, Brady Blade, Tony Hall, Ray Paczkowski and Tim Reynolds. Emmylou Harris and Spyboy were special guests on the tour. The 12-date tour began in Pennsylvania and ended in California in January 04.\n\nSpring of 2004 found DMB at home in their Virginia studio rehearsing for the summer tour and beginning to mold some new tunes for their forthcoming studio album.\n\nDave Matthews Band's 2004 summer tour proved to be another stream of dynamite concert performances. New songs such as \"Hello Again\", \"Sugar Will\" and \"Joy Ride\" joined older favorites on the setlists. Days after the summer tour ended, DMB played in front of thousands of fans at a \"Concert to Benefit Bay Area Charities\" in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.\n\nIn the first few days of October, Dave Matthews Band joined forces with many other musicians on the \"Vote for Change\" Tour. Presented by MoveOn PAC, all proceeds from the tour benefited American Coming Together (ACT). The \"Vote for Change\" Tour was a multi-city, multi-artist tour that included 37 shows in 33 cities in 12 states over 11 days and featured artists such as Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals, Bonnie Raitt, Pearl Jam, REM and more.\n\nDMB Live Trax, a highly anticipated series of exclusive live releases, made its debut in the early fall. 12.8.98 Centrum, Worcester, MA was the first release and shortly thereafter, 9.12.04 Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, CA became the second live release in the new series.\n\nDave Matthews Band returned to the studio in the fall of 2004 and continued to shape their next album. Mark Batson, a well-known producer who met DMB in August after their Los Angeles show, was asked by DMB to come to Virginia and help produce the album.\n\nIn early 2005, Dave Matthews Band launched a website devoted to their new studio album. www.dmbnewstudioalbum.com provides fans with video footage and ongoing updates on the album's progress.\n\nIn the spring of 2005, Dave Matthews Band made their first trip \"down under\", playing four theater shows in Australia as well as the renowned East Coast Blues & Roots Festival in Byron Bay, Australia. Back in the US, DMB played the 36th Annual New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival before releasing their acclaimed sixth studio album, Stand Up in May. The release of the album was celebrated by an intimate performance at the Roseland Ballroom in NYC.\n\nDave Matthews Band headlined the 4th Annual Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, TN and also hosted their own festival at the end of July, the two-day Island Getaway event at New York City's Randall Island. DMB's Island Getaway included performances by Black Eyed Peas, Jem, Mike Doughty, Barenaked Ladies, Ray LaMontagne and Robert Randolph & the Family Band.\n\nFrom the first show of the 2005 summer tour in St. Louis to the four-show tour-ender at Red Rocks, the summer tour was epic and made all the more special by longtime lighting director, Fenton Williams' new stage set and lighting design. The fourth night at Red Rocks was added immediately after Hurricane Katrina struck. The concert, which featured the Neville Brothers on the bill, was a benefit for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Everyone from the concessionaires to the City of Denver pitched in and every cent related to the show -- over a million dollars total -- went to relief charities in the Gulf Coast.\n\nDMB, through their Bama Works Village Recovery Fund, partnered with CARE in 2005 to help tsunami-struck communities in eastern Sri Lanka put their lives back together. Monies donated to the Bama Works Village Recovery Fund are going to CARE to help empower local organizations in tsunami-affected areas to lead the economic and social recovery of their communities. All donations made through the DMB and Warehouse websites were matched 100% by Dave Matthews Band.\n\nDMB performed in Philadelphia, PA on July 2nd, a performance that was part of a series of free global concerts called \"Live 8\". \"Live 8\" concerts were held simultaneously in Philadelphia, PA; London, England; Rome, Italy; Paris, France and Berlin, Germany and were part of the ONE countdown to the G8 Summit. The concerts were part of a movement urging President Bush and other leaders of the world's 8 wealthiest nations to save millions of lives at the G8 Summit in Scotland July 5-8, 2005.\n\n2005 was definitely a year of CD releases. In addition to Stand Up, Live Trax 3, 8.27.2000 Meadows Music Theatre, Hartford, CT and Live Trax 4, 4.30.1996 Classic Amphitheatre, Richmond, VA were released in 2005 and recently, Dave Matthews Band released the Weekend on the Rocks and The Complete Weekend on the Rocks. Weekend on the Rocks features the highlights of all four nights, 9.9.05 - 9.12.05, at Red Rocks Amphitheatre and The Complete Weekend on the Rocks features the four full-length shows. Both releases contain a DVD with video highlights of the Red Rocks performances.\n\nDave Matthews Band made a trip to New Orleans in late April 2006 for the annual New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Shortly before making the trip to Louisiana, DMB issued a $1.5 million challenge grant to help build the New Orleans Habitat Musicians\u2019 Village. The Village is a Habitat for Humanity project that seeks to build more than 300 homes in the city\u2019s Upper Ninth Ward with musicians and other New Orleans residents who were displaced by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe 2006 annual DMB summer tour found rare songs such as \"Dreaming Tree\" and \"Proudest Monkey\" being rediscovered and new songs like \"The Idea of You\", \"Sister\" and \u201cCan\u2019t Stop\u201d making their debut. The 2006 summer tour production was definitely one of the best yet with DMB taking the live experience to a new level.\n\nA high point in DMB\u2019s career occurred on July 7-8, 2006 when the band performed back-to-back nights in historic Fenway Park with Sheryl Crow performing as support both evenings. Due to feedback and a high demand from fans, within weeks, the Fenway Park concerts were offered as Live Trax volume 6.\n\nDave Matthews Band hosted the second annual two-day Island Getaway event at New York City's Randall Island in August. The 2006 Island Getaway included performances by Gov\u2019t Mule, David Gray, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Slightly Stoopid, Yonder Mountain String Band and Tea Leaf Green.\n\nOther highlights of the summer tour included a return to Chicago with George Clinton performing and a two show tour-closer in DMB\u2019s hometown of Charlottesville, VA, at the new state-of-the-art John Paul Jones Arena.\n\nIn October, Dave Matthews Band had the pleasure and honor of touring as special guest of the Rolling Stones for a show at the Sun Bowl in El Paso, TX and the Qwest Center in Seattle, WA.\n\n2006 was another year chock full of releases! In addition to the rush release of the Fenway Park shows, a show from 1995 and 1996 were pulled out of the vaults based on requests from fans to release older shows in the Live Trax series.\n\nLive Trax 5: 8.23.1995 Meadow Brook Music Festival, Rochester Hills, MI\nLive Trax 6: 7.7 \u2013 7.8.2006 Fenway Park, Boston, MA\nLive Trax 7: 12.31.1996 Hampton Coliseum, Hampton, VA\n\nIn October, DMB released its double CD, Best of What\u2019s Around, Vol. 1, featuring the essential studio songs on one disc and a disc of live songs picked by fans from a survey DMB held earlier in the year.\n\nDave Matthews Band announced their plan in June to arrange for NativeEnergy and Clean Air-Cool Planet to offset 100% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from their touring activities since 1991. By offsetting the CO2 pollution that touring activities such as transporting gear, powering stages and air travel generate, Dave Matthews Band has taken a proactive role in fighting global warming and helping Native America to restore sustainable homeland economies in balance with the Earth.\n\nWith NativeEnergy, the band ensures that its CO2 offsetting actually contributes directly to the construction of new, Native American and Native Alaskan renewable energy generators whose clean electricity will displace energy that would otherwise have to come from polluting coal-fired plants, reducing CO2 and other pollution on behalf of the band. In addition, DMB\u2019s purchase supports financially additional offsets from wind farms in the Great Plains, that displace electricity on one of the most intensely coal-fired grids in the country.\n\nDave Matthews Band wants to send thanks to those that have supported their tsunami relief efforts.

Her dog is buried in the garden along the eastern wall; sometimes, she wonders if the ground will bloom half-a-dozen of him under a certain kind of moon. In the morning the light creeps sideways through the windows and lights her up from the chest down, her head nestled in the shadow. Sometimes she finds herself playing guitar before she has left sleep. Her hands strum but her mind is still dreaming. (It\u2019s her birthday, she\u2019s at the movies, the screen is a tidal wave, someone touches her leg, she wakes up with her fingers tangled in the strings and the kettle whistling.)\n\nThe house is haunted. It should go without saying, but it should be said anyway. The house is haunted, but no one knows anything about the ghost or how it messes with you, except for the fact that every time she goes away (to Texas, to Memphis, to Graceland, to Germany) she always ends up coming home again. It\u2019s the strangest kind of haunting. Everyone calls it, the house, the House of Punishment\u2014more than one mistaken citizen has turned up looking for a similarly-named erotic dungeon on the other side of town\u2014but the name is misleading. It is not a house where someone was punished, or a house where someone might be punished, but a house that replaces punishment; instead of feeling guilt or regret you must play quietly in any corner, and eventually the emotion will resolve itself.\n\nInside, every door frame is notched: the respective growths of former tenants, friends. On one of them, a place where\u2014deep in her cups\u2014she\u2019d measured her height as a full five inches taller than normal; only the next morning did she realize, cotton-mouthed, that she\u2019d been standing on her toes when she\u2019d slid the pencil over the apex of her skull. There had been a Murphy bed once, she was certain, and sometimes when she was very, very tired she would imagine her bed, which was not a Murphy bed, snapping her up into the wall. Next to her bed, in her nightstand drawer, lived the following things: crumpled receipts, red yarn, eight dollars, a white lighter, two undeveloped film cameras, Grether\u2019s Pastilles in their old-timey tin, fistfuls of birthday cards with the shimmer worn off, a pocket-sized copy of the constitution, a pocket knife, a pair of swimming goggles, a pair of recording headphones, shoelaces twisted into a Gordian knot, an unpaid parking ticket, a strip of Peanuts Halloween stickers, an MRI request form from when she sprained her finger, colloidal silver (someone told her it would cure her cold; someone else told her it would give her Argyria), a map of Kyoto (she\u2019d gotten bored at the temple), incense, her first fan letter (she promised herself she\u2019d respond; she never did), a bunch of bolts, a plastic doll\u2019s hand, doggie bags (he\u2019d died over a year ago), an unopened Replacements cassette, an unopened 23 & Me kit, an unopened fortune cookie, unopened pepper spray she doesn\u2019t trust herself to take out of the packaging. In a fake book on her desk\u2014pleather-bound and conspicuously absent a title\u2014she collects her used boarding passes, old concert tickets, disconnected wristbands. It doesn\u2019t escape her notice that she can\u2019t throw anything away, that objects remain unopened, unresolved, untangled, unconsumed. She is always in the middle. She is never at the end of anything.\n\nShe lives near a hospital. All night, she hears sirens, imagines the people being transported to and fro, their bodies speeding along in the back of ambulances and their spirit trying to catch up. She makes jokes. \u201cIf I wake up, someone better be dying,\u201d she says, until one night she wakes up and feels it: someone\u2019s essence slipping past her on the way to somewhere else. After that, she thinks about the hospital as a metaphor, and considers the many ailments the metaphorical hospital could cure, the many symptoms it could treat: Imposter syndrome. Cabin fever. Foot-in-mouth disease. Word vomit.\n\nShe invites her friends\u2014that is to say, her family\u2014over for dinner. She has this one friend whose dad was really obsessed with blood\u2014blood as in family, not the interesting kind of blood\u2014and how it was thicker than water (ew), and then one day her friend looked up the actual expression and it was, The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. Shit, right? Anyway, she makes a green bean casserole, which is demolished in short order, and hot rolls. Someone kills a pint of ice cream she\u2019s been saving. Someone else drinks a beer so hard it sputters, erupts. Someone else sits in the corner playing cat\u2019s cradle, waiting to feel the guilt lift from their sternum.\n\nAfter that, the coven of her covenant goes out beneath the new moon; they journal and play Bright Eyes and Britney Spears and act out Mar\u00eda Irene Forn\u00e9s\u2019 plays and eat peaches. They lie on the grass and the stone and talk about the skies they were born under. They don\u2019t believe, really, that it makes a difference, but it\u2019s nice to think about. After all, everyone knows the world is ending. They\u2019ve been told as much, and they can see it in the streets, and they know the world is irreparably fucked, but most importantly they feel it among themselves; they know this goodness cannot last forever.\n\nShe sits near them. They are together but at the same time they are alone, as we all are. Someone has put a braid into her hair; she\u2019s left toothmarks on someone else. Something moves through the empty house, less the ghost than the breath of the ghost. She tells her friends: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to disappear.\u201d Someone laughs. Then, someone else opens their mouth, and something else climbs out.\n\nCarmen Maria Machado, March 2020", "otherInfo": "VICE's second installment of Noisey Night In, a virtual concert fundraiser to support artists impacted by the pandemic.

As he learned about Mozart, Bach and others, he began to realize that contemporary music is very simply the music of the pepople. The overtures and opuses of the 1700s were the popular songs of that era. People identified with those songs in the same way that today's \u201chits\u201d appeal to the masses of this generation. As a songwriter, specifically for liturgy in 2017, the question that provokes him is: How do I create a song that will honor traditions and music yet speak to the modern Church and lead them to worship?\n\nJosh collaborated with his guitar player, Grae McCullough, to write a new mass setting, paying homage to the hymns of the past and the culture of modern worship. \u201cEvery week we lead music for school and parish masses, so we knew we needed something that would resonate with all ages. We also wanted it to be joyful, approachable and easy to sing but still fresh, dynamic and expressive,\u201d says Blakesley.\n\nOn March 3, 2017 is the release of this long-awaited project called Mass of Restoration. It is available now anywhere music can be downloaded. For sheet music, please visit ocp.org\n\nJosh Blakesley's last full-length album, Even in This, was recorded in 2015 in Franklin, TN with Grammy Nominated producer/singer- songwriter, Michael Farren. The album features songs co-written with Farren, Mia Fieldes (Hillsong), Dove Award winner Marc Byrd (God of Wonders) and Grammy Award Nominated, Sarah Hart (Better than a Hallelujah).\n\nThe title track from the album is a song about finding hope in the darkest valleys of life. It was born out of tragedy after the band's guitar player, Grae McCullough, lost his one-month-old daughter to a chromosomal disorder called Trisomy 18. \"The peace I had the day Lizzie's short life ended could have only been God. There was an underlying sense of peace in the devastation and the song really encapsulates the situation we were in,\" says McCoullough.\n\nBlakesley has been featured on Sirius XM, EWTN\u2019s Life on the Rock, Relevant Radio, KLOVE and has performed with wide variety of Christian artists like Matt Maher, Andrew Peterson, Jars of Clay and the Newsboys; as well as several International Papal events, most recently in Milan, Italy in 2012. He continues to tour heavily with dates booked all over the US and Canada in 2017. He partners with Compassion International as a spokesperson for releasing children from poverty in Jesus\u2019 name.

Timeless and timely, it's a classic sound with every word sang from the heart, driven forward by a mix of southern storytelling, Bible Belt twang, and Owens' big, booming baritone.\n\nFresh out of the studio, Owens has just finished recording his latest album due to release at year\u2019s end. He traveled to Texas for this project to record in The Panhandle House Studio enlisting the talents of JT Corenflos | Electric Guitar ( Alan Jackson, George Jones, Charley Pride, George Strait), Mitchell Smithey | Steele Guitar (Ray Price, Lee Ann Rimes, TG Sheppard, Gary Stuart), Dale Morris Jr. | Fiddle (Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Ray Price, Marty Stuart, Travis Tritt), Kerry Huckaba | Bass Guitar (The Hansons, The White River Band), Jay Brown | Piano (Canyon, Ty Herndon), and Andrew Raley | Drums (Deryl Dodd). Together, they captured a sound filled with fiddle, pedal steel and all the hallmarks of classic country music. Ten of the eleven tracks are penned by veteran writer Galen Griffin (Luke Bryan, Joe Diffie, Craig Morgan, Clay Walker) and magically Engineered and Produced by Nick \u201cAce\u201d Lutz (David Alan Coe, Ty Herndon, Little Texas, Ronnie Milsap, Kellie Pickler). This is an album filled with music intended to take the listener back to an earlier era in Country Music reminiscent of a simpler time. Owens shines brightly delivering each song with the same supersized voice that once shook the pews of his hometown church as the musicians expertly lay the sounds of Dance Halls long gone.\n\nLong before he hand-built his career in the honky-tonks and country clubs of the southeast, Owens grew up in rural Alabama. In many ways, it was a classic American upbringing, filled with family, faith, and music. Owens shines a light on those old-school values with his debut album Where I\u2019m Coming From and his newest release It\u2019s A Southern Thing, working closely with a roster of country music's top songwriters \u2014 including Bob Diperio, Greg Barnhill, Tony Stampley, Wynn Varble, Brian Callihan and Trent Willmon \u2014 for his most upbeat collection of songs to date.\n\n\"Like a lot of my favorite country singers, I grew up singing Gospel music,\" says Owens, who grew up listening to artists like Randy Travis and Keith Whitley. \"I grew up the same way, and I've stayed true to my Traditional Country roots. I'm still singing about going to church, eating fried chicken, and keeping it country. Why wouldn't I? Once you start trying to be something you're not, that's when you lose track of where you're headed.\"\n\nLongtime country music journalist Robert K. Oermann agrees, pointing to Owens' traditional approach as his strongest weapon. \"I like to think that there are cycles in [country] music,\" Oermann explains. \"Usually, the pendulum swings out and the Pop-Country people bring in a whole lot of new listeners, and then the new listeners discover real Country music. Then there's usually a swing back to more traditional styles. I hope we're on the cusp of that\u2026 and if we are, Shane is perfectly positioned.\"\nA self-made road warrior who was recently named \"Independent Artist of the Year\" by MusicRow Reveals 2018 Country Breakout Awards, Owens continues to maintain an active schedule of listening room and honky tonk shows along with festival appearances. He made his Grand Ole Opry debut in 2017. He also appeared at summertime events like CMA Music Festival and Jamboree In the Hills, both of which were voted as the top two American country music festivals of the year. Cracker Barrel has picked Owens' music to appear in several of the store's exclusive releases, including Country Faith America and Country Faith Love Songs, while Netflix included his song \"Country Never Goes Out of Style\" in the popular series The Ranch. No wonder Rolling Stone Country named Shane Owens one of the magazine's \"10 New Country Artists You Need to Know!\"\n\nNew music. New album. New shows. Shane Owens continues to more forward, but he also remains rooted in the sound that launched his career, breathing new life into a sound that's at once fresh and familiar. \"I've grown my business the old-school way,\" he explains. \"I played the honky-tonks for years. I developed myself and my sound. It can be tough when you've got a traditional sound, but I can't be anything I'm not. If it was easy to do, everybody would do it.

In June of 2015, Trawick released his first single, \u201cGoodbye\u201d, under the band name \"Justin Trawick and the Common Good\u201d; written about the search for direction and belonging in a world that constantly feels one step ahead of you.

I\u2019ve never had voice lessons, and it wasn\u2019t until after graduating from college that I started teaching myself how to play guitar. So, if you\u2019d told me then that I\u2019d end up making a living as a singer-songwriter, I wouldn't have believed you. Even now, with the release of my fifth studio album, Morning Light, I can barely believe it.\n\nMy performing career began in the smoky corners of Knoxville, TN\u2019s restaurants and bars, singing cover songs for distracted drunks and underage college students. I didn\u2019t seriously consider pursuing a career in music until May 9, 2007, after an unexpected opportunity to open for John Legend at Knoxville\u2019s Tennessee Theatre. The guy that walked on stage that night, wasn\u2019t the same guy that walked off. One set, six songs in just thirty minutes, changed my life forever.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve shared a tour bus with Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Famers, performed in front of crowds of over 20,000 people, and been lucky enough to share the stage with artists like Brandi Carlile, Heart, Gavin DeGraw, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, James Blunt, Edwin McCain, Chris Isaak, and Daughtry, as well as tour Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, performing for our men and women in uniform stationed overseas.\n\nMusic has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It\u2019s taken me to parts of the world I would\u2019ve never seen and connected me with lifelong friends I would\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s given my life purpose. Without music, I may have never met the two greatest loves of my life, my wife, Mandy, and my daughter, Annabelle Rose Baker. However, at the same time, music almost tore my life apart.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2013, I was touring over 200 days a year. By many standards, I was living the dream, but life on the road was taking its toll. While my music career had never been better, my personal life had never been worse. At home, waiting for me, was the life that I\u2019d dreamed of, and I was missing it. First words were being spoken, first steps taken, and it was all passing me by like road signs on the highway. Sadly, the two people I was working hardest to protect, were the ones getting hurt the most.\n\nThen one day I walked into an empty house and found my wife\u2019s wedding ring on the kitchen table along with a note that read, \u201cI will not be sorry for the choice YOU made.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, success as a singer-songwriter didn\u2019t seem nearly as important if it meant failing as a husband and as a father. I was at an intersection in my life and a choice had to be made. I could continue down the road I was on, whatever the cost, or change my direction and come home.\n\nThankfully, I made the choice to refocus on my family, and in January of 2014, I put down my guitar and started picking up the pieces. I stopped recording and touring, and traded the stage lights, for front porch lights, but as it turns out, the day that I decided to stop making music, was the day a new chapter in my music career began.\n\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve learned is that you get what you give in this life. 5 years ago, I GOT a second chance, and everything that\u2019s happened has GIVEN me this moment.\n\nToday, I am a better husband. I\u2019m a better father, and hopefully, I\u2019m a better songwriter. Music may have tried to tear my family apart, but now it\u2019s graciously bringing us back together. So, I see music as a celebration of every wrong turn and right turn that has led me here, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t give thanks for that old wooden box with six strings.\n\nHere\u2019s to the hope that keeps us holding on and to never losing sight of the things that are truly important. Here\u2019s to the promise and possibility of each NEW DAY. Here\u2019s to the beauty of the present moment and to trying our best to make the most of it. The road here has not been easy, but over the last few years, I\u2019ve learned that if you look hard enough, the shadows always show us the light.

The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions. We have to build something to last, rather than just build it because it looks good at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Annie Zeleski", "otherInfo": "donate:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/Ounsworth"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Debra Devi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10098425.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Jamband, Classic Rock, Blues Rock, Pop Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Debra Devi is a blues-rock guitarist and singer/songwriter who blends pop, rock, jam and Americana into memorable songs flavored with her masterful guitar playing.\n\nDevi's upcoming EP, A Zillion Stars Overhead, includes Jorgen Carlsson (Gov't Mule) on bass and Rob Clores (Jesse Malin, Black Crowes) on keys.

But the South Korea born, New Mexico raised performer hardly realized just how dynamically his skills on the instrument would mesh with his ultimate development as a rocker in the popular regional bands Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and now, his emergence as a powerful and emotional singer/songwriter in his own right. On his debut album These Illusions, Park plays violin and acoustic guitar in addition to reaching out to acoustic rock fans everywhere with his inimitable vocals. Because of the mostly personal nature of the songs, the compelling 11-track collection rolls like a fascinating chronology of the 27-year-old singer\u2019s life, beginning with tunes he wrote when he was an engineering student at New Mexico State in his now adopted hometown of Las Cruces. He was also building his catalog of songs as he played violin and contributed backing vocals for several years in two well known regional bands: the mostly cover band Live Bait and the \u201cscreamo\u201d metalcore/hardcore group Kiss To Betray. Playing in Live Bait, his violin came in very handy for those Dave Matthews songs and it helped him take songs like Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d to a transcendent level. Live Bait won the local college radio station KRUXFEST for \u201cBest New Alternative Band\u201d in 2005 and Kiss To Betray won the Las Cruces 2006 Battle of the Bands and later played at well known venues around the country like Headhunters in Austin, The Viper Room in L.A. and hotspots in Phoenix. As a solo artist, Park has since headlined regularly at local clubs like El Patio Bar and Hurricane Alley, the Albuquerque haunts the Launch Pad and Rally\u2019s Pub on 4th Street, and in Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix and even Colorado Springs. He recently posted two live performance videos on his myspace (myspace.com/danielparkmusic), one of which features his unique looping technique which allows him to play violin and guitar \u201csimultaneously\u201d on the same song. While Park enjoyed his time in Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and the notoriety he received as a featured performer, in some ways he felt he was always gearing up for his eventual breakthrough to the forefront as his own artist. In the months leading up to the breakup of Kiss To Betray, Park gathered his best material, entered what kiddingly refers to as \u201ca local ghetto studio\u201d and started to come to grips with These Illusions. While many of the tracks on the album have their roots in romantic relationships, the hypnotic and percussive, acoustic guitar driven title cut cuts to the core of his desire to find his own creative path in life\u2014even if it means going against the mainstream expectations of our society. Other songs tap slightly into his lifelong search for identity as an Asian born man adopted (along with two of his siblings) by a white American family. Other key tracks on These Illusions include the jangling, high energy \u201cTimes Have Changed,\u201d which laments the shift in life as his significant other chooses to move on. The graceful, easy strumming ballad \u201cWhat We Should Be\u201d is another heartbreaker about learning to accept the changes in a relationship when one person leaves to pursue his or her dreams\u2014while still celebrating the memories. Park spins a different perspective .., going even deeper and more introspective .. in Me,\u201d a song about a man who hits rock bottom and realizes his need to adjust his course. \"Daniel Park has distilled what it is to be a singer songwriter in the late oughts, and in doing this, has created a blueprint that every individual with an acoustic guitar and a microphone should follow for the next decade.\" - James @ NeuFutur.com www.danielparkmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Grace McLean and Them Apples ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6388885.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Electronic, Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Called \u201celectrifying\u201d by The Huffington Post and \u201cphenomenal\u201d by The New York Times, Grace McLean is a multi-hyphenate actor-singer-writer-teacher on the rise.

The audience, however, is too busy dancing to the one-man acts layered guitar riffs, foot stomping percussion, blues harmonica, and emotionally charged lyrics to even think about looking away.\nThe New Jersey native is able to emulate the sound of a full rock band with his percussive fingerstyle approach to the acoustic guitar and an array of effects pedals. Kenny has even customized a vintage red suitcase which has been dubbed \u201cThe Big Red Suitcase\u201d to use as a kick drum, which has appeared with him on stage for over a decade of live performances.\nHis debut appearances at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park paved the way for Kenny\u2019s developing one-man band show and led him into the national touring circuit and beyond. Over years of honing his craft on the road, Kenny caught the attention of one of his guitar idols, Mickey Melchiondo, a.k.a. Dean Ween from WEEN. Melchiondo recently asked Kenny to tour opening up for his new band, The Dean Ween Group, and has gained him new fans around the United States. Kenny has also been spreading his music internationally with multiple tours throughout Europe and performances in SE Asia to raise awareness about unexploded bombs. In recent years he has shared the stage with the likes of John Butler Trio, Keller Williams, WEEN, The Dean Ween Group, Leon Russell, John Hammond Jr., New Riders of the Purple Sage and John Kadlecik (Further & Dark Star Orchestra). In January of 2016, The Eagles of Death Metal released Kenny\u2019s version of \"I Love You All The Time\" as a part of their Pay it Forward Campaign to raise money for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.\nOn his latest self-titled release, Kenny teamed up with three-time Grammy Winning Producer Justin Guip (Sound engineer for Levon Helm and current touring drummer for Hot Tuna) to create a record that expanded on his signature one-man band sound. The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks. With an influential voice that lies somewhere between Neil Young and Jack White, Kenny delivers clear and concise visions of dynamic musical deliverance. Combining a deep dive into tone, originality and believability, he ushers the listener into his brand new living room of roots riddled rock and roll.\nNever going for the standard attack, he flies far from the 12-bar blues, three-chord rock and Americana stereotype to land some place between a rock and a new place. The album illustrates a highly skilled writer who utilizes the same down-home approach in his music as he does with his day-to-day interactions with others. It\u2019s a combination that will continue to see Kenny reach exciting new levels as he helps future fans \u201csee the light\u201d of his musical message.\nTo hear his full discography, watch recent videos, and check out upcoming tour dates visit www.KeithKenny.com\n(Excerpt from John Pfieffer & Jessica Smith of The Aquarian Weekly)", "otherInfo": "Virtual Tip Jar!\nVenmo: Keith-Kenny-1\nPaypal: Keith@KeithKenny.com or Paypal.me/KeithKenny\nCashApp: $KeithKenny\n\nMerchandise!

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

Some of Kraus' biggest influences are LeAnn Rimes, Elton John, Phil Collins, Amy Grant, Gloria Estefan, Shania Twain, Faith Hill and various 80's rock artists.

But not every artist gets asked by their heroes to join\nthem, as artists, on their stage. It's a compliment that Jacob Moon keeps getting from the\nmusicians who have inspired him since he started as a singer-songwriter out in Hamilton,\nOntario. Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ Glenniest ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Simple Parade ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7416385.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Folk, Pop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "At it's core, The Simple Parade is singer/songwriter Justin Hooper who lives in beautiful Denver, CO.

These are melodies of depth, and her guitar work is exemplary.\" - Robert K. Oermann, Music Row Magazine\n\nOnce a Seattle resident, Treva Blomquist is now a Nashville local and has quickly risen to the top of an endless pool of talent that inundates the music city. Treva's ability to seamlessly weave a tapestry of folk and soul, dye it indigo blue, and adorn it with the occasional sparkling sequin of pop has earned her considerable recognition among artists and critics alike. Her songwriting is rock solid and mature, often earning favorable comparisons to Patty Griffin and Mindy Smith, with the exception that Treva is more versatile than either of the aforementioned tunesmiths. Treva is comfortable and compelling performing as a solo act, in front of a small string section, or shaking the walls of any rock venue in town with a band.\n\nAlthough Treva's brilliant songwriting and impressive guitar chops distinguish her from other artists in her genre, it is her voice that places her in a league of her own. Treva's range is wide and her timbre is as focused and as pure as a trumpet, and just as powerful. But it is the integrity and authenticity embedded within her lyrics, and the passion and soul conveyed through her voice that are truly the most inspiring. Treva posses a rare talent that is often sought after but rarely obtained.\n\nBlomquist\u2019s new album Snakes & Saints makes that point perfectly clear. Produced and engineered by multi-instrumentalists Nathan Johnson (Meaning Machine) and J. Brandon Owens (Enjoyer) at both Owens\u2019 Silent Planet studios and Johnson\u2019s home studio, it offers another example of how Blomquist culls her inspiration and sustains her intents through a resilient sense of hope, purpose and affirmation.\n\nConsisting of all original material penned by Blomquist herself, the album finds her sharing her heartfelt vocals through a delivery that\u2019s both hushed and heroic, upbeat and yet unassuming. On songs such as \u201cSecret\u201d and \u201cShape I\u2019m In,\u201d her singing literally seems to shimmer and shine. \u201cSugar\u201d finds her delivery teeming with pure pop perfection. The atmospheric ambiance of \u201cAnger\u201d belies the sentiments suggested by the title, just as the mellow drift of \u201cSorry\u201d and the distinctive dynamic of \u201cThe Bottom\u201d reflect a wisdom and endurance that conveys an inherent emotion that\u2019s bound up in each.\n\n\n*Riverbluff Performing Songwriter Grand Prize Winner (2006) for \"I Could Get Used To This\"\n\n*USA Songwriting Competition Honorable Mention (2006) with \"When the Cards Are Yours\" (Folk Category)\n\n*Kerrville Folk Festival Finalist (2005)\n\n*USA Songwriting Competition Honorable Mention (2018) with C'mon Love (Americana)", "otherInfo": "Tune in as Singer-songwriter Treva Blomquist streams an acoustic concert from her home to yours via FaceBook and Instagram."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Keith Kenny ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9369673.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Blues, Rock, Acoustic, Folk", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "If the audience at a Keith Kenny show were to close their eyes for the performance they would swear that there was a full band on stage. The audience, however, is too busy dancing to the one-man acts layered guitar riffs, foot stomping percussion, blues harmonica, and emotionally charged lyrics to even think about looking away.\nThe New Jersey native is able to emulate the sound of a full rock band with his percussive fingerstyle approach to the acoustic guitar and an array of effects pedals. Kenny has even customized a vintage red suitcase which has been dubbed \u201cThe Big Red Suitcase\u201d to use as a kick drum, which has appeared with him on stage for over a decade of live performances.\nHis debut appearances at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park paved the way for Kenny\u2019s developing one-man band show and led him into the national touring circuit and beyond. Over years of honing his craft on the road, Kenny caught the attention of one of his guitar idols, Mickey Melchiondo, a.k.a. Dean Ween from WEEN. Melchiondo recently asked Kenny to tour opening up for his new band, The Dean Ween Group, and has gained him new fans around the United States. Kenny has also been spreading his music internationally with multiple tours throughout Europe and performances in SE Asia to raise awareness about unexploded bombs. In recent years he has shared the stage with the likes of John Butler Trio, Keller Williams, WEEN, The Dean Ween Group, Leon Russell, John Hammond Jr., New Riders of the Purple Sage and John Kadlecik (Further & Dark Star Orchestra). In January of 2016, The Eagles of Death Metal released Kenny\u2019s version of \"I Love You All The Time\" as a part of their Pay it Forward Campaign to raise money for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.\nOn his latest self-titled release, Kenny teamed up with three-time Grammy Winning Producer Justin Guip (Sound engineer for Levon Helm and current touring drummer for Hot Tuna) to create a record that expanded on his signature one-man band sound. The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks. With an influential voice that lies somewhere between Neil Young and Jack White, Kenny delivers clear and concise visions of dynamic musical deliverance. Combining a deep dive into tone, originality and believability, he ushers the listener into his brand new living room of roots riddled rock and roll.\nNever going for the standard attack, he flies far from the 12-bar blues, three-chord rock and Americana stereotype to land some place between a rock and a new place. The album illustrates a highly skilled writer who utilizes the same down-home approach in his music as he does with his day-to-day interactions with others. It\u2019s a combination that will continue to see Kenny reach exciting new levels as he helps future fans \u201csee the light\u201d of his musical message.\nTo hear his full discography, watch recent videos, and check out upcoming tour dates visit www.KeithKenny.com\n(Excerpt from John Pfieffer & Jessica Smith of The Aquarian Weekly)", "otherInfo": "Virtual Tip Jar!\nVenmo: Keith-Kenny-1\nPaypal: Keith@KeithKenny.com or Paypal.me/KeithKenny\nCashApp: $KeithKenny\n\nMerchandise!

They were a perfect match. The trio began playing clubs around the St. Louis area and in no time they were working 7 nights a week. In the late \u201990s, they recorded Blue Room which celebrated it\u2019s 20th Anniversary and was recently remastered and released on Ruf Records.\n\nOdds Lane was formed in 2003 and they began recording and playing live to a steadily growing fan base. As part of an effort to promote emerging artists, they were invited to record at legendary Sun Studios, after which they released the first of several projects as independent songwriters in 2004. In 2012 their release Dark Matters garnered Byrkit an ASCAP Plus Songwriting Award.\n\nLOST & FOUND, Odds Lane\u2019s newest release on Gulf Coast Records was inspired by the re-mastered release of Mike Zito\u2019s Blue Room. They have come full circle with a collection of eleven songs that are influenced by their South St. Louis blues rock/funk roots. Lost & Found was recorded at MARZ Studio in Netherland, TX and mixed by Grammy Award-winning producer David Z (Prince, Etta James, Buddy Guy).", "otherInfo": "DOUG\u2019S QUARANTINE BIRTHDAY Living Room Show, with Doug Byrkit once again joined 6 feet away by Brian Zielie in his Living Room for the 2nd to last \"Live From The Living Room\" live streams.

But not every artist gets asked by their heroes to join\nthem, as artists, on their stage. It's a compliment that Jacob Moon keeps getting from the\nmusicians who have inspired him since he started as a singer-songwriter out in Hamilton,\nOntario. Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Simple Parade ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7416385.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Folk, Pop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "At it's core, The Simple Parade is singer/songwriter Justin Hooper who lives in beautiful Denver, CO.

If you ask the two remaining members of The Tragic Radicals, apparently several. A four year revolving door of band members has brought guitarist, Aj Caves, and former TR bassist, turned drummer extraordinaire, Tyler Chittick, to one conclusion; less really is more.\nRewind to the chilly month of January, 2016 in Fullerton, CA: The rock band soon to be known as The Tragic Radicals was born. Since the recent disbanding of her all-girl rock group, The Slivers, Aj, bored and bandless, turned to Craigslist, to scout out musicians for her next (and hopefully more successful) band. With a little diligence, it wasn\u2019t too long before drummer, Nathan, bassist, Tyler, and singer, Cassidy, were assembled, auditioning in Aj\u2019s living room. The band began rehearsing there weekly, and the four-piece picked up and put their scent on, roughly, a dozen of Aj\u2019s existing songs, came up with a suitable moniker, and were hitting stages within a couple of months. Over the next few years, the group played steady gigs, recorded two EPs (one unreleased), and also underwent numerous personnel changes.\nFast forward to late August, 2019: Two singers, four drummers, and nearly one hundred shows later, The Radicals found themselves tragically (or not so tragically) half the band they used to be. Having recently become a three-piece after letting go of their second (and last) singer in June 2019, the band was surprised to see their summer filling up very fast. The new formation of TR soon was gaining momentum as an instrumental act, and was booked solid through the end of August. Promoters were all over them. They were playing venues anywhere from the Sunset Strip to Long Beach, to Orange County, an exciting and unexpected turn of events for a band who was fully anticipating a struggle booking gigs without a vocalist. In a matter of six weeks, with nearly a dozen shows down, the band was nearing the end of their stretch, with only two left on the calendar, both of which at The World Famous Doll Hut in Anaheim, CA. The first of the two shows was one they\u2019d been preparing for. A Saturday night prime slot with a stacked bill, this was an excellent opportunity for The Tragic Radicals to earn some decent exposure, as it promised a great turnout. They did not predict the departure of their drummer on the day of the gig.\nThough blindsided and disappointed, indeed, the show must go on. No stranger to flakey musicians, the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was setting in for the two longest running members of The Tragic Radicals as they had hours to prepare for their performance as a duo. This was not the first time Aj and Tyler had been forced to curb their act on short notice. If one thing has remained constant in TR, it\u2019s etiquette, and there would be no backing out of shows due to the lack of professionalism from other members. Put on the spot, the two would naturally resort to just guitar and bass, jokingly dubbing these modified performances as their \u2018Almost Acoustic Christmas\u2019 shows; for whatever reason, this seemed to happen every December, coincidentally. Even though this was far from their first rodeo, it was clear they began to silently doubt their abilities matching the caliber of the lineup that night, fearing the intensity of their sound would suffer without drums. Consultation between the two was unnecessary as Tyler posed the idea of ditching the bass, and instead doing drums and guitar, and without debate, the musical arrangement was settled.\nWith a packed house, surrounded by many semi-famous musicians, the nervous pair took the stage at The Doll Hut that night, hoping to make it through their set semi-painlessly. The crowd\u2019s growing audible response as each new song was playedLittle did it would prove to be the most successful incarnation of The Tragic Radicals yet. In the months following their impressive, pivotal August performance, The Tragic Radicals would have a new look, a new sound, and a new following. Not to mention, new opportunities. In a very short amount of time, they found their calendar packed once again, filled with not only gigs, but appearances on podcasts like Taxi TV, The Flabby Hoffman Radio Show, Die Laughing Records Radio Podcast, and C4OC\u2019s House of Metal Radio Show. Somehow, they\u2019d managed to achieve more in a matter of weeks than they had as a full band in almost four years-time. It was an exciting time for TR, and finally they began reaping the benefits after years of hard work.\nAnd so it goes, with success comes some criticism. Now and again, skeptics who can\u2019t seem to wrap their heads around how a two-piece, instrumental band, with no vocals or bass will argue that TR cannot compete with the live sound capabilities of a traditional four or five-piece rock band. Aware of the criticism, the pair has had much to prove when it comes to their live act. Eliminating the vocals and bass does present some challenges, but the two-piece is adapting quite well, crafting clever songs with shortened or modified arrangements to make up for the sounds of absent band members. For years Tyler and Aj were frustrated with TR\u2019s inability to expand their song catalog. Due to the constant rotation of members, it was nearly impossible to write new material at the desired pace. Relieved of aforementioned obstacles, The Tragic Radicals are rapidly writing new songs, and are preparing to record and release new music by January 2020. The creative process requires a slightly different approach now, but Aj\u2019s melodic riffs and ability uniquely arrange songs to replace lyrics is a major asset to the band. Playing through both guitar and bass amps on stage, she maintains her distinct guitar tone while incorporating low end to fill the void of Tyler\u2019s missing bass. Perfectly accompaniment, Tyler lends emphasis to accents and dynamics, drumming as though he was playing bass. An incredibly versatile musician, capable of mastering numerous instruments, his skills and flexibility allow him to keep up with Aj\u2019s frequent song reworking and tendency to experiment with time changes. The two manage to captivate audiences with, not only their blatant chemistry, but their genuine, intense stage presence, and roll with the punches charm.", "otherInfo": "Every Thursday We'll Be Playing 3 Original Tracks - Personal Faves, And Requests Welcomed!

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tony Suraci Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9729939.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Rainbow, California", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tony Suraci\u2019s performances are purely musical with deep, honest manifestations of tone and expression.

He has his black-belt in voice and bottleneck guitar and his banjo playing scares the crap out of me.\u201d\n\u2013 David Lindley, musical adventurer\n\nVery few musicians of any stripe so personify a musical genre as completely as Tony Furtado embodies Americana roots music. Tony is an evocative and soulful singer, a wide-ranging songwriter and a virtuoso multi-instrumentalist adept on banjo, cello-banjo, slide guitar and baritone ukulele who mixes and matches sounds and styles with the flair of a master chef (he\u2019s also an accomplished sculptor, but that\u2019s another story). All of the music of America is in Tony\u2019s music. Relix hit the nail on the head when writing of Tony: \u201cTrue talent doesn\u2019t need categories.\u201d\n\nA native of Pleasanton, California, who now makes his home in Portland, Oregon, Tony Furtado took up the banjo at age 12, inspired by the Beverly Hillbillies TV show and a sixth grade music report. He first attracted national attention in 1987, when he won the National Bluegrass Banjo Championship in Winfield, Kansas. Not long after that, Tony opted for the life of a full-time professional musician, joining Laurie Lewis & Grant Street. A second victory at Winfield, in 1991, bookended his years with Grant Street.\n\nIn 1990, Tony signed a recording deal with Rounder Records, one of the country\u2019s preeminent independent record companies. Beginning with Swamped in 1990, he recorded six critically acclaimed albums for the label, collaborating with such master musicians as Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Tim O\u2019Brien, Stuart Duncan, Kelly Joe Phelps and Mike Marshall. During this period, Tony also performed and recorded with the band Sugarbeat and the Rounder Banjo Extravaganza with Tony Trischka and Tom Adams.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s\u2014influenced by such musical heroes as Ry Cooder, David Lindley and Taj Mahal\u2014Tony added slide guitar, singing and songwriting to his musical toolbox and began leading his own band. He is a tireless road musician who performs in a dizzying variety of formats: solo, in a duo or trio or with his full five-person band. He especially values the opportunities he has had to tour with such legendary musicians as Gregg Allman and with such esteemed slide guitarists as David Lindley, Derek Trucks and Sonny Landreth.\n\nTony has performed throughout the world at top venues and appeared at such prestigious music festivals as the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Jazz Aspen, Kerrville Folk Festival, Strawberry Music Festival, Winnipeg Folk Festival, Sisters Folk Festival, San Jose Jazz Festival and countless others. \u201cI love playing live,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my energy is focused on the love of playing music and rolling with the moment. It\u2019s a give and take from the audience to the stage, and back. And the music that is created is something that otherwise might not occur without that flow.\u201d\n\nTony has recorded and produced almost a dozen CDs for various labels such as Dualtone, What Are Records and Funzalo Records. Tony enthusiastically describes his newest CD, The Bell, as \u201cthe most personal of my career.\u201d To be released this summer on his own YousayFurtado Records, The Bell is an important release for several reasons: it represents a return to Tony\u2019s banjo-playing roots, with the banjo and cello-banjo more prominent than in recent years; the original songs concern such weighty themes as the loss of his father, the birth of his son and his own creative rebirth with the move to a new record label and management team; his working band is featured; and, most important of all, this is the first album in a long time on which Tony had complete artistic control.

Catching his break after winning a Beatport remix contest in 2012 with his dubstep-\nfocused version of Above & Beyond\u2019s \u201cYou Got to Go\u201d, Seven Lions, born Jeff Montalvo, garnered early support\nfrom the likes of Skrillex and his OWSLA label. 2013 tour dates with Porter Robinson and Krewella pushed\nMontalvo and his genre-bending production style to the forefront of the modern electronic music scene.\nPutting sheer technical production prowess to work in soulful, deep, hybridized creations all distinctly his\nown, the multi-talented musician is single-handedly changing the sonic landscape for future generations to come\nby bridging the gap between the soaring, ethereal vibe of trance and intensely adrenalizing bass music. His\nproductions have seen stages at world-renowned festivals such as Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival\n(New York and Las Vegas), Electric Forrest, Electric Zoo, South by Southwest, and HARD.\nAfter several successful releases under the OWSLA label (his debut EP, Days to Come, reached #2 on\nthe iTunes Dance charts), Montalvo released his highly anticipated 2014 follow-up EP, Worlds Apart, on Republic\nRecords\u2019 dance imprint Casablanca. Containing several notable features which include Ellie Goulding and Tove\nLo, Worlds Apart debuted at #1 on the iTunes Dance charts, and the title track was also featured in Billboard\u2019s\n\u201cTop 10 Electronic/Dance Songs of 2014\u201d list. The EP also featured the smash hit and canonical dance track\n\u2018Strangers\u2019, featuring superstar vocalist Tove Lo. \u2018Strangers\u2019 was a definitive track in what was perhaps the peak\nof American electronic dance music, and solidified Seven Lions as one of the scene\u2019s premier artists.\nIn 2015, Seven Lions began releasing music in EP formats, devoting each EP to a cohesive idea and\nworld found within the Seven Lions universe. 2015\u2019s \u201cThe Throes of Winter\u201d hints at a larger seasonal theme, to\nbe continued through to his future releases. When asked about the spark for this vision, he explains, \"Since\nartists aren't releasing proper albums anymore, it makes sense to create something that's digitally artistic with real\ncohesion as opposed to tossing out singles and just haphazardly seeing what sticks\u2026 I wanted to start making\nthe music more thematic, interesting, and part of something larger.\u201d\nBucking more trends and breaking from convention, his 2016 Creation EP [Casablanca Records] followed\na different path for his latest body of work. \u201cThis time, songwriting really took place on guitar,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere\nare more acoustic elements in the songs, and that ties it together. I wanted to get a little more experimental. I\ndidn\u2019t worry if something was going to be a big banger on the dancefloor or not. I just made what felt right at the\ntime.\u201d Ultimately, Seven Lions continues challenging himself and musical genres. \u201cI want to do something\ndifferent,\u201d he concludes. \u201cEverything doesn\u2019t have to fit into just one genre. I want people to walk away loving\ndifferent kinds of music and sounds.\u201d\nThis year saw Seven Lions once more travel across the country on his There and Back Again club-\nfocused tour, in addition to hallmark festival appearances at Tomorrowland, EDC Las Vegas, Life in Color, EDC\nJapan, Middlelands, Electric Zoo, and Paradiso, amongst others. This summer the sound-sculptor unveiled his\nhighly-anticipated Where I Wont Be Found EP as well, continuing his always growing world, identified via these\nannual EP projects. The eight-track offering is a wondrous journey from start to. From the heavily streamed and\ncritically praised \u201cFreesol,\u201d to the energetic future bass collaboration \u201cRescue Me\u201d with scene upstart Unlike Pluto,\nWhere I Wont Be Found reminds fans of what made Seven Lions who he is today - a singular talent in electronic\nmusic, and a producer who has always forged his own lane.\nIn support of the EP and the year as a whole, Seven Lions will wrap up 2017 with a 20 date North\nAmerican headlining tour with Tritonal (and Kill The Noise as support).

After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ben Rice Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9298115.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Americana, Blues-rock, Funk, Blues", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Three time Blues Music Award nominee, Ben Rice is from Portland Oregon.

Stamped with her affinity for finely crafted melodies and intricate storytelling, the project encompasses a blend of American music melding Rock, Soul, Rhythm and Blues, Country and Gospel. Maggie's recent album Change The Whole Thing was named by Rolling Stone as one of the \"Best Albums of 2018.\"\n\nThe resilient powerhouse recorded this album at the famed Starstruck Studios in Nashville, TN implementing an impressively demanding method highlighting an artist in complete command of her ever-evolving creative process: live with her 13-piece \u201cfamily band\u201d in one take, no overdubs, no bullshit and a sound that is best described by the following quote from Rolling Stone:\n\n\u201cMaggie Rose has come into her own with this current earth-conscious, trippy country-soul stage of her ever-evolving musical persona...Rose\u2019s performances [during CMA Fest and Bonnaroo] showed her embracing her inner soul diva, belting with fire on \u2018It's You\u2019 and the pulverizing \u2018Pull You Through.\u2019 Just to drive the point home, Rose and her band even stretched out on a swinging cover of \u2018The Letter,\u2019 doing a more-than-respectable impression of the funky Mad Dogs & Englishmen arrangement originally sung by Joe Cocker.\u201d\n\nLeading to the Fall album launch, Rose incrementally released four Digital 45s from her forthcoming project beginning in October 2017 to both satisfy and build the anticipation of her growing fanbase. The initial 45 earned her a spot in the Top 10 on Sirius XM with the \u201csmoldering\u201d A-side, \u201cPull You Through.\u201d The \u201cpulverizing\u201d single was hailed by Rolling Stone as a \u201csoulful ballad that rejoices in the healing powers of love...a bare-bones track [that is] really a showcase for the Dusty Springfield-worthy vocals of Rose\u2026\u201d.\n\nIn Spring of 2018, Maggie released \"It's You\" and \"Smooth.\" Rolling Stone once again praised Maggie Rose with \"It's You\" as \u201ca giant, throwback Soul ballad that shows off her dynamic vocals [containing] shades of Aretha Franklin,\u201d and also praised \"Smooth\" as \"a supremely funky rocker with hints of Grace Potter [and] Janis Joplin\".\n\nThe enthusiasm surrounding each Digital 45 release has continually increased the appetite of her fans while relentlessly expanding her following via radio, streaming platforms and through her captivating live performances. The full-length album will feature 12 songs, 12 live in-studio videos, with a full-access behind-the-scenes one-hour musical documentary which peels back the layers and allows the viewer an intimate look into the making of the album.\n\nRose has been named to YouTube\u2019s Emerging Artist and Artist in Residence 2018 programs, and Pandora named her an Artist to Watch 2018. In June, Maggie\u2019s creative breadth and versatility sparked the first-ever partnership between Prescription Songs and Sea Gayle Music, with the two companies signing a joint-venture publishing agreement with Rose. In July, she was tapped for an as-named synchronization deal that lends her voice to a national ad campaign focusing on Women\u2019s Empowerment.\n\nIn 2018, Maggie Rose has played over 150 dates across the world including\nBonnaroo Music and Arts Festival and The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, while sharing the stage with artists such as Kelly Clarkson, Julia Michaels, Brandy Clark, and Bob Weir of Grateful Dead.", "otherInfo": "Join us LIVE on Thursday May 28th at 9pm CT for the Official \u201cHELP MYSELF\u201d Virtual Release Party, Song Premiere and Concert.

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. He\u2019s never more than one degree away from a powerful musical hook-up.", "otherInfo": "Cecil B.

With the prolific duo\u2019s meteoric rise a true testament to their hard work in the studio and infectious energy in the club, a slew of early releases via imprints such as Viva, and elrow helped rocket the pair to their first Beatport Number #1 with their breakthrough record on Hot Creations, \u2018Tribesmen\u2019.\n\nHaving later released EPs on Toolroom Records, Lee Foss\u2019 Repopulate Mars and Green Velvet\u2019s Relief Records, Solardo soon branched out into their now iconic Sola imprint - which soon became a home for a flurry of the most predominant tech-house tracks on the circuit. With over 50 releases on the label with tracks from the likes of Max Chapman, Mason Maynard, and Grammy nominated duo CamelPhat - who Mark & James worked with on collaborative club track \u2018Accelerator\u2019, the label has gone from strength to strength hosting parties at the BPM Festival, The Warehouse Project and its own club showcase at The Source in Maidstone.\n\nAfter being assigned remixes for the likes of MK, David Guetta, Black Coffee, Nicole Moudaber & Carl Cox, Solardo\u2019s success hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed and they signed to Ultra Music. Since then, the pair have gone onto release hits \u2018Be Somebody\u2019, \u2018Tango Wango\u2019 and their latest release \u2018XTC\u2019. Arguably the duo\u2019s most successful release to date, the track has been an anthem for them and many DJ\u2019s alike with it being hailed as one of the tracks of the summer in Ibiza. So much so, BBC Radio 1 used it to promote all of their big weekend in Ibiza adverts - where Mark & James also played - whilst it was championed by Annie Mac (Hottest Record In The World), Pete Tong, Danny Howard (Friday Fire) & MistaJam (#1 Radio 1 dance charts) across the station. The tracks' success didn\u2019t end there, with it being voted thewinner of \u2018best track of the year\u2019 at the DJ Mag Best of British awards.\n\nThe love didn\u2019t stop there for the lads, towards the end of 2019 they hooked up with legendary producer Marshall Jefferson to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of one of the most iconic house tunes \u2018Move Your Body\u2019. With the lads touch, the track has been reborn into a modern day anthem only proven by it dominating the Beatport charts (the release was No.1 for 46 days which is an all time record!), being added to BBC Radio 1\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 list for three weeks straight and Scott Mills & BBC Radio 1 themselves selecting it for \u2018Tune Of The Weekend\u2019. With support coming from all corners of the globe, the release peaked at #1 in Sweden, #5 in the UK and #27 worldwide in the Spotify viral charts, and was in the top 100 Shazam\u2019s in 5 countries, peaking at #7 in the UK.\n\nMusic aside, the duo\u2019s presence on the road is ever growing. After selling out The Warehouse Project and London\u2019s Studio 338 with their brand new event series HIGHER, the pair took HIGHER on the road with successful stage takeovers at the likes of Higher Vision in Ireland and Mysteryland in Holland, where Eric Morillo, Skream & Groove Armada came and played. Mark & James also found the time to fit in over 30 major festivals throughout the course of 2019 including sets at Glastonbury, Creamfields, Parklife, Holyship, Babylon Festival, Tomorrowland (x2), EDC Las Vegas, We Are FSTVL, Beyond Wonderland, Snowbombing and their first Ultra Music Festival in Miami where they launched collaborative project SoPhat alongside Camelphat.\n\nFollowing on from their Club Solardo residency in the club room at Hi Ibiza last year, the duo launched their brand new record breaking 12 week residency BODYWORKS (again at Hi Ibiza) with themselves and Camelphat hosting the theatre, and FISHER in the club room. During the course of the summer, BODYWORKS broke numerous club records with over 7000+ people through the doors on multiple occasions and an estimated 90,000 passing through over the 12 weeks. With guests including Enzo Siragusa, Heidi, Danny Howard, Mason Maynard and many more, it just goes to show what a force theyhave now become on the island.\n\nThe duo\u2019s own radio show named \u2018The Spot\u2019 continues to go from strength to strength. Fast approaching it\u2019s 100th episode, they have so far had guests such as Claude VonStroke, Nicole Moudaber, Andrea Oliva, Gorgon City, MK, Skream and Kenny Dope all contributing guest mixes for the pair.

And that\u2019s exactly what Night Slugs co-founder aka L-Vis 1990 is doing under his Dance System guise.\u201d DUMMY\n\nAt the forefront of dance music for over a decade, L-Vis 1990 has left an indelible mark as a progressive producer; including his alias Dance System.\n\nDance System boils dance music down to its core elements to create infectious club tools with character that will standout in any set. Following releases on Clone and Ultramajic, Dance System took a five-year hiatus and is excited to return with the Wind 'Em Up EP, released on April 12th on Modeselektor\u2019s lauded Monkeytown Records.\n\nIn today\u2019s serious techno world, and against the current political landscape, Dance System is the playful breath of fresh air we all want and need. With influence from Dance Mania and Relief Records, Dance System takes a nod from Chicago, but makes a new sound distinctly his own.\n\nIndeed, on title track Wind Em Up, Dance System is playfully calling out for other DJs to do exactly that; wind up the crowd with the unexpected UK garage breaks that bring colour to the driving beat and guitar lick. Heeez Baaad takes a single hypnotic loop and pushes it to its absolute limit, the only break coming when the track slows down to a halt, before slamming straight back into the action. Bringing in the horns on That That Sh**, the off\u2013kilter horn loop is unsettling, but driven along by the low end tom groove.

He rapidly broke through onto the Garage pirate radio stations and forums gaining instant recognition, and was subsequently snapped up by international promoters to perform tours of Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Russia. Majestic has since crossed into a multitude of dance music genres from UK Garage to House to Drum & Bass and Dubstep performing with leading artists across the scene such as Sigma, DJ EZ, Dream Teem, Agent X, MJ Cole, Judge Jules, Micky Slim, Jack Beats, Laidback Luke, The Wideboys, Netsky, High Contrast, Loadstar, Shy FX, Skream, Bar9, Nero and Jacob Plant to name a few.\n\nAs well as a legendary MC known for being risqu\u00e9 in spreading his word, Majestic is also making waves as an artist in his own right. His single \u201cIn The VIP\u201d written and produced with the Wideboys that took a satirical look at the VIP Club culture, was released on Skint Records. After receiving serious hits on YouTube and Radio Support from MistaJam, DJ Target, Kissy Sell Out and Steve Smart on heavy rotation, the record also made its way onto the MOS Bass Culture annual.\nMajestic\u2019s lyrical flow then caught the eye of American Dubstep superstar Skrillex who sampled Majestics legendary, almost anthemic, \u201cRuffneck Bass\u201d spit for his latest massive single of the same title, played by the worlds biggest DJs and over 50m views online.\n\nAfter signing up to be Dubstep wonderkid, Jacob Plant\u2019s official hype man, the pair released, \u201cMosh Pit\u201d on Speakerbox. Majestic has been in the studio collaborating on a number of cutting edge tracks they intend to PA live at their shows. They have already performed for massive student brand Under The Radar on their tour dates up and down the country, as well as for Fresher\u2019s events at all the leading Universities in the UK. Plus having just wowed the crowd at Brighton\u2019s Shakedown festival performing on the main stage in front of 8000 revellers, in-between Razorlight and Example, they are certainly heading for superstar status!\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder Majestic is in demand to perform Live, with Mistajam quoting Majestic as being the \u201cbest live MC in the game\u201d after requesting him to perform alongside him at Exit festival in Serbia and Eddie Temple Morris bringing him onboard The Big Reunion Shows this winter not to mention continuing tours with The Wideboys, the hype has only just begun. After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece. Majestic is also opening for the Prodigy as part of his festival looks with Kiss FM UK.\n\nSo with the Majestic message travelling fast, hyping the crowd into a frenzy, Majestic takes on the role of grand puppeteer, from waiving lighters in the air to chanting back at the DJ, his commands are dutifully followed and quite a sight to behold. Through years of hard graft, quite literally behind the scene, Majestic has studied the sound of the underground for well over a decade.

He doesn't need an award to prove his popularity and he won't act cool to keep his credibility. The host of Radio 1's ground-breaking Essential Selection show for a staggering eight years, he works within the mainstream, but is respected by the underground.\n\nBorn in Dartford, educated in Rochester and inspired in his teens by the underground soul scene of the late seventies (and the music of the time...by the likes of Funkadelic, James Brown & Evelyn \"Champagne\" King) Pete's first DJ job was at a wedding. He was 15 years old. A natural born entrepreneur, he began promoting local bands, booking gigs in a nearby town hall and - as part of the Kent 'Soul Mafia' - playing black soul & dance music in every club that would give him a gig. After leaving school, he bought a Transit van and set up his own sound system.\n\nIn 1979, Pete became a journalist for monthly magazine Blues & Soul. By the following year, he was features editor, a position he would hold until '83. At the same time, he was appearing on local radio stations such as BBC Radio Medway and London. Then he got his first break with Radio 1, presenting a regular 15 minute 'magazine' feature on dance music on Peter Powell's show. \"That was a strange experience, but also very exciting,\" says Pete. \"Radio 1 was at the peak of its popularity. I had to say what was happening on the streets. I was the first person to play Malcolm McLaren's Buffalo Gals on the radio.\"\n\nPete's knowledge of the dance underground, coupled with his ear for a crossover hit, saw him appointed A&R manager at newly-founded independent label London Records in '83. While looking after the careers of pop acts like '80s girl group Bananarama, he continued to pursue his budding radio career. Put off daytime shows by the discovery that the DJs didn't pick their own playlists, Pete accepted his own programme on Kent's newly-launched Invicta station in '84. Influenced by radio DJ heroes such as Robbie Vincent, Greg Edwards and Emperor Rosko, he hosted a soul show there for three years, before briefly returning to Radio London. Almost immediately, however, he was poached by Capital Radio, where his weekly dance programme became cult listening with London clubbers.\n\nIn '88, in the wake of Acid House, Pete launched his own record label, FFRR, through London Records. His aim was to both embrace the new wave of electronic music flooding into the country from cities such as Detroit and Chicago, and continue to promote his first love, black dance artists. \"The first record I put out was a very cool, quite sexually-explicit single from Chicago called Baby Wants To Ride,\" he recalls. \"I had a rule which was to sign one relatively-indulgent record to every potential big hit. I was aware from the start that you can be hip, but you also have to balance the books.\"\n\nInevitably, Pete managed to do both, simultaneously. FFRR's next releases were cut'n'paste production 'Bass (How Low Can You Go?)' by Simon Harris and Salt'n'Pepa's 'Push It', both cool club tracks which went on to storm the charts. They were followed by a stream of influential hits from signings such as Steve 'Silk' Hurley, D Mob, Smith & Mighty, Cookie Crew, L'il Louis The Brand New Heavies, Orbital and, of course, Goldie.\n\nIn '91, with an indigenous club culture now thriving in cities across the UK, Pete quit Capital Radio to go national. His Essential Selection show every Friday evening instantly established itself as a welcome to the weekend for a new generation of young clubbers. Heavy on house, but with room for the best breaking techno, jungle, hip hop, funk and soul sounds from both Britain and around the world, it appealed to all tastes in contemporary dance music. Moreover, it merged the cutting-edge with the mainstream. Pete became the country's best-known dance DJ, while keeping his credibility intact. \"I'm not too concerned with credibility,\" he claims. \"When I started out, I was obsessed by jazz-funk and soul. I couldn't see life beyond the end of a Donald Byrd album. I was prepared to punch anyone who tried to talk to me about other types of music. But I grew up and discovered that I love hearing new sounds and having my perceptions changed. I didn't want to be pigeon-holed. I also realised that I could achieve much more by staying on the edge of several scenes, rather than being immersed in just the one.\"\n\nPerhaps Pete's biggest contribution to British pop to date was his involvement in the reshaping of BBC Radio 1. When the nation's biggest radio station decided to re-invent itself in the mid-'90s, controller Matthew Bannister knew precisely who to ask for help. After Pete's ideas were taken on board, the likes of Tim Westwood, Danny Rampling, Judge Jules, Carl Cox and, more recently, Fabio and Grooverider, started to appear on Radio 1's DJ roster. In addition, the station's daytime playlist began to reflect the extent of the impact of modern electronic music on British kids. In January '99, Pete enters his eighth year as the presenter of Essential Selection. With over a million and a half listeners each week, it remains the UK's most popular dance music radio show, thanks to its host's consistent ability to change with the times. Its success has also spawned a series of compilation albums, released by FFRR, which to date have sold over 750,000 copies. The latest - which boasts a tangerine-themed cover and the mixing talents of Tong, Paul Oakenfold and, if you're lucky enough to bag a limited edition copy with a bonus CD, Carl Cox - comes complete with Madonna's seal of approval. It is the first time ever that the singer has sanctioned the appearance of one of her songs (Drowned World) on a dance mix compilation.\n\nDuring '98, Pete made his first forays into television, an area he is keen to explore. In November, he donned different guises to present Clublife, a 90-minute, BBC-broadcast documentary based on Mixmag magazine's annual dance awards. However, when he does appear with his own TV programme, it won't be for want of publicity. In the past, he has turned down offers to present Radio 1's high-profile breakfast and Top 40 shows, not to mention Top Of The Pops.\n\nIn the meantime, Pete has plenty on his plate. He is a director of Wise Buddah, the production company which makes radio programmes presented by Danny Rampling, Seb Fontiane and Judge Jules and continues to work in A&R for London Records. His pop star credentials include A&R-ing Shakespeare Sister's hit Stay, which topped the charts for six weeks in '92, and played a big role in signing All Saints, whose career he continues to oversee. He was recently musical director on films, Human Traffic and The Beach.\n\nThe year 2000 proved to be a milestone for Pete - he toured the US for the first time which saw queues around the block, he played on the terrace at Space in Ibiza for the first time, he played in Cape Town and Johannesburg and hosted his own float at Radio 1's 'Love Parade' - \"standing on my float with Jon Carter and Darren Emerson in front of 250,000 Radio 1 listeners was just the best feeling ever - a real moment in history\".\n\n2001 is proving to be an equally exciting year for Pete with another tour of the States starting in March and his first tour of South America scheduled for later in the year.\n\nKeeping his feet on the ground in the UK, Pete continues to be a valuable part of the British club scene with regular gigs scheduled at Tribal Sessions at Sankey Soap in Manchester, Code in Birmingham and many other credible commitments. He still remains a key figure at the UK summer festivals including for the first time a performance at T-In The Park as well as his yearly appointment at Creamfields and Homelands (Foot and mouth permitting).\n\nPete's Radio 1 show \"The Essential Selection\" is now the most listened to radio show on the internet attracting a global audience of over 12 million.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Franky Wah ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9033966.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Yorkshire Producer / Dj- House and Techno with a chance of Disco\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/frankywahmusic\nhttps://twitter.com/frankywahmusic\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/3IG3Ub4ra8AuSxCFDVkVco?si=1CsOEkySS4KKFeARUW1ZTA\nhttps://soundcloud.com/frankywah\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/franky-wah/1316289895", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "CAAL ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Wehbba ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8725741.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Techno", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Electronic Music Artist\nhttp://twitter.com/wehbba\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/wehbba\nManagement:\nleticia@vanriel.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hitch ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6388178.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Post Hardcore, Punk", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hitch are from Kortrijk, Belgium and have released records on Goodlife, Delboy, Vlas Vegas and Divot records.

Influenced in its beginnings by techno and drum&bass, his technical skills, ability to connect with the crowd and he\u2019s diverse musical style has made him one of the most versatile DJ\u00b4s in Spain. Over the past 5 years De La Swing has shared turntables with different top level Djs as Marco Carola, Loco Dice, Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Laurent Garnier, Joseph Capriati, Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch, Paco Osuna or Vitalic among others, and has played at festivals like Monegros Desert Festival (Spain), Eastern Electric Festival (London), Kingsday Madness (Holland), We are Together (Marseille), Plages Electroniques (Cannes), Ultra Cape Town/Johannesburg & Origin Festival (South Africa), resulting rapidly a well-known and familiar Dj in countries as Spain, France, Italy and Holland. Since 2010 this Madrid born is one of the emblematic ElRow residents, the after hour based in the ever growing electronic hub of Barcelona, that has become one of the best clubs worldwide, brainchild of the organisers of Europe's only desert festival, Monegros, and owners of the acclaimed techno club Florida 135 in Fraga, Huesca. Equally important are his recent El Row residencies during the summer season in Privilege Ibiza -in 2012 and 2013- and Space Ibiza in 2014. De la Swing is that type of non-conformist artist which lives in a continuous sound evolution, where the depth, darkness and fun are always present in his sets and throughout which he shows his creativity and innovation on stage, driving his passion and vibrancy to create a different story every time, while establishing a unique connection with the crowd. While in the studio, De la Swing is a solid and fertile mind being in charge of different labels as Elrow Music, Florida Music & Ker Recordings, having also produced and remixed for labels like Form, Drakos Recordings and Amazing Lab. However, his skills and abilities go further on. We can also enjoy its more underground side with his aka \u2018Smoke Signal\u2019, usually as resident in Ker Club Barcelona once a month, sharing his talent with artists such as Martinez Brothers, Art Department, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Seth Troxler, Scuba or Los Suruba.

In fact, with seven studio albums and more than 2.3 million Facebook fans, he is one of techno's biggest superstars. In a time where the big drops of EDM (Electronic Dance Music) and cake-throwing DJs seem to reign supreme, Paul Kalkbrenner is keeping his cool. He trusts on his remarkable talent as a producer and live act\u2014no added artificial flashiness needed. He can rave with the best of them, and raise his arms to full dancefloor delirium, but his head will never spin right off.\n\nPaul Kalkbrenner's demanding compositions are full of energy; they exist to take listeners away from the everyday, from the weekly grind, into rapture\u2014into art, ecstasy, absurdity friendship, hope and love.\n\nJust 12 years old when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Kalkbrenner watched as East Berlin became an anarchic playground for a previously oppressed generation, recently freed from an overbearing state. Techno music became a way of expression and for many, Paul included, the soundtrack of Germany's reunification. In the autumn of 1992, together with his friend Sascha Funke, he started DJing at local youth clubs. Very quickly Paul and Sascha were either DJing or obsessively collecting records as electronic dance music's first tidal wave spilled over dance floors in Berlin's soon-to-be legendary clubs Tresor, Planet, Walfisch and e-werk.\n\nAt 18, he took a job at German television, spending his days sitting and editing suites watching as staid German political parties held national conferences. This would make him enough money to buy equipment to produce his own tracks. As much fun as DJing was, Paul wanted to play his own music live.\n\nHis first tracks were released on Ellen Allien's newly founded Bpitch Control label in 1999. In contrast to the darker, monotone sounds that characterized techno at the time, Paul's music was more melodic and enriched with a warm, dubby feel. After a number of 12\" singles, Paul realised he was better suited producing albums. In 2000, he released \u2018Superimpose\u2019, followed by \u2018Zeit\u2019 one year later. His third album, \u2018Self\u2019 from 2004, resonated beyond the dancefloor and took the cinematic quality of his music to new heights\u2014an indication of what was to come next.\n\nIn 2004, Berlin-based film director and self-confessed Kalkbrenner fan, Hannes Stoehr, got in touch with Paul. He was planning to make a movie about an electronic musician in Berlin's techno scene and wanted Paul to produce the soundtrack. As the script for the film developed, Hannes suggested Paul might be perfect in the starring role.\n\nTogether with his old friend Sascha Funke, he moved to Aix en Provence for six months. There, far away from Berlin's dreary winter, Paul produced some of his most diverse and mature compositions yet, which would later make up the soundtrack for \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019. He started shooting the movie upon his return to Berlin, with the result being an unconventional but outstanding performance. Somewhere between Paul Kalkbrenner and his character Ickarus, an intimate dialogue developed between actor and audience.\n\n\u2018Berlin Calling\u2019 became a surprise hit, and a German cult movie in its own right. It drew audiences all around Europe and stayed on the big screen at Berlin's Central Kino for several years. The soundtrack went platinum and the single \"Sky and Sand\", featuring his brother Fritz Kalkbrenner's vocals, spent over 121 weeks in the German singles charts\u2014a German record.\n\nAt the end of 2009, Paul split with his longtime label Bpitch Control to form his own independent imprint, Paul Kalkbrenner Musik. A sold-out European tour and a documentary followed. Made with the help of the \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019 team, Max Penzel and Hannes Stoehr, \u20182010 - A Live Documentary\u2019 featured an 8-camera shoot of 15 live shows, with computer graphics created by Pfadfinderei (who also worked on \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019). The documentary remains an intimate insight into Paul's life on the road, sprinkled with his dry, deadpan humour.\n\nBetween June 2011 and November 2012 Paul released his fifth and sixth studio albums \u2018Icke Wieder\u2019 and \u2018Guten Tag\u2019. These two self-released albums are Paul's bestselling albums yet\u2014both went top five in his native Germany, with \u2018Guten Tag also topping the charts in Switzerland.\n\nNot one to rest on his laurels, Paul returned to the studio soon after, but this time made a conscious decision to take his time and explore new avenues of his sound. While working on new tracks, flipping samples and experimenting, Germany's Federal Government asked him to play a headlining live show in front of the Brandenburg Gate in a historic ceremony commemorating the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was another milestone moment in Paul's career. The framed thank-you note he received from the Government afterwards has a special place in his apartment.\n\nAfter 15 years of releasing on independent labels (ten years at Bpitch Control and five on his own label), Paul decided to take the next step and signed a long-term deal with Sony International/Columbia in March 2015. Enthused by this new chapter in his career and incited by the pressure a deal like this is usually accompanied by, Paul went back to his studio to finish his seventh studio album and create a new live show.\n\nThe album, aptly titled \u20187\u2019, was released through Columbia Records in August 2015, and it saw Paul work with vocals for the first time since his chart-topping, record-breaking single \"Sky and Sand\". In an unprecedented move by the label, Sony and Columbia provided him total access to their Legacy vaults, allowing him to incorporate vocals from previously-unsampled music icons Luther Vandross and Jefferson Airplane. The album was a success across Europe, hitting No. 1 on the charts in Austria, Switzerland, and his native Germany; and earning plaudits from the New York Times, Village Voice, Mixmag, and others.\n\nFollowing \u20187\u2019\u2019s success, Paul continued to blaze new milestones, becoming the first techno artist to grace long-running European institution Tomorrowland\u2019s main stage in July 2016. At the end of the day, though, he always comes back to his underground Berlin roots, which he celebrated with his \u201cBack to the Future\u201d mixtape series, a trilogy that chronicles his personal history of electronic music\u2019s arrival to Germany as heard on the radio during his teenage years. The series went viral, amassing over 490K downloads and 502K streams, prompting rumors of a live experience in 2017.", "otherInfo": "Join me this Friday 5pm CET for Studiosession #2.

The album gained rave notices from publications like Billboard and Stereophile, and has been followed by two more albums.\n\nAdditionally, Corky has written and performed works for the Grant Park Symphony in Chicago (most recently Blues for a Green Planet-Opus 10) and the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center. He composedContinuum with renowned choreographers Alwin Nikolais and Murray Louis, and his music has also been choreographed and performed by five international ballet companies and has been used for numerous motion pictures and national TV specials, as well as the Olympic men\u2019s figure skating competition and the World Championship skating competition featuring Olympic gold medalists Torvill and Dean. His recent commission from the Lancaster Symphony Orchestra, The Symphonic Blues Suite, has already been performed many times around the world.\n\nCorky continues to appear internationally as guest soloist with symphony orchestras including the New York Philharmonic, Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Orquestra Metropolitana De Lisboa in Portugal, the Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal, the NHK Symphony in Japan, and the Philadelphia Orchestra with Maestro Charles Dutoit. He has performed many symphonic collaborations with Doc Severinsen, and also tours frequently with Dr. L. Subramaniam, India\u2019s greatest Eastern classical violin virtuoso: These \u201cglobal fusion\u201d tours have further featured some of the top names in jazz including Ernie Watts and Larry Coryell.\n\nMeanwhile, Corky continues to perform with Siegel-Schwall, which in addition to Schwall and longtime bassist Rollo Radford, includes drummer Sam Lay, a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee as a member of the Paul Buttefield Blues Band. He is prominently featured in the acclaimed documentary Born in Chicago, which recounts the history of the \u201860s rock-blues explosion and also stars Bob Dylan, Jack White, Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, Eric Burdon and Steve Miller, as well as Barry Goldberg, Harvey Mandel and Nick Gravenites; he has recorded and toured with Goldberg, Mandel, Gravenites and Lay as the Chicago Blues Reunion.\n\nIn 2007 Corky published the music guide book Let Your Music Soar: The Emotional Connection, co-written with Peter Krammer. And his harmonica playing accompanies the storytelling of award-winning Mexican American young adult novelist Pam Mu\u00f1oz Ryan in the audio book version of her 2015 book Echo, a mysterious tale involving a prophecy, a promise and, of course, a harmonica.\n\nby Jim Bessman\n\nhttp://www.chamberblues.com", "otherInfo": "Every Tue & Friday at 11:20 AM in Chicago - Completely home-made live stream in the little home of Corky and Holly.

This fresh-faced native of Southampton, England, was merely playing into his love of funkadelic hip-hop and crooning urban stylings when he started writing songs as a teenager. His love for Terence Trent D'Arby, Sisqo, and Donnell Jones allowed him to put his creative love for art, culture, and history into a musical beat all his own. And the new millennium belonged to him and garage had been redefined.\n\nBorn Craig Ashley David on May 5, 1981, David was slicing and dicing ragga and R&B on the local station PCRS 106.5FM and found himself playing club gigs prior to rubbing elbows with some of music's finest. It was during this time he hooked with Artful Dodger's Mark Hill. After winning a national writing competition, Craig was more than ready to start producing with Hill. His big break came when he put his own additives on Damage's \"I'm Ready,\" a B-side to \"Wonderful Tonight.\" Soon thereafter he remixed his own version of Human League's \"Human\" and started himself a regular spot in area clubs during the weekends. \"Rewind\" was another underground smash, specifically a definitive move for David. His respect for Stevie Wonder, Faith Evans, and R. Kelly was most apparent, however his own vocal talent was beginning to shine. He and Hill's specialty show on Capital Radio provided another outlet for David to shape his musical work of genius. \"Fill Me In\" proved yet another hit, shooting straight to number one in summer 2000. David was now the youngest British male solo artist to have a number one single. He was 19-years-old.\n\nA deal with Wildstar Records in the U.K. sparked toward the end of the summer as \"Re-Rewind\" and \"7 Days\" gained praise in late November. A stateside agreement with Atlantic also led to more global hype. He had sold 3.5 million records worldwide and garage was finally becoming massive overseas and it was David's debut Born to Do It that was at the head.\n\nBut not all were pulling for this R&B prodigy. Aside from winning three awards at the MOBO's in October, Craig David walked away empty handed at the 2000 Brit Awards in February 2001. He was up for six nominations, including Best British Male Solo Artist, Best British Newcomer, and Best British Single for \"7 Days,\" but industry politics fell into operation. Many mainstream stars came to David's defense, artists such as Elton John, U2, and Robbie Williams, professing their disgust for the ill recognition for David and his musical efforts in the past year. Death threats soon followed for the superstar in spring 2001 as he took the stage in a show in London. An anonymous caller claimed a soldier would injure David with tear gas and hand grenades. Still, his record sales continued to soar in the U.K. with sales of Born to Do It increasing over 100 percent after his dismal beginning months of 2001. He bombared American Shores with a deal with Atlantic and released Born to Do It stateside in summer 2001. Mainstream radio flocked to him immediately. Missy Elliott, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, and Usher called themselves fans.\n\nThe next year, things didn't simmer down for the now international pop star. Craig David returned with a sophomore effort Slicker Than Your Average in November 2002. This particular album saw a much grittier side from David. Debut single \"What's Your Flava?\" also became one of the year's hottest singles.\n\nIn 2005 he released his 3rd album \"The Story Goes...\", the first single of the album, \"All The Way\", returned him to the top three, and the second single, \"Don't Love You No More (I'm Sorry)\", tied with \"7 Days\" as his longest running single in the charts since \"Rewind\", spending 15 weeks inside the UK top 75. However, the album's third single, \"Unbelievable\", debuted and peaked at #18 in March 2006.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated with UK rapper Kano on his upcoming album London Town, for the single \"This is the Girl\". The track was released on August 27, 2007 and debuted at #18 on the UK charts.\n\nThe first single \"Hot Stuff\" from the album Trust Me, was released on November 5, 2007 . The single was a top ten hit, whilst the album charted at #18 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\"6 of 1 Thing\", the second single to be taken from Trust Me charted at thirty-nine on the UK Singles Chart, becoming his second lowest charting single to date.\n\nHis UK tour will start in June 2008, details of which can be found on the official website.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Duo Laroo/Byrd ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8323845.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "11th free Friday Feelgood 45-minutes concert by our Duo Laroo/Byrd, home-made live and streamed with originals and classics.

We hope Canada will share her with us.\u201d (Hot Indie Music Review) Krystle Dos Santos has taken her experience from the Canadian College of Performing Arts, and transformed it into the beginnings of a career already full of achievements. Unveiling her talents to the public with her 2008 full length self-titled debut, Dos Santos was instantly recognized as a force by the Western Canadian Music Awards, winning the Urban Recording of the Year. That same album charted for six weeks on CJSR FM88\u2019s Urban chart and was top ten on 92.5 The X in Kamloops, BC. One of the single\u2019s from the album even appeared in an Episode of ABC\u2019s Samantha Who? But to simply classify Dos Santos as a recording artist would be neglecting one of the most intriguing aspects of her talents. Whether facing the crowd on her own or with her full ensemble of band-mates as she is more accustomed, Dos Santos uses a sultry tone and eccentric array of melodies to create an intimately magnetic connection with her audience. She is able to further engage her audience by shifting seamlessly through genres, embodying her musical influences-Nina Simone, Etta James, Alicia Keys-culminating into a powerful live experience that fuses jazz, soul, pop, funk and blues into an arena of styles and sounds that takes listeners from mid-20th century Harlem, right up to present day L.A. With key performances at the Edmonton International Jazz Festival, Whistler International Film Festival, and the Honey Jam Showcase in Toronto, Krystle has had many opportunities to put her live shows on full display. She has already toured extensively throughout western Canada, singing stories of pain and love, joy and redemption, all told through a voice that precisely reflects the emotion of her music. It is nearly impossible to be a true fan of Krystle Dos Santos without taking part in the experience she creates with her live performances. Dos Santos completed her second album in the first quarter of 2011. Femme Fatale, as it was aptly titled, again revealed Dos Santos versatility and her ability to capture the audience with an eclectic mix of dance and funk, but always with the soulful jazz vocals for which she has quickly become renowned. Dos Santos\u2019 interpretation of her influences has made it difficult to categorize her style. Compared presently to Jill Scott or Corrine-Bailey Rae or even Erykah Badu, Krystle is able to personalize her sound and message, adding her own character to her music to create a uniquely refreshing sound. Her vibrant personality has been utilized outside of music in various add campaigns and modeling opportunities. It also helps that Krystle is as stunning as she is talented; one of those rare beauties that command attention with little more than a moments glance. But make no mistake, Krystle Dos Santos is a musician first and foremost. With a smoky voice that can fluctuate to fit any style and a live show that demands the audience stand-up and take notice, Dos Santos is ready for the masses to feel her music. She is currently working on her third studio release, and will no doubt continue to strive until her name and her music is known to the world.

They also incorporate symphonic elements into their sound. The past years, their melodies have taken much more melancholic turn and the sound is overall much darker.\n\nBiography\nInsomnium began to take shape during the bleak spring of 1997. In a quiet town of Joensuu, located in the easternmost part of Finland, four young men were forming a fierce metal band. From the beginning it was clear that this band would make music that was brutal and yet melodic, full of contrasts and changing atmospheres. They took what they regarded as the best aspects of their favourite bands and moulded these influences into a new kind of entity. The result was the marriage of melodic Scandinavian death metal and traditional Finnish tunes. Lyrics turned out to be sorrowful, dream-like tales of love and death that usually took place amidst the Finnish nature. Influences were taken from the Finnish folklore as well as the world literature.\n\nAfter two years of intensive training Insomnium made their first demo-cd, which received praises from all over the world. The second demo was made the following year and it gained a lot of attention as well. This time, record companies got interested, too. In the beginning of 2001 founding members, guitarist Ville Friman, drummer Markus Hirvonen and bassist/vocalist Niilo Sev\u00e4nen, attached a new guitarist, Ville V\u00e4nni to the band. Now Insomnium was stronger than ever and ready to rise to the next level. A deal with Candlelight was signed the same spring and recording of the first album began in the summer.\n\n- In the Halls of Awaiting - was released in April 2002 and it introduced a band that had evolved in many ways. The legacy of Scandinavian death metal was still the core of the music but new layers had appeared around it. There were more nuances and depth in the songs, and the music was more versatile and challenging than before. Progressive shades had crept into the songs, and in many ways the band had stepped aside from the mainstream of melodic death metal. Debut album received excellent reviews in many magazines around the globe, especially in Germany, Finland and North America. The recording of the second album began in summer 2003. The process was somewhat painful but finally in December the new album was ready. - Since the Day It All Came Down - continues the development that the first album began. Songs are more versatile and surprising, progressive influences are ever clearer. Some tracks may even be described as experimental. But the straightforward side of the music hasn\u00b4t gone anywhere, since catchy guitar-harmonies, crushing riffs and soothing acoustic interludes are all still there. Melodies are still the most essential element in the music of Insomnium, but this time the tunes are even more melancholic and wistful than on the debut album. This is a sad and dreary album, heavier and gloomier than the first one, and undoubtedly more challenging. So when you take this path, keep in mind that it takes a while before your eyes get used to the dark...\n\n..And darker it got. With their third release, - Above The Weeping World -, the music got more agressive, harder, louder and the progressive elements grew once again. The first European tour is over, and Insomnium is once again a step closer to world domination.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.insomnium.net", "otherInfo": "Friends, we have good news for you.\nMark your calendars for May 29! \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb\n\nOfficial announcement:\n\nINSOMNIUM performs a special WINTER\u2019S GATE live stream show\n\nFinland\u2019s spearhead of melodic death metal, Insomnium will play a special worldwide live stream show on Friday, May 29, showtime 19:00 CET.

They also incorporate symphonic elements into their sound. The past years, their melodies have taken much more melancholic turn and the sound is overall much darker.\n\nBiography\nInsomnium began to take shape during the bleak spring of 1997. In a quiet town of Joensuu, located in the easternmost part of Finland, four young men were forming a fierce metal band. From the beginning it was clear that this band would make music that was brutal and yet melodic, full of contrasts and changing atmospheres. They took what they regarded as the best aspects of their favourite bands and moulded these influences into a new kind of entity. The result was the marriage of melodic Scandinavian death metal and traditional Finnish tunes. Lyrics turned out to be sorrowful, dream-like tales of love and death that usually took place amidst the Finnish nature. Influences were taken from the Finnish folklore as well as the world literature.\n\nAfter two years of intensive training Insomnium made their first demo-cd, which received praises from all over the world. The second demo was made the following year and it gained a lot of attention as well. This time, record companies got interested, too. In the beginning of 2001 founding members, guitarist Ville Friman, drummer Markus Hirvonen and bassist/vocalist Niilo Sev\u00e4nen, attached a new guitarist, Ville V\u00e4nni to the band. Now Insomnium was stronger than ever and ready to rise to the next level. A deal with Candlelight was signed the same spring and recording of the first album began in the summer.\n\n- In the Halls of Awaiting - was released in April 2002 and it introduced a band that had evolved in many ways. The legacy of Scandinavian death metal was still the core of the music but new layers had appeared around it. There were more nuances and depth in the songs, and the music was more versatile and challenging than before. Progressive shades had crept into the songs, and in many ways the band had stepped aside from the mainstream of melodic death metal. Debut album received excellent reviews in many magazines around the globe, especially in Germany, Finland and North America. The recording of the second album began in summer 2003. The process was somewhat painful but finally in December the new album was ready. - Since the Day It All Came Down - continues the development that the first album began. Songs are more versatile and surprising, progressive influences are ever clearer. Some tracks may even be described as experimental. But the straightforward side of the music hasn\u00b4t gone anywhere, since catchy guitar-harmonies, crushing riffs and soothing acoustic interludes are all still there. Melodies are still the most essential element in the music of Insomnium, but this time the tunes are even more melancholic and wistful than on the debut album. This is a sad and dreary album, heavier and gloomier than the first one, and undoubtedly more challenging. So when you take this path, keep in mind that it takes a while before your eyes get used to the dark...\n\n..And darker it got. With their third release, - Above The Weeping World -, the music got more agressive, harder, louder and the progressive elements grew once again. The first European tour is over, and Insomnium is once again a step closer to world domination.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.insomnium.net", "otherInfo": "Friends, we have good news for you.\nMark your calendars for May 29! \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb\n\nOfficial announcement:\n\nINSOMNIUM performs a special WINTER\u2019S GATE live stream show\n\nFinland\u2019s spearhead of melodic death metal, Insomnium will play a special worldwide live stream show on Friday, May 29, showtime 19:00 CET.

Viv\u00ed toda mi infancia, y hasta los 17 a\u00f1os, en la ciudad donde nac\u00ed. All\u00ed hice pre-escolar en el Jard\u00edn Infantil \u201cEl Renacuajo\u201d, primaria en el Liceo V. A. L. (Vida, Amor y Luz) y secundaria en el Colegio San Luis Gonz\u00e1ga, ahora Colegio Champagnat, y luego de graduarme del colegio ingres\u00e9 a la VI Brigada del Ej\u00e9rcito, para cumplir con mi a\u00f1o de servicio militar obligatorio. La m\u00fasica siempre ha orbitado a mi alrededor, incluso desde que estaba en la barriga de mi mam\u00e1, Fabiola, ya que ella es m\u00fasico por convicci\u00f3n, aunque la vida la haya llevado a enfrentar otros retos. Incluso tengo memoria del primer bolero que me aprend\u00ed (Deseo), cuando a\u00fan no hab\u00eda nacido, y que mi mam\u00e1 lo cantaba en mi 8\u00ba mes de gestaci\u00f3n. Soy profesional en Finanzas y Relaciones Internacionales, de la Universidad Externado de Colombia en Bogot\u00e1, con diploma y todo, aunque \u00e9ste repose y acumule capas de polvo en alg\u00fan caj\u00f3n, pero siempre supe que mi destino estaba guiado por canciones. He hecho toda la escuela que un m\u00fasico de la calle puede hacer. He cantado en serenatas, con media de aguardiente Tapa Roja como \u00fanico pago, he cantado en bares de diferentes tama\u00f1os y diversos estilos, he amenizado almuerzos, fiestas de 15 a\u00f1os, bautizos, cap\u00edtulos de novelas, y hasta alg\u00fan velorio, y tuve bar propio cantado canciones ajenas. Fue all\u00ed donde tuve la oportunidad de conocer y perfeccionar el oficio de cantar en vivo, noche tras noche, haciendo de la comunicaci\u00f3n entre el artista y la gente nuestra virtud m\u00e1s relevante. Alguien me dijo alguna vez que la m\u00fasica me hab\u00eda salvado la vida, y estoy de acuerdo. Es lo que mejor se hacer, ya que mi zurda nunca fue prodigiosa con el bal\u00f3n, qu\u00e9 otra cosa quedaba por hacer? Cuando uno es un peque\u00f1\u00edn siempre dice: \u201cQuiero ser futbolista, o m\u00fasico, o Superman\u201d, por suerte le pegu\u00e9 a una de las tres. Las canciones me vienen del alma, y no conozco otra manera de escribir, y quisiera pensar que cuando alguien oye alguna de mis canciones, en un disco, en la radio, o en un concierto, es all\u00ed, al alma, el lugar al cual llegar\u00e1. Y escribo de amor, en todas sus formas, incluido el desamor, su forma m\u00e1s cruel. Mi equipaje para llegar a \u00e9ste \u201cCruce de Caminos\u201d lo componen 2 discos, anteriores, muchos amores y varias traiciones, una visita al infierno, y un auto-descubrimiento de lo que soy. En 2003 sali\u00f3 al mercado \u201cSolo hasta hoy\u201d, con \u201cNo mires atr\u00e1s\u201d y \u201cUna y otra vez\u201d como banderas, y en el 2006 sali\u00f3 \u201cSentidos\u201d, donde fueron \u201cAcabado\u201d y \u201cTus Regalos\u201d las canciones m\u00e1s importantes, comercialmente hablando. \u00c9stos dos cap\u00edtulos musicales me han brindado varios de los momentos m\u00e1s emocionantes de mi vida, siendo el m\u00e1s importante la respuesta de la gente frente a mis canciones, pero tambi\u00e9n me permiti\u00f3 conocer a varios de mis \u00eddolos, y compartir escenario y canciones con ellos, artistas como Alejandro Sanz, Pablo Milan\u00e9s, Miguel Bos\u00e9, Fito P\u00e1ez y Franco de Vita, han salpicado e inspirado con su arte lo que hago, y he tenido la fortuna de abrir sus shows, y en algunos casos cantar hombro a hombro en el escenario. Ahora estamos frente a \u00e9ste \u201cCruce de Caminos\u201d, desde que escrib\u00ed la primera de las 30 canciones que compuse para \u00e9ste \u00e1lbum hasta ahora han pasado 23 meses, muchos \u00e1ngeles, y 2 viajes a Espa\u00f1a, y ha sido un camino maravilloso. Espero que las canciones que seleccionamos les gusten, en palabras de Nacho Ma\u00f1\u00f3, el productor musical de \u00e9ste disco, y mi hermano del alma, \u201ces un disco sincero, personal y sincero, algo cada vez m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de encontrar en \u00e9ste negocio\u201d. \u201cCREO EN SECRETOS, Y EN EL ARTE COMO FORMA DE VIDA, CREO EN QUE TODO SE DEVUELVE, EN EL MISTERIO Y LA AVENTURA.

Widely labelled as one of Britain's greatest soul singers, Knight is best known for her hit singles \"Greatest Day\", \"Shoulda Woulda Coulda\" and \"Come As You Are\" and \"Get Up!\". After a decade in the industry, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Urban Music Awards in 2004.\n\nIn 2006 Knight starred in BBC1 music TV show, Just The Two Of Us, and is the host of the Radio 2 show Beverley's Gospel Nights, which explores the origins and impact of gospel music. Now in its second season, the show has featured interviews with stars such as Destiny's Child and Shirley Caesar.\n\nKnight is an ambassador for many charities such Christian Aid and has travelled to areas affected by disease and poverty to help raise awareness. She is an active campaigner for anti-Aids organisations such as the Stop AIDS Campaign and The Terrence Higgins Trust and is also a vocal campaigner against homophobic lyrics in urban music. She became an MBE in 2006, the only musician to be granted such an honour in the Queen's eightieth birthday honours list.\n\nIn February 2006 Knight consolidated her move into the mainstream audience by appearing on BBC1 music show, Just The Two of Us. The show, featuring celebrities who duet with established singers, ran for two weeks and proved to be a relative disappointment in terms of audience figures \u2013 averaging between fifteen and twenty-five percent audience shares.[17] Nevertheless it provided a platform for Knight to reach out to a bigger audience and demonstrate her talent by performing a different array of songs than she would otherwise be known for.

It was preceded by the single \"Piece of my Heart\" \u2013 a cover of the Erma Franklin classic made famous by Janis Joplin and entered the singles chart at number sixteen, spending eleven weeks inside the UK top 75 singles chart and becoming her longest-running chart single to date.\n\nIn October 2006, Knight recorded her fifth studio album, Music City Soul, in Nashville. Completed in less than five days, the album was released on 7 May 2007 and features collaborations with musicians such as Ronnie Wood and Scotty Moore.

With both of his parents being preachers and his siblings all being vocalists, it's no surprise that he began singing at only five years old.\n\n\"Music has been instilled in me all of my life,\" he confesses. \"So essentially, I'm just embracing who I am. At first, his young position in a large family relegated him to supporting roles, usually that of a background tenor. However, he was met with adversity due to a speech impediment. \"I used to have a bad stuttering problem and because of that a lot of people would stay away from me in school,\" he admits. In fourth grade he tried out for a part in his school's rendition of Oliver Twist, but the director dismissed him, informing him that he wasn't fit for the production: if he couldn't speak clearly, how could he ever expect to sing?\n\nGuordan's mother, however, observed that her son's speech issues weren't present in his singing and came up with a plan: she would truly make him sing for his supper. Instead of speaking to her, all of his communication would have to be in melodic form. \"I would literally sing to my mother if I wanted to go to the store, or outside,\" Banks recalls.\n\n\"Whatever I had to say to her, I would sing to her. Through that, I began to build my confidence and learned to talk without a stutter. It also helped me become the songwriter I am today, because I don't ever really write anything down with a pen or a pad. I just sing it out and whatever comes out is what I use and adjust to keep.

Derek Warfield is a distinguished name among them. Derek Warfield and They Young Wolfe Tones are bringing that musical tradition forward with a reverence for Ireland\u2019s past and the energy and optimism of a new generation of Irish musicians. \u201cWe\u2019re presenting an old tradition in a new package \u2013 and I\u2019ve the same passion for it now as I had when it all started 50 years ago!\u201d DEREK WARFIELD After spending nearly 40 years as founder/leader of the legendary Wolfe Tones (named after the 18th century Irish Revolutionary Theobald Wolfe Tone), Derek Warfield is revered as a singer, songwriter, historian and entertainer in all parts of the world where Irish roots have been put down. The Wolfe Tones enjoyed phenomenal success with 13 best-selling albums, 3 number one hits, many television appearances and shows in esteemed venues such as New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall and The Royal Albert Hall in London. Since breaking away from the Wolfe Tones in 2001, Derek\u2019s solo career has yielded 11 albums to date, the most successful of them being On the One Road, The Bonnie Blue Flag and Let Ye All be Irish Tonight. With the formation and ongoing success of The Young Wolfe Tones, the legend of Derek Warfield continues. LEGACY \u2013 THE YOUNG WOLFE TONES In 2001, after nearly 40 years performing, the legendary Wolfe Tones parted with their founder and leader \u2013 Derek Warfield. No other Irish folk group, before or since, told the story of Ireland so completely and unapologetically. But for Derek\u2019s hunger and desire to continue to further the story of Ireland through song, an ancient tradition might have lost perhaps its most iconic figure. In 2006 Derek put together a band containing some of the finest musicians and singers in Irish music \u2013 The Young Wolfe Tones. Damaris Woods - Banjo Damaris Woods from Co. Meath and is recognized as one of the foremost banjo players in Irish music. She has made a major contribution in popularizing the banjo within Irish traditional music. Damaris has performed an extremely hectic touring schedule over the last decade across the world. She has appeared on the Irish Spring Tour in Germany and been part of performing groups in North America, Australia and the prestigious Celtic Colours Festival in Cape Briton, Canada. Damaris has appearances on many radio and television shows including Ireland\u2019s The Late Late Show (RT\u00c9). Damaris is also a gifted music and many of her students have been prominent prizewinners in traditional music competitions over the last number of years. On an annual basis Damaris organizes the hugely popular traditional arts camp \u2013 The Ag Seinm Traditional Arts Camp in Co. Cavan, Ireland. Despite her own hectic schedule she still manages to find time to teach at the Joe Mooney Summer School in Drunshambo every year as well as The University of Ulster, Coleraine. Peadar Hickey \u2013 Guitar and Vocals Dublin\u2019s Peadar Hickey has been delivering the songs of Ireland\u2019s history to audiences at home and abroad for over a decade. A regular fixture on the Dublin city folk and traditional music circuit, Peadar learned his trade on stage at The Arlington Hotels, Oliver St John Gogarty\u2019s and The Temple Bar in Dublin\u2019s Cultural Quarter. In 2010, Peadar moved to New York City and now performs mainly on the Irish American circuit, teaming up with notable musicians such as Pio Ryan (banjo), Matt Mancuso (fiddle) and Vonnie Quinn (fiddle). On St Patrick\u2019s Day 2013, Peadar was invited to join All-Ireland winning accordion player Martin O\u2019Connell in a performance at the New York Mayor\u2019s residence \u2013 Gracie Mansion. Peadar is currently an instructor of guitar for traditional Irish accompaniment at the Irish Arts Center in Manhattan. Dan Lowery \u2013 Flute and Vocals Dan Lowery is one of the top Irish flute players in the United States today. Born in Milwaukee, raised in Dallas, and with ancestry from County Cork, Dan spent his youth travelling to Ireland learning traditional Irish music. A tour with Surreel, a band of up-and-coming American Irish musicians, prompted him to move to New York in 2002, where he has lived for the past ten years playing Irish music full-time. In demand as a flute and whistle player, and also as a guitarist, singer and teacher, he has appeared on stage and recordings with numerous musicians and bands, including Ivan Goff, Damien Connolly, Allison Barber, Johnny Cuomo, Ashley Davis, Darren Maloney, the Trinity Hall Session Players and Idle Road. Dan has been a member of Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones since 2010. Derek Warfield\u2019s 50 years of experience coupled with the talent and energy of The Young Wolfe Tones brings the old tradition of Irish balladry into a new age. The story of Ireland is transmitted in their music and song and illuminated by the outstanding musicianship of three wonderful ambassadors of a new generation of traditional players. Derek Warfield and The Young Wolfe Tones deliver Ireland\u2019s traditional music and folk songs with an energy and skill that shows the quality of contemporaries within that tradition. The patriotic spirit of Irish music carried through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s by the Wolfe Tones now marches on in the dynamic sound of The Young Wolfe Tones. SHOWS Irish festivals all over the United States have been host to Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones since 2007. Currently the band plays between 20 and 30 Irish festivals per year all over the country. In addition to musical performances, Derek also delivers lectures on Irish history and the history of the Irish in America. These lectures feature acoustic performances of ballads relevant to the subject matter. Perhaps most notably, the band performed at the great Milwaukee Irish Festival in 2011 - the biggest Irish festival in the world. Pat Byrne from Columbus Ohio, one of the organizing committee at the Dublin Irish Festival in Ohio, had this to say \u201cDerek has always set high standards for his performances and this band raises the bar. The people loved them and gave them an unbelievable rousing and appreciative reception. These Young Wolfe Tones and their legendary leader were given a standing ovation, The Dublin Ohio festival were delighted to have them \u2026 they\u2019re as good as it gets!\u201d Australia was the destination in April of 2011. The band played twelve concerts in two weeks with the highlight being four days performing at the National Folk Festival in Canberra. The same year saw the release of Far Away in Australia \u2013 a CD to coincide with their Australian visit. With 19 tracks the collection is a mixture of classic Irish songs music and literature that connect the two countries. Far Away In Australia fittingly highlights the Irish contributions to Australia in song and music. They perform regularly at the R\u00ed R\u00e1 Irish Pub at Mandalay Bay Casino, Las Vegas and are certainly regarded as a unique stalwart among Las Vegas\u2019 many musical acts. AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY AND CIVIL WARS Many of the Irish festivals around the United States every year also play host to lectures/musical performances on the songs of the Irish in the American Revolution and Civil War by Derek Warfield and The Young Wolfe Tones. Derek deals with ballads of regret, joy, victory and defeat and clearly illustrates Ireland's hand in defending the ideals that the United States was founded on. The lecture/show has been an eye-opener for many folk and history enthusiasts from Ireland and America alike. The response and feedback throughout the festival circuit here has been wonderful and has added such a wide and important aspect to the legacy of Derek Warfield and his part in the history of Irish balladry. It is a rich legacy that was almost entirely neglected before Derek began putting together Sons of Erin, Bonnie Blue Flag, Faugh-a-Ballagh and Washington's Irish \u2014 four albums dealing with the Irish of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. He has also written a book, The Irish Songster of the American Civil War. He comments: \u201cLooking at the tremendous quality of the songwriting among the Irish over generations in the States, as recorded in libraries and collections across the country, it\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that Ireland lost its greatest talent in those times, particularly in those who starved or emigrated during the Famine years.\u201d \u201cI hope it helps to keep alive the memory of the many Irishmen who fought on both sides,\u201d he says. Derek Warfield\u2019s lifelong passion for engaging people in the music and story of Ireland is also very present in the other band members: \u201cCommunication with a live audience through music is what I believed to be of primary importance when I founded the Wolfe Tones in 1963. In performing with The Young Wolfe Tones, I continue to communicate with audiences while also passing on an important tradition to a new generation. But perhaps most importantly, it has been fun and enjoyable and every performance gets better. The experience has reinvigorated me and given the young players and singers the opportunity to display their skills and talents around the world\u201d www.theyoungwolfetones.com www.facebook.com/theyoungwolfetones www.irishworldradio.com DISCOGRAPHY Legacy Faugh-a-Ballagh (Clear The Way) Bonnie Blue Flag Sons Of Erin Liberte 98 Sl\u00e1n Abhaile A Nation Once Again God Save Ireland Green White & Essential Gold Volume 2 (2 CD Set) Green White & Essential Gold Volume 1 (2 CD Set) The Night Is....Young On The One Road Far Away In Australia On The One Road Let Ye All Be Irish Tonight (Available from www.theyoungwolfetones.com) Fifty years on from his debut performance, Warfield is now delighted to present the Young Wolfe Tones.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Deven Green ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9427502.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Acoustic, Jazz, Modern Band, Cover Band, Comedy, Comedy Rock", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "This human jukebox is known for her Welcome to My Home videos, portraying Betty Bowers, and being on Drag Race.

This fresh-faced native of Southampton, England, was merely playing into his love of funkadelic hip-hop and crooning urban stylings when he started writing songs as a teenager. His love for Terence Trent D'Arby, Sisqo, and Donnell Jones allowed him to put his creative love for art, culture, and history into a musical beat all his own. And the new millennium belonged to him and garage had been redefined.\n\nBorn Craig Ashley David on May 5, 1981, David was slicing and dicing ragga and R&B on the local station PCRS 106.5FM and found himself playing club gigs prior to rubbing elbows with some of music's finest. It was during this time he hooked with Artful Dodger's Mark Hill. After winning a national writing competition, Craig was more than ready to start producing with Hill. His big break came when he put his own additives on Damage's \"I'm Ready,\" a B-side to \"Wonderful Tonight.\" Soon thereafter he remixed his own version of Human League's \"Human\" and started himself a regular spot in area clubs during the weekends. \"Rewind\" was another underground smash, specifically a definitive move for David. His respect for Stevie Wonder, Faith Evans, and R. Kelly was most apparent, however his own vocal talent was beginning to shine. He and Hill's specialty show on Capital Radio provided another outlet for David to shape his musical work of genius. \"Fill Me In\" proved yet another hit, shooting straight to number one in summer 2000. David was now the youngest British male solo artist to have a number one single. He was 19-years-old.\n\nA deal with Wildstar Records in the U.K. sparked toward the end of the summer as \"Re-Rewind\" and \"7 Days\" gained praise in late November. A stateside agreement with Atlantic also led to more global hype. He had sold 3.5 million records worldwide and garage was finally becoming massive overseas and it was David's debut Born to Do It that was at the head.\n\nBut not all were pulling for this R&B prodigy. Aside from winning three awards at the MOBO's in October, Craig David walked away empty handed at the 2000 Brit Awards in February 2001. He was up for six nominations, including Best British Male Solo Artist, Best British Newcomer, and Best British Single for \"7 Days,\" but industry politics fell into operation. Many mainstream stars came to David's defense, artists such as Elton John, U2, and Robbie Williams, professing their disgust for the ill recognition for David and his musical efforts in the past year. Death threats soon followed for the superstar in spring 2001 as he took the stage in a show in London. An anonymous caller claimed a soldier would injure David with tear gas and hand grenades. Still, his record sales continued to soar in the U.K. with sales of Born to Do It increasing over 100 percent after his dismal beginning months of 2001. He bombared American Shores with a deal with Atlantic and released Born to Do It stateside in summer 2001. Mainstream radio flocked to him immediately. Missy Elliott, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, and Usher called themselves fans.\n\nThe next year, things didn't simmer down for the now international pop star. Craig David returned with a sophomore effort Slicker Than Your Average in November 2002. This particular album saw a much grittier side from David. Debut single \"What's Your Flava?\" also became one of the year's hottest singles.\n\nIn 2005 he released his 3rd album \"The Story Goes...\", the first single of the album, \"All The Way\", returned him to the top three, and the second single, \"Don't Love You No More (I'm Sorry)\", tied with \"7 Days\" as his longest running single in the charts since \"Rewind\", spending 15 weeks inside the UK top 75. However, the album's third single, \"Unbelievable\", debuted and peaked at #18 in March 2006.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated with UK rapper Kano on his upcoming album London Town, for the single \"This is the Girl\". The track was released on August 27, 2007 and debuted at #18 on the UK charts.\n\nThe first single \"Hot Stuff\" from the album Trust Me, was released on November 5, 2007 . The single was a top ten hit, whilst the album charted at #18 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\"6 of 1 Thing\", the second single to be taken from Trust Me charted at thirty-nine on the UK Singles Chart, becoming his second lowest charting single to date.\n\nHis UK tour will start in June 2008, details of which can be found on the official website.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Santiago Cruz ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8439533.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Latina, Pop, Rock", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Nac\u00ed un domingo, cuando el calendario marcaba el 1\u00ba d\u00eda del mes de febrero, en la capital musical de Colombia, Ibagu\u00e9, de ah\u00ed que estemos hablando de canciones, que vaya un poco contra la corriente al arrancar la vida cuando se supone que todos debemos estar descansando, y que mi equipo del alma sea el Deportes Tolima. Viv\u00ed toda mi infancia, y hasta los 17 a\u00f1os, en la ciudad donde nac\u00ed. All\u00ed hice pre-escolar en el Jard\u00edn Infantil \u201cEl Renacuajo\u201d, primaria en el Liceo V. A. L. (Vida, Amor y Luz) y secundaria en el Colegio San Luis Gonz\u00e1ga, ahora Colegio Champagnat, y luego de graduarme del colegio ingres\u00e9 a la VI Brigada del Ej\u00e9rcito, para cumplir con mi a\u00f1o de servicio militar obligatorio. La m\u00fasica siempre ha orbitado a mi alrededor, incluso desde que estaba en la barriga de mi mam\u00e1, Fabiola, ya que ella es m\u00fasico por convicci\u00f3n, aunque la vida la haya llevado a enfrentar otros retos. Incluso tengo memoria del primer bolero que me aprend\u00ed (Deseo), cuando a\u00fan no hab\u00eda nacido, y que mi mam\u00e1 lo cantaba en mi 8\u00ba mes de gestaci\u00f3n. Soy profesional en Finanzas y Relaciones Internacionales, de la Universidad Externado de Colombia en Bogot\u00e1, con diploma y todo, aunque \u00e9ste repose y acumule capas de polvo en alg\u00fan caj\u00f3n, pero siempre supe que mi destino estaba guiado por canciones. He hecho toda la escuela que un m\u00fasico de la calle puede hacer. He cantado en serenatas, con media de aguardiente Tapa Roja como \u00fanico pago, he cantado en bares de diferentes tama\u00f1os y diversos estilos, he amenizado almuerzos, fiestas de 15 a\u00f1os, bautizos, cap\u00edtulos de novelas, y hasta alg\u00fan velorio, y tuve bar propio cantado canciones ajenas. Fue all\u00ed donde tuve la oportunidad de conocer y perfeccionar el oficio de cantar en vivo, noche tras noche, haciendo de la comunicaci\u00f3n entre el artista y la gente nuestra virtud m\u00e1s relevante. Alguien me dijo alguna vez que la m\u00fasica me hab\u00eda salvado la vida, y estoy de acuerdo. Es lo que mejor se hacer, ya que mi zurda nunca fue prodigiosa con el bal\u00f3n, qu\u00e9 otra cosa quedaba por hacer? Cuando uno es un peque\u00f1\u00edn siempre dice: \u201cQuiero ser futbolista, o m\u00fasico, o Superman\u201d, por suerte le pegu\u00e9 a una de las tres. Las canciones me vienen del alma, y no conozco otra manera de escribir, y quisiera pensar que cuando alguien oye alguna de mis canciones, en un disco, en la radio, o en un concierto, es all\u00ed, al alma, el lugar al cual llegar\u00e1. Y escribo de amor, en todas sus formas, incluido el desamor, su forma m\u00e1s cruel. Mi equipaje para llegar a \u00e9ste \u201cCruce de Caminos\u201d lo componen 2 discos, anteriores, muchos amores y varias traiciones, una visita al infierno, y un auto-descubrimiento de lo que soy. En 2003 sali\u00f3 al mercado \u201cSolo hasta hoy\u201d, con \u201cNo mires atr\u00e1s\u201d y \u201cUna y otra vez\u201d como banderas, y en el 2006 sali\u00f3 \u201cSentidos\u201d, donde fueron \u201cAcabado\u201d y \u201cTus Regalos\u201d las canciones m\u00e1s importantes, comercialmente hablando. \u00c9stos dos cap\u00edtulos musicales me han brindado varios de los momentos m\u00e1s emocionantes de mi vida, siendo el m\u00e1s importante la respuesta de la gente frente a mis canciones, pero tambi\u00e9n me permiti\u00f3 conocer a varios de mis \u00eddolos, y compartir escenario y canciones con ellos, artistas como Alejandro Sanz, Pablo Milan\u00e9s, Miguel Bos\u00e9, Fito P\u00e1ez y Franco de Vita, han salpicado e inspirado con su arte lo que hago, y he tenido la fortuna de abrir sus shows, y en algunos casos cantar hombro a hombro en el escenario. Ahora estamos frente a \u00e9ste \u201cCruce de Caminos\u201d, desde que escrib\u00ed la primera de las 30 canciones que compuse para \u00e9ste \u00e1lbum hasta ahora han pasado 23 meses, muchos \u00e1ngeles, y 2 viajes a Espa\u00f1a, y ha sido un camino maravilloso. Espero que las canciones que seleccionamos les gusten, en palabras de Nacho Ma\u00f1\u00f3, el productor musical de \u00e9ste disco, y mi hermano del alma, \u201ces un disco sincero, personal y sincero, algo cada vez m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de encontrar en \u00e9ste negocio\u201d. \u201cCREO EN SECRETOS, Y EN EL ARTE COMO FORMA DE VIDA, CREO EN QUE TODO SE DEVUELVE, EN EL MISTERIO Y LA AVENTURA.

They also incorporate symphonic elements into their sound. The past years, their melodies have taken much more melancholic turn and the sound is overall much darker.\n\nBiography\nInsomnium began to take shape during the bleak spring of 1997. In a quiet town of Joensuu, located in the easternmost part of Finland, four young men were forming a fierce metal band. From the beginning it was clear that this band would make music that was brutal and yet melodic, full of contrasts and changing atmospheres. They took what they regarded as the best aspects of their favourite bands and moulded these influences into a new kind of entity. The result was the marriage of melodic Scandinavian death metal and traditional Finnish tunes. Lyrics turned out to be sorrowful, dream-like tales of love and death that usually took place amidst the Finnish nature. Influences were taken from the Finnish folklore as well as the world literature.\n\nAfter two years of intensive training Insomnium made their first demo-cd, which received praises from all over the world. The second demo was made the following year and it gained a lot of attention as well. This time, record companies got interested, too. In the beginning of 2001 founding members, guitarist Ville Friman, drummer Markus Hirvonen and bassist/vocalist Niilo Sev\u00e4nen, attached a new guitarist, Ville V\u00e4nni to the band. Now Insomnium was stronger than ever and ready to rise to the next level. A deal with Candlelight was signed the same spring and recording of the first album began in the summer.\n\n- In the Halls of Awaiting - was released in April 2002 and it introduced a band that had evolved in many ways. The legacy of Scandinavian death metal was still the core of the music but new layers had appeared around it. There were more nuances and depth in the songs, and the music was more versatile and challenging than before. Progressive shades had crept into the songs, and in many ways the band had stepped aside from the mainstream of melodic death metal. Debut album received excellent reviews in many magazines around the globe, especially in Germany, Finland and North America. The recording of the second album began in summer 2003. The process was somewhat painful but finally in December the new album was ready. - Since the Day It All Came Down - continues the development that the first album began. Songs are more versatile and surprising, progressive influences are ever clearer. Some tracks may even be described as experimental. But the straightforward side of the music hasn\u00b4t gone anywhere, since catchy guitar-harmonies, crushing riffs and soothing acoustic interludes are all still there. Melodies are still the most essential element in the music of Insomnium, but this time the tunes are even more melancholic and wistful than on the debut album. This is a sad and dreary album, heavier and gloomier than the first one, and undoubtedly more challenging. So when you take this path, keep in mind that it takes a while before your eyes get used to the dark...\n\n..And darker it got. With their third release, - Above The Weeping World -, the music got more agressive, harder, louder and the progressive elements grew once again. The first European tour is over, and Insomnium is once again a step closer to world domination.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.insomnium.net", "otherInfo": "Friends, we have good news for you.\nMark your calendars for May 29! \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb\n\nOfficial announcement:\n\nINSOMNIUM performs a special WINTER\u2019S GATE live stream show\n\nFinland\u2019s spearhead of melodic death metal, Insomnium will play a special worldwide live stream show on Friday, May 29, showtime 19:00 CET.

Heavily influenced by soul greats such as Sam Cooke and Aretha Franklin, Knight has released four studio albums and one compilation collection to date. Widely labelled as one of Britain's greatest soul singers, Knight is best known for her hit singles \"Greatest Day\", \"Shoulda Woulda Coulda\" and \"Come As You Are\" and \"Get Up!\". After a decade in the industry, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Urban Music Awards in 2004.\n\nIn 2006 Knight starred in BBC1 music TV show, Just The Two Of Us, and is the host of the Radio 2 show Beverley's Gospel Nights, which explores the origins and impact of gospel music. Now in its second season, the show has featured interviews with stars such as Destiny's Child and Shirley Caesar.\n\nKnight is an ambassador for many charities such Christian Aid and has travelled to areas affected by disease and poverty to help raise awareness. She is an active campaigner for anti-Aids organisations such as the Stop AIDS Campaign and The Terrence Higgins Trust and is also a vocal campaigner against homophobic lyrics in urban music. She became an MBE in 2006, the only musician to be granted such an honour in the Queen's eightieth birthday honours list.\n\nIn February 2006 Knight consolidated her move into the mainstream audience by appearing on BBC1 music show, Just The Two of Us. The show, featuring celebrities who duet with established singers, ran for two weeks and proved to be a relative disappointment in terms of audience figures \u2013 averaging between fifteen and twenty-five percent audience shares.[17] Nevertheless it provided a platform for Knight to reach out to a bigger audience and demonstrate her talent by performing a different array of songs than she would otherwise be known for. Reaching out to new audiences was also a driving force behind Knight\u2019s decision to join Take That on their reunion arena tour. Take That - The Ultimate Tour 06, which ran from April to July 2006, sold 270,000 tickets in less than four hours on sale at the box office and featured Knight as a support act.[18]\n\nIn March 2006 Beverley released her fifth album, a compilation set featuring the majority of her top forty UK singles entitled Voice - The Best Of Beverley Knight. The album, which was certified Gold less than a month after its release,[19] became her second highest charting of her career when it entered the UK albums chart at number ten and rose to number nine a month later. It was preceded by the single \"Piece of my Heart\" \u2013 a cover of the Erma Franklin classic made famous by Janis Joplin and entered the singles chart at number sixteen, spending eleven weeks inside the UK top 75 singles chart and becoming her longest-running chart single to date.\n\nIn October 2006, Knight recorded her fifth studio album, Music City Soul, in Nashville. Completed in less than five days, the album was released on 7 May 2007 and features collaborations with musicians such as Ronnie Wood and Scotty Moore. It has spawned three singles thus far, \"No Man's Land\", released on 16 April 2007, \"After You\", released on 2 July 2007 and \"The Queen of Starting Over\", released on 15 October 2007.\n\nBeverley will be releasing her next album in spring 2009", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "LP Giobbi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10388009.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Electro House, Disco, Dance Pop, House, Electro Pop", "Time": "5:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "LP Giobbi is rock \u2019n roll with a disco soul, born draped in sequins and cloaked in fog at a seance in the mountains of Oregon.\n\nShe was trained in jazz piano at UC Berkeley before becoming a synth warrior goddess in Los Angeles.

Derek Warfield and They Young Wolfe Tones are bringing that musical tradition forward with a reverence for Ireland\u2019s past and the energy and optimism of a new generation of Irish musicians. \u201cWe\u2019re presenting an old tradition in a new package \u2013 and I\u2019ve the same passion for it now as I had when it all started 50 years ago!\u201d DEREK WARFIELD After spending nearly 40 years as founder/leader of the legendary Wolfe Tones (named after the 18th century Irish Revolutionary Theobald Wolfe Tone), Derek Warfield is revered as a singer, songwriter, historian and entertainer in all parts of the world where Irish roots have been put down. The Wolfe Tones enjoyed phenomenal success with 13 best-selling albums, 3 number one hits, many television appearances and shows in esteemed venues such as New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall and The Royal Albert Hall in London. Since breaking away from the Wolfe Tones in 2001, Derek\u2019s solo career has yielded 11 albums to date, the most successful of them being On the One Road, The Bonnie Blue Flag and Let Ye All be Irish Tonight. With the formation and ongoing success of The Young Wolfe Tones, the legend of Derek Warfield continues. LEGACY \u2013 THE YOUNG WOLFE TONES In 2001, after nearly 40 years performing, the legendary Wolfe Tones parted with their founder and leader \u2013 Derek Warfield. No other Irish folk group, before or since, told the story of Ireland so completely and unapologetically. But for Derek\u2019s hunger and desire to continue to further the story of Ireland through song, an ancient tradition might have lost perhaps its most iconic figure. In 2006 Derek put together a band containing some of the finest musicians and singers in Irish music \u2013 The Young Wolfe Tones. Damaris Woods - Banjo Damaris Woods from Co. Meath and is recognized as one of the foremost banjo players in Irish music. She has made a major contribution in popularizing the banjo within Irish traditional music. Damaris has performed an extremely hectic touring schedule over the last decade across the world. She has appeared on the Irish Spring Tour in Germany and been part of performing groups in North America, Australia and the prestigious Celtic Colours Festival in Cape Briton, Canada. Damaris has appearances on many radio and television shows including Ireland\u2019s The Late Late Show (RT\u00c9). Damaris is also a gifted music and many of her students have been prominent prizewinners in traditional music competitions over the last number of years. On an annual basis Damaris organizes the hugely popular traditional arts camp \u2013 The Ag Seinm Traditional Arts Camp in Co. Cavan, Ireland. Despite her own hectic schedule she still manages to find time to teach at the Joe Mooney Summer School in Drunshambo every year as well as The University of Ulster, Coleraine. Peadar Hickey \u2013 Guitar and Vocals Dublin\u2019s Peadar Hickey has been delivering the songs of Ireland\u2019s history to audiences at home and abroad for over a decade. A regular fixture on the Dublin city folk and traditional music circuit, Peadar learned his trade on stage at The Arlington Hotels, Oliver St John Gogarty\u2019s and The Temple Bar in Dublin\u2019s Cultural Quarter. In 2010, Peadar moved to New York City and now performs mainly on the Irish American circuit, teaming up with notable musicians such as Pio Ryan (banjo), Matt Mancuso (fiddle) and Vonnie Quinn (fiddle). On St Patrick\u2019s Day 2013, Peadar was invited to join All-Ireland winning accordion player Martin O\u2019Connell in a performance at the New York Mayor\u2019s residence \u2013 Gracie Mansion. Peadar is currently an instructor of guitar for traditional Irish accompaniment at the Irish Arts Center in Manhattan. Dan Lowery \u2013 Flute and Vocals Dan Lowery is one of the top Irish flute players in the United States today. Born in Milwaukee, raised in Dallas, and with ancestry from County Cork, Dan spent his youth travelling to Ireland learning traditional Irish music. A tour with Surreel, a band of up-and-coming American Irish musicians, prompted him to move to New York in 2002, where he has lived for the past ten years playing Irish music full-time. In demand as a flute and whistle player, and also as a guitarist, singer and teacher, he has appeared on stage and recordings with numerous musicians and bands, including Ivan Goff, Damien Connolly, Allison Barber, Johnny Cuomo, Ashley Davis, Darren Maloney, the Trinity Hall Session Players and Idle Road. Dan has been a member of Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones since 2010. Derek Warfield\u2019s 50 years of experience coupled with the talent and energy of The Young Wolfe Tones brings the old tradition of Irish balladry into a new age. The story of Ireland is transmitted in their music and song and illuminated by the outstanding musicianship of three wonderful ambassadors of a new generation of traditional players. Derek Warfield and The Young Wolfe Tones deliver Ireland\u2019s traditional music and folk songs with an energy and skill that shows the quality of contemporaries within that tradition. The patriotic spirit of Irish music carried through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s by the Wolfe Tones now marches on in the dynamic sound of The Young Wolfe Tones. SHOWS Irish festivals all over the United States have been host to Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones since 2007. Currently the band plays between 20 and 30 Irish festivals per year all over the country. In addition to musical performances, Derek also delivers lectures on Irish history and the history of the Irish in America. These lectures feature acoustic performances of ballads relevant to the subject matter. Perhaps most notably, the band performed at the great Milwaukee Irish Festival in 2011 - the biggest Irish festival in the world. Pat Byrne from Columbus Ohio, one of the organizing committee at the Dublin Irish Festival in Ohio, had this to say \u201cDerek has always set high standards for his performances and this band raises the bar. The people loved them and gave them an unbelievable rousing and appreciative reception. These Young Wolfe Tones and their legendary leader were given a standing ovation, The Dublin Ohio festival were delighted to have them \u2026 they\u2019re as good as it gets!\u201d Australia was the destination in April of 2011. The band played twelve concerts in two weeks with the highlight being four days performing at the National Folk Festival in Canberra. The same year saw the release of Far Away in Australia \u2013 a CD to coincide with their Australian visit. With 19 tracks the collection is a mixture of classic Irish songs music and literature that connect the two countries. Far Away In Australia fittingly highlights the Irish contributions to Australia in song and music. They perform regularly at the R\u00ed R\u00e1 Irish Pub at Mandalay Bay Casino, Las Vegas and are certainly regarded as a unique stalwart among Las Vegas\u2019 many musical acts. AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY AND CIVIL WARS Many of the Irish festivals around the United States every year also play host to lectures/musical performances on the songs of the Irish in the American Revolution and Civil War by Derek Warfield and The Young Wolfe Tones. Derek deals with ballads of regret, joy, victory and defeat and clearly illustrates Ireland's hand in defending the ideals that the United States was founded on. The lecture/show has been an eye-opener for many folk and history enthusiasts from Ireland and America alike. The response and feedback throughout the festival circuit here has been wonderful and has added such a wide and important aspect to the legacy of Derek Warfield and his part in the history of Irish balladry. It is a rich legacy that was almost entirely neglected before Derek began putting together Sons of Erin, Bonnie Blue Flag, Faugh-a-Ballagh and Washington's Irish \u2014 four albums dealing with the Irish of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. He has also written a book, The Irish Songster of the American Civil War. He comments: \u201cLooking at the tremendous quality of the songwriting among the Irish over generations in the States, as recorded in libraries and collections across the country, it\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that Ireland lost its greatest talent in those times, particularly in those who starved or emigrated during the Famine years.\u201d \u201cI hope it helps to keep alive the memory of the many Irishmen who fought on both sides,\u201d he says. Derek Warfield\u2019s lifelong passion for engaging people in the music and story of Ireland is also very present in the other band members: \u201cCommunication with a live audience through music is what I believed to be of primary importance when I founded the Wolfe Tones in 1963. In performing with The Young Wolfe Tones, I continue to communicate with audiences while also passing on an important tradition to a new generation. But perhaps most importantly, it has been fun and enjoyable and every performance gets better.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lockeland ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9001222.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "MARK VIKINGSTAD and MICHAEL BORIS come from different spectrums of the Empire State, while KYNDON OAKES hails from the \u201cLand of Oz.\u201d In their travels\u2014following the yellow brick road to \u201csomewhere over the rainbow\u201d in Music City, Tennessee\u2014 the trio met in the middle to \u201clock the lands\u201d and thus, LOCKELAND was formed.

Picking up an old guitar in a pawn shop along the way he found gigs from town to town playing his way across the states in the tradition of the delta Bluesmen before him.\n\nThen while stumbling home drunk one night along the main drag of Nashville, he came across a crowd. The crowd were surrounding an old man playing a one string guitar made from a broom handle and a box, while playing drums with his feet. In that moment Ben new he had found the inspiration he was looking for. But it wasn\u2019t until he made his way to New Orleans that he managed to get his hands on such an instrument. Walking down the backstreets of the french quarter he found his way into an old instrument shop selling a cigar box guitar.

The Blues Magazine called him 'A unique musical identity\u2019; Blues Blast Magazine described his songs as being 'of bleak beauty' and Americana U.K. hailed his work as 'A new Blues\u2019.\n\nSince then he has never looked back, going on to tour internationally four times to date, and releasing a second album \u2018City of Streets\u2019, independently and to great success.

Following the success of Patience they released the album \"Beautiful World\" which topped sales in 2006 & sold more then the current release by Robbie!\n\nDuring 2007 Take That also wrote a song for the motion picure Stardust titled Rule the World which reached number 2 in the UK charts and went on to be the 5th biggest selling single of 2007.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lockeland ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9001222.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "MARK VIKINGSTAD and MICHAEL BORIS come from different spectrums of the Empire State, while KYNDON OAKES hails from the \u201cLand of Oz.\u201d In their travels\u2014following the yellow brick road to \u201csomewhere over the rainbow\u201d in Music City, Tennessee\u2014 the trio met in the middle to \u201clock the lands\u201d and thus, LOCKELAND was formed.

The Los Angeles based troubadour uncovers an era-spanning style of his own at the crossroads of traditional folk songcraft, impressive guitarwork, bluesy gusto, and 21st century pop adventurousness. The singer and songwriter sifts through a lifetime of influences in order to assemble a vibrant, vivid, and vital vision.\n\nThis poignant, passionate, and personal style resounds throughout his 2018 EP.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixture of popular music that I respect and the classics I grew up on, because they will always be a part of who I am,\u201d he explains. \u201cI started out by making a lot of Americana folk rock, but I really wanted to explore new sounds. For the first time, the new music reflects everything\u2014from what inspired me to be a musician and a guitar player in the first place such as Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Jackson Browne to artists I\u2019ve just discovered in recent years like Ed Sheeran. There are those songwriter elements as well as the modern nuances. I feel as if I\u2019m moving with a new generation.\u201d\n\nSince his emergence in 2015, he has quietly set the stage for such an evolution. At 19-years-old, Corey dropped out of college in Eugene, Oregon, grabbed his guitar, and relocated to an eternal haven for creatives of all kinds: Venice Beach, CA.\n\nJust blocks away from the Pacific Ocean, he spearhead the genesis of an arts collective and hangout known as Winston House. After reposting clips of Corey on guitar, Cody Simpson tapped him to handle six-string duties on a national tour. Meanwhile, Justin Bieber caught a Winston House performance and invited Corey to open up a run of Pacific Northwest dates on the sold-out Purpose Tour in 2016.\n\nTeaming up with producer Andrew Wells [Meghan Trainor, Jason MrAZ, Bebe Rexha, etc.], he unveiled the On The Run EP following his appearance on the historic tour. Its title track racked up 7 million-plus streams as he garnered widespread acclaim from Rolling Stone, Billboard, American Songwriter, Teen Vogue, Baeble Music, and more. Along the way, he toured with the likes of Niall Horan, Noah Kahan, and more.\n\nIn early 2018, he relocated to a studio in Topanga, CA. Exploring new sonic territory, he started amassing an arsenal of guitar pedals to \u201ccome up with new riffs and sounds\u201d and channel \u201cwhat the past year looked and sounded like into a six-song EP.\u201d\n\nNow, Corey introduces that EP by way of the single \u201cWild Nights.\u201d It juxtaposes a cinematic piano-driven soundscape with bluesy guitar and handclaps before culminating on a slick, soulful, and soaring confession, \u201cI\u2019ll give up all the wild times, jump into the wild fires, just to have one more wild night with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about knowing that you\u2019re so in love with someone and satisfied that you\u2019d never want anybody else,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you were ever separated from this person, you\u2019d give up everything just for one more memorable night together. You\u2019d sacrifice everything.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on the EP, \u201cDried Blood\u201d stretches from stark and stripped verses into a powerhouse chant. Meanwhile, \u201cCloser\u201d pairs a steady and strong beat with plaintive acoustic guitar and another hard-hitting hook, \u201cI just want you closer, closer than my demons.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Corey emerges with a striking signature sound that immediately connects.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to inspire others to have a voice of their own and be themselves,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cMusic did that for me. I feel like I have the opportunity to hopefully do the same thing for listeners.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live stream at https://live.bandsintown.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ferris ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8887383.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Pop, Pop-rock, Rap, R&b, Hip-hop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "OFFICIAL FACEBOOK FOR FERRIS.

The Edmonton, Kentucky-based rock n\u2019 roll quartet Black Stone Cherry was raised on musical forefathers such as Cream, Led Zeppelin, Muddy Waters, and the Faces, among other 1970s staples, and, now, with its sixth album, Family Tree, BSC salutes its classic rock heritage and honors its legacy with a beast of a Southern rock n\u2019 roll album.\n\n\u201cWe caught divine intervention with this one,\u201d guitarist Ben Wells says with a good chuckle. \u201cWe hit a creative spark and tapped into a spirit and a fire we hadn\u2019t before.\u201d Drummer John Fred Young adds: \u201cFamily Tree showcases all of our collective musical influences and how we have taken those to create something that is truly our own unique Southern American Rock \u2018N Roll Sound.\u201d\n\nFor 17 years, Black Stone Cherry has put forth a new vicious breed of Southern rock, injecting youthful vitality and a myriad of fresh new influences into the beloved American rock tradition. To date, the band has released five critically acclaimed albums, and one well-received blues EP. Black Stone Cherry has also rocked 12,000-cap arena shows, topped the UK charts, and shared the stage with a diverse roster of superstars, including Def Leppard, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Bad Company, M\u00f6torhead, and ZZ Top.\n\nBlack Stone Cherry came together in 2001 in Edmonton, Kentucky, eventually coalescing around the lineup of Chris Robertson, vocals and guitar; Ben Wells, guitar and vocals; Jon Lawhon, bass and vocals; and John Fred Young, drums. Young's dad Richard, and his Uncle Fred, are two members of the iconic country-fried rock n\u2019 roots band The Kentucky HeadHunters, and the high school-aged boys came up honing their craft in the group\u2019s Practice House, a 1940s bungalow.\n\n\u201cWe grew up in the Kentucky Headhunters\u2019 rehearsal space, looking up at posters of Cream, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, the Stones, Montrose, and the Faces. We were like kids someone took in a time capsule and put in the woods,\u201d says drummer John Fred Young.\n\nLike the band\u2019s previous album and EP, Black Stone Cherry opted to self-produce and track Family Tree at David Barrick's Barrick Recording, the same studio where BSC recorded its self-titled debut and Kentucky albums . BSC also opted to not over-rehearse in advance of the album, instead preferring the immediacy and spontaneity of in the-moment takes. \u201cThere was a lot of laughter in the studio this time, and an air of comfort because we had self-produced the last few releases. It helped us get down to the nitty gritty bones of our music,\u201d says bassist Jon Lawhon. The band also entrusted guitarist and vocalist Chris Robertson to mix the album. This homespun approach perfectly suited the loose but epiphanic creative sessions that birthed Family Tree.\n\nFamily Tree boasts BSC\u2019s tried-and-true lucky number with its 13 songs, and, like all BSC releases, features songwriting contributions from each member. The result is a modern and meaty blues-based rock album, with unexpected sonic twists like punchy horn sections, barrelhouse pianos, Southern gospel organ, atmospheric synthesizer passages, and forays into funk and country.\n\nThe title track melds brawny blues riffage with BSC\u2019s most telepathic ensemble playing, showcasing the group\u2019s maturation as a unit without detracting from its Southern, hard rock wallop. The album also packs some satisfyingly surprising moments. \u201cCarry Me On Down The Road\u201d is a sleek slice of pure 1970s American rock n\u2019 roll\u2014something you would hear blaring out of a 1972 Chevy El Camino. \u201cJames Brown\u201d offers forth some stanky swamp-funk, replete with wah-wah guitars and gospel girl vocals. \u201cBad Habit,\u201d however, dripping sensual innuendo hammered home by a horny groove-rock beat, delivers some prime hooky and heavy BSC.\n\nOne Family Tree centerpiece is the rustically elegant \u201cMy Last Breath,\u201d a sweetly downhome ode to the unbreakable bonds of family. The song\u2019s goose bump-inducing call and response male and female vocal breakdown is one of those musical moments where light just shines through the speakers and you know everything is going to be alright.\n\nTwo special guests bring Family Tree full circle, one being Chris\u2019 5 year-old son singing backup on the brawny swaggering \u201cYou Got The Blues,\u201d and the other being jam band icon Warren Haynes\u2019 vocal and guitar cameo on the delta stomp of \u201cDancing In The Rain.\u201d The band first met Warren 17 years ago when they first came to New York to showcase for their new label. \u201cI remember coming to New York when we first were signed, and hearing Warren\u2019s voice behind me the minute my feet hit the street,\u201d recalls bassist Jon Lawhon. \u201cHearing him play on this track all these years later gave me chills.\u201d\n\nHaving Warren guest on the album was a wonderful gesture of \u201cyou\u2019re in the family now.\u201d It was truly a validation of all the miles the band has clocked on tour, and the dues the guys have paid being away from home. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how four good old boys from nowhere Kentucky can still be around 17 years later,\u201d singer/guitarist Chris Robertson says. Ben Wells concludes: \u201cI don\u2019t remember how life was outside of Black Stone Cherry.

It was during these formative years that Fokis developed a love for music and a work ethic that placed him amongst hip hop\u2019s hardest working entrepreneurs. Fokis began rhyming at an early age and later began to produce his own music. Seeking to enhance his career, Fokis pursued formal training as a recording engineer, later opening his own recording studio Krystal Clear Recordings. There, Fokis recorded and mixed for many artists including Big Daddy Kane, Fat Joe, Skyzoo, Torae, Dres, N.O.R.E, Kool G Rap, Brand Nubian, Chi-Ali, Ras Kass, Mic Geranimo, Bubba Sparxx and Rahsaan Patterson. His passion and commitment to succeed literally placed him on the \u201cRoad to the Riches\u201d. Early in his career, Fokis developed an online reality show based on his own experience as an independent hip hop artist seeking to secure a record deal within a year\u2019s time. Consistent with reality, the \u201cRoad to the Riches\u201d did not result in Fokis signing a record deal. Not deterred, Fokis went on to release several albums collaborating with various artists such as Joe Budden, Olu Dara (Nas\u2019 father), Deemi, Joell Ortiz and various producers such as Ty Fyffe, Focus\u2026(Aftermath Ent.) Fantom Of The Beat and Jake One. Fokis released various projects including the \u201c20/20\u201d EP exclusively produced by Focus of Aftermath \u201cRecognize Your Power\u201d EP with Edo. G & Shabaam Sahdeeq which was produced entirely by Fokis, \"This Thing Called Life\" which was produced by Oh No. all of which were well received by his fans.\n\nFokis has toured the United States and abroad, performed as an opening act for artists such as Common, Busta Rhymes, M.O.P., The Beatnuts, Onyx, Das Efx, Masta Ace and more. Through his experiences, Fokis developed a relevant broad appealing style and sound that remains true to the core foundational elements of Hip Hop with a commercial appeal. Though achieving success releasing his own music, Fokis realized in this era it would take more than pursuing a career as a recording artist to rise to the level of success he sought to achieve. As his experience with the business side of the industry grew, Fokis established his own independent record label, Loyalty Digital Corp. Through his label, Fokis has worked with and Executive produced projects like \u201cAn Ode To Reasonable Doubt\u201d by Skyzoo & Antman Wonder, \u201cBarrel Brothers\u201d by Skyzoo & Torae, \u201cNever Left\u201d by Sadat X and various others.

The members span from all over the world and are wrapping up their third LP for release this year. Fokis & Loyalty Digital\u2019s many achievements have been recognized by various blogs such as Complex, HipHopDX, NahRight, 2DopeBoyz, RapRadar, XXL and The Source to name a few.

It will include 11 brand new songs. This will be the first record that he has recorded & produced in his own home studio in Co. Armagh. There will also be a special limited edition of the album available only on the benreel.com website, which will include 5 bonus tracks. Since his debut back in 1999, each album has gone from strength to strength, touching on different styles of music from rock,soul,blues, Alt Folk/Americana & with the occasional injection of reggae. This was highlighted on his 2012, 18 song best of album (Ben Reel 1999-2009 Compilation 10) released only as a limited edition for loyal fans to buy at gigs, also available on iTunes worldwide. Ben\u2019s music has evolved into an honest earthy sound that has matured like a fine wine and he has very much his own sound today. This can be heard on this new album. Darkness & The Light is a powerful soulful album with deep meaningful lyrics and memorable epic anthemic songs, with strong melodies combined with imaginitive expansive arrangements. Recorded digitally but with an analog feeling of warmth. The songs deal with the struggles of life of ordinary folk since the global economic crash. Also probing for spiritual meaning and balance between the Yin and the Yang, trying to find light, hope and healing in these troubled times. Serious songs from a serious artist in a serious moment in time. In the last 10 years he has had numerous high profile TV & Radio appearances and airplay under his belt including Bob Harris BBC Radio 2 and has supported names like Jools Holland, Alabama 3, The Cranberries and appeared as a special guest at one of Hal Ketchum's shows in Dublin. He has performed his radio hit \u2018U People\u2019 with the late great Ian Dury\u2019s legendary \u2018Blockheads\u2019 and has recorded the song with award winning saxophonist Gilad Atzmon. Over the last 5 years Ben has enjoyed successful tours in Europe, receiving rave reviews and attracting a growing fan base . His band includes amongst the finest musicians in Ireland, his brother in law Michael Black on Drums, Ronnie O\u2019Flynn on bass and Mick McCarney on guitar. With this line up they have built up a loyal underground following. Ben is often described as an \u2018artist lying beneath the radar for way too long\u2019. In 2011 Ben played showcase gigs in Nashville & Memphis (Folk Alliance) where he colloborated with some of Nashville's finest, David Olney, Sergio Webb & Irene Kelley to name a few. Plans are in the pipeline to return to the U.S in 2013 to promote his new record and to follow up on his success on Airplaydirect.com radio download rock chart, which he has been number 1 for the last 3 months. Plus he will be touring extensively in Ireland, UK & Europe.

Rainy Nights nails down the pang of loneliness that emigrants feel when they are far from home and someone says something that just triggers regret. The easy, soulful melody and performance underlines the impact, with Reel\u2019s singing striking just the right note. It is the high point of the album. Though Feel Alive , the title track and the gospel of Old Bog Road come close. The Armagh singer-songwriter comes across as a honest man determined to use his love of music to best effect, and he is lucky in having a band, particularly guitarist Mick McCarney, full of expression and no little skill. www.benreel.com Download tracks: Rainy Nights, Time to Get Real http://dvdfever.co.uk/reviews/erbenreel.shtml Elly Roberts reviews The Ben Reel Band: Time To Get Real Another little gem from the Emerald Isle. Rating: 8/10 Irishman Ben Reel has consistently released solid albums over the past 10 years. My last CD encounter was 2007\u2019s fabulous New Horizon. Now on his fifth album, Time To Get Real, keeps that tradition well and truly alive with a dazzling collection of Americana crossover songs that ought to have ears pricking at all the \u2018real music\u2019 stations. Reel has a penchant for ignoring fads and trends keeping the focus on real music which is why he\u2019s become a cult artist in his native Ireland, though sadly he hasn\u2019t been picked up as genuine singer-songwriter in the UK. Everybody in the business knows he\u2019s hot stuff having supported Jools Holland, Alabama 3, The Cranberries and stage star Michael Ball no less. The good news is he doing rather well in Holland, Belgium and Germany. As an introduction to the album he\u2019s released Feel Alive as a single. The down and dirty groove has some sublime guitar licks carried by a great melody and his rough edged vocals. ________________________________________ This box of delights opens with a gentle country shuffle in the form of Rainy Night as the band moves with confidence and swagger, again with Reel dropping in some superb guitar breaks and a fine line in vocal gymnastics including falsetto along with a Neil Young-like harmonica swish. The introduction of songbird Julieanne Reek on the deliciously tender love ballad Summers Always Here only adds to the romantic mood. With a troubled heart he gushes with lyrics like \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re like the warm summer sun that\u2019s rising / Feel your warm love in my heart / Melting away the cold ice of winter / The storms have passed / There\u2019s a new life on the way.\u201d Embracing an eclectic mindset, Keep On Drivin\u2019 takes on a C.C.Rider rockabilly hue drenched in honeyed vocals, stylish pedal steel, thumping basslines and wah wah, whereas Time Slips Away is deeply reflective, yearning for his childhood days and the onset of wisdom now he\u2019s turned 35. A heavy funky bass, rolling organ, and acoustic chords make Who You Are the albums catchiest song, with the main hook coming in the chorus. For Old And Wise Reel delves deep into a more traditional Irish template which brings forward his wishes not to die a typical rock\u2019n\u2019roll death \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t wanna overdose like a rockin-roll star /Or choke on my vomit after whiskey in the jar.\u201d By far the best song on the album, closes it \u2013 the stripped back dusty-bowl ballad Old Bog Road. Reverbed harmonica leads to gentle acoustic picks, chords slabs and wailing solos, on what is essentially a mournful ballad. The verdict \u2013 Quality album. http://www.billybop.be/admin/CDdetail.asp?ID=8717 Ben Reel : Time To Get Real \u2013 CD, BRBCDA-007;B Reel Records Album Kindly Submitted by G-Promotions Style : Americana Rate (1-5) : Ben Reel is the latest addition to a series of Americana artists emerging from Ireland! Against the backdrop of the troubles in Northern Ireland, Ben first picked up his guitar when he was 15 years old inspired by greats like Bruce Springsteen or Neil Young. Today this inspirations are still to be found in his passionate music! Leading track \u201cRainy Night\u201d is one of those tunes that you start to whistle along without ever having it heard before! Country and Americana are the main genres on this album but this doesn\u2019t mean the album is limited to it. On \u201cFeel Alive\u201d Ben comes with some enjoyable soul influences while \u201cKeep on drivin\u2019\u201d throws in a lot of country as does \u201cLooking for a Lost Horizon\u201d. \u201cOld & Wise\u201d throws in some old styles and mix folk influences into this Americana tune. On \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d the title track of this album, Ben Reel, returns to his old habits and creates a song that could be from the hand of \u201cThe Boss\u201d. Closing down the album is \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d that opens with a beautiful haunting blues harp. The haunting keeps going on, both with his voice and slide guitar! As an extra, hidden track we can hear a nice rockabilly kind of version (Live) of Keep on Drivin\u2019 in a mix with the classic \u201cTrain Train\u201d Time To Get Real is already the fifth album for Ben Reel and in the past two years he has successfully toured Holland, Belgium and Germany steady working on a growing fan base. Back you\u2019ll can find him as supporting act for bands like the Cranberries, Alabama 3 or Jools Holland. The album is a true Americana effort and comes with handful of interesting tunes that makes me feel that this artist need to be in the spotlight a little more. Mr Blue Boogie http://www.getreadytorock.com/reviews2009/ben_reel.htm BEN REEL Time To Get Real (2009) Play this new Ben Reel CD to any music aficionado, and ask them where it was recorded. Nine out of ten would say Nashville. Guaranteed. Now, Ben Reel may not be a household name (yet), but let's assume for a moment his work is unfamiliar to you. OK, what genre music would you say Time To Get Real was? No problem - southern, country blues rock. And name any influences you can hear at play? Again, no problem - Neil Young is an obvious one, but also Springsteen and perhaps Chris Isaak and even a little Clapton circa 361 Ocean Boulevard. So, nationality? No brainer - a man from the deep south of the US of A. Wrong on all accounts, because Time To Get Real is the 5th album in 10 years from Irish guitarist and singer songwriter Ben Reel. And naturally it was recorded in Monaghan in the north of the emerald isle. In reviewing Ben's last album New Horizon (2007) - which had an altogether more 'west coast' feel - we pondered on image, and what might make Ben stand out from the likes of Marc Cohn. It may be that with Time to Get Real, and diving deep into Americana, Ben has found his niche. Beautifully played and recorded it's bound to strike a chord with the market that's fuelling the resurgence of Neil Young, and Springsteen's exploration of the American psyche. But the challenge is still to get his music across the pond. It's not easy to crack America - many have tried and failed, but the rootsy warmth of the songs, the soulful singing and classy playing (some wonderful blues guitar and harmonica work) would undoubtedly be lapped up with a little exposure. So remember the name - Ben Reel - a real class act. *** Review by Pete Whalley http://www.lonesomehighway.com/pdf/online-issue-7.pdf Ben Reel Time To Get Real B. Reel Northern Ireland native Ben Reel has delivered a roots album that is full of strong songs and good playing. There\u2019s some solid keyboard playing, a rhythm section that drives things along and some very tasty guitar from Mick McCarney. Reel\u2019s voice is accompanied by welcome backing vocals that help to portray the mood of the songs. Rainy Night sets the tone for time and place, a song that looks at what has been missed by moving away from your home town. Other topics are ageing, freedom, the nature of searching and of truth. Mature songs for a mature audience that\u2019s given a melodic and malleable musical base that could just as easily have come from the States as from Northern Ireland. Reel no doubt has taken from those who have also come from the North, such as the undeniable influence of Van Morrison as a beacon of musical innovation. Reel does not have Morrison\u2019s track record, but this is an album that shows all the signs of a true talent making his own way. It\u2019s time to get serious is the signal Ben Reel gives with the release of his latest cd \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d. Wasn\u2019t he before? Haven\u2019t got a clue because for me Ben Reel is a complete stranger. He is (northern) Irish and has been working at his craft for quite some time. \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d sure is a good way to get to know him and the cd is full of piercing impulses. Delicate songs, strongly carried by the accompanying musicians, but by no tarnishing ben\u2019s Vocals. (His vocals show comparisons to Rod MacDonald and John Stewart). I hope that I grow old and wise suggests that Ben has come to an age where he starts realising his own mortality, what undoubtedly determines the profundity you find again in his lyrics. With what I don\u2019t want to affect his compositions. As I said before, I only know Reels past from what I read in his biography, But \u201cTime to get Reel\u201d indeed looks like the start of a new development, a new awakening. No trace of a personal crisis. My guts tell me Ben Reel has defined he wants to make a good product. One he will be remembered by. The closing song \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d tells of a permanent goodbye Ben Reel manages to create a excellent variation of styles, and within a limited nr of spins I still a real positive feeling about Ben Reel. Serious, skilful. driven \u2026. (after the official songs there is a hidden track, a live song, where you hear the presence of a modern day Elvis. Not renewed, but very entertaining. www.rootstime.be /Rein van den Berg Oct 09 The Irish hearts are often rather melancholic. Maybe the beautiful sceneries see to a tendensy of warmth and retirement. It characterizes at any rate the dark songs of Ben Reel, which the cover of the newest album, time to get real, suggest. Eleven songs written by reel himself and richly arranged with violin, piano, appropriate guitar lines and a choice of extra additioned instruments. With this the Irish know how to display a large scale of spheres and feelings, carying names as Neil Young and sometimes Bob Dylan. Indeed in rags, because Ben Reel is a slippery costumer. Ben\u2019s first album, \u201cthis is the movie\u201d, came out in Ireland in 1999, after this the EP \u00ebxorcise me\u201d(2000) only with 3 tracks, which seemed to be forerunner for his second album \u201cLost in Haze\u201d (2001). After that came Sweet Victory (2004), U People (2006) and New Horizon (2007). We don\u2019t have to complain about man\u2019s releases and qualities: guitarplayer Ben Reel, born in silverbridge but now living in Castlebalyney, is a supreme storyteller; has a pleasant voice, writes, beside that, upperclass songs and has also the quality to gather very able musicians around him. At his new album Ben Reel is accompanied again by a fine equilibiated band: Ronnie, Michael. Mickey, John, Colin. And now we are calling names: the recordings were done in the Attic studios with producer Ronan who also has a vocal contribution in the last two songs. In the quite openers Rainy Summers etc. we hear Reel\u2019s wife Julieanne who takes the change of the singing second. Anyway, in their natural but yet larger soundscape is more than enough space for improvisation and variety, which we can hear clearly on their new album. What Ben has settled with this successor is impressing. In 11 songs the band knows to create an oppressing atmosphere, which gets enlightened only now and then. Rasping and grating, then again with deceptive lovely acoustic guitars, then with thin guitarsounds and spacious violin, the listener is taking to a voyage through the Deep South of the mind, which only can turn out bad. It is oppressing, dark, stirring and especially very beautiful. Roots, pop and folk are going hand in hand with now and then an experimental strain. The point is that Ben Reel makes magnificent music. Music that mixes influences from alt-country with the atmospheric and darkness the music from Ireland so often charcterizes. Music that attracts attention by the variety and the highstanding music, because they really can play. Ben Reel searches, with his new album, joining with the greatness of the alt-country, but takes here at the same time surrender. Time to get real is just a good patterncard of the ability of the Ben Reel Band. Everything sounds beautiful, clear and especially respectable. The sharp ends are removed expertly and almost everything is produced in a way that it has to be specially accessed for the singersongwriter radiosize. Freddie Cells http://www.rootstime.be/CD REVIEUW/2009/OKT1/CD89.htm www.rootstime.be http://www.fatea-records.co.uk/magazine/releases.html ________________________________________ Ben Reel Album:Time To Get Real Label:Self Released Website: http://www.myspace.com/benreelband I guess when it comes to the blues, growing up in Ireland gives you a real introduction to spirit and passion and not always in a good way. There's lots to inspire and Ben Reel has absorbed those influences and let them inform his particular style of travelling blues. \"Time To Get Real\" isn't a classic troubadour album, but it is deep hearted blues packed with characters, places and just a wee bit of drinking. The songs are strong through out, all could standalone without being thought of as filler. Time to step up from being a solid support to being the headliner. BELGUIM http://www.ctrlaltcountry.be/Pagina1.htm#BenReel BEN REEL \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d (Ben Reel) (3,5****) Ireland has long been enjoying a good reputation, where the singer-songwriters are concerned. And with Ben Reel has another one to be proud of. With \"Time To Get Real\" the man has just delivered his fifth album in ten years time, and that is a very beautiful album. Reel is gifted with a warm, a little soulful vocal style, shows himself a truly excellent song smith and professional manner together in genres like rock, pop, folk, Americana and blues into his songs. He calls himself Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young as inspiration, but there really is not much sign of that. Reel sounds like a particularly original. Someone with a vision of his own writing and placing songs. Someone with an own sound. And it would absolutely not surprise us if he behave the songs on \"Time To Get Real\" soon break on larger scale. He fully deserves it already! Songs like it a little reminiscent of Neil Young \"Rainy Night\", the beautifully subdued piano and harmonica work on-going rootspopdeuntje \"Summer's Always Here\", the soulful rockin 'Feel Alive', the bluesy bounce \"Keep On Drivin '\", the summer, somewhere between pop, folk and country resident \"Old & Wise\" is simply magnificent. (Ben Reel is doing these days also Netherlands and Belgium for some gigs. On November 13 he is as such in McCormack's Irish Pub in Turnhout. And De Sport in Geel On Monday 9th http://www.ilpopolodelblues.com/rev/novembre09/recensione/ben-reel.html Ben Reel is part of the wide array of successful songwriters born and raised in Ireland. More precisely, the North and administratively part of the English crown. Yet in his music are heard echoes of Neil Young or Bruce Springsteen rather than those of the island's musical tradition.

(SWA) REAL ROOTS CAF\u00c9 Netherlands Dutch to English translation Very recently came from Time to get real, the fifth full-time CD of Irish singer-songwriter Ben Reel. For me a great unknown, but already 20 years active in music since he was a teenager in 1989 founded his first band, \"Trim the Velvet '. After the breakup of this band eight years later, Ben's solo tour in 1999 and came from his solo CD's available. With five number one so he just scored an average of two years each. Ben's music is best described as Irish mid-tempo alt-country, the songs are nice sound and treat a number of pressing issues for Ben. He describes one part of his life and Rainy Night Time just slips away, do proclaim his feelings, especially love, respect, in four songs and shares his thoughts with us and future expectations in another four songs. He concludes (No. 11 is) a kind of summary of this in Old Bog Road: Seasons change as people come and go, life and death is the endless flow. Want to find the answers, because the story to be told, is not gonna quit the mining for gold. Want to find a reason before I go. Before they take my body, down that old bog road. Heavy thoughts for a guy who has several years of the 40 removed. But we are not all looking for the deeper meaning of life? Incidentally, after more than six minutes of the final number is still nearly six minutes a lasting valve closure, which Ben totally in style and tempo rocking (leading to a sodden organ) announces yet another time by a wish to: (I 'll) keep on driving, a live concert recording and a perfect valve. Always funny, some unexpected hidden track. Ben's band was great response and are in addition to Ben's acoustic guitar (and occasional harmonica) bass, drums and electric guitar. A few songs do keyboards and violin along. Ben has a somewhat gritty but pleasant voice. His wife Julianne sings along to eight songs, four songs is half Bloch (e, you never know with those Irish first names) to hear. I think it's a good CD, especially through the expressiveness of the songs both lyrically and in terms of melody (Fred Schmale) Put simply and aptly, New Horizon is all killer, no filler! Rarely have I heard an album so complete and so fully realised. From the brilliance of the playing and arranging to the magnificence of Reel's voice, this is heaven all the way. A superb album by an artist good enough to hold his own in rock\u2019s premiere league. Andrew Hobbs, Hi Fi + magazine When it comes to making classy albums, Ben Reel's your man. Year on year, Reel's songwriting is growing in stature in every department, yet he still doesn't get the wide spread recognition he richly deserves it's one of the strongest albums this year. This CD isn't just music: it's art. AllGigs.co.uk review of New Horizon, 8th October 2007 Ben Reel, a native of South Armagh, has in the words of one journalist \u2018operated under the media\u2019s radar for far too long\u2019. On the evidence of this release, his fourth album, I would have to agree. The songs and the playing are really impressive, an earthy mix of rock, roots and blues, all mixed lovingly together with soulful vocals. His song writing shows maturity and progression which comes through with repeated plays. Featuring some great slide guitar from Micky McCarney and terrific vocals from Kelie Redmond, \u201cHell In Ur Own Head\u201d is a standout, closely followed by the semi spoken \u201cWhen Will Be Ever Be Free\u201d. \u201cFor U And I\u201d shows the band at their best with a lovely rock/soul groove that you wish would go on longer. All in all this is an impressive album from a major talent who needs further investigation.

The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON). The Allaire Show features John sharing the stage with local and up-and-coming talent as well as more experienced and established musicians, some who\u2019ve come from as far away as Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\n\nAWARDS\n- American Songwriter Assoc. \"Best Lyrics\" Award 2009 for \"Magnets\" (Nashville, TN)\n\n- Toronto Independent Music Awards \"Best Live Act\" (2009)\n\n- CBC Telefest top independent music video in Ontario (1989)\n\n- Top independent video in Canada 1989 as selected by MuchMusic\n\n- Canadian College and University Radio Assoc. top album of the month - \"All's Well\" (1989)\n\n- PROCAN (now SOCAN) independent songwriter award for \"Cry at Night\" (1987)", "otherInfo": "Pub Party Fridays brought to you by Flora Hall Brewing.

He spent six years performing in the hardcore circuit and released an independent album with a huge fan following before moving to Philadelphia, PA.\n\nSoon after arriving in the city of Brotherly Love, he co-founded the Philadelphia-based rock band Octane (2000-2005). Still considered to this day as one of the most successful bands to come out of Philly, Octane sold more than 20,000 copies of their independent debut release and enjoyed more than 1000 spins of the single \u201cI For One\u201d on Philadelphia rock station 94.1 WYSP.\n\nDuring this time, Quinn was named \u201cBest Guitarist\u201d in the Philadelphia region by the Philadelphia Music Awards in 2001 and 2004 and was routinely praised by fans and critics alike for his signature guitar technique, especially on slide guitar, and dynamic on stage presence.\n\nAfter enjoying five successful years with Octane, Quinn left the band to found a blues-based hard rock band that would later become known as Fosterchild. This project would quickly gain national attention and the band was signed to the SMG/ILG/WARNER record label from 2007-2010. After touring the country numerous times with Fosterchild, the band culminated its journey with a special invitation to perform for the U.S. troops stationed at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, where the group performed in front of thousands of soldiers.\n\nToday, Quinn is lead guitarist for multi-platinum selling, Seattle, WA based rock band, CANDLEBOX. The band has finished it's sixth studio effort and was released on April 22nd, 2016. A world tour in support of the album kicked off in South America in early March 2016.\n\nDuring his career, Quinn shared the stage with such acts as: Ozzy Osbourne, Slash\u2019s Snakepit, Gene Simmons, Metallica, Kid Rock, Disturbed, Judas Priest, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Sixx AM, Chevelle, 3 Doors Down, Seether, Sevendust, Three Days Grace, Candlebox, Tantric, Shinedown, Robert Randolph & The Family, Alter Bridge, Godsmack, Taproot, Nonpoint, Mudvayne, Deftones, Zakk Wylde, Black Label Society, Buckcherry, Warren Haynes, Marshall Tucker, Devo, Finger Eleven, and the House Of Blues All-Stars (with whom he performed alongside rock legends Jeffrey \u201cSkunk\u201d Baxter of Doobie Bros & Steely Dan, Fran Sheehan and Barry Goudreau of Boston, drum phenom Kenny Aranoff (John Mellecamp, Bob Dylan, John Fogerty), Chris Chaney (Jane\u2019s Addiction, Alanis Morrisette), and James Montgomery of Johnny Winter fame).\n\nQuinn is currently endorsed by Gibson Guitars, D'Addario Strings, Planet Waves Accessories, The Rock Slide by the Songhurst Guitar Company, and LPS Clothing.\n\nFor more information, visit www.brianquinnguitar.com.", "otherInfo": "LIVE FROM HEADQUARTERS. 5/29/20.

prolific Brill building pop Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and \u2013 fingers crossed - Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music - and give them an experience that they will never forget.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Every Friday I will transport my viewers into the past where they will feel as thought they are sitting behind the recording console at Motown's Hitsville recording studio.

They were later joined by Tony to become Above & Beyond.\n\nAnjunabeats was formed when Jono Grant and Paavo Siljamaki met at Westminster University and discovered a mutual love of electronic music. The pair kicked off the label in 2000 with \u2018Anjunabeats Volume 1\u2019, a massive club success which instantly ear-pricked the likes of Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold and Paul van Dyk. The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label. It provided the perfect outlet for their numerous production projects \u2013 Oceanlab, Aalto, Freestate, Nitromethane, POS, Rollerball and Tranquillity Base \u2013 and every release was warmly received by elite DJ\u2019s and club-goers across the globe.\n\nIn late 2002 James Grant joined the Anjunabeats management team and the label began to expand its output, signing a series of fresh artists.

In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

It will include 11 brand new songs. This will be the first record that he has recorded & produced in his own home studio in Co. Armagh. There will also be a special limited edition of the album available only on the benreel.com website, which will include 5 bonus tracks. Since his debut back in 1999, each album has gone from strength to strength, touching on different styles of music from rock,soul,blues, Alt Folk/Americana & with the occasional injection of reggae. This was highlighted on his 2012, 18 song best of album (Ben Reel 1999-2009 Compilation 10) released only as a limited edition for loyal fans to buy at gigs, also available on iTunes worldwide. Ben\u2019s music has evolved into an honest earthy sound that has matured like a fine wine and he has very much his own sound today. This can be heard on this new album. Darkness & The Light is a powerful soulful album with deep meaningful lyrics and memorable epic anthemic songs, with strong melodies combined with imaginitive expansive arrangements. Recorded digitally but with an analog feeling of warmth. The songs deal with the struggles of life of ordinary folk since the global economic crash. Also probing for spiritual meaning and balance between the Yin and the Yang, trying to find light, hope and healing in these troubled times. Serious songs from a serious artist in a serious moment in time. In the last 10 years he has had numerous high profile TV & Radio appearances and airplay under his belt including Bob Harris BBC Radio 2 and has supported names like Jools Holland, Alabama 3, The Cranberries and appeared as a special guest at one of Hal Ketchum's shows in Dublin. He has performed his radio hit \u2018U People\u2019 with the late great Ian Dury\u2019s legendary \u2018Blockheads\u2019 and has recorded the song with award winning saxophonist Gilad Atzmon. Over the last 5 years Ben has enjoyed successful tours in Europe, receiving rave reviews and attracting a growing fan base . His band includes amongst the finest musicians in Ireland, his brother in law Michael Black on Drums, Ronnie O\u2019Flynn on bass and Mick McCarney on guitar. With this line up they have built up a loyal underground following. Ben is often described as an \u2018artist lying beneath the radar for way too long\u2019. In 2011 Ben played showcase gigs in Nashville & Memphis (Folk Alliance) where he colloborated with some of Nashville's finest, David Olney, Sergio Webb & Irene Kelley to name a few. Plans are in the pipeline to return to the U.S in 2013 to promote his new record and to follow up on his success on Airplaydirect.com radio download rock chart, which he has been number 1 for the last 3 months. Plus he will be touring extensively in Ireland, UK & Europe.

Rainy Nights nails down the pang of loneliness that emigrants feel when they are far from home and someone says something that just triggers regret. The easy, soulful melody and performance underlines the impact, with Reel\u2019s singing striking just the right note. It is the high point of the album. Though Feel Alive , the title track and the gospel of Old Bog Road come close. The Armagh singer-songwriter comes across as a honest man determined to use his love of music to best effect, and he is lucky in having a band, particularly guitarist Mick McCarney, full of expression and no little skill. www.benreel.com Download tracks: Rainy Nights, Time to Get Real http://dvdfever.co.uk/reviews/erbenreel.shtml Elly Roberts reviews The Ben Reel Band: Time To Get Real Another little gem from the Emerald Isle. Rating: 8/10 Irishman Ben Reel has consistently released solid albums over the past 10 years. My last CD encounter was 2007\u2019s fabulous New Horizon. Now on his fifth album, Time To Get Real, keeps that tradition well and truly alive with a dazzling collection of Americana crossover songs that ought to have ears pricking at all the \u2018real music\u2019 stations. Reel has a penchant for ignoring fads and trends keeping the focus on real music which is why he\u2019s become a cult artist in his native Ireland, though sadly he hasn\u2019t been picked up as genuine singer-songwriter in the UK. Everybody in the business knows he\u2019s hot stuff having supported Jools Holland, Alabama 3, The Cranberries and stage star Michael Ball no less. The good news is he doing rather well in Holland, Belgium and Germany. As an introduction to the album he\u2019s released Feel Alive as a single. The down and dirty groove has some sublime guitar licks carried by a great melody and his rough edged vocals. ________________________________________ This box of delights opens with a gentle country shuffle in the form of Rainy Night as the band moves with confidence and swagger, again with Reel dropping in some superb guitar breaks and a fine line in vocal gymnastics including falsetto along with a Neil Young-like harmonica swish. The introduction of songbird Julieanne Reek on the deliciously tender love ballad Summers Always Here only adds to the romantic mood. With a troubled heart he gushes with lyrics like \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re like the warm summer sun that\u2019s rising / Feel your warm love in my heart / Melting away the cold ice of winter / The storms have passed / There\u2019s a new life on the way.\u201d Embracing an eclectic mindset, Keep On Drivin\u2019 takes on a C.C.Rider rockabilly hue drenched in honeyed vocals, stylish pedal steel, thumping basslines and wah wah, whereas Time Slips Away is deeply reflective, yearning for his childhood days and the onset of wisdom now he\u2019s turned 35. A heavy funky bass, rolling organ, and acoustic chords make Who You Are the albums catchiest song, with the main hook coming in the chorus. For Old And Wise Reel delves deep into a more traditional Irish template which brings forward his wishes not to die a typical rock\u2019n\u2019roll death \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t wanna overdose like a rockin-roll star /Or choke on my vomit after whiskey in the jar.\u201d By far the best song on the album, closes it \u2013 the stripped back dusty-bowl ballad Old Bog Road. Reverbed harmonica leads to gentle acoustic picks, chords slabs and wailing solos, on what is essentially a mournful ballad. The verdict \u2013 Quality album. http://www.billybop.be/admin/CDdetail.asp?ID=8717 Ben Reel : Time To Get Real \u2013 CD, BRBCDA-007;B Reel Records Album Kindly Submitted by G-Promotions Style : Americana Rate (1-5) : Ben Reel is the latest addition to a series of Americana artists emerging from Ireland! Against the backdrop of the troubles in Northern Ireland, Ben first picked up his guitar when he was 15 years old inspired by greats like Bruce Springsteen or Neil Young. Today this inspirations are still to be found in his passionate music! Leading track \u201cRainy Night\u201d is one of those tunes that you start to whistle along without ever having it heard before! Country and Americana are the main genres on this album but this doesn\u2019t mean the album is limited to it. On \u201cFeel Alive\u201d Ben comes with some enjoyable soul influences while \u201cKeep on drivin\u2019\u201d throws in a lot of country as does \u201cLooking for a Lost Horizon\u201d. \u201cOld & Wise\u201d throws in some old styles and mix folk influences into this Americana tune. On \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d the title track of this album, Ben Reel, returns to his old habits and creates a song that could be from the hand of \u201cThe Boss\u201d. Closing down the album is \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d that opens with a beautiful haunting blues harp. The haunting keeps going on, both with his voice and slide guitar! As an extra, hidden track we can hear a nice rockabilly kind of version (Live) of Keep on Drivin\u2019 in a mix with the classic \u201cTrain Train\u201d Time To Get Real is already the fifth album for Ben Reel and in the past two years he has successfully toured Holland, Belgium and Germany steady working on a growing fan base. Back you\u2019ll can find him as supporting act for bands like the Cranberries, Alabama 3 or Jools Holland. The album is a true Americana effort and comes with handful of interesting tunes that makes me feel that this artist need to be in the spotlight a little more. Mr Blue Boogie http://www.getreadytorock.com/reviews2009/ben_reel.htm BEN REEL Time To Get Real (2009) Play this new Ben Reel CD to any music aficionado, and ask them where it was recorded. Nine out of ten would say Nashville. Guaranteed. Now, Ben Reel may not be a household name (yet), but let's assume for a moment his work is unfamiliar to you. OK, what genre music would you say Time To Get Real was? No problem - southern, country blues rock. And name any influences you can hear at play? Again, no problem - Neil Young is an obvious one, but also Springsteen and perhaps Chris Isaak and even a little Clapton circa 361 Ocean Boulevard. So, nationality? No brainer - a man from the deep south of the US of A. Wrong on all accounts, because Time To Get Real is the 5th album in 10 years from Irish guitarist and singer songwriter Ben Reel. And naturally it was recorded in Monaghan in the north of the emerald isle. In reviewing Ben's last album New Horizon (2007) - which had an altogether more 'west coast' feel - we pondered on image, and what might make Ben stand out from the likes of Marc Cohn. It may be that with Time to Get Real, and diving deep into Americana, Ben has found his niche. Beautifully played and recorded it's bound to strike a chord with the market that's fuelling the resurgence of Neil Young, and Springsteen's exploration of the American psyche. But the challenge is still to get his music across the pond. It's not easy to crack America - many have tried and failed, but the rootsy warmth of the songs, the soulful singing and classy playing (some wonderful blues guitar and harmonica work) would undoubtedly be lapped up with a little exposure. So remember the name - Ben Reel - a real class act. *** Review by Pete Whalley http://www.lonesomehighway.com/pdf/online-issue-7.pdf Ben Reel Time To Get Real B. Reel Northern Ireland native Ben Reel has delivered a roots album that is full of strong songs and good playing. There\u2019s some solid keyboard playing, a rhythm section that drives things along and some very tasty guitar from Mick McCarney. Reel\u2019s voice is accompanied by welcome backing vocals that help to portray the mood of the songs. Rainy Night sets the tone for time and place, a song that looks at what has been missed by moving away from your home town. Other topics are ageing, freedom, the nature of searching and of truth. Mature songs for a mature audience that\u2019s given a melodic and malleable musical base that could just as easily have come from the States as from Northern Ireland. Reel no doubt has taken from those who have also come from the North, such as the undeniable influence of Van Morrison as a beacon of musical innovation. Reel does not have Morrison\u2019s track record, but this is an album that shows all the signs of a true talent making his own way. It\u2019s time to get serious is the signal Ben Reel gives with the release of his latest cd \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d. Wasn\u2019t he before? Haven\u2019t got a clue because for me Ben Reel is a complete stranger. He is (northern) Irish and has been working at his craft for quite some time. \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d sure is a good way to get to know him and the cd is full of piercing impulses. Delicate songs, strongly carried by the accompanying musicians, but by no tarnishing ben\u2019s Vocals. (His vocals show comparisons to Rod MacDonald and John Stewart). I hope that I grow old and wise suggests that Ben has come to an age where he starts realising his own mortality, what undoubtedly determines the profundity you find again in his lyrics. With what I don\u2019t want to affect his compositions. As I said before, I only know Reels past from what I read in his biography, But \u201cTime to get Reel\u201d indeed looks like the start of a new development, a new awakening. No trace of a personal crisis. My guts tell me Ben Reel has defined he wants to make a good product. One he will be remembered by. The closing song \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d tells of a permanent goodbye Ben Reel manages to create a excellent variation of styles, and within a limited nr of spins I still a real positive feeling about Ben Reel. Serious, skilful. driven \u2026. (after the official songs there is a hidden track, a live song, where you hear the presence of a modern day Elvis. Not renewed, but very entertaining. www.rootstime.be /Rein van den Berg Oct 09 The Irish hearts are often rather melancholic. Maybe the beautiful sceneries see to a tendensy of warmth and retirement. It characterizes at any rate the dark songs of Ben Reel, which the cover of the newest album, time to get real, suggest. Eleven songs written by reel himself and richly arranged with violin, piano, appropriate guitar lines and a choice of extra additioned instruments. With this the Irish know how to display a large scale of spheres and feelings, carying names as Neil Young and sometimes Bob Dylan. Indeed in rags, because Ben Reel is a slippery costumer. Ben\u2019s first album, \u201cthis is the movie\u201d, came out in Ireland in 1999, after this the EP \u00ebxorcise me\u201d(2000) only with 3 tracks, which seemed to be forerunner for his second album \u201cLost in Haze\u201d (2001). After that came Sweet Victory (2004), U People (2006) and New Horizon (2007). We don\u2019t have to complain about man\u2019s releases and qualities: guitarplayer Ben Reel, born in silverbridge but now living in Castlebalyney, is a supreme storyteller; has a pleasant voice, writes, beside that, upperclass songs and has also the quality to gather very able musicians around him. At his new album Ben Reel is accompanied again by a fine equilibiated band: Ronnie, Michael. Mickey, John, Colin. And now we are calling names: the recordings were done in the Attic studios with producer Ronan who also has a vocal contribution in the last two songs. In the quite openers Rainy Summers etc. we hear Reel\u2019s wife Julieanne who takes the change of the singing second. Anyway, in their natural but yet larger soundscape is more than enough space for improvisation and variety, which we can hear clearly on their new album. What Ben has settled with this successor is impressing. In 11 songs the band knows to create an oppressing atmosphere, which gets enlightened only now and then. Rasping and grating, then again with deceptive lovely acoustic guitars, then with thin guitarsounds and spacious violin, the listener is taking to a voyage through the Deep South of the mind, which only can turn out bad. It is oppressing, dark, stirring and especially very beautiful. Roots, pop and folk are going hand in hand with now and then an experimental strain. The point is that Ben Reel makes magnificent music. Music that mixes influences from alt-country with the atmospheric and darkness the music from Ireland so often charcterizes. Music that attracts attention by the variety and the highstanding music, because they really can play. Ben Reel searches, with his new album, joining with the greatness of the alt-country, but takes here at the same time surrender. Time to get real is just a good patterncard of the ability of the Ben Reel Band. Everything sounds beautiful, clear and especially respectable. The sharp ends are removed expertly and almost everything is produced in a way that it has to be specially accessed for the singersongwriter radiosize.

There's lots to inspire and Ben Reel has absorbed those influences and let them inform his particular style of travelling blues. \"Time To Get Real\" isn't a classic troubadour album, but it is deep hearted blues packed with characters, places and just a wee bit of drinking. The songs are strong through out, all could standalone without being thought of as filler. Time to step up from being a solid support to being the headliner. BELGUIM http://www.ctrlaltcountry.be/Pagina1.htm#BenReel BEN REEL \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d (Ben Reel) (3,5****) Ireland has long been enjoying a good reputation, where the singer-songwriters are concerned. And with Ben Reel has another one to be proud of. With \"Time To Get Real\" the man has just delivered his fifth album in ten years time, and that is a very beautiful album. Reel is gifted with a warm, a little soulful vocal style, shows himself a truly excellent song smith and professional manner together in genres like rock, pop, folk, Americana and blues into his songs. He calls himself Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young as inspiration, but there really is not much sign of that. Reel sounds like a particularly original. Someone with a vision of his own writing and placing songs. Someone with an own sound. And it would absolutely not surprise us if he behave the songs on \"Time To Get Real\" soon break on larger scale. He fully deserves it already! Songs like it a little reminiscent of Neil Young \"Rainy Night\", the beautifully subdued piano and harmonica work on-going rootspopdeuntje \"Summer's Always Here\", the soulful rockin 'Feel Alive', the bluesy bounce \"Keep On Drivin '\", the summer, somewhere between pop, folk and country resident \"Old & Wise\" is simply magnificent. (Ben Reel is doing these days also Netherlands and Belgium for some gigs. On November 13 he is as such in McCormack's Irish Pub in Turnhout. And De Sport in Geel On Monday 9th http://www.ilpopolodelblues.com/rev/novembre09/recensione/ben-reel.html Ben Reel is part of the wide array of successful songwriters born and raised in Ireland. More precisely, the North and administratively part of the English crown. Yet in his music are heard echoes of Neil Young or Bruce Springsteen rather than those of the island's musical tradition.

(SWA) REAL ROOTS CAF\u00c9 Netherlands Dutch to English translation Very recently came from Time to get real, the fifth full-time CD of Irish singer-songwriter Ben Reel. For me a great unknown, but already 20 years active in music since he was a teenager in 1989 founded his first band, \"Trim the Velvet '. After the breakup of this band eight years later, Ben's solo tour in 1999 and came from his solo CD's available. With five number one so he just scored an average of two years each. Ben's music is best described as Irish mid-tempo alt-country, the songs are nice sound and treat a number of pressing issues for Ben. He describes one part of his life and Rainy Night Time just slips away, do proclaim his feelings, especially love, respect, in four songs and shares his thoughts with us and future expectations in another four songs. He concludes (No. 11 is) a kind of summary of this in Old Bog Road: Seasons change as people come and go, life and death is the endless flow. Want to find the answers, because the story to be told, is not gonna quit the mining for gold. Want to find a reason before I go. Before they take my body, down that old bog road. Heavy thoughts for a guy who has several years of the 40 removed. But we are not all looking for the deeper meaning of life? Incidentally, after more than six minutes of the final number is still nearly six minutes a lasting valve closure, which Ben totally in style and tempo rocking (leading to a sodden organ) announces yet another time by a wish to: (I 'll) keep on driving, a live concert recording and a perfect valve. Always funny, some unexpected hidden track. Ben's band was great response and are in addition to Ben's acoustic guitar (and occasional harmonica) bass, drums and electric guitar. A few songs do keyboards and violin along. Ben has a somewhat gritty but pleasant voice. His wife Julianne sings along to eight songs, four songs is half Bloch (e, you never know with those Irish first names) to hear. I think it's a good CD, especially through the expressiveness of the songs both lyrically and in terms of melody (Fred Schmale) Put simply and aptly, New Horizon is all killer, no filler! Rarely have I heard an album so complete and so fully realised. From the brilliance of the playing and arranging to the magnificence of Reel's voice, this is heaven all the way. A superb album by an artist good enough to hold his own in rock\u2019s premiere league. Andrew Hobbs, Hi Fi + magazine When it comes to making classy albums, Ben Reel's your man. Year on year, Reel's songwriting is growing in stature in every department, yet he still doesn't get the wide spread recognition he richly deserves it's one of the strongest albums this year. This CD isn't just music: it's art. AllGigs.co.uk review of New Horizon, 8th October 2007 Ben Reel, a native of South Armagh, has in the words of one journalist \u2018operated under the media\u2019s radar for far too long\u2019. On the evidence of this release, his fourth album, I would have to agree. The songs and the playing are really impressive, an earthy mix of rock, roots and blues, all mixed lovingly together with soulful vocals. His song writing shows maturity and progression which comes through with repeated plays. Featuring some great slide guitar from Micky McCarney and terrific vocals from Kelie Redmond, \u201cHell In Ur Own Head\u201d is a standout, closely followed by the semi spoken \u201cWhen Will Be Ever Be Free\u201d. \u201cFor U And I\u201d shows the band at their best with a lovely rock/soul groove that you wish would go on longer.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON). The Allaire Show features John sharing the stage with local and up-and-coming talent as well as more experienced and established musicians, some who\u2019ve come from as far away as Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\n\nAWARDS\n- American Songwriter Assoc. \"Best Lyrics\" Award 2009 for \"Magnets\" (Nashville, TN)\n\n- Toronto Independent Music Awards \"Best Live Act\" (2009)\n\n- CBC Telefest top independent music video in Ontario (1989)\n\n- Top independent video in Canada 1989 as selected by MuchMusic\n\n- Canadian College and University Radio Assoc. top album of the month - \"All's Well\" (1989)\n\n- PROCAN (now SOCAN) independent songwriter award for \"Cry at Night\" (1987)", "otherInfo": "Pub Party Fridays brought to you by Flora Hall Brewing.

He spent six years performing in the hardcore circuit and released an independent album with a huge fan following before moving to Philadelphia, PA.\n\nSoon after arriving in the city of Brotherly Love, he co-founded the Philadelphia-based rock band Octane (2000-2005). Still considered to this day as one of the most successful bands to come out of Philly, Octane sold more than 20,000 copies of their independent debut release and enjoyed more than 1000 spins of the single \u201cI For One\u201d on Philadelphia rock station 94.1 WYSP.\n\nDuring this time, Quinn was named \u201cBest Guitarist\u201d in the Philadelphia region by the Philadelphia Music Awards in 2001 and 2004 and was routinely praised by fans and critics alike for his signature guitar technique, especially on slide guitar, and dynamic on stage presence.\n\nAfter enjoying five successful years with Octane, Quinn left the band to found a blues-based hard rock band that would later become known as Fosterchild. This project would quickly gain national attention and the band was signed to the SMG/ILG/WARNER record label from 2007-2010. After touring the country numerous times with Fosterchild, the band culminated its journey with a special invitation to perform for the U.S. troops stationed at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, where the group performed in front of thousands of soldiers.\n\nToday, Quinn is lead guitarist for multi-platinum selling, Seattle, WA based rock band, CANDLEBOX. The band has finished it's sixth studio effort and was released on April 22nd, 2016.

The original members were Stephan Jenkins (singer, songwriter, electric guitar), Kevin Cadogan (guitar), Adrian Burley (drums), and Jason Slater (bass guitar). The band's original line-up changed several times before the release of the group's debut album, and again shortly after the release of the band's second album Blue \u2014 at which point the band's main guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released from the band under circumstances that still elicit controversy among fans. Third Eye Blind's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, electric guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums), and Tony Fredianelli (electric guitar). More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. Leo Kremer has been filling in for Salazar during concerts, but it is not yet known if he will become a full-time member. For a time the band also featured ex-Smash Mouth drummer Michael Urbano and early Primus drummer Tim ''Curveball'' Wright.\n\nThird Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis, prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing Liam Gallagher to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins' outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of \"the biggest mouth in music\" by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox Twenty.\n\nA fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, is scheduled for a winter 2008 release. Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor. Only Jenkins' lyrics and vocals are left to be finished; all instrumental work is reportedly complete. Recent live performances have revealed a majority of the new tracks being worked on, including \"Don't Believe a Word,\" \"Lay Back (and the Water Will Hold You),\" \"In the Skin,\" \"Summer Town,\" \"Second Born,\" \"(You Really) Don't Like Me Now\" aka \"Campfire,\" \"Monotov's Private Opera,\" \"Break Me,\" \"Stevie Ray Vaughan,\" \"Red Star,\" and \"Standing Up For You.\" Other tracks mentioned for the album by Fredianelli are \"Away,\" \"A Sharp Knife,\" \"Captain of Emo,\" \"Swimming,\" and \"Jesse 2k.\" He also confirmed that \"Lay Back\" was scrapped. A number of previously unreleased recordings were made available, including \"Persephone,\" \"Carnival Barker\" (an instrumental), and numerous instrumental sessions declined by Jenkins for inclusion on the fourth album.", "otherInfo": "Please note the exact film start time is 6:11PM ET."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Feco Jimenez ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9018851.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Masculino", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Feco Jimenez\nNacido en 1995 en Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Espa\u00f1a), ligado a la escena electr\u00f3nica canaria , desde muy joven sinti\u00f3 una gran pasi\u00f3n por la m\u00fasica electr\u00f3nica y la cultura de club, aunque no fue hasta 2010 cuando comenz\u00f3 a pinchar. en fiestas privadas, carrozas de carnaval, festivales y discotecas de renombre.

Coming up near Chicago in the early 90s, Intel grew up in the early days of Hip Hop with a fascination for turntablism. He quickly hit the decks with a set of turntables and a mixer he \u201cborrowed\u201d from his brother, and started off on the path that Chicago DJ legends like PNS and Tone B Nimble paved. Between the house parties and the B-boy battles, Intel quickly made a name for himself across the Midwest.\n\nIntel still holds down the decks for the B-boys, but his scope and style--fueled by his limitless passion and innovation--have evolved. The kid honing his craft on hand-me-down tables now shares (or steals, depending on your perspective) the stage with Hip Hop legends (Lupe Fiasco, Afrika Bambaataa, Wu-Tang Clan, ?Love), EDM greats (Amon Tobin, Kid Koala, Nero, The Prodigy) and three time world DMC champion DJ Qbert, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. He holds down quite a few residencies in Chicago, including the world famous Smart Bar, rips up stages at huge music festivals (Lollapalooza, North Coast Music Fest, SXSW) and works everything from charitable events to openings to fashion shows for clients like: Adidas, Red Bull, Scion, AT&T and Microsoft.\n\nWNUR and the DJZTRIP.com community both voted DJ Intel \u2018Best MixTape DJ.\u2019 The New York Post and Entertainment Weekly both love him.

Over ten years and seven long players into their career, White Denim are still in the relentless pursuit of a thread- in other words, a wick.\n\nThe band have carefully studied the greatest records ever made, but they write songs just dumb enough to drink, dance, and fight to. Theirs is a music that aims for the whole body, while equally satisfying the mind. While it has morphed, expanded, and even burst apart, White Denim\u2019s sincere and human drive and ability to spark exhilaration have been unerring constants of the band\u2019s existence. Now, two years on from their comeback album supreme 'Stiff,' singer-guitarist Petralli and bassist Steve Terebecki have changed tack again for their seventh full-length, 'Performance.' A new studio, new collaborators, and new techniques for writing and recording influenced the elastic possibility and liberation felt throughout.\n\nIf the album\u2019s title seems meaningful in its deadpan simplicity, it is. There is, of course, the meaning of \u201cperformance\u201d that applies to anyone for whom the live arena is the proving ground. There\u2019s also something more personal but universally acknowledged \u2013 the gap that exists between what we project and who we really are. \u201cThere is something absurd and isolating in continuing this pursuit for personal connection on such a wide scale. When writing an album I essentially leave my actual life, retreat deeper into myself and as it nears completion, I evaluate my work based on my own extremely skewed notion of what is widely relatable and still legitimately cool,\u201d says Petralli. \u201cMy idea of cool is most significantly shaped by Steve\u2019s body language when we are talking through ideas in session.\u201d It has been said that \u201cA clown enriched knows neither relation nor friend.\u201d\n\n'Performance' was mainly recorded over eight weeks at the band\u2019s new downtown Austin studio, Radio Milk. Once an old general store constructed in 1902, it is now respectfully restored and sandwiched in between bars and modern condominiums. Two new players were key in what Petralli describes as \u201ca super-collaborative record:\u201d keyboardist Michael Hunter, a \u201cyoung, humble genius with endless potential\u201d and Conrad Choucroun, a \u201cridiculously solid\u201d drummer with a long stint with NRBQ on his resume. \"If you take nothing else from this at least take some time to listen to NRBQ, rock & roll scholars who shared members with the Sun Ra Arkestra\" advises Petralli. It makes sense that White Denim would develop a kinship with a player from their circle. In many ways, they are a continuation of that sort of group. One that will never stop pushing and taking every opportunity to shine a light on and exemplify what is truly good about Rock & Roll music.\n\nCategorically speaking, White Denim is still impossible to narrowly pin down. There\u2019s the glam-rock strut of \u201cMagazin\u201d and \u201cIt Might Get Dark,\u201d the dueling guitars on the low-slung blues prog of \u201cMoves On\u201d, and the sideways jazz of \u201cSky Beaming.\u201d There are plenty of pleasingly unexpected musical moments on the title track and the easy-rolling closer \u201cGood News,\u201d along with some seriously distorted guitar. In the title track, Petralli sings, \u201cFlashing light in a tunnel, You\u2019re indicating a change.\u201d In many ways, White Denim is the flashing light in a dark and crowded tunnel of showbiz glop.

The younger brother of Cajun fiddler Michael Doucet, Doucet has used his distinctive hybrid of folk-style fingerpicking and bluegrass-like flatpicking to strengthen the performances of Beausoleil, the band he's shared with his brother for over 21 years. With the release of his debut solo album, Quand J'ai Parti in 1991, Doucet successfully stepped into the spotlight.\nDoucet first played the guitar after recuperating from a broken arm sustained while practicing with his high school football team. Although he initially taught himself to play by using Bob Dylan and Paul Simon songbooks, Doucet became fascinated with flatpicking after listening to an album by Doc Watson.\n\nTogether with his brother and banjo player Raoul Breaux, Doucet played Cajun music in Louisiana clubs in 1975. When the project proved commercially unsuccessful, the band broke up with Doucet enrolling in college and his brother going on to form the Cajun rock band Coteau and the original lineup of Beausoleil. A turning point in Doucet's evolution as a guitarist came when he heard the playing of the late Clarence White on an album, The Kentucky Colonels 1965-1967, in 1980. Inspired by White's use of unusual chords and imaginative melodies, Doucet began to develop his own unique style.\n\nAlthough Doucet did not play on Beausoleil's first recording session in Paris, he joined the group before the recording of their debut album, The Spirit of Cajun Music, in 1976.\n\nGrand Texas Doucet moved to New Orleans, where he continues to reside, in 1980 to work at the World's Fair. In addition to his solo album and recordings with Beausoleil, Doucet was featured on albums by Chuck Guillory (Grand Texas), Octa Clark & Hector Duhon (Ensemble Encore) and Michael Doucet (Dit BeauSoleil).\nDoucet was accompanied on Quand J'ai Parti by members of Beausoleil (Michael Doucet, Jimmy Breaux, Tommy Comeaux, Billy Ware and Tommy Alesi) and influential dobro player Josh Graves, whom he met during a \"Legends of Folk Violin\" tour.\n\n\nMore to come", "otherInfo": "A weekly show of tunes I play now and used to play long ago.

However, within three months of moving to the big city, Theresa\u2019s father and best friend passed away.\n\n\u201cIt was a very confusing time for me,\u201d recalls Theresa. \u201cI was very insecure. I had all these dreams, but they seemed so far out of reach.\u201d\n\nTheresa re-focused her music career to work behind the scenes, taking intern roles at Jive Records and with Sheryl Crow\u2019s management company, W Management. Later, she landed in the advertising world as a music producer for commercials. But, last year, Theresa decided to once again chase her girlhood dreams, and reignited her career as an artist.\n\nNow living in Queens, Theresa has come a long way since \u2018Love is Like Bubblegum.\u201d Her 2019 debut single, \u201cThings About to Change\u201d reached over 40 thousand streams in its first month on Spotify. Then, in November of 2019, she released her highly acclaimed follow-up single, \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Another Day.\n\nTaking cues from the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, Theresa draws influence from artists like Blondie, Madonna, Duran Duran, Mariah Carey and Lady Gaga.\n\n\u201cI wanted to BE Madonna when I was younger,\u201d admits Theresa. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t about her sex appeal. I just loved her style and her story. I loved seeing what she was going to do next. And I loved that she did it ALL. She wrote, she sang, she acted. And she still does it on her terms.\u201d\n\n2020 promises to bring big things for Theresa, including her newest single, \u201cLet Go.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet Go,\u201d which finds Theresa channeling her insecurities, is the first song she wrote with Mike Cash and Jesse Blum.\n\n\u201cI had been doing a LOT of soul searching and was starting to come to terms that I was holding myself back through dwelling on experiences, people or even my former self. But it was time to shove fear in the closet and throw away the key. I needed to \u201cLet Go\u201d to move the fuck forward!\u201d\n\nAs Theresa moved forward, she continues to generate well-deserved buzz for her infectious brand of pop. Her goal is to share her music \u2013 and her story \u2013 with everyone who will listen.\n\n\u201cI want to inspire people to follow their dreams \u2013 no matter how big \u2013 at any age.

In the fall of \u201999 she moved to Salzgitter, Germany where she collaborated on a commercial pop project, marking her first experience singing in a professional studio. In May 2000 she returned to Austin to explore performing and song writing. Following her role as supporting vocalist and dancer for the Austin high-energy rock band Young Heart Attack in 2001, Martin launched her solo career in 2002 with an opening slot for Wilco and her debut album Pretty Things. Shortly after the album\u2019s release, she moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia and had her first commercial success when two of her songs were placed in the award-winning British-Canadian two-part drama Sex Traffic (2004) and in the TV drama series Snakes and Ladders (2004).\n\nWith her second album, Two Hearts (2008), Martin gained considerable attention as a hot up-and-coming artist with several East Coast Music Awards and Nominations. Her Two Hearts music video rose to #5 on the Much More Music Countdown, leading to tours across Canada, the US and Ireland. She performed high-profile shows with Canadian rock icon Matt Mays and sang on Parliament Hill in Ottawa for The Queen of England. You Come Home was placed in the internationally distributed teen drama series The Best Years (2010). Two Hearts won Martin two 2008 Music Nova Scotia Awards, and a 2009 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\nHer third album I Can Too (2010) received rave reviews and includes a collaboration with Blue Rodeo\u2019s Greg Keelor on her rendering of Andrew Sisk\u2019s Subject To Change. \u201cWhat sets I Can Too apart is Martin\u2019s commitment to honestly exploring complicated relationships.\u201d (Exclaim Magazine, October 2010). Following multiple East Coast Music Award Nominations and extensive touring across Canada with Juno nominated indie rock band Cuff The Duke, Martin began touring independently in Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nIn 2011 Martin worked on building her label Come Undone Records, and focused on developing a global online presence with fans via community-based projects. She worked with PledgeMusic.com to release A House Concert (2011) containing fourteen live acoustic versions of songs from her first three studio albums. Martin was nominated at the 2011 Music Nova Scotia Awards for Digital Artist of the Year and A House Concert was nominated at the 2012 East Coast Music Awards for Folk Recording of the Year. This project also raised awareness and funds for the Canadian Mental Health Association. During 2011-2012 Christina continued her community development initiatives with a yearlong Artist in Residency through Geriatric Medicine Research (GMR) at Dalhousie University and The Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 2014 she released an EP titled Remember Me, featuring five songs inspired by and dedicated to individuals affected by dementia. Co-produced and written by Dale Murray, the EP won the 2014 Music Nova Scotia Award for Inspirational Recording of the Year.\n\nSleeping With A Stranger (2012), Martin\u02bcs fifth award-winning album, reflects the artist\u2019s coming of age lyrically and musically. \u201cIt\u02bcs one of those rare albums where you have to listen to it all in one sitting. Like a good book that\u2019s hard to put down, Sleeping With A Stranger tickles the ears and within three bars you\u2019re completely hooked.\u201d (Americana UK, October 2012). The album won her the 2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Recording of the Year Award. It was nominated for three East Coast Music Awards Come Undone Records was nominated for Music Nova Scotia Company of the Year. What I Always Knew was placed in the CBC television drama Heartland and her single Falling For You remained on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 countdown for five months.\n\nMartin returned home from Europe in the spring of 2014, following eighty concert dates which included a performance at Rolling Stone Weekender Festival, a publicity partnership with PopUp Records in Hamburg, and an endorsement from the esteemed Duesenberg Custom Guitar Shop in Hannover, Germany. She secured relationships for her future from her home base as Artist in Residence in the city of Dachau, Germany.\n\nIt\u2019ll Be Alright (2015) found Christina attaining what her music has always suggested, a place where the ghosts of her musical heroes freely mingle with the architecture of modern music. Working closely with her long-time producer and guitarist Dale Murray, drummer Brian Murray and bassist Jason Vautour, Martin made a conscious effort to confound the expectations of those who have categorized her in the past. This record utilizes far more sonic textures, allowing Martin to explore the many sides of her musical personality. The album won a 2016 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year and her It\u2019ll Be Alright single rose to #6 on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 chart. You Ran From Me was voted the #14 most played Canadian song on Sonica for 2015, and Somewhere With You was placed in the CBC Television show Heartland.\n\nFollowing two years of touring across Germany, Poland, The Netherlands, The UK, Switzerland, Austria, France and Canada, Martin returned home briefly in 2016 to write her newest album. A fervent anthem for those who are lost and longing, Lungs Are Burning was the first single from her album Impossible To Hold (Released March 23, 2018). The first single was triggered by the rising Fentanyl drug crisis killing thousands of Canadians, with Christina\u2019s lyrics set to music by her and Dale Murray. With lyrics like \u201cwhile I\u2019m watching the babies\u201d and \u201cgot to go out and get some, baby\u201d, Martin captures the desperation of \u201cchasing the dream\u201d and the horror of living it. Murray\u2019s stately production brings that stark reality home with a bite. Martin: \u201cThe song is an modest attempt to bring light to the heavy topic of addiction, and reflects my own personal sense of loss, longing and a deep void, and the ache I feel from losing my brother and friends to addiction and mental illness.\u201d For her Canadian tour dates, Christina has partnered with Center for Addiction and Mental Health to increase engagement and awareness.\n\n\u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is Martin\u2019s sixth and strongest studio album, achieving a perfect balance between organic ambience and impeccable production. \u201cI\u2019m writing about faith and love more than ever with songs like \u2018Keep Me Calm\u2019 and \u2018Always Reminding\u2019, but I haven\u2019t shaken the need to write about the darker things that are part of our human journey\u201d. Combining good taste, passionate singing and thoughtful lyrics, \u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is where music and poetry meet. The album won the 2018 Music Nova Scotia Award for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\n\nAWARDS\n\n2018 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Impossible To Hold)\n2016 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (It\u2019ll Be Alright)\n2014 Music Nova Scotia Inspirational Recording of the Year (Remember Me \u2013 EP)\n2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Sleeping With A Stranger)\n2009 East Coast Music Award Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Pop Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n2008 Music Nova Scotia Female Artist Recording of the Year (Two Hearts)\n\nARTIST IN RESIDENCIES COMPLETED\n\n2013-2015 Dachau, Germany\n\n2010-2011 Halifax NS, Canada \u2013 Dalhousie Geriatric Medical Research & Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN)\n\nFESTIVALS/CONFERENCES\n\n2019 Ottawa Blues Fest - Ottawa ON, Canada\n2019 Area506 - Saint John NB, Canada\n2018 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto, Canada\n2017 Sonder Fest \u2013 Manchester, United Kingdom\n2016 Reeperbahn Festival \u2013 Hamburg, Germany\n2016 Rising Tide Festival @ Fundy National Park- Alma NB, Canada\n2016 Harmony Bazaar Festival \u2013 Lockeport NS, Canada\n2016 Maverick Festival \u2013 Suffolk, United Kingdom\n2013 Rolling Stone Weekender Festival \u2013 Weissenh\u00e4user Strand, Germany\n2011 Winter Olympics @ Atlantic Canada House \u2013 Vancouver BC, Canada\n2011 Canada Games \u2013 Halifax NS, Canada\n2011 Canadian Music Week \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2010 Belfast Nashville Songwriters Festival \u2013 Belfast, Ireland\n2009 Folk Alliance \u2013 Memphis TN, USA\n2009 North By North East \u2013 Toronto ON, Canada\n2009 Stan Rogers Festival \u2013 Canso NS, Canada\n2002 SXSW - Austin TX, USA", "otherInfo": "Join Dale and I for another Live Stream event from our home on Facebook this week.

The band performed on the Warped Tour and other high profile gigs before dissolving. But heavy metal was never Jordan\u2019s passion; it was just a fun experience with his friends to grow musically. As a child, Jordan grew up with R&B artists like Sam Cooke and Earth Wind & Fire providing the soundtrack to his frequent road trips to a ski resort with his family. Artists from what his father called \u201cthe good music era.\u201d Those were the sounds and stylings that stuck in Jordan\u2019s musical memory and by the time he was old enough to realize that his own singing voice was a gift, it was those early groove-funk-soul singers that had shaped his personal aesthetic. If he was going to make records, those were the kind of influences he wanted to draw from.\n\nAfter his move from California to Nashville, Jordan was invited to participate in an unsigned artists retreat hosted by Centricity Music. It was the combination of Jordan\u2019s nuanced vocal abilities, the freshness of his retro-influenced melodies and songwriting, and his warm, enthusiastic personality that spurred label execs to take a closer look and ultimately sign him.\n\nJordan Feliz\u2019s debut project, Beloved, brings the rich influence of 70\u2019s sensibilities into a modern pop context. Intentionally constructing uncluttered tracks free of production tricks and excessive instrumentation, Jordan instead focused on arrangements that were designed to give the vocals center stage. The songs on the Beloved 10 song album are soul-influenced pop numbers, and the instruments present are articulate in their voicings and melodies, saying only as much as they need to.\n\n\u201cI was the kid growing up with the headphones on listening to every lick and reading the lyrics,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cMy dad had a collection of cassettes. My mom had some vinyl. I discovered artists like the Commodores, Bill Withers, and Nat King Cole through them. When I was in the studio making Beloved, I told my producers I didn\u2019t want thirty guitars stacked on one track. I didn\u2019t want five different guitar tones. I want to put one guitar sound on a song and find a way to make that one lick sound massive, the way those 70\u2019s artists were able to do. If you stack too many sounds on one track you can lose the song in all that clutter. Building \u2018clean\u2019 tracks on Beloved was very intentional.\u201d\n\nTag-team produced by Colby Wedgeworth (Lincoln Brewster, The Main, Lydia) and Josh Silverberg (Newsboys, Jon Foreman, Plumb), Beloved has plenty of radio-friendly pop melodies that manages to hit those marks without compromising Jordan\u2019s unique musical personality. The best example of his singular vision is the record\u2019s powerhouse first single, \u201cThe River.\u201d While it sounds like a pulse-quickening mega-hit from the first listen\u2014instantly singable and repeatedly listenable\u2014 the song actually rides on a deep current of soul-driven funk influence that serves to set it apart from other contemporary radio fare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big melody guy,\u201d Jordan admits, \u201cand musically \u2018The River\u2019 is my own personal happy place. It\u2019s a great driving groove that just feels good to sing. The song itself is an invitation to anyone who hears it\u2014whether they\u2019re stuck in pride and legalism or wallowing down in the mess they\u2019ve made of their lives\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to take whatever we have and to run to Jesus. It\u2019s an invitation to go down in amazing grace and to rise up being made new.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s title track, while every bit as soulful and catchy as the first single, was penned from a more personal and autobiographical posture. Jordan\u2019s wife was about to give birth to their first child, and Jordan began to consider what he, as a new father, would most want to communicate to the daughter he was about to meet.\n\n\u201cI wrote \u2018Beloved\u2019 before she was born,\u201d he says, \u201cand I wrote it with two guys who both had little girls. The thing I really wanted my daughter to grow up knowing was that no matter what the world tells her, she\u2019s beloved. She\u2019s loved beyond compare. Regardless of what any of the people around her think, she doesn\u2019t have to be concerned with measuring up because I\u2019m gonna love her unconditionally as long as she lives. She\u2019s beloved and that\u2019s a love she was born into without having to earn it. I wrote it for her, but of course the parallel of God\u2019s unconditional love for His children is obvious. Anything I feel for my daughter is just a small echo of what God feels for her and for all of us.\u201d\n\nWith its slow build and towering vocal hooks, \u201cBeloved\u201d will doubtless provide one of the cornerstones of Jordan\u2019s energetic live shows, along with \u201cThe River,\u201d a festive cut that reveals some of the artist\u2019s roots as a worship leader, and the laid back grooving track, \u201cSimple.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my record has a theme, it\u2019s probably summed up in the \u2018Simple lyric,\u2019\u201d Jordan explains. \u201cI really just wanted this to be a project that people would smile when they listened to it. I wanted to write songs that would make people feel loved. I want them to feel good. Whatever the complications of life that we might be going through at any given moment, our relationships with Jesus don\u2019t have to be difficult. We have a tendency to make it so much harder on ourselves than it really is. We think God can\u2019t love us because we\u2019re struggling with something or we messed up somewhere. But it\u2019s not that complicated. God loves us. Our ransom has been paid. The emotional baggage we carry around doesn\u2019t change the truth. We belong to God and He loves us. It really is that simple. We just have to be constantly reminded of that. The work has already been done on the cross. We just have to remind ourselves and each other to believe it.\u201d\n\nHaving just navigated a long and rocky transition after leaving the security of his local music connections, a church staff position, and moving from California to Tennessee, Jordan Feliz and his wife experienced firsthand what it means to learn to rest in the simplicity of faith in a Father who daily provides for the needs of His children. In fact, they set out from California without even enough money to make it past Phoenix. But along each leg of the journey some music gig opened up that provided enough funds to drive the next leg. By the time they reached their new home, Jordan had actually made several hundred dollars from the move.\n\n\u201cWe believed God had made it clear from the beginning we should move to Nashville,\u201d Jordan says, \u201cbut that didn\u2019t mean it was easy. After we got here I couldn\u2019t find a job. My wife and I were sharing one car. I was posting handyman ads on Craigslist and working as a valet downtown. I could hardly get any people to write songs with me. Then we found out we were pregnant and there was so much that seemed up in the air and kind of scary. In the last few months though, it\u2019s just been like this whirlwind of good things falling into place. I signed the record deal with Centricity Music in February of this year and I finished the Beloved record July 5th. Then, I actually won a brand new car, completely out of the blue, right before my daughter was born July 20th. My first single went to radio July 31st. After so much difficulty and uncertainty, God answered our prayers. He is there for all of us and all we have to do is remain faithful.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join an exclusive VIP video call with Jordan Feliz and experience a rare opportunity to ask questions and hear directly from one of your favorite artists!

Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Accidentals ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8899014.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Indie Folk Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Texas Lifestyle Magazine chose The Accidentals as the \u201cband to see\u201d at Austin City Limits, SXSW, calling them defiant, young \u2013 powerful, and undaunted.\u201d\n\nFemale \u2013fronted, multi-instrumentalist power trio, The Accidentals, (Sav Buist, Katie Larson, and Michael Dause) kicked off 2018 with the release of their debut album, Odyssey, with Sony Masterworks.

They decided on their first name, Psychedelic Breakfast, based on the suggestion of Tramontano's cousin. It is a reference to Pink Floyd's song \"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\" from their album Atom Heart Mother. Besides playing cover songs by classic rockers such as The Doors and Floyd, they released a self-titled DIY studio album in 1999. The band's popularity began to rise after four songs from this album were featured on the MTV series Undressed.\n\nThe band won their first Jammy for being \"New Groove of the Year\" in 2004. Around the same time, the band decided to change their name due to misnomers of the seriousness of the band leading to the loss of booking for shows and festivals. Spears defended the choice, though, saying that \"the Music is what is important, not the name.\" While supporting their 2005 release, Real Radio, the band performed a national tour, at times backing up popular bands such as The Wailers, moe., North Mississippi Allstars, and Gomez. In early July of 2006, Giangreco left and the band continued on as a trio.\n\nThe band is also known for a high level of musicianship. In the current incarnation, instrument swapping between members is not uncommon. Guitar virtuoso Tim Palmieri also plays keyboards, drums and bass. Both Spears and Tramontano are highly proficient guitar players. Tramontano also plays the keyboards. Such swaps are usually reserved for encores, and are especially well received by fans. Members of the Breakfast also share vocal duties. While lead vocals are typically handled by either Palmieri (a baritone) or Spears (a tenor), Tramontano will occasionally act as a lead vocalist, but is most often heard providing harmonies.\n\nOn August 3rd, 2007, it was announced that Matt Oestreicher will be joining the band as the new keyboardist.\n\nwww.thebreakfast.org - Official site", "otherInfo": "The Breakfast COVID Live Stream Episode 3 - performing The Doors' 1967 Self-titled debut album in its entirety plus a set of Breakfast originals."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tim Baker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8969941.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Techno, Electronic", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tim Baker is best known as the writer and frontman of the much-acclaimed Newfoundland group, Hey Rosetta!.

At sixteen she began performing in bars in Salvador da Bahia and discovered that her calling in life was music. Her passion for Bahian Carnaval led to the ultimate challenge of singing in a trio el\u00e9trico. Mercury took to the rolling, amplified bandstand that lumbers down the avenue among Carnaval revelers at a time in which only men sang in blocos. Since then the festa barroca has become her milieu of choice for redefining her artistry. A performer of exceptional magnetism who emphasizes creativity, responsibility, and social commitment, excellence and originality in her work, Mercury comfortably navigates musical diversity with the infectious energy and joy of being a Baiana. Her tours and concerts around the world have transformed her into an ambassador for Brazilian music. She sold more than 10 million albums wordwide and is one of the best selling female artists in Brazil.\n\nCareer\n\nDaniela Mercury formed the pop group Companhia Clic and recorded her first two albums. Pega que Oh! and Ilha das Bananas became hit singles in the late 80s. Mercury\u2019s first studio efforts paved the way for her incursion into electronic music, placing her at the forefront of what lay ahead.\n\nHer first solo project (1991), released by independent record company Eldorado, announced the arrival of a sound that conquered Brazil. The single Swing da Cor became the most played song on Bahian airwaves. From there it rippled into the rest of the northeastern region and resonated in southern and southeastern Brazil. Today Swing da Cor is synonymous with samba-reggae, a genre rooted in the Afro-blocos of Bahia (dancing groups that act as afro-centric vehicles of racial identity) and directly influenced by the ceremonial drumming used in the African-derived religious rituals of Candombl\u00e9.\n\n\nDaniela Mercury\u2019s first live concert (1992) in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Museum of Art consolidated her popularity onstage. The midday performance attracted more than twenty thousand people who spilled into the avenue, interrupting the flow of traffic.\n\n1992\u2019s Canto da Cidade (Sony) emerged just as Brazil was experiencing the enthrallment of having discovered a new star. The single that gave the album its title became a number one hit and stayed in that position for months. The LP broke sales records, giving Mercury the distinction of being the first artist to receive a diamond record for having sold a million copies. Its success is so impressive that many years have passed since its release, yet Canto da Cidade continues to sell, having already surpassed the three million mark in Brazil and abroad. Canto da Cidade sparked a special on Rede Globo, shows throughout Europe and the United States, magazine covers, and hundreds of interviews. Its success was crowned by shows throughout Brazil boasting a record number of attendants that reached more than two million concertgoers.\n\nMercury\u2019s next album, M\u00fasica de Rua (1994-Sony), proved that the singer was no fleeting sensation. The record established her versatility as a composer and arranger and more frequent domestic and international tours consecrated her as a top-notch performer. Singing in Portuguese for an international audience was not a setback for Mercury. In response to the perceived language barrier she once countered: \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m a Brazilian artist who has less difficulty expressing what I do on an international level. While my audience may not understand what I sing they certainly feel the joy and energy coming from my music and sing along.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Mercury continued to delight audiences with Feij\u00e3o com Arroz (1996-Sony), and won over critics for good. Given her unabated popularity with audiences, skeptics recognized the artist\u2019s musical consistency. Feij\u00e3o com Arroz explored the range of Samba music in its sundry phases, paying homage to Brazil\u2019s musical and ethnic roots with arrangements that showcased the modern pop sensibilities present in the most traditional of rhythms. Feij\u00e3o com Arroz was a landmark album in Mercury\u2019s career, especially in the international market.\n\nFinally in 1998 Mercury released her first live album, El\u00e9trica (Sony), in response to the public\u2019s overwhelming demand of having the electrifying atmosphere of her shows preserved on disc. Recorded in her stronghold, Salvador, Mercury blended the Bahian guitar typically used in the trios el\u00e9tricos during Carnaval with electric rock guitar. The album\u2019s repertoire included hits from previous records, including Swing da Cor, O Canto da Cidade, M\u00fasica de Rua, Rapunzel, Nobre Vagabundo, among others, and songs she had performed live but never recorded. Additionally Mercury included five new songs on the album, four of which were either penned solely by the artist or in partnership with other songwriters.\n\nSol da Liberdade (2000-BMG) reaffirmed Mercury\u2019s affinity for the samba-reggae hybrid. The single Il\u00ea P\u00e9rola Negra registered as one of Mercury\u2019s most beautiful renditions. The artist\u2019s newest challenge, hailed as her best album yet, surprised fans and critics alike. Joining forces with Suba (an acclaimed producer in Brazilian electronica), Mercury mixed the drumbeats of samba-reggae with sounds extracted from electronic music (rap, funk, lounge, house), in a harmonious, if unlikely union.\n\nSou de Qualquer Lugar (2001-BMG) brought together prominent songwriters such as Lenine, Gilberto Gil and Carlinhos Brown and showcased a remake of Rita Lee\u2019s Mutante and an electrifying version of the late Chico Science\u2019s Praieira. Electronic samba-reggae frames the album for the most part, though Mercury\u2019s most intimate and feminine side permeates throughout, from the album art to the compositions and her renditions of the songs.\n\nEletrodom\u00e9stico \u2013 MTV Live (2003-BMG) was recorded during a show at the Castro Alves Theater\u2019s Concha Ac\u00fastica in Salvador and released on CD and DVD. By inviting Portuguese singer Dulce Pontes, flamenco pop sensation Ros\u00e1rio Flores, Italian rapper Lorenzo Jovanotti, Bahian percussionist Carlinhos Brown, along with the bands Olodum, Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea, and Hip Hop Roots to join her onstage, the show became a high point on the multicultural scale of Mercury\u2019s career.\n\nIn Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico (2004-BMG), Daniela invited the most important DJs and producers of electronic music in Brazil, as well as Gilberto Gil, Carlinhos Brown, and Lenine, to participate in a commemorative disc celebrating five years of her having formed TrioTechno, the first trio el\u00e9trico of electronic music to parade in Bahia\u2019s Carnaval. The album is a fusion of a panoply of electronic musical expressions, including Drum\u2019n Bass, House, Techno, Lounge, and Dub with Brazilian rhythms that result in original song creations. The disc subsequently received a Latin Grammy nomination for best pop album of the year and Mercury was nominated for a Tim award for best female pop/rock vocals. Internet users voted Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico the best pop album of the year online in one of Brazil\u2019s most important weekly magazines Revista Isto \u00c9.\n\nIn 2005 Mercury released Cl\u00e1ssica (Som Livre) on CD and DVD. Recorded from a show she gave the year before at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Casa de Espet\u00e1culo - Bourbon Street the album is a sampler of bossa nova, jazz, and remakes of MPB (Brazilian Popular Music) hits. The recording signaled a new phase for Mercury, who chose independence from multinational record companies to gain full control of her music.\n\nThe year 2005 also saw the release of Bal\u00e9 Mulato (EMI). Produced by Mercury, Ramiro Musotto, and Al\u00ea Siqueira, the album is percussive, vibrant, and contemporary. On it Mercury draws from samba-reggae, rock, frevo (a hybrid of martial polka and African rhythms played mostly during Recife Carnaval), galope eletr\u00f4nico (the electronic version of a northeastern rhythm that imitates the gallop of a horse), and romantic ballads.\n\nBaile Barroco (2006-EMI) is the first live DVD of Mercury performing in a trio el\u00e9trico during the 2005 Bahian Carnaval. The collection of songs celebrates twenty years of ax\u00e9-music with quest performers Luis Caldas, Fernanda Porto, Banda Kaleidosc\u00f3pio and Ramiro Musotto. A highlight that exemplified Bahian Carnaval\u2019s history of diversity was when Mercury opened the parade with a baby grand piano set up on an ample stage. Accompanied by Ricardo Castro on piano, Mercury sang Ary Barroso\u2019s Aquarela do Brasil, Villa Lobos\u2019 Bachianas n.5, and some Bach, in a performance that enchanted millions of revelers at the Barra-Ondina circuit and demonstrated the singer\u2019s boldness and inimitability.\n\nPresent\n\noday Mercury has sold more than ten million albums around the globe. She was the only Brazilian artist invited to participate in the recording of a DVD celebrating the twentieth anniversary of Cirque de Soleil. In 2004 she was invited to commemorate the Montreal International Jazz Fesitval\u2019s 25th anniversary and was a special guest on Alejandro Sanz\u2019s latest DVD, with whom she sang a duet in a bullfighting ring in Madrid. Mercury has sung with the greatest names in Brazilian music and in popular music abroad. Legends such as Tom Jobim, Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Paul McCartney and Ray Charles stand out.\n\nThe artistic vitality of Daniela Mercury\u2019s musical trajectory is reflected in the fact that all of her albums have produced national hits and many of her songs have been included in soap opera soundtracks.\n\nToday Mercury is the star of bloco Crocodilo, headlining the Barra-Ondina circuit, which was created as an alternative space in an area in the center of the city that was drawing large crowds during Carnaval. From the time Mercury began parading in 1996 down the Avenue the winds along the seashore, later setting up her own camarote (boxes along the parade route), the circuit became official. Today it attracts hundreds of thousands of revelers in the same way the former Seventh Avenue circuit did in the past.\n\nThe celebration of Carnaval is a backdrop to Mercury\u2019s success on stage and in the studio. For many years she was chosen best Carnaval singer and some of her hits were named best Carnaval themed music, sang by other artists and blocos.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DAVE BRAY USA ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8628524.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Country, Rock And Country, Pop, Christian & Gospel, Acoustic Country, Rock N Roll, Christian Rock, Rock Alternative, Cover Songs, Opening Ceremonies, Rock, American Rock, Patriotic Rock, Patriotic, Rock & Pop, Corporate Band, Acoustic & Acoustic Rock, Sports Anthems, Corporate Event, Story Teller, Rock & Country, Private Event, Folk Acoustic Rock, Acousic", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dave Bray USA - Patriotic Entertainer\nDave Bray is a United States Navy Veteran.

Not just because she was only one of about seven Black kids in her junior high school, but because of the compelling power of her shockingly big voice, which stopped people in their tracks from early on. Danielia\u2019s natural gift--raw, searing vocal chops combined with a deep, buttery tone--draws from the two different rich traditions that she absorbed early in her youth. On the one hand, she couldn\u2019t get enough of what her friends and neighbors were listening to: AC/DC, Zeppelin, the Stones. On the other, she was her mother\u2019s girl: daughter of a jazz singer and member of the church gospel choir, grooving to Mavis Staples, Etta James, Billie and Ella.\n\nThe happy collision of these two traditions is her new album, Rare Child, produced by Brad Jones (Jill Sobule, Over the Rhine) and co-produced by Joe Blaney (Shawn Colvin, Soul Asylum) and Danielia herself. On Rare Child, the sheer joy and pain she evokes in her songs instantly draw the listener in. She pulls, stretches and grips her lyrics with a strength that is startling considering this lovely young woman\u2019s seemingly happy-go-lucky demeanor and petite frame. Appearances aside, like male counterparts Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone or crossover icon Tina Turner, Danielia not only has embraced the notion of Black Rock--she has redefined it.\n\nVery early on, music played a major role in Danielia\u2019s life. It became not only the focus of what would become her career, but also, her saving grace and her best friend. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have music saving me every day, I wouldn\u2019t have a place to put a lot of emotions that I have that could potentially be destructive,\u201d says Danielia. \u201cIt\u2019s how I survive.\u201d Citing her mother, Danielia speaks lovingly about musical influences that aren\u2019t quite from the playbook of most Rock performers. \u201cI loved Phyllis Hyman\u2019s ..Somewhere In My Lifetime,\u2019\u201d she says, \u201cand Chaka Khan. But not just the popular stuff. It was her version of ..I Loves You, Porgy\u2019 from Gershwin\u2019s Porgy and Bess. My mom also listened to things like Bonnie Raitt and Loggins & Messina. But for me, it was listening to Donny Hathaway and Stevie Wonder\u2019s album Songs In The Key of Life: it was about that tone that I thought was the best. And Nancy Wilson singing ..Guess Who I Saw Today\u2019\u2019; the first time I heard that I was like, ..I don\u2019t even like that genre\u2019 but I couldn\u2019t get over the delivery. There was so much emotion. I like artists that were living and feeling whatever it was they were singing about.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, more than any other important influence was Danielia\u2019s fascination with musical movies of the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s. \u201cI had a thing for Bing Crosby,\u201d she bashfully admits. \u201cI was an old soul. What entertained me didn\u2019t entertain most kids. But we had a deep life. So anything that would take me out of that life was important. Anything that was singing and had a story to it I liked.\u201d A very young Danielia would stand up on a wood crate in her backyard, grab a stick, and sing Donna Summer\u2019s ..Last Dance\u2019 to the trees and a few semi-curious deer, When she realized she could really belt it out, she decided she might make singing her career. Soon, 12 year-old Danielia joined her mom and aunts in a gospel group called Brookes Ensemble Plus, where she learned harmony. Around that time, Danielia received her first guitar. While her mother couldn\u2019t afford to pay for lessons, she gave Danielia a ..How To\u2019 book that the young writer devoured, locking herself in her room until she came out a comfortable player and had penned her first song.\n\nDanielia\u2019s home life wasn\u2019t always easy. Danielia never met her father, a native of Puerto Rico. Moving around a lot and experiencing the hardships of racism, Danielia had to grow up fast. And although Danielia came from very humble beginnings, the one thing the family was not lacking was love and determination to succeed. Raising four kids on her own without a college degree, Danielia\u2019s mother nevertheless became the head of accounting for Houghton-Mifflin Publishing and was determined to make sure her children had the best education possible. To that end, books were in no short supply at home (spoils of the trade), and the children learned to read at an early age, while calculators were treated as toys. Following her mother\u2019s example, Danielia strove to make the most of her opportunities, and in her junior year of high school, she gained entry to the Mercer County School of Performing Arts. Danielia excelled and graduated at the top of her class, going on to obtain a full scholarship to the esteemed Bennington College in Vermont, from which she graduated with a degree in Theater Arts.\nBennington was a major turning point for Danielia. There, she studied with the great avant garde jazz trumpeter Bill Dixon. Noted for his vocalic playing style, Dixon, who founded the Black Music division at Bennington, gave Danielia the guidance she needed to refine her distinctive power as a singer. By her junior and senior year, she was studying tutorials. \u201cHe trained my ear. I\u2019d go to his class every day, and he\u2019d hit a note on his trumpet and ask me to match it. I thought it was the most God-awful thing. But I realize today that my pitch is the way it is because of this training. He taught me basic music theory, keyboard harmony and what music reading and writing was. During my senior year, he sent me to study singing with the classical department so I could learn breath, which is where I found my power. He would die to know I was singing rock \u2018n roll now instead of jazz, but he changed my whole perception of how you sing a song.\u201d\n\nUsing classic songs like Eden Ahbez\u2019s \u201cNature Boy\u201d and reading the lyrics as a soliloquy, Danielia learned that \u201cin any good song, there\u2019s a story; it\u2019s a moment. And it\u2019s the same when you get onstage with those same set of words and discover how you can convey that story to an audience. It helped me realize why I loved singing. It was about the story, the tone\u2014it wasn\u2019t about all the ..tricks.\u2019 It was about singing the line straight. That took more skill.\u201d She credits Dixon with teaching her how to \u201csing ..ugly\u2019.\u201d She explains, \u201cYou have to be able to sing the wrong notes if you ever want to sing beautifully. You have to be able to be ..ugly\u2019 sometimes. That\u2019s where you find your true beauty.\u201d\n\nQuietly writing her own songs under wraps while she studied, she performed several original compositions at a recital after she spent her final year at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. Drawing raves for her performance as well as her songs, she had learned well by then that her lyrics had to be pulled from her own life experiences in order to be authentic and received in such a positive light. \u201cI have to write from what I know about. It\u2019s like in acting. I can\u2019t play a character who\u2019s 70 at the age of 30. I don\u2019t know what 70 is. I could go to my grandmother and ask her and she might say, ..It\u2019s a loss of faith, it\u2019s tired\u2019 or whatever, but I don\u2019t know this because I haven\u2019t been there. I could only play a role and be true to something I felt. Because then it\u2019s true.\u201d\nAs a performer, Danielia is glad she grew up pre-American Idol. \u201cMost kids today, if you ask why they want to perform, they\u2019ll say they ..want to be a star\u2019 or ..be in the music business.\u2019 I liked music not because I saw it as a way to get out of the life I lived and have more than what I had, which wasn\u2019t that much. I did it because it was fun; it was like a drug. I\u2019ve always felt a little selfish when people say, ..I do it for the people.\u2019 I do it because it does something for me.\u201d\n\nRadio stations across the country appreciated Danielia\u2019s unique rock talent. After Danielia released her first studio album, 2005\u2019s Small White Town (Hipshake Records), WXPN/Philadelphia and home of the nationally syndicated World Caf\u00e9 named her \u201cArtist To Watch\u201d in 2005, slotted the album\u2019s soulful single, \u201cIt\u2019s Only Life\u201d into heavy rotation, and featured her on their HDNetwork broadcast of \u201cOn Stage at World Caf\u00e9 Live\u201d. WXRT in Chicago featured Danielia on New Year\u2019s Eve, where she brought down the house in a live performance broadcast by ABC.\n\nExtensive national touring followed. Danielia traveled the breadth of the country, opening for some of the greatest acts in music, from Blues legends Buddy Guy and Etta James to Pop Rock giant Bon Jovi, to the Southern Rock royalty of Gregg Allman, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Little Feat. Crossing boundaries was no problem for the versatile Danielia, who has wowed alternative rock audiences of the Flaming Lips, Staind and Collective Soul, among many others.\n\nDanielia\u2019s unique talent drew rave reviews, with notices on her \u201craw intensity\u201d (Essence magazine), her \u201csoulful voice and searing telecaster\u201d (Time Out NY) and for possessing \u201cthe sort of voice for which the phrase ..force of nature\u2019 was coined\u201d (Austin American-Statesman). Relix magazine named Danielia one of the \u201c5 Artists You Should Know\u201d in 2007 and New York\u2019s Amsterdam News proclaimed Danielia \u201ca powerful musician that cannot be ignored.\u201d\n\nThose high accolades often come from those who\u2019ve been blown away by Danielia\u2019s live act. Audiences that experience Danielia and her band live are hit hard with the sheer emotionalism of her songs, and Danielia\u2019s performance style is all about revisiting the feelings that brought those songs into being in the first place. \u201cI give you everything. I\u2019m going back, and these stories are obviously from my life. I\u2019ve picked moments that I can safely go back to time and time again without getting to a place where I can\u2019t collect myself. But, in my songs, I\u2019ll go to places that are still an issue for me. Like in the song ..Rare Child,\u2019 I say, ..On the day I was born/I hope my daddy cried.\u2019 Because I\u2019m still dealing with those issues. So you have to be careful. There\u2019s a responsibility to your audience too, because some of your fans will go there with you. And they don\u2019t know how to pull back either; they\u2019re riding on what you\u2019ve given them. You\u2019re handing them a drug too.\u201d Going back to the idea of music as an emotional release, for the artist and the audience in equal measure, Danielia not only accepts the responsibility, but rather, she is flattered and thrilled by it and sees it as an opportunity. \u201cWhen you hear some of the stories that people tell you and how the songs have helped them through tough times, that\u2019s as good as somebody telling you your album went platinum,\u201d Danielia says. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be about, and then you think, ..This might not be why I wrote this song, but this is what this person got out of it,\u2019 and I\u2019m glad.\u201d\n\nA stiff self-critic, Danielia admits to pre-show and pre-recording bouts of nervousness. \u201cEric Clapton always says, ..If I\u2019m not nervous, I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.\u2019 But then that\u2019s where you get all that energy and you end up giving it back to the audience. And it means just as much to me in the studio when I record. At no time do I take it lightly. I want it to come out well. So it\u2019s harder than live, but I like to record with the band in the studio and I can pull from that energy.\u201d\n\nBut, as much as Danielia is a performer, she is also a proud and dedicated songwriter.\nInspiration for songwriting for Danielia comes at all hours, and her mindset is to grab the moment no matter when it comes and write it down. \u201cI\u2019ve woken up from dreams with an idea, and it was my grandfather that used to say ..God woke you up, and wants you to go get a pen and piece of paper and write it down.\u2019 Otherwise, the idea you had goes away. If you\u2019re lucky enough to get the call, you gotta pick the phone up,\u201d she says. As for when this inspiration hits, contrary to popular belief, it isn\u2019t always as a result of sadness or depression in Danielia\u2019s case. \u201cIt does tend to happen on a cloudy, rainy day, and I do agree with artists that it does happen at moody moments, or when you first wake up, when you\u2019re feeling not necessarily at the peak of happiness. But you can\u2019t always be the source for everything. I collaborate a lot. Like on ..Make U Move\u2019 I collaborated with Kareem Devlin and Shelby Gaines, who I worked with on a lot of the songs on this record. The beauty of co-writing is that when you collaborate, your co-writers take you to a place you normally wouldn\u2019t go.\u201d For example, on \u2018Make U Move,\u2019 one of the most infectious, rocking tracks on Rare Child, \u201cKareem and Shelby brought the track, and I wrote the melody and the words, and there\u2019s no way I would\u2019ve come up with that myself.\u201d\nDanielia is very candid about why she would rather wear her heart on her sleeve in her songwriting than try to deliver her music through a manufactured persona. \u201cSome people create characters to make it easier for them to perform, but that\u2019s just not me. I feel that when someone pays to come see me, they\u2019re coming to see me, and so I owe them that. And that\u2019s more interesting to me. Rock \u2018n roll is real, and that\u2019s what people want.\u201d Danielia describes Rare Child as \u201ca party, in a sense. It starts out saying ..I\u2019m gonna rock your world\u2019 but then it arcs, has some soulful moments, and has some upbeat moments. Like going to a really good party, it isn\u2019t all non-stop ..woo-hoo.\u2019 You might get into a deep conversation with someone in one corner and share a joke with someone else in another. It\u2019s an experience.\u201d\nIn making Rare Child Danielia\u2019s goal was to create an album that she could really play. \u201cI think this is an album that the audience wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd because we didn\u2019t try to write singles or do anything like that, it came out being a real rock \u2018n roll album, and that\u2019s exactly the way you have to go about it. And when you\u2019re lucky, it ends up being this great effort, which I think it is.\u201d\nThe meaning behind the album title is at once personal and universal for Danielia. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out there, I don\u2019t see too many Black girls slinging guitars. And I know they\u2019re out there\u2014Tracy Chapman, Toshi Reagon\u2014but in the venues I\u2019m doing and the genre I\u2019m doing, a lot of times it\u2019s just me. Music is so manufactured nowadays. I feel I go back more to the classics, and Rare Child just reminds me of more of the 70\u2019s feel, and I think this album is a throwback to a time when music was less produced and a little bit more honest, accessible and realer. It doesn\u2019t make it better or worse than anything that\u2019s out there now, it just makes it what it is. Which is a little rare for right now. But a lot of people want that.\u201d The Philadelphia Daily News concurs, saying \u201c\u201cDanielia\u2019s music has the swagger of Let It Bleed-era Rolling Stones, her singing has the raw emotional power of Janis Joplin and her songwriting places her among the top new musical storytellers.\u201d\n\nNow releasing Rare Child on Adrenaline Records/ADA, Danielia has put her remarkable voice, heart, and soul into a record that truly rocks.

I mean that she can tell a story with her voice in a way that cuts right to the heart of our collective humanity, whatever the topic may be.

Her first release on MPress is expected later on in the year. In the meantime, she is eager to have found such a supportive new team. \"Signing a record deal sounds pretty daunting\", Pettis admits. \"It's not a decision to take lightly. But from the first conversation with Rachael Sage and her wonderful team, I've felt like I've finally found my way home. After a decade of releasing my own music, I couldn't be more thrilled to announce that I'm partnering with MPress Records, a label that has built its unique reputation on championing and supporting artists and putting music with integrity out into the world. I'm so proud to be a part of the MPress family.\"\n\nAs a card-carrying member of the south Austin scene, Grace Pettis has amassed bragging rights to spare.

The band performed on the Warped Tour and other high profile gigs before dissolving. But heavy metal was never Jordan\u2019s passion; it was just a fun experience with his friends to grow musically. As a child, Jordan grew up with R&B artists like Sam Cooke and Earth Wind & Fire providing the soundtrack to his frequent road trips to a ski resort with his family. Artists from what his father called \u201cthe good music era.\u201d Those were the sounds and stylings that stuck in Jordan\u2019s musical memory and by the time he was old enough to realize that his own singing voice was a gift, it was those early groove-funk-soul singers that had shaped his personal aesthetic. If he was going to make records, those were the kind of influences he wanted to draw from.\n\nAfter his move from California to Nashville, Jordan was invited to participate in an unsigned artists retreat hosted by Centricity Music. It was the combination of Jordan\u2019s nuanced vocal abilities, the freshness of his retro-influenced melodies and songwriting, and his warm, enthusiastic personality that spurred label execs to take a closer look and ultimately sign him.\n\nJordan Feliz\u2019s debut project, Beloved, brings the rich influence of 70\u2019s sensibilities into a modern pop context. Intentionally constructing uncluttered tracks free of production tricks and excessive instrumentation, Jordan instead focused on arrangements that were designed to give the vocals center stage. The songs on the Beloved 10 song album are soul-influenced pop numbers, and the instruments present are articulate in their voicings and melodies, saying only as much as they need to.\n\n\u201cI was the kid growing up with the headphones on listening to every lick and reading the lyrics,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cMy dad had a collection of cassettes. My mom had some vinyl. I discovered artists like the Commodores, Bill Withers, and Nat King Cole through them. When I was in the studio making Beloved, I told my producers I didn\u2019t want thirty guitars stacked on one track. I didn\u2019t want five different guitar tones. I want to put one guitar sound on a song and find a way to make that one lick sound massive, the way those 70\u2019s artists were able to do. If you stack too many sounds on one track you can lose the song in all that clutter. Building \u2018clean\u2019 tracks on Beloved was very intentional.\u201d\n\nTag-team produced by Colby Wedgeworth (Lincoln Brewster, The Main, Lydia) and Josh Silverberg (Newsboys, Jon Foreman, Plumb), Beloved has plenty of radio-friendly pop melodies that manages to hit those marks without compromising Jordan\u2019s unique musical personality. The best example of his singular vision is the record\u2019s powerhouse first single, \u201cThe River.\u201d While it sounds like a pulse-quickening mega-hit from the first listen\u2014instantly singable and repeatedly listenable\u2014 the song actually rides on a deep current of soul-driven funk influence that serves to set it apart from other contemporary radio fare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big melody guy,\u201d Jordan admits, \u201cand musically \u2018The River\u2019 is my own personal happy place. It\u2019s a great driving groove that just feels good to sing. The song itself is an invitation to anyone who hears it\u2014whether they\u2019re stuck in pride and legalism or wallowing down in the mess they\u2019ve made of their lives\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to take whatever we have and to run to Jesus. It\u2019s an invitation to go down in amazing grace and to rise up being made new.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s title track, while every bit as soulful and catchy as the first single, was penned from a more personal and autobiographical posture. Jordan\u2019s wife was about to give birth to their first child, and Jordan began to consider what he, as a new father, would most want to communicate to the daughter he was about to meet.\n\n\u201cI wrote \u2018Beloved\u2019 before she was born,\u201d he says, \u201cand I wrote it with two guys who both had little girls. The thing I really wanted my daughter to grow up knowing was that no matter what the world tells her, she\u2019s beloved. She\u2019s loved beyond compare. Regardless of what any of the people around her think, she doesn\u2019t have to be concerned with measuring up because I\u2019m gonna love her unconditionally as long as she lives. She\u2019s beloved and that\u2019s a love she was born into without having to earn it. I wrote it for her, but of course the parallel of God\u2019s unconditional love for His children is obvious. Anything I feel for my daughter is just a small echo of what God feels for her and for all of us.\u201d\n\nWith its slow build and towering vocal hooks, \u201cBeloved\u201d will doubtless provide one of the cornerstones of Jordan\u2019s energetic live shows, along with \u201cThe River,\u201d a festive cut that reveals some of the artist\u2019s roots as a worship leader, and the laid back grooving track, \u201cSimple.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my record has a theme, it\u2019s probably summed up in the \u2018Simple lyric,\u2019\u201d Jordan explains. \u201cI really just wanted this to be a project that people would smile when they listened to it. I wanted to write songs that would make people feel loved. I want them to feel good. Whatever the complications of life that we might be going through at any given moment, our relationships with Jesus don\u2019t have to be difficult. We have a tendency to make it so much harder on ourselves than it really is. We think God can\u2019t love us because we\u2019re struggling with something or we messed up somewhere. But it\u2019s not that complicated. God loves us. Our ransom has been paid. The emotional baggage we carry around doesn\u2019t change the truth. We belong to God and He loves us. It really is that simple. We just have to be constantly reminded of that. The work has already been done on the cross. We just have to remind ourselves and each other to believe it.\u201d\n\nHaving just navigated a long and rocky transition after leaving the security of his local music connections, a church staff position, and moving from California to Tennessee, Jordan Feliz and his wife experienced firsthand what it means to learn to rest in the simplicity of faith in a Father who daily provides for the needs of His children. In fact, they set out from California without even enough money to make it past Phoenix. But along each leg of the journey some music gig opened up that provided enough funds to drive the next leg. By the time they reached their new home, Jordan had actually made several hundred dollars from the move.\n\n\u201cWe believed God had made it clear from the beginning we should move to Nashville,\u201d Jordan says, \u201cbut that didn\u2019t mean it was easy. After we got here I couldn\u2019t find a job. My wife and I were sharing one car. I was posting handyman ads on Craigslist and working as a valet downtown. I could hardly get any people to write songs with me. Then we found out we were pregnant and there was so much that seemed up in the air and kind of scary. In the last few months though, it\u2019s just been like this whirlwind of good things falling into place. I signed the record deal with Centricity Music in February of this year and I finished the Beloved record July 5th. Then, I actually won a brand new car, completely out of the blue, right before my daughter was born July 20th. My first single went to radio July 31st. After so much difficulty and uncertainty, God answered our prayers. He is there for all of us and all we have to do is remain faithful.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join an exclusive VIP video call with Jordan Feliz and experience a rare opportunity to ask questions and hear directly from one of your favorite artists!

Added to that thick and intriguing sound are a series of dark and ironic lyrics, combining the mood and tone of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds with the narrative force of The Decemberists or a short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Adam Turla fills out these sometimes frightening, sometimes beautiful lyrics by conjuring up a cast of character voices, allowing the songs to speak with the force of the characters themselves, and providing the listener with a sense of ensemble unique in rock music.\n\nBut this ensemble feel is not only the result of Turla's vocal playfulness, but of the cohesive playing of the band itself. Sarah Balliet channels her Kentucky bluegrass roots through the skilled hands of a concert cellist, playing point and counterpoint to the lyrics and guitars with magnificent grace and style. [bandmember from=2000]Matt Armstrong's bass guitar provides the rhythmic framework of the band, but also takes the lead with surprising frequency, guiding Murder by Death into driving highs and brooding lows. And Alex Schrodt's drumsticks almost dance across the skins, giving the band what the Chicago Reader called \"a rhythm section Nick Cave or The Faint would die for.\" The result is a fascinating slice of American Gothic, replete with trail rides, whiskey shots and Old Scratch himself.\n\nMurder By Death were discovered in 2000 by Thursday vocalist, Geoff Rickly, when the two bands played on the same bill at a gig in their hometown of Bloomington, Indiana. Rickly introduced the band, known at the time as Little Joe Gould, to his friend Alex Saavedra (owner of Eyeball Records), who signed the group immediately. Rickly performs discreet background vocals in the song Killbot 2000. The Little Joe Gould EP was issued in 2001, the group later deciding on changing the name to Murder By Death, which they felt better represented the \"Americana noir and dramatic post-punk\" of their sound.\n\nMurder by Death's unique sound has developed over several years of touring and recording. Constantly evolving their sound, the style changes from their first release Like The Exorcist, But More Breakdancing to their sophomore release, Who Will Survive, and What Will Be Left of Them?. \"Who Will Survive...\" grew from a small, limited pressing album into a sleeper hit as they constantly toured the country, sharing the stage with bands as diverse as The Weakerthans, Rasputina, Lucero, Against Me!, and William Elliott Whitmore. \"Who Will Survive...\"'s rich narrative structure, which recounted the travails of a small western town besieged by the devil, not only garnered popular and critical attention, but inspired a number of artistic reactions and responses, including ballet and stage productions, paintings, and even a PhD thesis.\n\nThe band's third album, entitled \"In Bocca al Lupo\", forgoes the integrated narrative structure of \"Who will Survive..., \" presenting the listener with an album built on thematic connections. \"In Bocca al Lupo,\" which translates roughly to \"In the Mouth of the Wolf\" (a phrase said before students take exams in Italian classrooms, and to which the students respond \"Kill the Wolf\"), examines themes of sin, transgression, punishment, and redemption, touching on different lives and different stories in each individual song. The resulting album resembles the 1979 murder mystery from which the band takes its name-a pastiche of bad deeds and good intentions, of last minute heroism and, in some cases, nearly impossible forgiveness.\n\nMusically, \"In Bocca al Lupo\" is as diverse as the various stories that the album recounts. The songs themselves reflect the stories they tell-gritty rock and roll beats drive \"Brother\" and \"Sometimes the Line Walks You,\" complex tango rhythms twine themselves through \"One More Notch,\" and lonely western guitars accompany the simple elegance of \"Shiola\" and \"Raw Deal.\" Each of the album's ballads and waltzes, chants and hard hitting rock songs, meld content and form, creating meaning in the music itself. Murder by Death's unique musical aesthetic ties these seemingly disparate tracks together. With the help of producer J. Robbins (Jets to Brazil, Jawbox, Against Me!) the lush melodies and harmonies so unique to the band transform these varied sounds into a coherent and cohesive album, an album whose overall sound and sensibility melds the darkest moments of Modest Mouse's \"Good News for People Who Love Bad News\" with the maudlin country roots of Western folk-rock. The band's thick, fretted, knotty sound provides a through line, tying together an album as musically diverse as the backcountry roads and basement rooms that inspired it.\n\n\"In Bocca al Lupo,\" on Tent Show Records, the band's own label, shows off Murder by Death's maturity, both as songwriters and musicians. The album is alternately rough and gentle, elegant and complex, intelligent and playful; it moves from one to the other without breaking stride, without interrupting the album as whole. Murder by Death is known for their talent as performers, for their live presence, the ambiance and energy present in their music. \"In Bocca al Lupo\" harnesses this energy and distills it, adding to it the maturity of a band constantly on the road.\n\nRed Of Tooth And Claw\n\nMurder By Death's fourth album, and first with Vagrant Records was released in March 2008, entitled Red Of Tooth And Claw. Produced by Trina Shoemaker at Dark Horse Studios in Tennessee, the record features former keyboardist Vincent Edwards on the song \"Ball & Chain\" and is also the first album to feature new drummer Dagan Thogerson, who replaced founding member Alex Schrodt. It continues with the band's trademark themes: \"lust, betrayal, and classical archetypes of good and evil.\" In Turla's words, the record is an \"Homer\u2019s Odyssey of revenge, only without the honorable character at the center.\" The vocals are again sung in the same low, baritone range as In Bocca Al Lupo causing many critics to speculate that Red Of Tooth And Claw breaks less new ground than previous efforts, although in general the album has been well received. As described by allmusic.com the album \"carries over some of the Old West outlaw feel of its predecessor, but it's more aggressive and freewheeling here. [...] [The album] isn't a departure for Murder By Death, but their ability to keep their sound fresh and vibrant speaks well of their musical abilities.\" To celebrate the album's release, Murder By Death played two shows on the same night in their hometown of Bloomington.\n\nMembers\nAdam Turla - vocals, guitars\nSarah Balliet - cello, keys\nDagan Thogerson - percussion\nMatt Armstrong - bass\n\nPrevious members\nVincent Edwards - keys (left the band in 2004 to pursue an art degree)\nBrandon Cooper - keys mid-2004\nAlex Schrodt - percussion through mid-2007", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ross Ellis ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8794749.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ross Ellis was born and raised in the small town of Monterey, Louisiana (pop 439).

A relentless touring schedule has earned them a fervent following around the world, with fans ranging from jam-band hippies to corpse-painted headbangers.\n\nTheir latest album, You Are Literally a Metaphor, is the culmination of a fifteen-year musical journey. Packed with the same fury and dazzling virtuosity of their previous work, Metaphor is also a portrait of three musicians reaching new levels of maturity.\n\nFrom the bluesy swing of \u201cWhen You\u2019ve Loved and Lost Like Frankie Has\u201d to the ethereal electro-synths of \u201cSketches From a Blind Man\u201d, CTS\u2019s minimalist pop instincts stand shoulder-to-shoulder with progressive metal and freewheeling improvisation in a true expression of their omnivorous musicality. Three of Metaphor\u2019s nine songs are Eastern European traditionals, but could easily be mistaken for the band\u2019s original tunes, so singular has their sound become. CTS retain their signature fiery maximalism while pushing the hooky, anthemic songwriting to the forefront. Bassist John Ferrara\u2019s new Taurus bass pedals and guitarist Gabriel Marin\u2019s new custom Vigier double-neck guitar add new dimensions to the band\u2019s already diverse sound.\n\nThis is an album born of comfort and growth. In the five years since World War Trio, the band has toured extensively, Marin and Ferrara have released side projects, and drummer/percussionist Jeff Mann has gone from a relative newcomer to a road-hardened veteran.

Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers.

They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN.

But the South Korea born, New Mexico raised performer hardly realized just how dynamically his skills on the instrument would mesh with his ultimate development as a rocker in the popular regional bands Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and now, his emergence as a powerful and emotional singer/songwriter in his own right. On his debut album These Illusions, Park plays violin and acoustic guitar in addition to reaching out to acoustic rock fans everywhere with his inimitable vocals. Because of the mostly personal nature of the songs, the compelling 11-track collection rolls like a fascinating chronology of the 27-year-old singer\u2019s life, beginning with tunes he wrote when he was an engineering student at New Mexico State in his now adopted hometown of Las Cruces. He was also building his catalog of songs as he played violin and contributed backing vocals for several years in two well known regional bands: the mostly cover band Live Bait and the \u201cscreamo\u201d metalcore/hardcore group Kiss To Betray. Playing in Live Bait, his violin came in very handy for those Dave Matthews songs and it helped him take songs like Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d to a transcendent level. Live Bait won the local college radio station KRUXFEST for \u201cBest New Alternative Band\u201d in 2005 and Kiss To Betray won the Las Cruces 2006 Battle of the Bands and later played at well known venues around the country like Headhunters in Austin, The Viper Room in L.A. and hotspots in Phoenix. As a solo artist, Park has since headlined regularly at local clubs like El Patio Bar and Hurricane Alley, the Albuquerque haunts the Launch Pad and Rally\u2019s Pub on 4th Street, and in Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix and even Colorado Springs. He recently posted two live performance videos on his myspace (myspace.com/danielparkmusic), one of which features his unique looping technique which allows him to play violin and guitar \u201csimultaneously\u201d on the same song. While Park enjoyed his time in Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and the notoriety he received as a featured performer, in some ways he felt he was always gearing up for his eventual breakthrough to the forefront as his own artist. In the months leading up to the breakup of Kiss To Betray, Park gathered his best material, entered what kiddingly refers to as \u201ca local ghetto studio\u201d and started to come to grips with These Illusions. While many of the tracks on the album have their roots in romantic relationships, the hypnotic and percussive, acoustic guitar driven title cut cuts to the core of his desire to find his own creative path in life\u2014even if it means going against the mainstream expectations of our society. Other songs tap slightly into his lifelong search for identity as an Asian born man adopted (along with two of his siblings) by a white American family. Other key tracks on These Illusions include the jangling, high energy \u201cTimes Have Changed,\u201d which laments the shift in life as his significant other chooses to move on. The graceful, easy strumming ballad \u201cWhat We Should Be\u201d is another heartbreaker about learning to accept the changes in a relationship when one person leaves to pursue his or her dreams\u2014while still celebrating the memories. Park spins a different perspective .., going even deeper and more introspective .. in Me,\u201d a song about a man who hits rock bottom and realizes his need to adjust his course. \"Daniel Park has distilled what it is to be a singer songwriter in the late oughts, and in doing this, has created a blueprint that every individual with an acoustic guitar and a microphone should follow for the next decade.\" - James @ NeuFutur.com www.danielparkmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jack and the Vox ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9297994.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "d, Victoria Vox, Jack Maher", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Could there be a better moniker than Jack & the Vox, for the husband and wife duo comprising of Jack Maher and Victoria Vox?

Co-Produced and engineered by Brian Fox (Wingtips, Ganser), the new album intertwines classic genres such as Darkwave, Post-Punk and Goth while a richly layered modern Synth-pop sensibility elevates the album to something larger than simple nostalgic recreation. Performed and composed almost entirely by Armondo (with key contributions by Twin Tribes, Vincent Segretario of Wingtips and Gretta Rochelle of My Gold Mask), \u201cSecond Seduction\u201d is simultaneously personal yet fantastical.

On this recording, Valdes is again featured with his Afro-Cuban Messengers, and the compositions include nods to flamenco, the Gnawa music of Morocco and the ritual rhythms of the Orishas, the deities of the Afro-Cuban Santer\u00eda religion. There are mentions of hard-bop and danz\u00f3n but also echoes of Bach, Rachmaninoff and Miles Davis -- and yet the sum total is a deeply personal and open-ended sound. And it\u2019s all Chucho Vald\u00e9s.\n\n\u201cSince I was a student I had this idea of taking disparate elements, mixing them and seeing what happened. And little by little, over time, I\u2019ve found my ways,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cAnd I love it because it\u2019s a search that forces you to investigate and study. It\u2019s not all about Afro-Cuban music. I\u2019m always looking for new things.\u201d\n\nThe concept in Border-Free \u201cwas to do many different things but all in my own style. Now, that is something very difficult to achieve.\u201d\n\nDionisio Jes\u00fas \"Chucho\" Vald\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, was born in a family of musicians in Quivic\u00e1n, Havana province, Cuba, October 9, 1941. His first teachers were his father, the pianist, composer and bandleader Ram\u00f3n \u201cBebo\u201d Vald\u00e9s, and his mother Pilar Rodr\u00edguez, who sang and played the piano.\n\nAt the age of three, Chucho already played at the piano, using both hands, in any key, melodies he heard on the radio. In fact, there is a famous anecdote that tells the story of Bebo tricking his friend, the late Israel \u201cCachao\u201d Lopez, about checking out, with his back to the player, \u201ca young North American pianist.\u201d Chucho was then four years old.\n\nAt the age of five, Chucho began to take lessons on piano, theory and solfege with maestro Oscar Mu\u00f1oz Boufartique. He continued his studies at the Conservatorio Municipal de M\u00fasica de la Habana, from which he graduated at 14. Chucho also took private lessons from Zenaida Romeu, Rosario Franco, Federico Smith and Leo Brouwer.\n\n\u201cAt home he played jazz: the music of Ellington, Count Basie, and Glenn Miller\u2019s band. I\u2019ve been privileged. Because Bebo was the piano player at the Tropicana I could see true legend of jazz in person. He took me to see Nat King Cole, Errol Garner and Sarah Vaughan when I was child studying music. You can\u2019t imagine the effect that had on my life! It was enormous! Magical!\nAt 15 Chucho formed his first jazz trio end in December 1958 he worked as a pianist at the Deauville and St. John hotels in Havana. In 1959, he debuted with the orchestra Sabor de Cuba, directed by his father, Bebo. That band accompanied the top singers of that era such as Rolando Laserie, Fernando \u00c1lvarez and P\u00edo Leyva.\n\n\u201cMy father taught me everything about Cuban music, South American music, jazz, and how to work with an orchestra,\u201d reminisces Chucho. \u201c He gave me the piano chair, and stayed on as director, so I could learn how to work under a conductor. We did our shows and a million other things with that orchestra, including accompanying shows at the Havana Hilton. I learned a lot there. He is my idol, \u201che pauses, then continues. \u201cI don\u00b4t say was, my idol. He is my idol. He was my teacher. He still is.\u201d\n\nChucho\u2019s family and professional life took a dramatic turn in 1960 when his father left to work in Mexico and from there he moved to Europe, where he eventually settled. Bebo Vald\u00e9s never returned to Cuba. (Father and son saw each other again 18 years later at Carnegie Hall, where Chucho was debuting in the United States with his group Irakere. The relationship was fully restored in 2000, when they met again to play a duet on Calle 54, a film about Latin jazz by Oscar winning Spanish director Fernando Trueba. The father and son reunion culminated, musically, in Juntos Para Siempre, a 2007 duet recording that won both a Grammy and a Latin Grammy. Bebo Vald\u00e9s died on March 22, 2013. He was 94.)\n\nIn the early \u201860s, Chucho worked as a pianist at the Teatro Mart\u00ed (1961), the Sal\u00f3n Internacional del Hotel Habana Riviera (1963) and the orchestra of the Teatro Musical de la Habana (1964-67). In 1967, and after a suggestion of his old teacher, the great guitarist, composer and director Leo Brouwer, Chucho organized his own combo.\n\nStill, that same year he joins the important Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, then directed by maestros Armando Romeu and Rafael Somavilla. While a member of the orchestra, Chucho revisited the idea of a small group and, in 1970, he appeared at the Jazz Jamboree in Poland leading his own quintet.\n\nIn 1972, after recording Jazz Bat\u00e1, an album featuring an unusual jazz trio comprising bassist Carlos del Puerto and singer and percussionist Oscar Vald\u00e9s on bat\u00e1 (the traditional hourglass shaped drums used in the ritual music of the Orishas), Chucho decided to enlarge the group adding brass and trap drums. That\u00b4s the genesis, in 1973, of Irakere, a small, Cuban-style big band that played an explosive mix of jazz, rock, classical music and traditional Cuban music, including Afro-Cuban religious music and instruments.\n\n\u201cThe ideas for the brass have to do with the work we did with the Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, which was a great big band,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cI tried to imitate that with four horns -- two trumpets, a alto and a tenor sax -- and with just that try to have the sound of a big band. Of course when you have monster players like Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, [trumpeter] Jorge Varona and [saxophonist] Carlos Averhoff you can write anything you want and it will work.\u201d\nIrakere first made its mark internationally in Finland in 1976. But the following year, the band was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie in a visit to Havana on a jazz cruise that also included pianist Earl \u201cFatha\u201d Hines and saxophonist Stan Getz. In 1978 the producer Bruce Lundvall, then president of CBS, signed the band for the label. Irakere debuted, unannounced, as \u201csurprise guests,\u201d at Carnegie Hall as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. As fate would have it, the program that night also featured pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner, two of Chucho\u2019s main influences.\n\nSelections from Irakere\u2019s performances at Carnegie Hall and at the Montreux Jazz Festival comprised the repertory of Irakere (CBS) their debut recording in the United States. The album won a Grammy as Best Latin Recording in 1979.\n\nThe group went on to create an extraordinary body of work that includes great dance recordings such as Homenaje a Beny Mor\u00e9 (Pimienta, 1989) and Indestructible (Sony, 1997); explorations of Afro-Cuban religious music such as Babal\u00fa Ay\u00e9 (Bemb\u00e9, 1999) featuring the great Orisha music singer L\u00e1zaro Ros; as well as ambitious projects such as Tierra En Trance (Are\u00edto, 1983) and Misa Negra (Messidor, 1987)\n\nIrakere\u2019s lineup went through many changes over the years. Throughout, Chucho remained as the one, great constant. But success had its costs. Except for the remarkable solo outing Lucama (Mission, 1986), his talent as a pianist was largely out of sight, obscured by his other obligations with the band.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1997, Chucho won his second Grammy for his work on Habana (Verve) as a member of trumpeter Roy Hargrove\u2019s Crisol. The following year, while not completely leaving Irakere behind, Chucho started a parallel career as a solo player and quartet leader, looking for greater opportunities to explore and showcase his playing.\n\n\u201cTwenty five years with the same band is a long time,\u201d said Chucho at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to play solo and with a quartet for some time now. My work as a pianist and soloist gets diluted in Irakere. My job in the group is to be the composer, arranger and musical director and that\u2019s a completely different role.\u201d\n\nChucho stayed with Irakere until 2005.\n\nThe fruitful period that followed is highlighted by albums such as Solo Piano (Blue Note, 1991), Solo: Live in New York (Blue Note, 2001) and New Conceptions (Blue Note, 2003), as well as quartet recordings such as Bele Bele en La Habana (Blue Note, 1998), Briyumba Palo Congo (Blue Note, 1999) and Live at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note, 2000), capturing a performance that features Chucho\u2019s sister, singer Mayra Caridad Vald\u00e9s . The recording won a Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album.\n\nThere were also Grammy awards for the already mentioned Juntos Para Siempre (Calle 54, 2007), the duet recording with Bebo; and for Chucho\u2019s Steps (Comanche, 2010), featuring his new group, the Afro-Cuban Messengers .\n\nIn total, Chucho has won five Grammys and three Latin Grammys.\n\nIn 2012, Chucho reorganized his Afro-Cuban Messengers which currently feature Yaroldy Abreu, percussion, Dreiser Durruthy Bombal\u00e9 , bat\u00e1 drums and voice; Reinaldo Meli\u00e1n, trumpet, Gast\u00f3n Joya, bass and Rodney Barreto, drums.\n\nHis most recent production, Border-Free, is yet another expression of the continuing musical search and evolution of Chucho Vald\u00e9s as a pianist, composer, arranger and director.", "otherInfo": "On Friday, May 29 at 5PM PT, SFJAZZ presents a live stream of Chucho Vald\u00e9s' February 2019 concert.

Hannah always knew she wanted to be an entertainer, but it wasn't until she was ten years old that she made her debut solo performance at her fourth grade Christmas Recital. She sang \"Tender Tennessee Christmas\". After that she was hooked. She focused on nothing else. At fourteen she picked up a Squire acoustic guitar that her younger sister had abandoned and quickly began learning to write. Over the next four years she performed at fairs, coffee houses, shopping malls and talent shows throughout the Upper Midwest. At eighteen Hannah moved to Nashville, TN to make her dreams a reality. She attended Belmont University in Nashville to study the business of music and vocal performance. After two years she decided to leave Belmont and delve deeper into the art of song writing. She also began performing her own material in and around Nashville. In 2010 Hannah released her first EP, a self produced project called, \"No Stopping, Standing, Parking\". It received rave reviews from the Nashville songwriting community. Soon after it's release, she was personally selected to attend the prestigious Horse & Writer Songwriting Invitational by one of Nashville's most successful songwriters, Skip Ewing. Hannah was a contestant on the 2011 season of the reality television show, \"The X Factor USA\". Her goal was to show America her unique version of country music. The results were evident when her fan base exploded and has continued to grow ever since. Hannah returned to Nashville to continue performing and writing. Her hard work paid off when she secured four song cuts on the debut album of country artist, Rachele Lynae, on Momentum Label Group. Hannah's newest project, \"The Freedom EP\", was released on Thanksgiving Day 2012. Her current single from the project, \"No Where Left to Roam\" has been sent to Country, Americana, College and Internet radio around the world and is receiving an enthusiastic response. \"The Freedom EP\" includes five original tracks and is available now on all major online stores including iTunes and Amazon, as well as her website.

Josie saw through to his true intention, but she also saw that he was sincere about his music. Well, Tom went home and set to work arranging his music with a violin in mind. A rehearsal date was set, and one of the first songs they did was to become the title song on their first CD, Ready, Willing, and Able.\n\nTom had been in a number of rock bands, and they had always met an early demise. He was ready to try a different tactic for getting a band going. This time he was going to create a core of two people that could work together, and build from there.\n\nJosie had been wanting to get more into playing jazz violin. The spontaneity of improvisation was intriguing to her. Problem was, there wasn't a lot of opportunity for getting together with other jazz musicians. Her violin was always drowned out by the other instruments, and electric violins and violin pickups hadn't yet come into use.\n\nThe time was right for these two to get together. Tom's use of open tunings and fingerstyle guitar gave Josie the inspiration to improvise contrapuntal melodies. At first their music was a combination of folk and classical, which can be heard on their first CD.\n\nAs time went on ttheir sound evolved to encompass any musical inspiration that came their way. Determined to break the mold of typical acoustic guitar and violin music, they dive into the blues, rock and roll, jazz, and anything else they can think of.

Bluhm\u2019s music, as an acclaimed solo artist as well as with the Hips, his duo project Skinny Singers with Jackie Greene, fronting The Rhythm Devils (featuring The Grateful Dead\u2019s Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann), Ball-Point Birds (duo with Hips co-founder Greg Loiacono), and in his wife\u2019s band Nicki Bluhm & The Gramblers, is a timeless mix of classic rock, Americana, California country, folk, psychedelic blues, and power-pop. Though varied and ambitious, Bluhm never sounds disjointed, his work always tied together by impeccable songwriting.\n\nBluhm grew up listening to eight-track tapes of Leon Russell, Jim Croce, Anne Murray, and The Beach Boys. He got his first taste of singing in the church choir and it was Neil Young\u2019s Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere that inspired him to pick up a guitar. Captivated at an early age, Bluhm has always been connected to music\u2019s spiritual capacity. \u201cThe transformative power of music is really the best part\u201d he says, \u201cand it\u2019s why so many of us are obsessed with music.\u201d\n\nAlthough The Mother Hips were courted by major labels and signed to Rick Rubin\u2019s American Recordings while still in college, they\u2019ve yet to receive the riches of rock stardom. Instead Tim Bluhm settled into a prolific, slow-burning career adored by many yet virtually unknown in the mainstream. Along the way Bluhm has shared the stage with such luminaries as Johnny Cash, Wilco, The Black Crowes, Widespread Panic, Lucinda Williams, M. Ward, Cracker, John Hiatt, and Phil Lesh to name a few.\n\nWhile The Mother Hips were constantly touring up and down California\u2019s coast, Bluhm became infatuated with surfing. In 1997 he purchased a Toyota pick-up with a camper shell and began drifting from town to town, spending his days in the water and crashing in the truck. Standing at 6 feet 5 inches the Toyota wasn\u2019t the most comfortable accommodations and was soon replaced by a legendary van that Bluhm called home until 2003.\n\n2006 offered Bluhm, Bay Area musician Jackie Greene, and engineer Dave Simon-Baker the opportunity to open Mission Bells Studio where Bluhm has produced albums for the Hips, Jackie Greene, Hot Buttered Rum, Dave Brogan, Little Wings, and the studio has hosted Phil Lesh, Los Lobos, Rogue Wave, Jonathan Richman, Josh Ritter, and ALO.\n\nIn 2005 Bluhm teamed up with San Diego-based singer/songwriter/guitarist Steve Poltz and combined his love of the outdoors with his passion for music with The High Sierra Singer/Songwriter Workshop. The unique four day backcountry experience offers attendees the opportunity to write songs and learn from two of California\u2019s most renowned songwriters in one of the country\u2019s most amazing locations.\n\nBluhm and his bandmates further blurred the lines between Mother Nature and music by launching The Mother Hips Family Hipnic in 2009. A two day festival set in gorgeous Big Sur, CA hosted by the Hips, \u201cit\u2019s everything I like about music festivals\u201d says Bluhm; \u201cgreat acts, pristine surroundings and no crowds.\u201d 2010 was an even greater success and all signs point to an annual outing where fans will continue to flock.\n\nWhen not touring the world in a rock band, producing albums, surfing, skiing, camping and hiking, Tim Bluhm lives with his wife Nicki in their San Francisco home.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ So Hype ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7069503.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "DJ So Hype", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Derrick Reeves, known as Hype or DJ So Hype, is an American DJ and producer of segway music. \u201cHype\u201d, meaning extravagant or intensive publicity or promotion., suits his personality and skill-set perfectly when talking about his craft. This is due to his well-known ability to work with any genre of music, or combination of multiple genres at one time, to produce dynamic and high energy music sets. In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture. As the resident DJ since 2004 of some of Vegas\u2019 hottest clubs and lounges including Rum Jungle, Jet Nightclub & Koi Nightclub inside of the Planet Hollywood. Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip. Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cFRIDAY NIGHT HYPE\u201d EVERY FRIDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brandon Stansell ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9869255.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Country Pop, Contemporary Country, Country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With Jimmie Allen\u2019s recent #1 song, Kane Brown\u2019s #1 album and recent Grammy wins for artists like Kacey Musgraves and Brandi Carlile, Country music seems to be swinging open its doors to some of the more unlikely of country artists - enter Brandon Stansell.\n\nWhen CMT premiered the video for Brandon\u2019s last single HOMETOWN in November 2018, he instantly became what they called,\u201cliving history.\u201d The premiere of this video, addressing LGBTQ themes, is a first for the home of Country Music videos.\n\nThe video then went on to be named one of Rolling Stone\u2019s Top 10 Country Music Videos of 2018.\u201d\n\n\"Country music may not be known for being inclusive to LGBTQ artists, but rising musician Brandon Stansell is redefining the genre one soulful song at a time, \u201c says Billboard\n\nHis is a bold new voice in the genre, as comfortable making you tap your foot as shed a tear - a singer songwriter with something to say, and a voice to remember.", "otherInfo": "Join Brandon Stansell in Partnership with The GRAMMY\u00ae Museum to celebrate the release of his brand new single \u201cHurt People,\u201d which includes a can\u2019t miss collaboration with fellow country artist Cam!

We eat gumbo in our flannel shirts, and we eat red beans and rice while head-banging!\u201d\n\nMusic was a huge part of Eva and Cedric\u2019s childhood, their first shared fandom being for \u201cTurn Your Love Around\u201d by iconic vocalist and guitarist George Benson, which they would dance to together every time the radio played it. They enjoyed looking in at what their older siblings were digging on MTV, such as Jay Z, Nirvana, Blind Melon, Michael Jackson, and \u201c90s pop music was awesome too! And R&B like SWV, En Vogue, etc.,\u201d Eva says. In high school their tastes had drifted; Eva was introduced to Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd. After high school she researched and grooved on the old blues and folk that had influenced those classic rock bands. At the same time, she and Cedric were also big World-Wide Wrestling fans \u2014 \u201cwe loved wrestling! Cedric loved it before I did, but then I became a fanatic too.\u201d They really enjoyed the hard rock music used in bouts, drawing them closer to heavy metal.\n\nAbout this time Cedric had started to play the drums and wanted to hear the songs that Eva was writing, which she found exciting. He matched drum parts to songs she had only worked out so far on guitar, later on getting a bass player and another guitarist. As soon as they had a few arranged, they were ready to start performing. They went through some changes: The Black Tones as a four piece only lasted for a while, then became a trio, \u201cbut Cedric and I were the founders and the only consistently reliable members, so now we just keep it as a duo, while hiring other musicians to play instruments live with us.\u201d Eva had also been in an all-girl punk band called BUST, but she ended up channeling everything into The Black Tones with Cedric.\n\nThrough countless shows supporting a few early singles, The Black Tones felt they finally got their first big breakthrough opening for Death Cab for Cutie in an anniversary benefit for the Paramount Theater. \u201cThat was the biggest show we\u2019ve done!\u201d Eva exclaims. She gives credit for reaching that height to NighTrain, the all black female punk band that she says discovered and championed them when they had freshly started.\n\nFor Cobain and Cornbread, The Black Tones are returning from their singles to work with the renowned, glorious grunge producer Jack Endino, introduced to them by Eva\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and music writer Jake Uitti. Jake had interviewed Jack and sent him their song \u201cWoman in Black\u201d without Eva\u2019s knowledge and Jack replied how much he loved it and wanted to work with The Black Tones.\n\n\u201cI was never really big on recording in a studio,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m a live show nut, I just love performing. Being in studios was always very stressful for me, but when we worked with Jack, that totally changed! It was the best recording experience I\u2019ve ever had. Jack is like a scientist, a chemist behind the soundboard. He had great ideas that strengthened each song. I\u2019ve never met anyone with an ear like his, it\u2019s unbelievable, though he\u2019s a calm, humble, kind, efficient, honest and very intelligent guy \u2014 I was so intimidated at first, I mean, here\u2019s the guy who recorded the Melvins, Nirvana, Soundgarden, and the list goes on. And now he\u2019s working with us and he\u2019s really into it!\u201d\n\nCobain and Cornbread also features help from their friend Mason Lowe from Bread & Butter, on \u201cChubby and Tubby\u201d (a frenetic garage rock instrumental ode to the landmark Seattle variety store) and \u201cWelcome Mr. Pink\u201d (the band\u2019s autobiographical anthem). \u201cMason has a great ear and was really amazing to work with.\u201d Ed Brooks mastered all the songs on the record, with Jack checking back in to make sure he was looped on everything. \u201cAs a band we are of course rooting for the record, but it\u2019s even more special when everyone else is as well!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something very unique about the songs (all originals save for a cover of \u201cRiver of Jordan\u201d) and sound unique about the minimalist sound Jack helped The Black Tones achieved, reminding one of the debuts from The Ramones to the Stooges to the Modern Lovers. Eva acknowledges the brute power of the album\u2019s sound, \u201cit\u2019s pretty vulnerable and raw and I like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are songs like \u2018Welcome Mr. Pink\u2019 where you can hear the click sound from me pressing down on the button to turn on my reverb pedal.\u201d Or in their righteous, ferocious Black Power anthem, \u201cKey of Black (They Want Us Dead),\u201d \u201cafter the second guitar chorus when I go back to the solo, I almost forgot to press my Wah Wah pedal back on so it comes in a little late.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not factory made or even ever scratch the surface of perfection, we\u2019re real people, this is real life and these little details remind me of the imperfections of life,\u201d she says. \u201cLife\u2019s real, life\u2019s the blues, coming from the heart.

The vocal performance by band co-founder Serena Pryne was so gut-wrenching and so emotionally draining, mining the very depths of her soul that she practically collapsed into the arms of superstar producer GGGarth Richardson when it was over. That vocal take and the similarly powerhouse performances from her bandmates, came to be the template and benchmark for the rest of the album. \u201cI knew it was a powerful song with a lot of emotion behind it and I was a little intimidated to record it\u201d said Pryne. \u201cHe let me do my thing and just pour everything I had into the microphone. He said I would know when I was done.\u201d From that moment on, that song set the tone for the rest of the record. \u201cI don\u2019t know if GGGarth knew it ahead of time and planned it with that song, because he would always reference Don\u2019t Ask if we were struggling at any other moment. He set the entire tone based on that track,\u201d said guitarist and band co-founder Nick Lesyk. The entirety of Windows and Stones is just as creatively, spiritually and emotionally intense and takes the listener on an aural and experiential journey that they won\u2019t soon forget. This too is emblematic of The Mandevilles\u2019 \u2018leave it all on the floor\u2019 approach to writing, recording and especially performing the music live. And it\u2019s music that couldn\u2019t be more straightforward and unpretentious in its approach and delivery. No studio trickery, experimental flights of fancy or self-indulgence - just rock and roll. \u201cBeing a Canadian, I think it\u2019s funny that I describe it as American rock and roll. I say that because it\u2019s reminiscent of Tom Petty, John Mellencamp, Bob Seger and Bruce Springsteen - all rolled into one. Our music comes from the same place.\u201d said Lesyk. Pryne and Lesyk are the creative nucleus of The Mandevilles and have been musical partners for nearly 15 years, although both bring significantly different musical influences to the table. \u201cSerena\u2019s influences are steeped more in the roots of rock and roll whereas mine are a little more contemporary. But there are a lot of commonalities: we love Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. And then there are newer songwriters like Ryan Adams and Jason Isbell,\u201d said Lesyk. As the frontwoman for the band, Pryne is the focal point and centre of attention for the band for both her force-of-nature stage presence and her amazingly dynamic and unmistakably authentic whisky-soaked voice. \u201cI played in a blues band when I was a kid. That definitely shaped the sound of my voice. Even though I don\u2019t listen to blues records all the time there is just something about it that I gravitate to \u2013 it was natural for me,\u201d Pryne said. \u201cAnd oddly enough I didn\u2019t really dig into a lot of female artists until I was in my mid-20s. Until then, Robert Plant was more of an influence on me. When I started to discover women in music it was Tina Turner initially. And Bonnie Raitt is huge. I just love the tenderness in her voice, which she can also turn into a real raspy growl.\u201d The Mandevilles is the latest incarnation of Pryne and Lesyk\u2019s musical merger, which began around the turn of the millennium in the Niagara Region of southern Ontario. After playing in cover bands separately and then together, the duo started penning their own material and formed the hard rock outfit Oliver Black. Soon thereafter they were courted by an American record label that soon went bankrupt, leaving the band at loose ends, and living in the United States. After moving to Europe for a short time, the band released an album under the name Serena Pryne and The Mandevilles which saw them begin an ongoing songwriting collaboration with Nashville-based Niagara Falls transplant Dave \u201cDwave\u201d Thomson. But with a revolving door of musicians and a yearning for something fresh, Lesyk and Pryne decided to return to Canada and reboot the band. Only guitarist Taylor Laslo was kept, and long-time friend Brett Bendo was brought in to play drums a couple of month before the band was set to fly to Vancouver to work at Richardson\u2019s The Farm Studios. After auditioning a number of prospective bassists, Waylon Glintz blew his future bandmates away and got the gig \u2013 three weeks before recording was to begin. Alongside Don\u2019t Ask, Windows and Stones features infectious, melodic rock tunes like the lead-off track, Hangovers, which as evidenced by the name, encapsulates the unpleasant result of an evening of overindulging. \u201cWe visit our friend Dave (Thomson) a couple of times a year in Nashville. During one visit he had a massive blow up with his then fianc\u00e9. But then they reconciled and we decided to have a party to celebrate. We bought several litres of rum and drank it all in one night. I think we almost killed him! The next day he didn\u2019t wake up until well into the evening and he looked like death. When he woke up we wrote the song in about 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d said Lesyk with a hearty laugh. A more blues-rock fueled version of the traditional country break-up song is I Stole Your Band. \u201cI was working as a seamstress and I was bored one day and kept singing this line \u2018I stole your band when you broke my heart. It was just one of those funny little anecdotes where I\u2019m saying to a fictional boyfriend \u2018if you do something stupid, I\u2019m going to steal your f***ing band,\u201d said Pryne. While The One was another defining moment for the Mandevilles as it was a song that truly brought all five members into the creative process. \u201cWhen we were in pre-production we had a magical moment which I never would have expected. It was in a completely different style when we first brought it to GGGarth, just a happy little folk song. He said it was good but didn\u2019t really go anywhere,\u201d Pryne explained. \u201cWe said let\u2019s take five minutes and work on it a bit. All of a sudden we just started playing and all five of us together created this whole new song. It was one of those inexplicable crazy moments. It\u2019s kind of a heavy song about death, but ambiguous as to what has died \u2013 a person, an idea, a dream a relationship \u2013 it means different things to different people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all us on this record. There are very few tricks, no Auto-tuning of the vocals, and we\u2019re all playing real instruments on every track,\u201d said Pryne. With this remarkable, well-crafted album that manages to be tight in its musicianship but loose in its vibe, The Mandevilles have taken one giant, definitive leap for rock and roll.

This is due to his well-known ability to work with any genre of music, or combination of multiple genres at one time, to produce dynamic and high energy music sets. In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture. As the resident DJ since 2004 of some of Vegas\u2019 hottest clubs and lounges including Rum Jungle, Jet Nightclub & Koi Nightclub inside of the Planet Hollywood. Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip. Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cFRIDAY NIGHT HYPE\u201d EVERY FRIDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

Zane began honing his chops in LA's vibrant music circuit on his 12th birthday and later refined his style at USC's prestigious Thornton School of Music, becoming one of the most in-demand guitarists on both coasts in the process. Possessing an exciting and extremely rare combination of creativity and virtuosity, along with an audiophile's ear for guitar tone and an extraordinary ability to sightread, Zane has been referred to as \"The best guitarist in NY and LA\" by Bono of U2. More recently, John Mayer handpicked Zane to play guitar on his current world tour and latest album, sans audition, after Mayer discovered Zane's fiery performances online. But with his newfound passion for writing and singing his own material, Zane is quickly gaining significant attention as a lead vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. While Zane's guitar playing has been described as daring, passionate, soulful, and jaw-dropping - tremendous labels for a young man many are proclaiming to be the next great guitar hero - Zane is now rapidly accumulating equally praiseworthy descriptions about his compositions and vocal abilities. As people witness Zane's evolution from gunslinging guitarist to full-fledged frontman, comparisons to the early days surrounding the release of John Mayer's debut EP \"Inside Wants Out\" have even been serendipitously drawn. Bob Lefsetz has raved about CARNEY - where Zane began his meteoric rise as a lead guitarist - likening the band's sound to \"a mysterious trip into the heart of darkness.\" But, Zane's original songs lean slightly away from the raw and brooding Rock and Roll that defined CARNEY as they gravitate towards his roots in Jazz, Blues and Pop. His songwriting style is grounded in visual storytelling, honesty, surrender and hope and his melodies, while imaginative and adventurous, are irresistibly catchy and instantly familiar. Zane's lyrics have been likened to those of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray LaMontagne, and his voice has been compared to singing icons Jeff Buckley, Damien Rice, and Jimmy Gnecco. This unique combination of masterful guitars, unforgettable hooks, and emotively provoking lyrics - all expressed with his profoundly moving and honest voice - is what makes Zane such a one-of-a-kind talent; one that seems poised to join not only the greats of his generation, but those who've come before him. Live performance is where Zane's most inherent gift shines; his undeniably infectious charisma - one that captivates the audience the instant he takes the stage.

Pepper and Abbey Road eras and beyond.\n\nBased in the Los Angeles area, the band has toured extensively since its founding in 1997 -- performing at hundreds of venues throughout the U.S. and in many countries across the globe, including Japan, Malaysia, France, Hong Kong, The United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Mexico, and Brazil -- where they've skillfully recreated the Beatles' music multiple thousands of times, yet always with a freshness and excitement that audiences love.\n\nWhat makes The Fab Four unique among Beatles tribute bands is the not-so-simple fact that the four band members play all their own music live. This is just one more factor that gives their performances an energy and immediacy that backing tracks and sequencers can\u2019t.\n\nConsidering the complexity of the Beatles\u2019 later work and the fact that it was never intended to be performed live, what The Fab Four do onstage is phenomenal. Without a \u201cfifth Beatle\u201d anywhere in sight to make their job easier, these four highly accomplished musicians recreate all the sounds of an incredibly diverse catalog of Beatles favorites 100 percent live and in real time -- and their technical precision, musical artistry, and onstage chemistry make every concert a stunning performance!\n\nAudiences will appreciate their dynamic stage presence and the almost boundless energy that keeps them moving around the stage practically non-stop throughout the night, as they systematically move through the different Beatles eras, changing costumes between sets to represent the early Beatlemania years, the Sgt.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

Whether it was rocking out to Bruce Springsteen in his dad\u2019s car or singing along to Garth Brooks with his mom, music always played a big part in Chris\u2019 life. Fast forward a few years and, like most kids, Chris couldn\u2019t stand to listen to the same music as his parents. Being from St. Louis he had to know every word to Nelly\u2019s \u201cCountry Grammer\u201d, he also fell in love with artists such as Usher and Fall Out Boy. His mix of pop, rock and country separates him from most other artists out there. After graduating from Ole Miss and spending a few summers traveling back and forth from Oxford to Nashville, Chris decided it was time to make the move. Initially knowing only a few people in the Music City, his drive and determination were quickly noticed throughout town.\n\nFrom almost empty bar rooms to fraternity parties to sold out shows, Chris has been captivating audiences everywhere he goes. Having opened for bands like The Marshall Tucker Band and LoCash, Chris\u2019 stage presence and voice pull the audience in until they are all on their feet! Recently teaming up with United Talent Agency, Chris has been on the road touring all over the midwest and southeast regions.\n\nSo keep an eye out for when Chris will be playing near you. You won\u2019t want to miss one of Nashville\u2019s \u201cRising Country Stars\u201d!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tony Suraci Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9729939.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Rainbow, California", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tony Suraci\u2019s performances are purely musical with deep, honest manifestations of tone and expression.

A prolific songwriter, he has a large and varied catalog of songs ranging from heart-wrenching acoustic ballads to heart-pounding heavier rock. His music is published by EMI Music Publishing Canada (2004-present). Lukas first ventured onto the music scene with two Canadian bands, Cleavage (1995-2005) and Rise Electric (2005-2006), which helped prepare him for what was to come. He entered and won the competition television show Rock Star: Supernova (2006) which earned him front man status with Tommy Lee (Motley Crue), Jason Newsted (Metallica), and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). Their band Rock Star Supernova completed an album and a world tour of the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Following the tour, Lukas returned to Los Angeles and began writing and recording new music. The Love and Lust EP (June 2007) was released and he completed the solo acoustic Love and Lust Tour, making over two dozen stops throughout the United States and Canada. The new material was well-received by fans, and the band Stars Down was born (2008-present). After touring with his new band, Lukas began playing local gigs at such southern California hot spots as The Roxy, The Key Club, The Mint, and Viper Room. The year 2010 kicked off with a mini East Coast tour and Lukas working on his first full length album. Hollywood was released (July 2010) and debuted live at West Hollywood\u2019s famous Viper Room. The all acoustic Hollywood Stripped followed (August 2010). After moving to Nashville, in addition to local and out-of-town gigs, he wrote, recorded, produced, and released six additional recordings. The first three were Seed EP (December 2010), Story Teller (January 2011), and Super, Sex, Magic (February 2011). He also co-wrote, provided vocals, and recorded several music videos for a side-project, Switchblade Glory (April 2011). Lukas released Prophecy (November 2011) and Christmas Collection (December 2011) to complete a very busy year. But he wasn\u2019t finished, releasing the album 8 Days (April 2012) soon after. Lukas has appeared on many media outlets, including performing live at the 2006 Gemini awards, the CBS television series Rock Star: Supernova (18 million viewers worldwide), Ellen, Regis & Kelly, The Jimmy Kimmel Show, Entertainment Tonight, The Howard Stern Show, and ET Canada.

The blistering guitarist, soulful vocalist, singular songwriter and city bus driver fuses his muscular, rock-inspired blues guitar playing with his original, keenly detailed slice-of-life songs, blazing his own blues trail. With the 2016 release of his Alligator Records debut, The Chicago Way, Cannon burst onto the international stage as one the most electrifying bluesmen to emerge from Chicago in decades. His live performances unfailingly earn him heaps of critical praise and hordes of wildly enthusiastic fans. Cannon has played major cities all over the U.S., Canada, and Europe. He recently performed for the first time in Japan, delighting and surprising audiences with one unforgettable gig after another. Now, with the release of The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Cannon builds upon the foundation he\u2019s laid, creating and defining his vision of contemporary blues.\n\nThe Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp features twelve Cannon originals, ranging from the burning social commentary of the title track to the wryly told, up-to-the-minute truths of Insurance to the trademark Cannon humor of Stop Me When I\u2019m Lying and Ordinary Woman. He gets serious on the haunting The First 24, the Martin Luther King-inspired The Silence Of My Friends and on the moving final track, I\u2019m Not Scared. Cannon\u2019s blazing guitar and soul-baring vocals are front and center. His songwriting is inspired by his deep Chicago roots, the wisdom of his grandparents and his years of observing the public while driving a bus. His songs tell timeless stories of common experiences in uncommon ways.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the solos,\u201d Cannon says, \u201cIt\u2019s about the songs. People get used to everyday life, so it\u2019s easy to miss the things around them. I write about those things. I know the problems of Chicago, the hardship, 'cause we\u2019re always a scapegoat. But I choose to love and respect the city because of the Chicago blues giants that came here from down south. I\u2019m proud to be standing on the shoulders of every great Chicago blues musician who came before me.\u201d\n\nToronzo Cannon was born in the Windy City on February 14, 1968, and grew up in the shadows of the notoriously tough Robert Taylor Homes. Theresa\u2019s Lounge, one of the city\u2019s most famous South Side blues clubs, was nearby. As a child, Cannon would stand on the sidewalk outside the door, soaking up the live blues pouring out while trying to sneak a glance inside at larger-than-life bluesmen like Junior Wells and Buddy Guy. He also heard plenty of blues growing up in his grandfather\u2019s home, and listened to soul, R&B and contemporary rock on the radio.\n\nCannon bought his first guitar at age 22, and his natural talent enabled him to quickly master the instrument. Although his initial focus was reggae, he found himself increasingly drawn to the blues. \u201cIt was dormant in me. But when I started playing the blues, I found my voice and the blues came pouring out.\u201d He absorbed sounds, styles and licks from Buddy Guy, Albert Collins, Hound Dog Taylor, B.B. King, Albert King, Freddie King, Jimi Hendrix, J.B. Hutto, Lil\u2019 Ed and others. Although influenced by many, Cannon\u2019s biting, stinging guitar sound is all his own.\n\nCannon began his rise in the intensely competitive proving ground of the local club scene, where only the best musicians reach the top. Iconic blues artists from Muddy Waters to Howlin\u2019 Wolf to Koko Taylor to Hound Dog Taylor to Luther Allison all paid their dues in the Chicago blues bars before making their mark on the world. The same holds true today, as newcomers look to living legends like Buddy Guy, Jimmy Johnson and Lil\u2019 Ed Williams for inspiration in taking their music from Chicago to fans across the globe.\n\nFrom 1996 through 2002, Cannon played as a sideman for Tommy McCracken, Wayne Baker Brooks, L.V. Banks and Joanna Connor. But he was determined to prove himself. In 2001, while continuing to work as a hired-gun guitarist, he formed his own band, The Cannonball Express. By 2003, he was working exclusively as a band leader. Cannon\u2019s first three albums\u20142007\u2019s My Woman (self-released), 2011\u2019s Leaving Mood (Delmark) and 2013\u2019s Blues Music Award-nominated John The Conqueror Root (Delmark)\u2014document his rise from promising up-and-comer to star-in-the-making.\n\nAlmost immediately upon the release of The Chicago Way, Chicago media helped launch Cannon toward blues stardom. He was the subject of multiple newspaper and magazine feature stories and appeared on every local television station. National and international media soon took notice. CNN filmed Cannon leading a tour of Chicago blues clubs and then broadcast the piece around the world. England\u2019s MOJO magazine declared The Chicago Way the #1 Blues Album Of 2016, as did the readers of Living Blues magazine in their annual poll. The album and Cannon were also nominated for four Blues Music Awards (the Grammy of the blues) in 2017. And the world champion Chicago Cubs invited Cannon to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of the September 13, 2017 game. All the attention only makes Cannon more focused. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve become an ambassador for Chicago blues. People expect a lot from me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s good, because I\u2019m forced to keep upping my game.\u201d\n\nCannon has played the Chicago Blues Festival on ten separate occasions, initially as a sideman, then as a special guest, a sidestage band leader and finally as a main stage headliner. When he\u2019s home, he drives a Chicago Transit Authority bus by day and performs by night. Using every vacation day and day off and working four ten-hour shifts a week, Cannon arranges his schedule to gig out of town as much as possible. It isn\u2019t easy, but, like all of the Chicago greats who have come before him, blues is his calling. Blues Music Magazine declares, \u201cHis guitar playing has all the fire and spontaneity of the Chicago legends he carries; his songwriting is a timely and original look at the world he sees by day on a bus and in blues clubs by night, and his assertive voice is the perfect vehicle to deliver the message.\u201d\n\nNow, with The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Toronzo Cannon delivers his messages loud and clear. Between his searing chops, soul-satisfying vocals and vibrant and distinctive original songs, Cannon has grown from being a local attraction to become a world-renowned torch bearer for the blues. PBS Television\u2019s Chicago Tonight sums it up like this: \u201cCannon is just your typical CTA bus driver who moonlights as a sought-after Chicago blues musician. As a guitarist, singer and songwriter, he drives the sound of Chicago blues from the city to blues clubs and festivals around the world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CantStopTheBlues"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Futurebirds ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9833524.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Psychedelic Country", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The music is a patchwork amalgam of influences, including: twangy Southern rock (they've opened for the Drive-By Truckers), reverb-soaked psychedelia reminiscent of early My Morning Jacket or fellow Athens residents Phosphorescent, soaring guitar solos \u00e0 la Neil Young and Crazy Horse, rhythmic jangle from that other Athens band, REM, multi-part vocal harmonies (which every band ought to have, dammit), and, weaving through it all, lyrical slide guitar. - Vox.com", "otherInfo": "TGIFuturebirds"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Terry Robb ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9080362.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Folk-blues, Delta Blues, Americana", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"The matter is clear.

As of the time of this writing, Chris Schambacher has a truly unbelievable number of 12 separate records, each replete with a couple originals, in the Beatport Top 50 Big Room Charts.\n\nBesides his record accolades, he is an active internationally touring DJ who packs emotional dynamite when performing live. Chris Schambacher has held residencies at 2 of the Top USA ranked nightclubs, and shared the stage with the world\u2019s leading electronic artists and acts, such as Galantis, Nervo, Fisher, Chris Lake, Eli Brown, Autograf, Dada Life, Ansel Elgort, Boombox Cartel, Will Sparks, Dyro, The AnjunaBeats Tour, BT, Don Diablo, and Benny Benassi. He currently is about to embark on a 35 city international tour with Night Nation, with a large part of the proceeds going to Stand Up 2 Cancer. Other notable festival performances include Something Wicked Festival, sharing the stage with the likes of Diplo, Hardwell, Carnage, 3Lau, Audien, Jauz, Slander, Slushi, & Yellow Claw. As well he performed at the Something Wonderful Festival, sharing the stage with Tiesto, Dada Life, Sam Feldt, Borgore, & Markus Schulz. His last big festival performance at the Backwoods Music Festival saw him share the stage with Porter Robinson and Odesza. Internationally he had a headlining show in Sydney Australia with Will Sparks and has performed for large audiences of 20,000 people in a Toronto summer headlining show, two shows in Vancouver each capped at 10,000 people per event, and one show in Montreal for 11,000 people.\n\nHis current sponsorship deal with award winning and leading audio company JLab also sees Chris\u2019 name, picture, & brand in the big box retailers of Walmart and Best Buy in America. His dedicated focus to releasing great records is a prime interest for Chris this year, as well as developing his international touring dates and show performances.\n\nAllowing an artist time to grow and develop his craft is of paramount importance in the current music market, and with DMC World Magazine calling Chris Schambacher \u2018Dallas\u2019 Most Exciting Upcoming Artist\u201d we say hear hear \u2013 let Judge Schambacher throw the gavel and announce his calling card. He has been nominated in 2017 for the Bell Media / Kiss FM \u201cOne To Watch Program Artist\u201d, and his latest radio record \u2018My World\u2019 was featured on Spotify\u2019s \u2018Time To Dance\u201d playlist. Chris has started 2018 off with an impressive Number 1 Release on Beatports Top 100 Big Room Charts topping artists like Tiesto, Hardwell and more. Expansive atmospheric dance pop made for big stadiums and cavernous clubs is the headspace of this artist, and with constant top tier DJ support.", "otherInfo": "Join Chris Schambacher Live from his Studio in Dallas, TX on Friday May 29th at 10PM CST / 8PM PST on Youtube & Twitch.\n\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z2c7L-RDtU\n\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/cschambacher"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Scoffs ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9084867.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Rock, 77 Punk, Indie, Punk, Old School", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Punk rock from the Needle City!", "otherInfo": "ROBFEST!

Since, he has put out a slew of genre-defying cuts, changing the game entirely through massive collaborations and solid remixes for artists such as Paul Oakenfold, Armin van Buuren, Solid Stone, Cosmic Gate and Ruben de Ronde.\n\nThanks to extensive support from a gamut of top-tier performers (e.g. Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Above & Beyond, Markus Schulz, Gareth Emery, Nicky Romero, W&W, Andrew Rayel and even Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and David Guetta), Rodg has been getting the recognition he deserves, even touted \u201cOne of the best producers of 2016\u201d by Armin van Buuren. Seeing his in-studio diligence pay off, Rodg released his debut album in mid-2016 and grabbed early support from Armin van Buuren, Gareth Emery and Above & Beyond, all the while riding the US airwaves with title track \u2018High On Life\u2019, which accumulated over two million streams on Spotify to date.\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t stop there. After countless collaborations with long-time friend and production partner Ruben de Ronde, on came a collaborative effort that dropped jaws and pushed their sound to an even higher level. With their joint album called \u2018Togetherr\u2019, Rodg and Ruben de Ronde emerged with a body of work that serves as a testament to their consistent high-quality output and became Mixmag\u2019s \u201calbum of the month\u201d with a 9 out of 10 rating.\n\nOn the live front, the Rodg sound has become inseparable from Armin van Buuren\u2019s live sets and the Dutchman himself has since brandished his own sonic blend at A State Of Trance shows in Utrecht, Ibiza, and Mexico, Armada Nights, and various other unforgettable shows at H\u00ef Ibiza, Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival and more.

With Guest DJs such as Ferry Corsten, Ben Nicky, Mark Sixma, Ben Gold, Protoculture, RAM and Driftmoon, they consistently attracted around 1,000 clubbers and became the biggest Trance event in Japan. Rinaly successfully organized the first ever in Asia and biggest ever AVA Night worldwide at her home town, at womb Tokyo, inviting Andy Moor, Ashley Wallbridge, Bjorn Akesson, Somna and Memory Loss.\n\nHer collaboration with Ronski Speed \"Horoscope\" was released the same year, immediately attracting a lot of attention after being featured in legendary Dutch DJ Armin van Buuren's radio show \"A State of Trance\" (ASOT).\n\nSince January 2017, she hosts her own regular radio show on Block FM, \"Tears of Trance radio\" which then changed into to \u201cRoom 138\u201d the following year.\n\nWhile launching her radio show, the new single \"Wave of Affection (AVA White), found instant success and stayed at the top of the Beatport Trance chart for several days, reaching 56th on the overall Beatport chart.

With the prolific duo\u2019s meteoric rise a true testament to their hard work in the studio and infectious energy in the club, a slew of early releases via imprints such as Viva, and elrow helped rocket the pair to their first Beatport Number #1 with their breakthrough record on Hot Creations, \u2018Tribesmen\u2019.\n\nHaving later released EPs on Toolroom Records, Lee Foss\u2019 Repopulate Mars and Green Velvet\u2019s Relief Records, Solardo soon branched out into their now iconic Sola imprint - which soon became a home for a flurry of the most predominant tech-house tracks on the circuit. With over 50 releases on the label with tracks from the likes of Max Chapman, Mason Maynard, and Grammy nominated duo CamelPhat - who Mark & James worked with on collaborative club track \u2018Accelerator\u2019, the label has gone from strength to strength hosting parties at the BPM Festival, The Warehouse Project and its own club showcase at The Source in Maidstone.\n\nAfter being assigned remixes for the likes of MK, David Guetta, Black Coffee, Nicole Moudaber & Carl Cox, Solardo\u2019s success hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed and they signed to Ultra Music. Since then, the pair have gone onto release hits \u2018Be Somebody\u2019, \u2018Tango Wango\u2019 and their latest release \u2018XTC\u2019. Arguably the duo\u2019s most successful release to date, the track has been an anthem for them and many DJ\u2019s alike with it being hailed as one of the tracks of the summer in Ibiza. So much so, BBC Radio 1 used it to promote all of their big weekend in Ibiza adverts - where Mark & James also played - whilst it was championed by Annie Mac (Hottest Record In The World), Pete Tong, Danny Howard (Friday Fire) & MistaJam (#1 Radio 1 dance charts) across the station. The tracks' success didn\u2019t end there, with it being voted thewinner of \u2018best track of the year\u2019 at the DJ Mag Best of British awards.\n\nThe love didn\u2019t stop there for the lads, towards the end of 2019 they hooked up with legendary producer Marshall Jefferson to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of one of the most iconic house tunes \u2018Move Your Body\u2019. With the lads touch, the track has been reborn into a modern day anthem only proven by it dominating the Beatport charts (the release was No.1 for 46 days which is an all time record!), being added to BBC Radio 1\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 list for three weeks straight and Scott Mills & BBC Radio 1 themselves selecting it for \u2018Tune Of The Weekend\u2019. With support coming from all corners of the globe, the release peaked at #1 in Sweden, #5 in the UK and #27 worldwide in the Spotify viral charts, and was in the top 100 Shazam\u2019s in 5 countries, peaking at #7 in the UK.\n\nMusic aside, the duo\u2019s presence on the road is ever growing. After selling out The Warehouse Project and London\u2019s Studio 338 with their brand new event series HIGHER, the pair took HIGHER on the road with successful stage takeovers at the likes of Higher Vision in Ireland and Mysteryland in Holland, where Eric Morillo, Skream & Groove Armada came and played. Mark & James also found the time to fit in over 30 major festivals throughout the course of 2019 including sets at Glastonbury, Creamfields, Parklife, Holyship, Babylon Festival, Tomorrowland (x2), EDC Las Vegas, We Are FSTVL, Beyond Wonderland, Snowbombing and their first Ultra Music Festival in Miami where they launched collaborative project SoPhat alongside Camelphat.\n\nFollowing on from their Club Solardo residency in the club room at Hi Ibiza last year, the duo launched their brand new record breaking 12 week residency BODYWORKS (again at Hi Ibiza) with themselves and Camelphat hosting the theatre, and FISHER in the club room. During the course of the summer, BODYWORKS broke numerous club records with over 7000+ people through the doors on multiple occasions and an estimated 90,000 passing through over the 12 weeks. With guests including Enzo Siragusa, Heidi, Danny Howard, Mason Maynard and many more, it just goes to show what a force theyhave now become on the island.\n\nThe duo\u2019s own radio show named \u2018The Spot\u2019 continues to go from strength to strength. Fast approaching it\u2019s 100th episode, they have so far had guests such as Claude VonStroke, Nicole Moudaber, Andrea Oliva, Gorgon City, MK, Skream and Kenny Dope all contributing guest mixes for the pair.

He rapidly broke through onto the Garage pirate radio stations and forums gaining instant recognition, and was subsequently snapped up by international promoters to perform tours of Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Russia. Majestic has since crossed into a multitude of dance music genres from UK Garage to House to Drum & Bass and Dubstep performing with leading artists across the scene such as Sigma, DJ EZ, Dream Teem, Agent X, MJ Cole, Judge Jules, Micky Slim, Jack Beats, Laidback Luke, The Wideboys, Netsky, High Contrast, Loadstar, Shy FX, Skream, Bar9, Nero and Jacob Plant to name a few.\n\nAs well as a legendary MC known for being risqu\u00e9 in spreading his word, Majestic is also making waves as an artist in his own right. His single \u201cIn The VIP\u201d written and produced with the Wideboys that took a satirical look at the VIP Club culture, was released on Skint Records. After receiving serious hits on YouTube and Radio Support from MistaJam, DJ Target, Kissy Sell Out and Steve Smart on heavy rotation, the record also made its way onto the MOS Bass Culture annual.\nMajestic\u2019s lyrical flow then caught the eye of American Dubstep superstar Skrillex who sampled Majestics legendary, almost anthemic, \u201cRuffneck Bass\u201d spit for his latest massive single of the same title, played by the worlds biggest DJs and over 50m views online.\n\nAfter signing up to be Dubstep wonderkid, Jacob Plant\u2019s official hype man, the pair released, \u201cMosh Pit\u201d on Speakerbox. Majestic has been in the studio collaborating on a number of cutting edge tracks they intend to PA live at their shows. They have already performed for massive student brand Under The Radar on their tour dates up and down the country, as well as for Fresher\u2019s events at all the leading Universities in the UK. Plus having just wowed the crowd at Brighton\u2019s Shakedown festival performing on the main stage in front of 8000 revellers, in-between Razorlight and Example, they are certainly heading for superstar status!\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder Majestic is in demand to perform Live, with Mistajam quoting Majestic as being the \u201cbest live MC in the game\u201d after requesting him to perform alongside him at Exit festival in Serbia and Eddie Temple Morris bringing him onboard The Big Reunion Shows this winter not to mention continuing tours with The Wideboys, the hype has only just begun. After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece. Majestic is also opening for the Prodigy as part of his festival looks with Kiss FM UK.\n\nSo with the Majestic message travelling fast, hyping the crowd into a frenzy, Majestic takes on the role of grand puppeteer, from waiving lighters in the air to chanting back at the DJ, his commands are dutifully followed and quite a sight to behold. Through years of hard graft, quite literally behind the scene, Majestic has studied the sound of the underground for well over a decade. Majestic is realising his destiny as one of the biggest talents to come out of the UK underground scene, infinitely more than just the best live MC in the game.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dance System ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9091080.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "House", "Time": "12:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cWhen Night Slugs boss L-Vis 1990, aka James Connolly, slips on his Dance System alias, the mission is simple: slamming, but pointedly simple and unfussy, tracks that get your ass on the dancefloor.\u201d VICE\n\n\u201cWind \u2018Em Up; four infectious house belters designed specifically with the dancefloor in mind.\u201d FACT\n\n\u201c At the forefront of dance music for over ten years, as one of the UK\u2019s most progressive producers, L-Vis 1990 revives Dance System, following a five-year break, with the playful Wind Em Up EP, offering is a playful take on the serious world of techno.\u201d HYPEBEAST\n\n\u201cSometimes you just want to unleash some slamming house bangers.

Her musical talent was discovered early on and fostered by Helena Guimar\u00e3es Galo and Arnaldo Estrella (student of Alfred Cortot and friend of Villa Lobos), at the Conservatory of Antwerp student of Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge, student of Arthur Schnabel>Leon Fleisher>Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge.\n\nShe played a first recital at the age of 5 in the Teatro Mesbla in Rio de Janeiro. First TV performance at age 6 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Alceo Bocchino with a Haydn concerto, and another two times the same concerto conducted by Eleazar de Carvalho and Isaac Karabtchevsky with the Orquestra Sinfonica Brasileira. At age 7 she performed Mozart KV488 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Edouard van Remoortel (Rio de Janeiro).\n\nIn the USA she received the \"special prize\" of the jury at the Van Cliburn competition, and she made an indelible impression with Beethoven\u00b4s piano concerto n.4 at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium.\n\nAfter the \"wonderkind\" and \"competitions\" happenings, she received invitations to perform in more than 25 countries. Her intelligence and brilliant musical feeling allow her to play a repertory of 61 piano concertos.\n\nIn 1990 she took up composing again, producing brilliant and at times mischievous cadenzas for her concertos. In 1994-95 she wrote her 15 Momentos Musicais and composed the Sonate Oubli\u00e9e with themes from her childhood. Her characteristics have remained unchanged: simplicity and spontaneity, feeling and imagination, technique, perfection without affectation, a delight for the eye and ear.\n\nIn February 1998 Rodrigues' Bach-CD was recorded. The critics describe her improvisations and paraphrases on works for the organ as: \"The sonorities go back to the scale of more than 3 centuries of piano literature and link perfectly well up with the richness in colour of an independent way of pianistic thinking, they have their own new life, a fascinating transfiguration, full of phantasy.\"\n\nAstonishment, admiration and even incredibility caused her Suite n.1 \"Rio de Janeiro\" for piano and orchestra, that was first performed on 9 August 2000. She plaid and recorded in St. Petersburg the 5 concerto's for piano from Sergei Prokofiev with the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n1998 - 2014 she is invited in a.o.

Peddling a kind of jangly guitar pop not dissimilar to their Scottish contemporaries Aztec Camera and Orange Juice, they had three hit singles in the UK, all written by guitarist and founder member Bobby Bluebell (aka Robert Hodgens) - \"I'm Falling\" with Ken McCluskey , \"Cath\", and their biggest success \"Young At Heart\". The latter was co-written with Siobhan Fahey (with whom Hodgens was romantically linked for a while) and made it to No.8 in the UK singles chart on its original release in 1984. The band also released two albums, \"The Bluebells\" and \"Sisters\".\n\nThe band split up in the mid-1980s, but enjoyed an unexpected - albeit brief - revival in 1993 when \"Young At Heart\" was used in a Volkswagen TV commercial. Re-issued as a single, it was No.1 for four weeks and led to the band reforming temporarily to perform the song on Top of the Pops. A singles collection followed.\n\nAt the time of the 1990s revival, band member Lawrence Donegan - who trained as a journalist after the band's demise and is now golfing correspondent for The Guardian - wrote a newspaper article reminiscing about his days as a Bluebell which caused some friction between himself and the rest of the band. Amongst other anecdotes, he claimed that the group took part in a talent contest in Los Angeles in 1984, where a fellow contestant - an up-and-coming singer called Madonna - blew cigarette smoke into the band's faces and declared them to be \"losers\". The other ex-Bluebells are adamant that no such incident took place. Donegan has also published 'California Dreaming', a book based on his experiences selling used cars in Los Angeles.\n\nThe other members of the band stayed in the music business after the split. David McCluskey and his brother, Ken, formed a folk duo (www.myspace.com/mccluskeybrothers) . Robert Hodgens formed Up.

The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities.

In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

Nicky's resume boasts an impressive and lengthy discography of originals, remixes, edits and co-productions, proving again and again his ability to evolve with the ever-changing landscape of electronic music. Perhaps even more telling of his razor-sharp prowess and visionary mindset is the success and impact of his label Protocol Recordings, setting up recent collaborations with David Guetta, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike.\n\nIn the late 2000's, EDM was having its heyday, and Nicky Romero was at the forefront of the movement that would become one of the most significant cultural resurgences in decades. After releasing several singles early in his career, Nicky officially had his breakthrough moments with the viral anthem \"Toulouse\" and \"I Could Be the One\" (vs. Avicii), which to date has amassed over 185 million streams on Spotify alone. Nicky's meticulous skill as a producer led him to co-producing with legendary artists, both on Rihanna's hit \"Right Now\" and Britney Spears' \"It Should Be Easy.\" These early successes served to pave the way for the founding of Nicky's own label, Protocol Recordings.\n\nNicky created Protocol Recordings in 2012, and in the last six years it has grown from a record label to a truly multi-faceted household name in electronic music - but they're still only getting started. Nicky created Protocol to be a place of camaraderie between forward-thinking artists, always daring to break the mold through innovative sounds. Protocol's diverse list of artists currently includes Raiden, Maximals, Tom Tyger, Florian Picasso, Sunstars, Corey James and many more.

The initial 45 earned her a spot in the Top 10 on Sirius XM with the \u201csmoldering\u201d A-side, \u201cPull You Through.\u201d The \u201cpulverizing\u201d single was hailed by Rolling Stone as a \u201csoulful ballad that rejoices in the healing powers of love...a bare-bones track [that is] really a showcase for the Dusty Springfield-worthy vocals of Rose\u2026\u201d.\n\nIn Spring of 2018, Maggie released \"It's You\" and \"Smooth.\" Rolling Stone once again praised Maggie Rose with \"It's You\" as \u201ca giant, throwback Soul ballad that shows off her dynamic vocals [containing] shades of Aretha Franklin,\u201d and also praised \"Smooth\" as \"a supremely funky rocker with hints of Grace Potter [and] Janis Joplin\".\n\nThe enthusiasm surrounding each Digital 45 release has continually increased the appetite of her fans while relentlessly expanding her following via radio, streaming platforms and through her captivating live performances. The full-length album will feature 12 songs, 12 live in-studio videos, with a full-access behind-the-scenes one-hour musical documentary which peels back the layers and allows the viewer an intimate look into the making of the album.\n\nRose has been named to YouTube\u2019s Emerging Artist and Artist in Residence 2018 programs, and Pandora named her an Artist to Watch 2018. In June, Maggie\u2019s creative breadth and versatility sparked the first-ever partnership between Prescription Songs and Sea Gayle Music, with the two companies signing a joint-venture publishing agreement with Rose. In July, she was tapped for an as-named synchronization deal that lends her voice to a national ad campaign focusing on Women\u2019s Empowerment.\n\nIn 2018, Maggie Rose has played over 150 dates across the world including\nBonnaroo Music and Arts Festival and The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, while sharing the stage with artists such as Kelly Clarkson, Julia Michaels, Brandy Clark, and Bob Weir of Grateful Dead.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Suu ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9134691.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Barcelona,Spain", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Aquesta \u00e9s la meva p\u00e0gina oficial on anir\u00e9 penjant els meus temes i compartint els meus esdeveniments per mantenir-vos informats en tot moment.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Erja Lyytinen ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10147552.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Progressive, Pop, Rock, Blues", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Erja Lyytinen \u2013 Biography\n\nSince the release of her tenth studio album Stolen Hearts in 2017, Erja Lyytinen has starred on MTV Finland\u2019s T\u00e4hdet, T\u00e4hdet show, picked up the much-coveted European Guitarist of the Year award, performed in front of 80,000 people in her hometown of Helsinki on New Year's Eve, shared the stage with the legends such as Carlos Santana, Dan Aykroyd and Jennifer Batten, supported Sir Tom Jones as well as clocking up in excess of 100 headline shows across Europe per annum.\nLyytinen\u2019s musical pallet is vast, encompassing the very best of contemporary blues-rock whilst inspired and influenced by the blues greats of yore.

There\u2019s one major distinction, however, that separates her from other similarly studied musicians. That is Holly\u2019s devotion to the legendary rock band Phish. Having attended over 300 shows by the Burlington-based quartet, she became obsessed by their famous rendition of \u201cTweezer\u201d from Lake Tahoe on July 31, 2013. It led Holly to transcribe this 37-minute improvisational masterpiece note-for-note and arrange it for solo piano. The process, both painstaking and fulfilling, inspired her to transform other Phish songs and well-known live jams into solo piano interpretations. Holly\u2019s breathtaking renditions of Phish classics like \u201cIt\u2019s Ice,\u201d \u201cThe Squirming Coil\u201d and \u201cHarry Hood\u201d serve not only as a tribute to the modern day kings of jam, but stand on their own as fully developed classical pieces. The past year has seen Holly expand her repertoire into the realm of the Grateful Dead, including an \u201cEyes of the World\u201d based on the band\u2019s spectacular exploratory June 18, 1974 performance at Freedom Hall. Using classical piano technique to reinterpret these jamband luminaries, Holly\u2019s live performances infuse new with old, tradition with surreal, and creates a concert experience like nothing else in the music world.\n\nIn 2018, Holly along with Tom Hamilton, Steve Lyons, Raina Mullen & Scott Zwang formed a new band, Ghost Light.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tornado Tib ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6077545.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "the Lawrence Peters Outfit ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10351367.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Country, Ameripolitan, Traditional Country, Honky Tonk", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Lawrence Peters Outfit play un-ruined country music, a term Lawrence coined to describe the band\u2019s original, deep-rooted, honky tonk sound.

It\u2019s a musical relationship that has endured for over two decades, with band members playing in numerous projects together and apart. Following the 2012 release of their freewheeling Sounds Like This, the band took time off to work on various side projects. Zach Gill (keys/vocals) toured the world with the band\u2019s college pal Jack Johnson; Dan \u201cLebo\u201d Lebowitz (guitar/vocals) played shows with the Grateful Dead\u2019s Phil Lesh; Steve Adams (bass/vocals) toured and recorded with Nicki Bluhm & the Gramblers; Dave Brogan (drums/vocals) joined up with Utah band, Mokie. These and other endeavors have influenced the band\u2019s new album Tangle Of Time.\n\nMore than previous releases, Tangle Of Time really taps into what makes ALO unique. It\u2019s that special blend of classic songwriting and the ability to stretch out jams and distill dance floor grooves. It's heartfelt lyrics that make you smile, reflect and just want to sing along either way. It's four great musicians who all write and sing. And four friends who've been through a lot together and still support, challenge and inspire one another.\n\nEntering Allegiant Records in San Anselmo, California this past January with co-producer Dave Simon-Baker, the four members decided they\u2019d take a different recording approach. Instead of spending pre-production days jamming and co-writing, each member brought in their own demos, roughly three dozen in total, for the group to listen to, pick apart and eventually whittle down to the 11 songs that make up Tangle Of Time. Once they narrowed their focus, they turned their attention to arrangements and production techniques. Songs were tightened up, layers made more experimental and the end results validated their new approach.\n\nLebo described the shared respect and admiration the band felt during the recording process this way: \"There are four strong opinions in the room, but playing together for so long we've all become pretty good at the empathy thing at this point; we can be very Zen about it. We truly value being together at this point in our careers, and whatever we get from our solo and side gigs, no matter how much fun we have, it's not this.\"\n\nThat sort of maturity, the ability to take stock of your friends, loved ones, and collaborators, and truly appreciate them is certainly one of the cornerstones of Tangle Of Time. Lebo, Adams and Gill first started playing music together in middle school, and then with Brogan right after college. Somehow, these relationships have lasted, evolved and been made stronger every year. One can almost hear the group releasing a satisfied existential sigh throughout the album, finding acceptance, love and contentment with the world they've built.\n\n\"I really appreciate the guys right now, more so than ever,\" Gill shared, excitedly adding, \"Years ago the feeling was, 'I wanna get to my songs and see how they sound while we're all here', whereas now I'm rooting for everyone else's songs. It's great.\"\n\nThat approach of supporting each other\u2019s songs worked like a charm, capturing each member\u2019s distinct songwriting voice, while simultaneously expanding the notion of what an ALO song or album can be. Take for instance the one-two-punch of the synth-filled, spacey jam vehicle \"The Ticket\" and the pedal steel-driven easy-going happiness of \"Simple Times\". Although two ends of the sonic spectrum, both are classic Gill songs at their core but stretched wide and far by the band\u2019s collective effort.\n\nNot to be outdone, Lebo's guitar epic \"Undertow\" is a song that practically begs to be stretched out live, with its swirling double guitar outro intoxicating the listener to such a degree that you might find yourself on the band's website, dreamily purchasing tickets for an entire run of shows just to see where the song ventures live. Lebo pairs this with \"Push\", a jaunty yet thoughtful number with a playful guitar riff that's basically the musical equivalent of joy.\n\n\"Not Old Yet\" and \"Keep On\", Adams\u2019 contributions to the album, are also touchstones to the spirit of Tangle Of Time. The first is a light-hearted romp about keeping a positive perspective on life\u2019s long road of hurdles and surprises, while the second is an upbeat, forward-thinking sing-along with lines that could be the album's mantra: \"Wherever this takes us, I know/That we've got each other, we've still got a long way to go.\"\n\nBrogan's \"Coast To Coast\" is among the most intriguing songs on the record. He, along with co-writer buddy Ben Malan, came up with a layer-upon-layer soundscape consisting of beautifully esoteric textures. The funky but ominous track tells the surreal tale of a band on the run, with more ideas and energy than know-how. Brogan shared that the theme of \u201ctangled time\u201d materialized unexpectedly over the course of the sessions, elaborating: \"There's a point where there is more behind you than ahead of you, and you realize that time becomes a limiting factor.\"\n\nPut the record on your turntable, and you can clearly hear the band\u2019s excitement to get back on the road and explore these songs with their audience. Improvisation is a staple of what the band does, and as Adams stated: \"Being in that unknown is such a great life lesson beyond just the music. For all the careful planning and preparing we do, being in the moment is really when it all matters.\"\n\nThe band is also planning new ways to expand the theatrical shenanigans that have become a fantastic complement to the live show. From confetti canons to 12-foot beach balls, pre-show skits to elaborate theme nights, bubble suits to a laser-shooting ukulele (yes, really)... ALO is always on the hunt for new and exciting ways to interact with fans to make their shows truly special. Gill, the band's head prankster, put it this way: \"I want people to come to a show expecting to be engaged in a fun and creative way. When I see someone dancing or singing along or reaching out to hit a giant beach ball, I start playing to the dancer and at that point, it's really a circle of energy traveling back and forth from the stage. The larger theatrical concepts are ways of interacting with the audience on another level.\"\n\nOn Tangle Of Time the band has reached that other level, and are ready to bring everyone along.", "otherInfo": "60+ artists, one day!

Leyla, a multi-instrumentalist, cellist and singer whose distinctive sound is impossible to replicate.\n\nLeyla\u2019s music reflects her eclectic and diverse life experiences, projecting a respect for eloquent simplicity that is rarely achieved. Born in New York City to Haitian emigrant parents, Leyla was raised in suburban New Jersey. As a teenager, she relocated to Accra, Ghana for two years. Upon her return, she attended Smith College for a year before transferring to New York University where she studied cello performance and chamber music. Armed with Bach\u2019s Cello Suites, Leyla moved to New Orleans to play cello on the streets of the French Quarter.\n\n\nIt is the move to New Orleans that signaled a journey of musical and cultural discovery for Leyla. \u201cNew Orleans always felt like home to me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe more I learned about the history of Louisiana, its ties to Haiti and French speaking culture, the more sense of belonging I felt and continue to feel.\u201d Most recently, Leyla has fallen in love with the late Louisiana Creole fiddlers Canray Fontenot and B\u00e9b\u00e9 Carri\u00e8re and has explored their fiddling styles on the cello.\n\n\nLeyla\u2019s move to New Orleans also signaled a new stage in her career. It was while playing on the street that she caught the attention of Tim Duffy, the founder and director of the Music Maker Relief Foundation. He invited Leyla to join the Music Maker Relief Foundation family and introduced her to the Carolina Chocolate Drops, a renowned African-American string band. After appearing on the band\u2019s GRAMMY-nominated album Leaving Eden and touring extensively with the group, she now focuses on her solo career.\n\n\nVari-Colored Songs: A Tribute to Langston Hughes, Leyla\u2019s debut album, is set for a February 2014 release. The album, which has been years in the making for Leyla, was given a push after a successful Kickstarter campaign in which she surpassed her $5,000 goal by four times to ultimately raise over $20,000. Vari-Colored Songs consists of compositions she has written to Langston Hughes poetry, Haitian folk songs and original pieces. The album features musicians including Rhiannon Giddens and Hubby Jenkins of the Carolina Chocolate Drops as well as New Orleans\u2019 own Don Vappie on tenor banjo and Luke Winslow King on guitar.", "otherInfo": "Equal parts festivity, community coalescence and fundraiser for the work of EqualHealth, the concert will be an hour of connection and joy through music and friendship.
