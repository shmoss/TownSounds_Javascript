We hope Canada will share her with us.\u201d (Hot Indie Music Review) Krystle Dos Santos has taken her experience from the Canadian College of Performing Arts, and transformed it into the beginnings of a career already full of achievements. Unveiling her talents to the public with her 2008 full length self-titled debut, Dos Santos was instantly recognized as a force by the Western Canadian Music Awards, winning the Urban Recording of the Year. That same album charted for six weeks on CJSR FM88\u2019s Urban chart and was top ten on 92.5 The X in Kamloops, BC. One of the single\u2019s from the album even appeared in an Episode of ABC\u2019s Samantha Who? But to simply classify Dos Santos as a recording artist would be neglecting one of the most intriguing aspects of her talents. Whether facing the crowd on her own or with her full ensemble of band-mates as she is more accustomed, Dos Santos uses a sultry tone and eccentric array of melodies to create an intimately magnetic connection with her audience. She is able to further engage her audience by shifting seamlessly through genres, embodying her musical influences-Nina Simone, Etta James, Alicia Keys-culminating into a powerful live experience that fuses jazz, soul, pop, funk and blues into an arena of styles and sounds that takes listeners from mid-20th century Harlem, right up to present day L.A. With key performances at the Edmonton International Jazz Festival, Whistler International Film Festival, and the Honey Jam Showcase in Toronto, Krystle has had many opportunities to put her live shows on full display. She has already toured extensively throughout western Canada, singing stories of pain and love, joy and redemption, all told through a voice that precisely reflects the emotion of her music. It is nearly impossible to be a true fan of Krystle Dos Santos without taking part in the experience she creates with her live performances. Dos Santos completed her second album in the first quarter of 2011. Femme Fatale, as it was aptly titled, again revealed Dos Santos versatility and her ability to capture the audience with an eclectic mix of dance and funk, but always with the soulful jazz vocals for which she has quickly become renowned. Dos Santos\u2019 interpretation of her influences has made it difficult to categorize her style. Compared presently to Jill Scott or Corrine-Bailey Rae or even Erykah Badu, Krystle is able to personalize her sound and message, adding her own character to her music to create a uniquely refreshing sound. Her vibrant personality has been utilized outside of music in various add campaigns and modeling opportunities. It also helps that Krystle is as stunning as she is talented; one of those rare beauties that command attention with little more than a moments glance. But make no mistake, Krystle Dos Santos is a musician first and foremost. With a smoky voice that can fluctuate to fit any style and a live show that demands the audience stand-up and take notice, Dos Santos is ready for the masses to feel her music. She is currently working on her third studio release, and will no doubt continue to strive until her name and her music is known to the world.

We hope Canada will share her with us.\u201d (Hot Indie Music Review) Krystle Dos Santos has taken her experience from the Canadian College of Performing Arts, and transformed it into the beginnings of a career already full of achievements. Unveiling her talents to the public with her 2008 full length self-titled debut, Dos Santos was instantly recognized as a force by the Western Canadian Music Awards, winning the Urban Recording of the Year. That same album charted for six weeks on CJSR FM88\u2019s Urban chart and was top ten on 92.5 The X in Kamloops, BC. One of the single\u2019s from the album even appeared in an Episode of ABC\u2019s Samantha Who? But to simply classify Dos Santos as a recording artist would be neglecting one of the most intriguing aspects of her talents. Whether facing the crowd on her own or with her full ensemble of band-mates as she is more accustomed, Dos Santos uses a sultry tone and eccentric array of melodies to create an intimately magnetic connection with her audience. She is able to further engage her audience by shifting seamlessly through genres, embodying her musical influences-Nina Simone, Etta James, Alicia Keys-culminating into a powerful live experience that fuses jazz, soul, pop, funk and blues into an arena of styles and sounds that takes listeners from mid-20th century Harlem, right up to present day L.A. With key performances at the Edmonton International Jazz Festival, Whistler International Film Festival, and the Honey Jam Showcase in Toronto, Krystle has had many opportunities to put her live shows on full display. She has already toured extensively throughout western Canada, singing stories of pain and love, joy and redemption, all told through a voice that precisely reflects the emotion of her music. It is nearly impossible to be a true fan of Krystle Dos Santos without taking part in the experience she creates with her live performances. Dos Santos completed her second album in the first quarter of 2011. Femme Fatale, as it was aptly titled, again revealed Dos Santos versatility and her ability to capture the audience with an eclectic mix of dance and funk, but always with the soulful jazz vocals for which she has quickly become renowned. Dos Santos\u2019 interpretation of her influences has made it difficult to categorize her style. Compared presently to Jill Scott or Corrine-Bailey Rae or even Erykah Badu, Krystle is able to personalize her sound and message, adding her own character to her music to create a uniquely refreshing sound. Her vibrant personality has been utilized outside of music in various add campaigns and modeling opportunities. It also helps that Krystle is as stunning as she is talented; one of those rare beauties that command attention with little more than a moments glance. But make no mistake, Krystle Dos Santos is a musician first and foremost. With a smoky voice that can fluctuate to fit any style and a live show that demands the audience stand-up and take notice, Dos Santos is ready for the masses to feel her music. She is currently working on her third studio release, and will no doubt continue to strive until her name and her music is known to the world.

The two were also romantically involved.

Music styles such as dirty south, crunk and miami bass are now trademark ingredients of the Hollertronix output. Pentz's solo work is also influenced by Southern Gothic and other southern literature. Additionally, world music is a strong musical influence on Diplo, especially baile funk which he encountered whilst traveling in Brazil.\n\nDiplo was recently signed to Ninja Tune, on the Big Dada imprint.

But not every artist gets asked by their heroes to join\nthem, as artists, on their stage. It's a compliment that Jacob Moon keeps getting from the\nmusicians who have inspired him since he started as a singer-songwriter out in Hamilton,\nOntario. Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "A different theme every day!

The band released two albums, the breakout debut, Flow, and the follow up release, The Corporate Sugar Daddies. CSD broke up after being passed over for an appearance on NBC's Saved By The Bell - a crushing blow to the group that was already dealing with the pressures of being a hip, local high school act. The rejection from Saved by the Bell knocked the band down and they never really got up. The only thing left do was move on.\n\nAfter graduating from High School a year early, and finding that substitute teaching was not his bag, he decided to move South and go to college. Brock kissed King George goodbye and made his way to Savannah, GA for what would eventually become a turning point in his life. Brock enrolled in The Savannah College of Art and Design where he pursued and obtained a degree in video and film production as well as a minor in sound engineering.

The title is a literal etymological reading of the word: the French amateur from the Latin verb \u201cto love\u201d, applied in this case as a mission statement and a reminder of why they do what they do.\n\nIn 2011, the effervescent electronic pop of the band\u2019s debut EP, Act Naturally, attracted the attention of Dangerbird Records, which re-released both that project and its full-length follow-up, 2013\u2019s Glow. The spirited anthem \u201cWild,\u201d driven by the sparkling vocal chemistry between singers Nora Patterson and Gary Larsen, propelled the band to multiple TV, film, and video game placements, guest appearances on Last Call with Carson Daly and American Idol (at the personal invitation of fellow Louisiana native Harry Connick, Jr.) and slots at festivals, including Austin City Limits, Bonnaroo, Firefly, SXSW, CMJ, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and the Voodoo Experience.\n\nOn Amateurs, Nora Patterson\u2019s passionate lead vocals are showcased front and center, emerging from the more layered production of earlier releases. \u201cKids Conspire\u201d, the infectious lead single, buoys her up on a wave of ringing synths and propulsive, Afropop-inflected beats, as she demands, \u201ctake me all the way up, take me all the way up.\u201d It\u2019s a clear relative of \u201cWild\u201d, an anthem of possibility, but with more muscle and urgency.\n\n\u201cChildren have a wild imagination,\u201d Patterson explains. \u201cThey make up a plan for what they\u2019re going to be when they grow up. They don\u2019t hold back in terms of what they feel like they can accomplish, which is something that a lot of people lose over time.\u201d In writing the song, she wanted to channel that untamed joy, the feeling of unlimited potential and steadfast conviction. \u201cIt\u2019s about going back to when you thought you could do anything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to remind yourself of that.\u201d Promoting Act Naturally and Glow, Royal Teeth averaged more than 200 live dates per year, earning a glowing rep for exuberant, sweaty, high-energy live shows as explosive as their signature confetti cannons. The addition of guitarist Thomas Onebane, an inveterate, crafty tinkerer, has also led the band to take more risks in the studio. \u201cThomas was a game-changer creatively,\u201d says drummer Josh Hefner. \u201cHe\u2019s a secret weapon. We spent a little more time in the studio \u2013 more experiments, more fine-tuning. And it was more fun, with less pressure.\u201d\n\nBoth the sounds and the overarching themes on Amateurs are tougher, more mature and more surehanded than Royal Teeth\u2019s previous outings. They play like a band that\u2019s honed itself down to its core chemistry, musicians who know what they want to do and how to do it.

Stephen Quigg is a well-established folksinger who has made a living playing music for over 40 years. Stephen grew up on the west-coast of Scotland where music played a key part in his formative years. Stephen has through all the years performed solo but for 10 years he was also part of the legendary folk group The McCalmans until they finished up in 2010. Stephen toured with the group all over Europe and it was from Denmark (Viking raids revisited) that he brought with him home his future wife and singer/songwriter Pernille.\n\nPernille grew up in a very small village in the East of Jutland, where the old folk still recall a certain songbird sitting in the neighbour's apple tree singing the Danish version of 'I'm a Rambler I'm Rover'. As a young adult she moved to Ireland following in musical footsteps and later on to Scotland where love and music combine in perfect harmony \u2013 most of the time ;-)\nThe Quiggs tour regularly with great success in Denmark, Germany and The Netherlands and of course there are many concerts on Scottish soil. Stephen and Pernille share a common feeling for the tradition of folk song, and thrive on a strong connection to the audience reaching far beyond the frontrow.\n\nThe combination of the two voices in close harmony in songs whether traditional or contemporary interspersed with anecdotes and a touch of humour has received much praise from both audiences and organisers. A concert with The Quiggs is a chance to hear folk song in its original form - simple, yet highly expressive, beautiful harmonies and songs that seek the audience's participation.\n\nThe duo has previously released the album \"River of Time\" in 2015, which received fine reviews and airplay on BBC Radio and other European radio stations. In March 2017 \u201cThe Quiggs\u201d released the CD \u201eSeeds I Didn't Sow\u201d, which featured as album of the week on Celtic Music Radio and was described by Folkradio.uk's Mike Davies as, \u201cUnquestionably one of the best folk albums of the year.\u201d\n\n\"The indicators of true quality extend to the individual and collective strengths of the Quiggs themselves, for both are fine singers with a nice line in close harmony, and both are natural experts in the art of choosing excellent songs...\" David Kidman, The Living Tradition.\n\n\u201cThe Quiggs are blessed with a rare musical talent \u201c Kenneth Ferguson, Corstorphine folk\n\n\u201cPernille and Stephen Quigg are a duo who pack a real punch with their sparkling harmonies and no nonsense musicianship.\u201d David Jones", "otherInfo": "The Quiggs LIVE streaming on Music From Scotland Facebook Page.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Saint John and the Revelations ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/440517.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Alt Folk, Alternative, Indie Rock, Folk Rock, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"...I feel like the guy who discovered U2\" - Indie Music Express\n\n\"...these guys are Smiths 3.0\" - Eat Sleep Drink Music\n\n\"Halo demonstrates that this band from Venice, CA comes with\nremarkable depth\" - Caught in the Carousel\n\nSaint John was born in Victoria, BC, Canada.

Yet the moniker is more than just a humorous takeoff on life's realities.\n\nBorn Matt the Electrician on a frosty San Francisco morn, Matt and his family soon moved to Oregon in search of culture, nice weather and vineyards. Once there, Matt spent much of his youth obsessed with Woody Guthrie, The Hollies and the soundtrack to Godspell. The Electrician's were A musical, yet thrifty family, so they found a swell garage-sale trumpet to encourage this musical interest.\n\nThe Electrician's moved back to California in the early eighties; and while the trumpet was eventually discarded, the expensive private lessons were not a complete waste, as it was here that Matt met and fell in love with the guitar.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the elder Electrician's spiraling oragami habit, money was not only extremely tight but intricately folded and beautifully hung all around the Electrician household, so Matt was limited to the only three chords his parents could afford. His dad assured him this was plenty, that kids in China only get one or two.\n\nAnd strangely, it all worked out. Matt headed to Austin, a serious music town, with aspirations of becoming a serious musician.\n\nMission accomplished. After years of a steadily-built, devoted fan base, some would say that Sever's unassuming baby-faced slacker image and \"nice guy\" blue-collar charm belie a very complex and intoxicating energy that is equal parts gritty neo-folk, frenetic boyish pulse, and tangled life experience - all held cohesive by his deft guitar skills and liquid vocals reminiscent of a young Paul Simon wrapped around a Tom Waits heart. Some wouldn't be able to say that. Some would rather type it. Others might yodel.\n\nMatt released his first CD, \"Baseball Song\", in 1998. \"Home\" in 2000, \"Made For Working\" in 2003 and \u201cLong Way Home\u201d in 2004.\n\nThe new CD, \u201cOne Thing Right\u201d, was recorded in Austin at The Aerie Studios; co-produced by Jud Newcomb, Mark Addison and Matt, and is slated for release\nin early 2007.

Like the best of the Nordic Noir leaving the Danish mainland, the recordings are at once both sonically pure and grimy; there\u2019s a shared loneliness that makes you feel that you\u2019re not at all; and all the while there is an honesty to the songwriting that tugs at your sleeve. While her grasp of English is second nature, there\u2019s some of those intriguing turns of phrase that only a heart that dreams in another language can weave: \u201cThe deep conceals things that are real/ look beyond the mirror/look beyond the mirror\u201d , \u201cI know we see things differently/as long as it\u2019s not separately\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re a fish in a bottle/a cock in a coop/the essence of trying\u2026\u201d\n\nSure, she has the usual credible influences from Vashti to Joni, from Neil Young to Danish folk hero Sebastian; and there\u2019s hints of Sandy Denny and Linda Perhacs.

Stephen Quigg is a well-established folksinger who has made a living playing music for over 40 years. Stephen grew up on the west-coast of Scotland where music played a key part in his formative years. Stephen has through all the years performed solo but for 10 years he was also part of the legendary folk group The McCalmans until they finished up in 2010. Stephen toured with the group all over Europe and it was from Denmark (Viking raids revisited) that he brought with him home his future wife and singer/songwriter Pernille.\n\nPernille grew up in a very small village in the East of Jutland, where the old folk still recall a certain songbird sitting in the neighbour's apple tree singing the Danish version of 'I'm a Rambler I'm Rover'. As a young adult she moved to Ireland following in musical footsteps and later on to Scotland where love and music combine in perfect harmony \u2013 most of the time ;-)\nThe Quiggs tour regularly with great success in Denmark, Germany and The Netherlands and of course there are many concerts on Scottish soil. Stephen and Pernille share a common feeling for the tradition of folk song, and thrive on a strong connection to the audience reaching far beyond the frontrow.\n\nThe combination of the two voices in close harmony in songs whether traditional or contemporary interspersed with anecdotes and a touch of humour has received much praise from both audiences and organisers. A concert with The Quiggs is a chance to hear folk song in its original form - simple, yet highly expressive, beautiful harmonies and songs that seek the audience's participation.\n\nThe duo has previously released the album \"River of Time\" in 2015, which received fine reviews and airplay on BBC Radio and other European radio stations. In March 2017 \u201cThe Quiggs\u201d released the CD \u201eSeeds I Didn't Sow\u201d, which featured as album of the week on Celtic Music Radio and was described by Folkradio.uk's Mike Davies as, \u201cUnquestionably one of the best folk albums of the year.\u201d\n\n\"The indicators of true quality extend to the individual and collective strengths of the Quiggs themselves, for both are fine singers with a nice line in close harmony, and both are natural experts in the art of choosing excellent songs...\" David Kidman, The Living Tradition.\n\n\u201cThe Quiggs are blessed with a rare musical talent \u201c Kenneth Ferguson, Corstorphine folk\n\n\u201cPernille and Stephen Quigg are a duo who pack a real punch with their sparkling harmonies and no nonsense musicianship.\u201d David Jones", "otherInfo": "The Quiggs LIVE streaming on Music From Scotland Facebook Page.

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Saint John and the Revelations ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/440517.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Alt Folk, Alternative, Indie Rock, Folk Rock, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"...I feel like the guy who discovered U2\" - Indie Music Express\n\n\"...these guys are Smiths 3.0\" - Eat Sleep Drink Music\n\n\"Halo demonstrates that this band from Venice, CA comes with\nremarkable depth\" - Caught in the Carousel\n\nSaint John was born in Victoria, BC, Canada.

Yet the moniker is more than just a humorous takeoff on life's realities.\n\nBorn Matt the Electrician on a frosty San Francisco morn, Matt and his family soon moved to Oregon in search of culture, nice weather and vineyards. Once there, Matt spent much of his youth obsessed with Woody Guthrie, The Hollies and the soundtrack to Godspell. The Electrician's were A musical, yet thrifty family, so they found a swell garage-sale trumpet to encourage this musical interest.\n\nThe Electrician's moved back to California in the early eighties; and while the trumpet was eventually discarded, the expensive private lessons were not a complete waste, as it was here that Matt met and fell in love with the guitar.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the elder Electrician's spiraling oragami habit, money was not only extremely tight but intricately folded and beautifully hung all around the Electrician household, so Matt was limited to the only three chords his parents could afford. His dad assured him this was plenty, that kids in China only get one or two.\n\nAnd strangely, it all worked out. Matt headed to Austin, a serious music town, with aspirations of becoming a serious musician.\n\nMission accomplished. After years of a steadily-built, devoted fan base, some would say that Sever's unassuming baby-faced slacker image and \"nice guy\" blue-collar charm belie a very complex and intoxicating energy that is equal parts gritty neo-folk, frenetic boyish pulse, and tangled life experience - all held cohesive by his deft guitar skills and liquid vocals reminiscent of a young Paul Simon wrapped around a Tom Waits heart. Some wouldn't be able to say that. Some would rather type it. Others might yodel.\n\nMatt released his first CD, \"Baseball Song\", in 1998. \"Home\" in 2000, \"Made For Working\" in 2003 and \u201cLong Way Home\u201d in 2004.\n\nThe new CD, \u201cOne Thing Right\u201d, was recorded in Austin at The Aerie Studios; co-produced by Jud Newcomb, Mark Addison and Matt, and is slated for release\nin early 2007.

Like the best of the Nordic Noir leaving the Danish mainland, the recordings are at once both sonically pure and grimy; there\u2019s a shared loneliness that makes you feel that you\u2019re not at all; and all the while there is an honesty to the songwriting that tugs at your sleeve. While her grasp of English is second nature, there\u2019s some of those intriguing turns of phrase that only a heart that dreams in another language can weave: \u201cThe deep conceals things that are real/ look beyond the mirror/look beyond the mirror\u201d , \u201cI know we see things differently/as long as it\u2019s not separately\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re a fish in a bottle/a cock in a coop/the essence of trying\u2026\u201d\n\nSure, she has the usual credible influences from Vashti to Joni, from Neil Young to Danish folk hero Sebastian; and there\u2019s hints of Sandy Denny and Linda Perhacs. But to list artists she sounds like would be to miss the point entirely. As anyone who has witnessed a live show can attest, Ida Wen\u00f8e is very definitely Ida Wen\u00f8e. As Carsten Holm at Danish Radio P6 Beat put it,\n\u201cshe has an icy, almost Icelandic timbre.

The music created lot of attention and the following year Ida played showcases and concerts in Denmark, Sweden, USA, England, Germany, Switzerland, The Faroe Islands and Poland. She was nominated for a Danish Music Award as \u201cFolk Songwriter of the Year\u201d and her music was used in DR (National TV) documentary \u201cDe Smukke Piger\u201d.\n\nA showcase concert at Tonder Festival lead to a collaboration with UK booking agency BlueHouse Music, who set up a very successful trio tour with Ida and her band The Silver Cords in the UK in 2016. I February 2017 Wen\u00f8e played Folk Alliance in Kansas City for the second time, and found new exciting collaborators for a future US release.\n\nOn April 7th 2017 \u201cTime of Ghosts\u201d will be released in the UK through Shellshock Distribution / The Orchard.

Eric Johnson is now a permanent part of The Shins, although he continues to address the musical adventure that is the Fruit Bats. Johnson began playing and writing songs on his four-track in the mid-'90s before he formed I Rowboat, a Velvet Underground-inspired indie rock band. Johnson began dabbling in folk with I Rowboat guitarist Dan Strack and drummer Brian Belval as the Fruit Bats. When I Rowboat disbanded, Johnson played guitar and banjo with Califone. That group's Tim Rutili and Ben Massarella, who also own Perishable Records, urged the Fruit Bats to record their work for the label, which resulted in the trio's 2001 debut, Echolocation. Over the next two years the group toured and refined its lineup and sound, adding Lisee as well as more pop and experimental elements to its folk-rock base. In 2002, the group signed to Sub Pop, who released their sophomore effort, Mouthfuls, in spring of 2003. Two years later, after relocating to Seattle and expanding to a four-piece, the band released their third full length album, Spelled in Bones.

Her distinctive and brutally honest songwriting, paired with her energetic performances, come through seamlessly no matter where her music is played, live on the stage or in her critically acclaimed recordings.\n\nSince she began writing music when she was a teenager, the essence of Nicole Rayy\u2019s music has always been, first and foremost, to express herself as honestly as possible. When pressed for musical comparisons to her musical ability, the Oakville, Ontario-born Rayy is reluctant to provide. For as long as she\u2019s been playing music, she has been herself. Comparisons are easy to fall back on, but for Nicole, her music should always speak for itself.\n\nNicole Rayy first blasted into the Canadian Country music scene in 2012 with the release of her debut EP \u201cOnly Everything\u201d.

Nicole was also invited to showcase at the Country Music Association of Ontario Roadshow in Ottawa, NSAI Toronto\u2019s Tin Pan North, Diamonds In The Rough during Canadian Country Music Week in Saskatchewan, SK, and Indie Week Canada in Toronto, November 2017.\n\nNicole has also had the honour of performing at the World Music Festival in Shanghai, China, for three years in a row (2015-2017), and will be returning again in 2018, proving to be a hit among Shanghai\u2019s enthusiastic crowds.\n\n2018 began with an opportunity to open for Brett Kissel in Barrie, Ontario, and continued with multiple festival performances including Dauphin Countryfest, Trackside in London and the main stage at the Howl at the Moon festival in Manitoba opening for Aaron Pritchett and Brett Kissel\n\nIn June Nicole was honoured to be nominated for Rising Star by the CMA Ontario and her latest single \u201cBad Habit\u201d was released and has been very popular with her fans this summer.\n\nWith a sound that is distinctly her own and a creative ambition that knows no bounds, Nicole Rayy feels right at home either on a stage or in a recording studio and will never stay put in one place for too long.

Throughout the record, the catchy pop influence of his two mainstays, Billy Joel and Elton John, is alive and thriving.\n\nThe new album reunites Evin with some key collaborators from different points in his career: producer Howie Beck (Charlotte Day Wilson) first worked with Evin on 2015\u2019s Life As A Lover, bassist Jim Creeggan (Barenaked Ladies) co-produced 2005\u2019s I\u2019ll Bring The Stereo, and drummer Ian MacKay (Basia Bulat) has toured across Canada and the US with Evin.\n\nTo shake things up midway through the writing and recording process, Evin spent a summer traveling and immersing himself in two different cultures: he volunteered in the Aniishnaabe community of Manitoulin Island for a month, and he drove down to New Orleans to write for the other month. These adventures added a thematic thread to some of the album\u2019s songs. Evin\u2019s no stranger to dropping himself in the middle of unfamiliar territory. In the summer of 2012, he spent two months studying percussion in Cuba in the midst of a rich Afro-Cuban community.\n\nEvin On Earth was recorded in Evin\u2019s homebase of Toronto, and the album title has been kicking around since his early years coming up in the Montreal scene. A friend suggested it back then, and Evin originally scoffed at it - but it just seemed right for this album. That same friend challenged Evin to write a short album opening title song, and the result is \u201cEvin On Earth\u201d, a kind of mission statement and salute to artists everywhere.\n\nEvin\u2019s fans include Canadian icons Barenaked Ladies and Ron Sexsmith. CBC Music called Evin the \u201cnext big thing\u201d, and \u201cHave I Ever Loved?\u201d was among the Top 20 most played songs of 2015 on Sirius XM\u2019s CBC Sonica. \u201cAl Green\u201d reached #1 on Sirius XM\u2019s The Verge. In 2017, Barenaked Ladies brought him out to support their US theatre tour, and he\u2019s also shared stages with Sexsmith, Dan Mangan and Sarah Harmer. Audiences love the spontaneity, intimacy and energy of his live shows.\n\nThe Evin On Earth album title took on added nuance when toward the end of making the record Evin had a near-death experience. He and a friend found themselves lost in the woods of Quebec after-dark while cross-country skiing in -25 degree celcius weather. Close to hypothermia, Evin almost lay down to rest in the snow, but he pushed on. During the next two months, he endured frostbite on his finger-tips and was unable to play piano.\n\nMike Evin\u2019s modern spin on piano pop manages to sound contemporary, classic and elusive all at once. His voice is a heartfelt reflection of the human experience. Now with his new album (out October 11 on Cairomin Records), he\u2019s bringing everyone another \u2018little slice of Evin on Earth.\u2019\n\n\u201cAn overflowing musical universe\u201d\n- Live In Limbo\n\n\u201cDanceable sexy pop music that will make you want to sway your hips\u201d\n- The Girl At The Rock Show\n\n\u201cHauntingly beautiful vocals and mesmerizing music\u201d\n- Canadian Beats", "otherInfo": "Music Room Session"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "the Lawrence Peters Outfit ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10351367.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Country, Ameripolitan, Traditional Country, Honky Tonk", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Lawrence Peters Outfit play un-ruined country music, a term Lawrence coined to describe the band\u2019s original, deep-rooted, honky tonk sound.

In a few short years, he had quickly become one of Portland's most well-loved, consommate road-warriors, cherished by fans of songcraft, other songwriters, and the bandleaders who, over and over, invited him to join them on tour. Still a young man, he'd released three LPs, numerous splits, 7\"s EPs, and singles under the moniker Hip Hatchet and toured as a multi-instrumentalist for the likes of Esme Patterson, The War & Treaty, Quiet Life, and others. He relocated to Nashville in 2017 to continue working as a touring musician. But the endless cycle of barely-occupied sublet apartments, ephemeral friendships, and might-have-beens left him drained, burnt out, longing for some semblance of stability or a connection that remained always tantalizingly out of reach.\n\n\"I keep telling myself this is the life that I chose,\" he sings on album\u2019s title track Me and the Moon, a reflection on the solitutde of traveling alone. Me and the Moon holds, at its core, a fundamental question - if you devote your life to labor, what is left to go home to?\n\nIt's a tender, restrained record, distilling and developing his previous work with a confident stylistic voice; his vocal naked and close, the arrangements uncluttered and deliberate - a brushstroke of pedal-steel crying in the left ear, a faint swell of a synthesizer somewhere through a highway tunnel, the deft chiming of fingerpicked guitar melodies. The writing is unhurried and poignant, each story linked by a wistful kindness - for both the author and the characters that drift in and out of his life. As weary as Philippe clearly is by the end of side B, he never comes across as bitter, rather, he delivers his words with an obvious empathy that is much better felt than described.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kris Drever ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10384014.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Kris Drever is a Scottish folk singer songwriter, who has won multiple awards including an incredible 7 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, two shortlist nominations for Scottish Album of The Year (with his trio Lau) and much acclaim for his solo recordings and concerts including glowing reviews from The Herald, The Guardian, Mojo and Q Magazine.\n\nHis recent single \u201cScapa Flow 1919\u201d was nominated for Best Original Track by BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards whilst his (John Parish produced) album with Lau, \"Midnight and Closedown\" was released in 2019 by Reveal Records to wild acclaim including being chosen in The Best Albums of The Year feature by The Guardian.\n\nDrever\u2019s voice and guitar form a part of the backbone of today\u2019s contemporary roots and folk scene.

Johnson began playing and writing songs on his four-track in the mid-'90s before he formed I Rowboat, a Velvet Underground-inspired indie rock band. Johnson began dabbling in folk with I Rowboat guitarist Dan Strack and drummer Brian Belval as the Fruit Bats. When I Rowboat disbanded, Johnson played guitar and banjo with Califone. That group's Tim Rutili and Ben Massarella, who also own Perishable Records, urged the Fruit Bats to record their work for the label, which resulted in the trio's 2001 debut, Echolocation. Over the next two years the group toured and refined its lineup and sound, adding Lisee as well as more pop and experimental elements to its folk-rock base. In 2002, the group signed to Sub Pop, who released their sophomore effort, Mouthfuls, in spring of 2003. Two years later, after relocating to Seattle and expanding to a four-piece, the band released their third full length album, Spelled in Bones. In 2006, Johnson became a member of The Shins, but remains committed to the Fruit Bats.

Her distinctive and brutally honest songwriting, paired with her energetic performances, come through seamlessly no matter where her music is played, live on the stage or in her critically acclaimed recordings.\n\nSince she began writing music when she was a teenager, the essence of Nicole Rayy\u2019s music has always been, first and foremost, to express herself as honestly as possible. When pressed for musical comparisons to her musical ability, the Oakville, Ontario-born Rayy is reluctant to provide. For as long as she\u2019s been playing music, she has been herself. Comparisons are easy to fall back on, but for Nicole, her music should always speak for itself.\n\nNicole Rayy first blasted into the Canadian Country music scene in 2012 with the release of her debut EP \u201cOnly Everything\u201d. She went on to release her debut full-length album Dig, in October 2016. The highly anticipated album, continued in the theme of uncompromising honesty and challenges listeners, as well as Nicole herself, to dig deep down to the emotional core of themselves. Produced at Noble Street Studios in Toronto by renowned Record Producer/Writer and Musical Director Doug Romanow, whose long list of clients include Justin Bieber, Johnny Reid, Chantal Kreviazuk, and the Canadian Country Music Awards. The album showcases Rayy\u2019s tonal range and relatable sentiment perfectly\n\nThe release of the album was celebrated by a performance and fundraising event at Cowboys Roadhouse in Winnipeg, MB, which raised over $4000 for the Manitoba Neurofibromatosis Support Group (MBNF). It was shortly after the event, that the title single \u201cDig,\u201d also released in October 2016, started to make its way on to radio stations across Canada. The single was highly supported nationally and garnered over 63,000 streams on Spotify.\n\nWith the success of the album and single \u201cDig,\u201d Nicole released her next single \u201cFireproof\u201d March, 2017, and embarked on a radio tour throughout Ontario and across Western Canada. \u201cFireproof,\u201d hit immediate success among music programmers and directors, and to date has received over 155,000 streams on Spotify.\n\nThe single took Nicole into what became a very exciting 2017, seeing her invited back to perform at such festivals as Manitoulin Countryfest, The Calgary Stampede and Burlington Ribfest, sharing the stage with artists such as The Chris Buck Band, Crystal Shawanda, and Joe Nichols. Nicole was also invited to showcase at the Country Music Association of Ontario Roadshow in Ottawa, NSAI Toronto\u2019s Tin Pan North, Diamonds In The Rough during Canadian Country Music Week in Saskatchewan, SK, and Indie Week Canada in Toronto, November 2017.\n\nNicole has also had the honour of performing at the World Music Festival in Shanghai, China, for three years in a row (2015-2017), and will be returning again in 2018, proving to be a hit among Shanghai\u2019s enthusiastic crowds.\n\n2018 began with an opportunity to open for Brett Kissel in Barrie, Ontario, and continued with multiple festival performances including Dauphin Countryfest, Trackside in London and the main stage at the Howl at the Moon festival in Manitoba opening for Aaron Pritchett and Brett Kissel\n\nIn June Nicole was honoured to be nominated for Rising Star by the CMA Ontario and her latest single \u201cBad Habit\u201d was released and has been very popular with her fans this summer.\n\nWith a sound that is distinctly her own and a creative ambition that knows no bounds, Nicole Rayy feels right at home either on a stage or in a recording studio and will never stay put in one place for too long.

The Canadian piano pop tunesmith has been steadily building a loyal following across North America and beyond for over ten years, yet his new music has the feel of an artist still out to discover something fresh and honest and connect with a wider audience.\n\nEvin On Earth builds on Evin\u2019s soulful sound and tells the story of the search for love and community. As one fan puts it, Evin has a way of \u201ccalling out all the meaningless noise we live with these days and just paring music down to simple, beautiful perfection.\u201d This new album, his sixth full-length, is one of his most diverse collection of songs, but it never strays from the consistent and distinctive sound of Evin\u2019s piano and singing. Along the way, Evin wears his various influences on his sleeve and takes us from theatrical power-pop to Afro-Latin grooves, from electro ska to laid-back beach pop. There are touches of The Who, West Side Story, Jason Mraz, ELO, Toots & The Maytals, The Bee Gees, Coldplay and Joe Jackson. Throughout the record, the catchy pop influence of his two mainstays, Billy Joel and Elton John, is alive and thriving.\n\nThe new album reunites Evin with some key collaborators from different points in his career: producer Howie Beck (Charlotte Day Wilson) first worked with Evin on 2015\u2019s Life As A Lover, bassist Jim Creeggan (Barenaked Ladies) co-produced 2005\u2019s I\u2019ll Bring The Stereo, and drummer Ian MacKay (Basia Bulat) has toured across Canada and the US with Evin.\n\nTo shake things up midway through the writing and recording process, Evin spent a summer traveling and immersing himself in two different cultures: he volunteered in the Aniishnaabe community of Manitoulin Island for a month, and he drove down to New Orleans to write for the other month. These adventures added a thematic thread to some of the album\u2019s songs. Evin\u2019s no stranger to dropping himself in the middle of unfamiliar territory. In the summer of 2012, he spent two months studying percussion in Cuba in the midst of a rich Afro-Cuban community.\n\nEvin On Earth was recorded in Evin\u2019s homebase of Toronto, and the album title has been kicking around since his early years coming up in the Montreal scene. A friend suggested it back then, and Evin originally scoffed at it - but it just seemed right for this album. That same friend challenged Evin to write a short album opening title song, and the result is \u201cEvin On Earth\u201d, a kind of mission statement and salute to artists everywhere.\n\nEvin\u2019s fans include Canadian icons Barenaked Ladies and Ron Sexsmith. CBC Music called Evin the \u201cnext big thing\u201d, and \u201cHave I Ever Loved?\u201d was among the Top 20 most played songs of 2015 on Sirius XM\u2019s CBC Sonica. \u201cAl Green\u201d reached #1 on Sirius XM\u2019s The Verge. In 2017, Barenaked Ladies brought him out to support their US theatre tour, and he\u2019s also shared stages with Sexsmith, Dan Mangan and Sarah Harmer. Audiences love the spontaneity, intimacy and energy of his live shows.\n\nThe Evin On Earth album title took on added nuance when toward the end of making the record Evin had a near-death experience. He and a friend found themselves lost in the woods of Quebec after-dark while cross-country skiing in -25 degree celcius weather. Close to hypothermia, Evin almost lay down to rest in the snow, but he pushed on. During the next two months, he endured frostbite on his finger-tips and was unable to play piano.\n\nMike Evin\u2019s modern spin on piano pop manages to sound contemporary, classic and elusive all at once. His voice is a heartfelt reflection of the human experience. Now with his new album (out October 11 on Cairomin Records), he\u2019s bringing everyone another \u2018little slice of Evin on Earth.\u2019\n\n\u201cAn overflowing musical universe\u201d\n- Live In Limbo\n\n\u201cDanceable sexy pop music that will make you want to sway your hips\u201d\n- The Girl At The Rock Show\n\n\u201cHauntingly beautiful vocals and mesmerizing music\u201d\n- Canadian Beats", "otherInfo": "Music Room Session"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jesse Dayton ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10386621.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jesse Dayton hails from Beaumont Texas and is the living, breathing, drinking embodiment of a cool country soul brother.

In a few short years, he had quickly become one of Portland's most well-loved, consommate road-warriors, cherished by fans of songcraft, other songwriters, and the bandleaders who, over and over, invited him to join them on tour. Still a young man, he'd released three LPs, numerous splits, 7\"s EPs, and singles under the moniker Hip Hatchet and toured as a multi-instrumentalist for the likes of Esme Patterson, The War & Treaty, Quiet Life, and others. He relocated to Nashville in 2017 to continue working as a touring musician. But the endless cycle of barely-occupied sublet apartments, ephemeral friendships, and might-have-beens left him drained, burnt out, longing for some semblance of stability or a connection that remained always tantalizingly out of reach.\n\n\"I keep telling myself this is the life that I chose,\" he sings on album\u2019s title track Me and the Moon, a reflection on the solitutde of traveling alone. Me and the Moon holds, at its core, a fundamental question - if you devote your life to labor, what is left to go home to?\n\nIt's a tender, restrained record, distilling and developing his previous work with a confident stylistic voice; his vocal naked and close, the arrangements uncluttered and deliberate - a brushstroke of pedal-steel crying in the left ear, a faint swell of a synthesizer somewhere through a highway tunnel, the deft chiming of fingerpicked guitar melodies. The writing is unhurried and poignant, each story linked by a wistful kindness - for both the author and the characters that drift in and out of his life.

There is a message, emotion, and uniqueness within each song that transcends trends while still embracing the familiar.\u201d - John Moyer (Disturbed)\n\nNew York, NY: Austin-based, hard/alternative artist, Hanna Barakat, announces her new album, Siren, showcasing \u201ca vocally powerful performance by the Texas-native driven by compelling songwriting and thunderous production.\" (Substream Magazine) Born in Texas to a Lebanese father and American mother, Barakat combines a variety of influences. \"While proudly paying homage to her roots, Barakat has cultivated her own style that merges Arab-Oriental influences with her love of rock music for a stunningly unique and original sound.\" (Metal Nexus). Pure Grain Audio declares, \"Artists come and go like skin cells but, sometimes, there are those that truly stand out for their immense talents. Barakat is clearly a member of the latter.\u201d\n\nThe album was produced by John Moyer, bassist from famed hard rock band, Disturbed, and mixed by Martin Nessi (Michael Jackson estate, Ariana Grande, Josh Groban, Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Ricky Martin, Kelly Clarkson), and mastered by Ted Jensen of Sterling Sound (Disturbed, Evanescence, Three Days Grace, Breaking Benjamin, Halestorm, Pat Metheny).\n\nBarakat beautifully describes the inspiration behind the album:\n\n\u201cI chose the title, Siren, for my debut record, after John Moyer and I produced our final song together, which happened to be \u201cSiren.\u201d The power of the music and the lyrics filled me with such fire. It motivated me and inspired me to take this next step in my journey with such confidence. Though the song references the mythical sirens of the sea, I loved the idea of a double meaning: an actual siren, warning call, alarm! The songs on this record were written over a span of 10 years. These songs have been my comfort and my therapy, as I\u2019ve journeyed this world, witnessed injustices, engrossed myself in my ancestral culture, grown within myself, literally travelled the globe, loved, lost, failed, loved again, and struggled to reach the place where I am today. I want to bring awareness to these situations, not by forcing any political agenda, but by pushing for love, understanding, and acceptance of all the other humans walking this earth together. Throughout history, there have been unnatural walls physically erected, or socially accepted and perpetuated, in order to divide people. I want to tear those walls down. All of them. Through my music, with rock guitars, heavy drums, deep rhythmic bass lines, and my intricate vocal melodic lines and punchy harmony stacks, I have chosen to forge Arab instruments like the oud, kanun, frame drum, riqq, into my sonic landscape, where I feel they so naturally and appropriately belong.\u201d\n\n\nFor All Media Inquiries:\nMeijin Bruttomesso, Effective Immediately PR\n(212) 777-6727x209 / meijin@ei-pr.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bethany Cosentino ( Best Coast ) ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Grenon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10363323.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Alternative, Pop Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "GRENON is an alt-rock band from New Hampshire (USA).

The album announces Regen as a formidable talent with the rarest of gifts - an original voice that speaks to the human condition with authority and hope. Regen\u2019s songs define our times, but are meant to last for all time.\n\nRegen knows a thing or two about navigating the unexpected. Coming of age in the 1980s, he nourished himself on a steady diet of MTV and synth pop. And while he could have spent his life in search of New Wave glory, he instead moved to New York City and became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of jazz piano great Kenny Barron, toured with artists like Little Jimmy Scott and Kyle Eastwood, and slowly carved-out a name for himself as a solo artist who defied easy categorization.\n\nLike Bruce Hornsby before him, Regen creates infectious melodies that often belie the music\u2019s harmonic sophistication. Like Randy Newman, he draws on the richness of the American musical vernacular, distilling an ocean into a creek the artist can call his own. It\u2019s on the axis of those seemingly diverse worlds that Jon Regen\u2019s sound is born. It's also on the axis of differing worlds that Higher Ground sprang to life.\n\nHaving experienced a new level of artistic success following his critically-acclaimed 2015 album Stop Time (produced by Mitchell Froom and featuring members of Elvis Costello\u2019s Imposters), Regen wasn\u2019t eager to rush into the studio for a follow-up. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t going to make a record of just any songs, produced just any way,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI never gave up the idea of recording again, but I knew I didn\u2019t want to make the same album I did last time. I wanted to be inspired.\u201d\n\nParenthood helped Regen meditate on several factors. \u201cI wondered if, in this new divided world \u2013 and in this era of instant internet fame, if music still resonated the way I remembered it could.\u201d\n\nWith no stream of roadwork planned (he was too busy being a full-time dad), Regen played local shows around New York City and dug into his work as the Editor of Keyboard Magazine. \u201cFor the first time in decades, I had a regular jazz gig,\u201d he says. \u201cI became reacquainted with the piano in a way I hadn\u2019t been able to while I was constantly touring. I also threw myself into my writing work, relishing the chance to explore the inspiration behind otherpeople\u2019s music.\u201d Then in September 2018, Jamiroquai\u2019s Matt Johnson invited Regen to the group\u2019s gig at the Forest Hills Tennis Center in Queens, New York.\n\nThe location proved remarkable: Regen\u2019s parents had lived on the same street during the 1960s. Possibly more remarkable was the gig itself: \u201cI saw 14,000 people dancing to funk music in the New York rain that night, and my faith in the healing power of music was instantly restored.\u201d\n\nWhen Regen and Johnson met at the afterparty, they hit it off instantly, despite being something of an unlikely pairing. \u201cMatt\u2019s a proper British synth whiz, and I\u2019m a gravely-voiced New York singer/songwriter. But I thought, \u2018Maybe there\u2019s something to this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe pair wrote the song \u201cWide Awake\u201d as a way of testing the waters - with Johnson in London and Regen at home in New York City. And despite the distance, the duo struck creative magic. \u201cIt was just this great marriage of Matt\u2019s studio wizardry and my songwriting and piano styles,\u201d Regen explains. \u201cFunnily enough, that song would never have been born had I not bought an old Roland Juno-60 synthesizer and started fooling around with it on top of my Steinway grand piano. But once I did, I knew I was onto something fresh. It was a sound that was new to me, so I chased it.\u201d\n\nJohnson says, \u201cWhen he sent me his idea, I was struck by the rich quality of his voice. As the track progressed, I learned that Jon could also play great jazz piano. For me, this album shows off all the best in Jon - great songs, great piano and a truly distinctive voice.\u201d\n\nBut a lingering question remained: Could the duo record an entire album without anyone ever playing in the same place at the same time? They were about to find out.\n\nFor Regen, making the album became a mission unto itself, regardless of the challenges the pair faced. \u201cI wrote lyrics while my son watched \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 and recorded piano and vocals in my apartment while he napped,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore we knew it, the project was materializing before our eyes.\u201d\n\nNo stranger to formidable companions, Regen enlisted an all-star cast that reads like the lineup of a supergroup; keyboardists Benmont Tench, Chuck Leavell, Ricky Peterson (David Sanborn, Fleetwood Mac) and Matt Rollings (Lyle Lovett, Willie Nelson,) signed-on, as did Duran Duran\u2019s Nick Rhodes.\n\n\u201cFor someone who used to air drum to Rio as a kid, hearing Nick\u2019s synth work on my music was positively surreal,\u201d Regen says. \u201cIn a lot of ways, this record is about the moment when your heroes become your peers.\u201d\n\nTench says that there was never a second thought about lending his talents to the album. \u201cNot only is Jon an annoyingly great piano player,\u201d the veteran keyboardist says, \u201che isn\u2019t sitting still in the songwriting department, either: this is a laudable leap forward in both style and expression.\u201d\n\nHaving scored a premiere rhythm section for his previous album, Regen was once again drawn to top players like bassists Larry Klein (Joni Mitchell) and Tim Lefebvre (David Bowie, Tedeschi Trucks Band), and drummers Keith Carlock (Steely Dan) and Jerry Marotta (Peter Gabriel). Previous Regen collaborators like guitarists Andy Summers (The Police) and George Marinelli (Bonnie Raitt) return here, as do cellist Julia Kent and Swiss harmonica ace Gr\u00e9goire Maret. And as impressive as the guest list on Higher Ground is, what\u2019s even more miraculous is that every musician played his or her parts in their respective hometowns. The entire album was recorded remotely, across different cities, oceans and countries.\n\nListening to Higher Ground, it\u2019s not hard to imagine what led musical luminaries to join in. The album strikes the perfect balance between gravity and levity, between deep introspection and knowing when to cast worries aside and get down to celebrating the moment.\n\nThe album opener \u201cWide Awake\u201d gives us a glimpse of the myriad of styles Regen pulls from. Funky, R&B grooves collide with jazz and pop flourishes, and lyrics that never overstate the tune\u2019s status as a love song. And the title track \u201cHigher Ground\u201d sounds like something culled from an earlier time and, perhaps, like John Hiatt\u2019s \u201cHave a Little Faith\u201d not just a song but a hymn to the heart. \u201cThat one is for my son,\u201d Regen remarks. \u201cThe lyric, \u2018I\u2019m a better man now, \u2018cause I stand on higher ground\u2019 is about him showing me what\u2019s really important in this world. The title became a mantra for the entire album, pushing me to elevate my singing, songwriting and piano playing at every turn.\u201d\n\nAs good as he is at walking in the alleyways of America\u2019s musical past, Regen moves himself into the contemporary via the socially-conscious \u201cWho Cares If Everybody Else Knows.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a lyric that all right-minded people can relate to,\u201d Johnson says, \u201cand I feel it\u2019s where I took Jon furthest from his comfort zone musically. The track sounds completely modern and Nick put in some really interesting sounds at the end to finish it off.\u201d\n\nOn other tracks, Regen\u2019s piano mastery is firmly on display. \u201cHole in My Heart\u201d features a dreamy, triple-tracked piano solo that channels the best of early Bowie and later Hornsby. The libidinous, New Orleans-inflected \u201cEvery Night\u201d recalls Dr. John at his swampiest. And \u201cEast Side Blues\u201d pits Regen\u2019s blues-drenched piano against the street noise of his native New York City, marrying humor with high musical art.\n\nOne song, \u201cThe Last to Go,\u201d bridges Regen\u2019s recent past with the music of his youth. \u201cBenmont played on that one and recorded the organ at Mitchell Froom\u2019s studio in Los Angeles,\u201d Regen explains. \u201cMitchell produced my last album, Stop Time, and played the first organ solo I ever heard, on Crowded House\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over.\u2019 And so the circle completes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Last to Go\u201d not only summarizes many of the album\u2019s themes, it\u2019s also unquestionably a new high in Regen\u2019s compositional output. \u201cIt was the last song I wrote for the album,\u201d he says. \u201cI was up late in New York City one night, thinking about the album and my approaching birthday \u2013 of where I have been, and where I still hope to go. I traced my life back through big events, and more personal earthquakes. And of course, with the world we live in now full of disinformation and vitriol, we all look for a guiding light. My wife is that for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter I wrote that song, I called Benmont to play organ on it. Because nobody can move air on a Hammond like Ben. He also had his daughter on the exact same day I had my son, and I had a feeling he feels about his wife the way I do about mine.\u201d\n\nThe balance between light and dark heard on the album is not lost on Regen. \u201cLooking back at the album now, I see it\u2019s full of both optimism and fear,\u201d he says. \u201cSongs like \u2018Wide Awake\u2019 and \u2018Higher Ground\u2019 speak to the power of love and family and the happiness they bring. But songs like \u2018Who Cares If Everybody Else Knows\u2019 and \u2018Before\u2019 are darker. They are me grappling with the madness of life as a new parent in 2019 \u2013 where no one seems to stand for anything besides greed and power. Those are tough sentiments to reconcile. In the end, I suppose life is about just that \u2013 how to explain the unexplainable.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ MADD\u00d8G ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10282312.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Wed May 20 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-20", "Genre": "Electro House, Techno, Electronic, House", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "MADD\u00d8G has shared lineups with such artists as Ke$ha, Betty Who, Big Freedia, Matt & Kim, Girl Talk, and Big Dipper to name a few.

Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011. Elephant Mountain has just recorded their new album and will be releasing it Spring/Summer of 2013. He's lent his vocal expertise to many local releases, and appears on MUSHROOMHEAD\u2019s album, \u201cBeautiful Stories For Ugly Children\u201d, singing on the track \u201cHoles In The Void\u201d\n\nAnd not to be outdone Joe has released three cd\u2019s of original material, \u201cJUST JOE SOLO EP\u201d (December 2011), \u201cMy Demons, My Burden, My Life\u201d (May of 2012) and \u201cGot Joe?\u201d (December of 2012). And now after a very successful Kickstarter campaign, Joe\u2019s next album, \u201cSo The Story Goes\u2026\u201d will be released this Spring 2013!!\n\nUpstate New York born and bred.

But tucked into the coves, bluffs and hollers above the freeways are hairpin roads, dirt paths, hidden waterfalls and stunning valley views. Mountain native Jennifer Daniels claims this territory as her own, despite traversing the interstates to make a living. As she puts it, \u201cI sometimes think of my songs as vertical.\u201d\nFor 10 years now, the singer/songwriter has chosen a narrow, winding, mountain road less traveled than the broad highway frequented by homogenized pop superstars, cluttering the radio with disposable hooks and disingenuous, secondhand sentiment. For her, \u201cpart of the music is figuring life out. I can\u2019t help but feel I have some Bohemian blood in me, searching for truth and beauty and love. You can\u2019t serve the master of fame and fortune and the master of truth and beauty\u2014no path exists for following both.\u201d\n\nAlongside husband Jeff Neal, who contributes tasteful guitar and mandolin support, Daniels first caught the attention of music fans in live settings\u2014beginning in 1999\u2014with her supple, dynamic voice and physical, absorbing delivery. It began in time-honored, grassroots fashion, with gigs in Chattanooga, Tennessee\u2014just down the mountain from home\u2014then short forays around the southeastern U.S. and then regular hauls up and down the East Coast and, finally, jaunts across the country, with as many as 200 dates each year.\nOn the road for long stretches, Daniels made Decatur, Ga\u2019s legendary Eddie\u2019s Attic\u2014an acoustic-music listening room known for launching the careers of everyone from the Indigo Girls to Shawn Mullins\u2014her home away from home. During this period Daniels was a regular contestant at the venue\u2019s \u201cOpen Mic Shoot-Out\u201d contests. On one particular night, she made it to the final, but fell just short of the top prize, edged out by a young upstart named John Mayer. Daniels won the contest later, topping another notable singer/songwriter, Zac Brown (whose Zac Brown Band now is blowing the doors off country radio) to do it.\nHer stage reputation established, Daniels began establishing herself as a recording artist, independently releasing her 2000 debut, Fists of Flood, to raves in Performing Songwriter, which named it a Top 12 DIY Release for the year and said, \u201cThis is music that seems to have grown slowly from some rich, dark soil.\u201d\nDespite the occasional conversation with label execs, Daniels has chosen to remain independent, drawing upon her own resources for touring and recording. For Daniels and Neal, a sustainable, fulfilling life creating meaningful music and connecting personally with listeners holds far more reward than chart positions, heavy-rotation singles or SoundScan numbers.\n\nNow, four studio albums and one live album later, Daniels has recorded her most ambitious effort, Come Undone, a song cycle in three acts. The album\u2019s recording was fraught with more than just artistic significance, with Daniels and Neal spending sessions in wonder and anticipation at the pending birth of twins, their first children (if you don\u2019t count songs and beloved dog Bob Marley). As Daniels notes, rather than heavy literature, \u201cduring tracking I was obsessively reading What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting!\u201d\nSignificantly, for an artist who began her recording career with stripped-down arrangements\u2014featuring guitars, mandolin, a little bass and not much else\u2014on Come Undone producer Scott Smith goes for a fuller approach, with strings, electronics, a choir and a pipe organ at various moments, depending on what seemed appropriate.\n\u201cThere was a whole new level of artistry, so we felt the production\u2019s depth should fit the project,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThe orchestration and sonic choices were a natural fit not only for the songs, but for framing Jennifer's voice in a way it hasn\u2019t yet been heard. The complexity of her voice\u2014both lyrically and melodically \u2014works amazingly well stripped down, with two guitars. So the challenge was to add to this while still retaining the intimacy of her message. There's plenty of ear candy for anyone who wants to listen for it, yet those in love with Jen\u2019s voice and the songs won't be distracted.\u201d\nJust as ambitious as the sounds\u2014and owing, in no small part, to the significant life-changes afoot\u2014are the themes, both epic in scope and more personal than ever. To name one example, few artists this side of Bono would have the guts to tackle an argument with God in song, but in \u201cYou Slay Me,\u201d Daniels pulls it off. \u201cThat song practically wrote itself,\u201d she observes, \u201cduring a night when I was grief stricken, angry and exhausted by months of sorrow, unable to understand why God would allow such heartache. Honestly, I\u2019m afraid to perform it\u2014it\u2019s personal, it\u2019s revealing and it leaves me vulnerable to misinterpretation and judgment.\u201d\nAt the same time, she says, that song and one other close-to-the-bone confession, \u201cEvery Single Day,\u201d are absolutely indispensable to the story Come Undone tells, one of hopes and dreams, then disillusion and darkness and, finally, joy that survives all the more for having been tested and scarred by life. \u201cThe title is an invitation to allow the weight of disappointment to strip you of things that can be taken away in order to find the stabilizing force of what cannot,\u201d Daniels concludes.\nThat said, even Daniels\u2019 most serious album to date doesn\u2019t forsake her well-known humor, particularly on \u201cYou Should Love Me,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek strut before a would-be beau. It\u2019s a side of her that shows up even more forcefully onstage. \u201cIf the audience laughs at my jokes, I\u2019m liable to try a whole stand-up routine,\u201d she notes. \u201cThen Jeff will quietly remind me that we\u2019re here to play music and we all laugh some more.\u201d\n\nWith a new album in hand and new twins to raise, Daniels and Neal still will be making their way down from their home sweet mountain home to hit the roaring interstates and play to their loyal audience. \u201cQuite honestly, we\u2019re not sure how it\u2019s going to work,\u201d Daniels admits. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never been sure how it would work, even in the earliest days when it was just the two of us, or when we got our now-five-year-old puppy.\u201d\nLong after the highways need to be rebuilt, and all the fast-food drive-throughs dotting their exits have been boarded up, ancient Lookout Mountain will still tower over the landscape. In the same way, Daniels hopes to keep writing, playing and recording long after today\u2019s chart-toppers have been relegated to the \u201cwhere are they now?\u201d file.\n\u201cWe saw Gordon Lightfoot play last year,\u201d Daniels recalls, \u201cand came away thinking how awesome it would be to be able to continue writing and performing well into old age. The audience didn\u2019t care that his voice wasn\u2019t what it used to be. They loved the stories and they loved the storyteller.

Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011. Elephant Mountain has just recorded their new album and will be releasing it Spring/Summer of 2013. He's lent his vocal expertise to many local releases, and appears on MUSHROOMHEAD\u2019s album, \u201cBeautiful Stories For Ugly Children\u201d, singing on the track \u201cHoles In The Void\u201d\n\nAnd not to be outdone Joe has released three cd\u2019s of original material, \u201cJUST JOE SOLO EP\u201d (December 2011), \u201cMy Demons, My Burden, My Life\u201d (May of 2012) and \u201cGot Joe?\u201d (December of 2012). And now after a very successful Kickstarter campaign, Joe\u2019s next album, \u201cSo The Story Goes\u2026\u201d will be released this Spring 2013!!\n\nUpstate New York born and bred.

But tucked into the coves, bluffs and hollers above the freeways are hairpin roads, dirt paths, hidden waterfalls and stunning valley views. Mountain native Jennifer Daniels claims this territory as her own, despite traversing the interstates to make a living. As she puts it, \u201cI sometimes think of my songs as vertical.\u201d\nFor 10 years now, the singer/songwriter has chosen a narrow, winding, mountain road less traveled than the broad highway frequented by homogenized pop superstars, cluttering the radio with disposable hooks and disingenuous, secondhand sentiment. For her, \u201cpart of the music is figuring life out. I can\u2019t help but feel I have some Bohemian blood in me, searching for truth and beauty and love. You can\u2019t serve the master of fame and fortune and the master of truth and beauty\u2014no path exists for following both.\u201d\n\nAlongside husband Jeff Neal, who contributes tasteful guitar and mandolin support, Daniels first caught the attention of music fans in live settings\u2014beginning in 1999\u2014with her supple, dynamic voice and physical, absorbing delivery. It began in time-honored, grassroots fashion, with gigs in Chattanooga, Tennessee\u2014just down the mountain from home\u2014then short forays around the southeastern U.S. and then regular hauls up and down the East Coast and, finally, jaunts across the country, with as many as 200 dates each year.\nOn the road for long stretches, Daniels made Decatur, Ga\u2019s legendary Eddie\u2019s Attic\u2014an acoustic-music listening room known for launching the careers of everyone from the Indigo Girls to Shawn Mullins\u2014her home away from home. During this period Daniels was a regular contestant at the venue\u2019s \u201cOpen Mic Shoot-Out\u201d contests. On one particular night, she made it to the final, but fell just short of the top prize, edged out by a young upstart named John Mayer. Daniels won the contest later, topping another notable singer/songwriter, Zac Brown (whose Zac Brown Band now is blowing the doors off country radio) to do it.\nHer stage reputation established, Daniels began establishing herself as a recording artist, independently releasing her 2000 debut, Fists of Flood, to raves in Performing Songwriter, which named it a Top 12 DIY Release for the year and said, \u201cThis is music that seems to have grown slowly from some rich, dark soil.\u201d\nDespite the occasional conversation with label execs, Daniels has chosen to remain independent, drawing upon her own resources for touring and recording. For Daniels and Neal, a sustainable, fulfilling life creating meaningful music and connecting personally with listeners holds far more reward than chart positions, heavy-rotation singles or SoundScan numbers.\n\nNow, four studio albums and one live album later, Daniels has recorded her most ambitious effort, Come Undone, a song cycle in three acts. The album\u2019s recording was fraught with more than just artistic significance, with Daniels and Neal spending sessions in wonder and anticipation at the pending birth of twins, their first children (if you don\u2019t count songs and beloved dog Bob Marley). As Daniels notes, rather than heavy literature, \u201cduring tracking I was obsessively reading What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting!\u201d\nSignificantly, for an artist who began her recording career with stripped-down arrangements\u2014featuring guitars, mandolin, a little bass and not much else\u2014on Come Undone producer Scott Smith goes for a fuller approach, with strings, electronics, a choir and a pipe organ at various moments, depending on what seemed appropriate.\n\u201cThere was a whole new level of artistry, so we felt the production\u2019s depth should fit the project,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThe orchestration and sonic choices were a natural fit not only for the songs, but for framing Jennifer's voice in a way it hasn\u2019t yet been heard. The complexity of her voice\u2014both lyrically and melodically \u2014works amazingly well stripped down, with two guitars. So the challenge was to add to this while still retaining the intimacy of her message. There's plenty of ear candy for anyone who wants to listen for it, yet those in love with Jen\u2019s voice and the songs won't be distracted.\u201d\nJust as ambitious as the sounds\u2014and owing, in no small part, to the significant life-changes afoot\u2014are the themes, both epic in scope and more personal than ever. To name one example, few artists this side of Bono would have the guts to tackle an argument with God in song, but in \u201cYou Slay Me,\u201d Daniels pulls it off. \u201cThat song practically wrote itself,\u201d she observes, \u201cduring a night when I was grief stricken, angry and exhausted by months of sorrow, unable to understand why God would allow such heartache. Honestly, I\u2019m afraid to perform it\u2014it\u2019s personal, it\u2019s revealing and it leaves me vulnerable to misinterpretation and judgment.\u201d\nAt the same time, she says, that song and one other close-to-the-bone confession, \u201cEvery Single Day,\u201d are absolutely indispensable to the story Come Undone tells, one of hopes and dreams, then disillusion and darkness and, finally, joy that survives all the more for having been tested and scarred by life. \u201cThe title is an invitation to allow the weight of disappointment to strip you of things that can be taken away in order to find the stabilizing force of what cannot,\u201d Daniels concludes.\nThat said, even Daniels\u2019 most serious album to date doesn\u2019t forsake her well-known humor, particularly on \u201cYou Should Love Me,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek strut before a would-be beau. It\u2019s a side of her that shows up even more forcefully onstage. \u201cIf the audience laughs at my jokes, I\u2019m liable to try a whole stand-up routine,\u201d she notes. \u201cThen Jeff will quietly remind me that we\u2019re here to play music and we all laugh some more.\u201d\n\nWith a new album in hand and new twins to raise, Daniels and Neal still will be making their way down from their home sweet mountain home to hit the roaring interstates and play to their loyal audience. \u201cQuite honestly, we\u2019re not sure how it\u2019s going to work,\u201d Daniels admits. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never been sure how it would work, even in the earliest days when it was just the two of us, or when we got our now-five-year-old puppy.\u201d\nLong after the highways need to be rebuilt, and all the fast-food drive-throughs dotting their exits have been boarded up, ancient Lookout Mountain will still tower over the landscape. In the same way, Daniels hopes to keep writing, playing and recording long after today\u2019s chart-toppers have been relegated to the \u201cwhere are they now?\u201d file.\n\u201cWe saw Gordon Lightfoot play last year,\u201d Daniels recalls, \u201cand came away thinking how awesome it would be to be able to continue writing and performing well into old age. The audience didn\u2019t care that his voice wasn\u2019t what it used to be. They loved the stories and they loved the storyteller.

Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable.\n\n\n\n\"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\"\n\n\n\nHarris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night.\n\n\n\nHarris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record.\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week. I only made it through one semester of college, but being around these amazing songwriters here in Austin\u2026 It\u2019s like getting an education.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Barnyard Stompers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9183255.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Outlaw Country, Americana, Country, Southern Rock, Folk, Rock, Blues, Dirty Blues", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hard working, traveling outlaw circus!

When you consider all of the bands that formed using their idiosyncratic power and texture as blueprints (and then hearing those pretenders fail anyway), you can clearly see the hole Under\u00f8ath left behind. Whatever real-life worries, psychic baggage or other concerns plagued Spencer Chamberlain, Aaron Gillespie, Tim McTague, Chris Dudley, Grant Brandell and James Smith at the time of their 2013 farewell tour, Under\u00f8ath\u2019s collective consciousness has been fortified by a renewed commitment to their art. On their Fearless Records debut Erase Me, Under\u00f8ath have added another crucial chapter to their formidable legacy. When the band went in the studio in the summer of 2017 to record their sixth album with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3), and Ken Andrews (co-founder of acclaimed LA outfit Failure), they knew exactly what they wanted to do as well as what they needed to do. Having already established themselves both as melodic songwriters (2004\u2019s RIAA-Certified Gold record They\u2019re Only Chasing Safety) and as ambitious power merchants (2006\u2019s stentorian, gold-selling Define The Great Line and its majestic follow-up, 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound Of Separation), the evolution detailed on Erase Me finds them using the sonic dialects they\u2019ve crafted to reveal where they are now. Clearly, Erase Me is the apex where melodic heft, indefatigable power, spatial resonance and arcane electronic textures converge to reveal a band that\u2019s positively fearless. The band who once openly--and without apology--professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems.

The legendary journalist called the record \u201cone of the least polished first albums I\u2019ve heard in the past year and one of the best\u201d in his review for Rolling Stone.\n\nRobert Palmer of the New York Times wrote that one of the reasons that the Iron City Houserockers \u201chave drawn so much critical praise is that they\u2019re bringing fresh energy to a hallowed and somewhat moribund rock tradition.\u201d\n\nThe band had created a unique sounding blend of blue collar rock informed by their influences which included a deep love of Chicago blues, early rock and roll and old school soul, all mixed together with dollops of the then-current sounds of punk and new wave added in.\n\nTheir second album, 1980\u2019s Have A Good Time (But Get Out Alive), found them recording in New York City with an incredible supporting cast. Cleveland International\u2019s Steve Popovich and Marty Mooney tapped Mick Ronson (David Bowie) to co-produce the sessions, with additional input coming from Ian Hunter (Mott The Hoople) and Steven Van Zandt (Bruce Springsteen, Southside Johnny).\n\nHouserockers songwriter and vocalist Joe Grushecky recognized that they were entering into an unique situation. \u201cWe were a particularly effective concert band at that time. We just wanted to kick your ass and tear the place down. That\u2019s the attitude we had and then you had these guys that joined us who had much more experience recording,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey brought a little bit of sophistication to the whole process. You have the English guys and then you had the New Jersey guys and then you had us from Pittsburgh and on paper, it never should have worked. But somehow it did. Everything just fell into place.\u201d\n\nCleveland International Records is celebrating the 40th anniversary of Have A Good Time (But Get Out Alive) with a new expanded reissue that is available on CD, vinyl(bonus tracks available via a download card) and on all digital streaming outlets. Grushecky worked with his son, Johnny (who also plays guitar in the current version of the band) and his sound engineer, Brian Coleman, to compile a second disc with an additional 16 tracks, all previously unreleased. More than an hour\u2019s worth of demos and rarities, including alternate takes and in some cases, songs that didn\u2019t make the final running order of the original album, add an intriguing chapter to the existing legend of the record.\n\n\u201cWe always went into a local studio in Pittsburgh and I would write songs. Some of the guys would bring in some ideas and we would demo everything,\u201d Grushecky recalls. \u201cMost of the demos, when we were recording them, we weren\u2019t setting out to make a final product. So a lot of this stuff is just first and second takes to see what the song sounded like.\u201d\n\nGoing through reel-to-reel tapes and even some cassettes that had been in boxes for decades, Grushecky found he had an abundance of material. \u201cAt first, I thought we were just going to include a couple of extra tracks on this reissue. Then I started finding all of these different things and I started to get excited about it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, to some people, I\u2019m sure it would be like a great lost Iron City Houserockers record.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Tune in to a special edition of LIVE & Joe's Place.

The fourth full-length from bi-lingual French-born singer Samantha Stephenson and post-punk guitar visionary Scott Helland, Hooray Beret is organic and largely acoustic but relentless in its downhill grooves and cheeky garage noir riffage. In song after song, Stephenson nails the vanities, traps, and disfiguring pressures of 21st century life as she delivers a genuinely affirmative and urgent call to action: the action of self-reflection.\n\nThe album-opening \u201cWah\u201d winks in awareness of this paradox. Over an insistent club beat and a stylish, Euro vocal hook, Stephenson instructs herself to \u201cstay at home on a Saturday night...diving into what feels real.\u201d A feminist theme of self-exploration-as-activism recurs in almost every song. The deliriously cool chorus of the New Wave and spy-toned \u201cLankey Bell Bottoms\u201d celebrates continual growth and the rejection of triviality, while the gorgeous jangle-pop of \u201cSing\u201d offers a compact time-lapse portrait of a woman ignoring or forestalling her true calling in five different decades of her life.\n\nHooray Beret\u2019s message of independence and the shedding of socially imposed identities is well-earned. For more than a decade, Frenchy and the Punk have been refining their own voice in many quadrants of the Balkanized post-punk world. They have essentially invented their own genre in which punk vitality and drive meets an evocative, cinematic way with exotic melodies and European-inflected percussive textures. A founding member of Deep Wound with J Mascis and Lou Barlow, Helland weaves dark riffs and layers of spidery melody in an acoustic/electric tone that is entirely his own. Stephenson sings with a gothy heft and authority that may remind one generation of Siouxsie Sioux and another of Grace Slick.\n\nThrough no design of their own, the Hudson valley, New York, based band has become an in-demand performer on the post-cabaret, mythic, and steampunk scenes, even as they eschew affectation and excessive theatricality. Their engaging, unjaded live shows convert strangers to fans regardless of the setting. Hooray Beret offers the strongest proof to date of this band\u2019s rich and edifying spirit of serious fun.\n\nThe product of a 1998 office romance, the two left their temp jobs, traveled as a solo musician (him) and artist (her) selling their wares until 2005 when, Stephenson, the sultry French born singer jumped onstage and joined, Helland, the fiery punk rock guitarist from the golden days of the hardcore scene, and Frenchy and the Punk was born. Along the way they became the 'jewel of the steampunk/Dark Cabaret scene' and were named one of the ''Top 25 duos in America' by Yahoo music.\n\nThe unlikely pairing has since released 6 full-length CDs, produced a live concert DVD and have performed all across the U.S. and in Europe.

Combine that with Delta blues, compliments of a childhood spent in Cajun country, and you\u2019ve got one badass up-and-comer, with the pure musical talent and vocal chops to back him up. Already turning heads throughout Nashville, Baton Rouge and beyond, having been named one of the \u201cTop New Artists You Need To Know\u201d by Rolling Stone Country, CJ says the driving force behind his current success isn\u2019t fame nor fortune \u2013 it\u2019s just a diehard infatuation with the music he grew up on.\n\n\u201cI just want to write songs that say something that really means something. I want to ride around in a van, tour the country, and play songs with my buds. Everything I do in music, I want to do it for the love of the music and the sake of the song,\u201d he adds.\n\nIt all started back in Baton Rouge where his family\u2019s affinity for music struck a chord. \u201cMy grandparents loved country music. My dad was a big classic rock fan,\u201d he said. \u201cDad kept a guitar in a closet, and I dug it out when I was seven and started making noise of my own with it,\u201d Solar recalls. That so-called \u201cnoise\u201d would sharpen quickly, through lessons at the young age of eight, to enrollment at Nashville\u2019s Belmont University, to cuts on albums by Justin Moore and Jerrod Niemann, and, now, his own critically acclaimed solo EP that\u2019s turning heads, Hard One to Turn Down.\n\nAnd a Hard One To Turn Down, the EP is. Critics at The Daily Country write, \u201cSolar injects a hefty (and welcome) dose of Southern rock into his country, which melds perfectly with his gravelly vocals.\u201d Country Music Rocks was \u201cimmediately captivated by all five songs and hopes that [the EP] obtains the recognition it deserves.\u201d The Rowdy found it \u201cexactly what country fans are looking to savor.\u201d And The Shotgun Seat welcomes Hard One to Turn Down as \u201cthe perfect pairing of country storytelling and rocking rhythms, married by his dynamic vocals.\u201d And that\u2019s only the beginning.\n\nFlashback to Louisiana where CJ put a group together while in elementary school, recruiting his two brothers. They called themselves The Solar Heat, recollected by CJ as \u201cthe cheesiest band name of all time.\u201d But the band built up a solid local fan base, and helped CJ hone his writing and performance skills. However, CJ knew he needed to be in Nashville where he attended Belmont and landed an exclusive publishing agreement before he had even graduated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded some of my best songs in December of my senior year,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started interning at Sea Gayle Music in February, I played these and two other songs I hadn\u2019t recorded for Mike Owens (VP Creative at Sea Gayle). A week later I had a publishing deal. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not the way it happens with most interns. I\u2019m grateful for these opportunities, and I don\u2019t plan on taking them for granted.\u201d\n\nThe ink was still wet on Solar\u2019s degree when artists all over town started putting the new Nashville songwriter\u2019s self-penned songs on hold. \u201cBlue Bandana,\u201d which he\u2019d written in January, was chosen by Jerrod Niemann and released as a single. Then, Solar began writing with Bob DiPiero and other members of Nashville\u2019s songwriting elite.\n\nSolar tracked and produced Hard One To Turn Down, alongside Sea Gayle\u2019s Brent Anderson, (who\u2019s producing and songwriting credits include Chris Janson, Blake Shelton and others), with established country hit-maker Jerrod Niemann joining in on one song as guest vocalist. Its lead single, a paean to the powers of sipping on a \u201cTall Boy,\u201d dropped in mid-March and quickly garnered over 164,000 Spotify spins in its first month of release. The EP followed on April 15, in both digital and physical formats. In May, the music video for \u201cTall Boy,\u201d directed by Marcel Chagnon, premiered on CMT. Tour dates from coast to coast include his own headlining dates and opening slots for The Cadillac Three, Old Dominion, Hank Williams, Jr., and the list goes on.\n\nIf it\u2019s not obvious yet, Solar is on the fast track to success, with a solid team in Nashville to back him up. And he\u2019s not going to leave any stones left unturned. As important as songwriting is and will always be to Solar, he is excited to be stepping into the spotlight as an artist. CJ is a powerful vocalist with his Southern, gravelly edge and he has the guitar chops to match. His live show puts it all together and will knock you off your feet.\n\nYet the pensive, bolero-brimmed, too-wise-for-his-age 23-year-old is riding his momentum thoughtfully, with the long haul in mind. \u201cI\u2019d love to tour the country and have a handful of hit songs,\u201d he muses. \u201cBut I\u2019m totally cool with living pretty normally as long as I need to. All that matters is that I keep doing what I love to do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Way Back Wednesday"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mary Gauthier ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8315427.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Country, Alternative Country, Folk, Rock, Folk Rock, Singer, Americana, Songwriter", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cWith songwriting as powerful as hers, there\u2019s no need to go looking for qualifiers.

On their fourth studio album Everything Seems Like Yesterday, the San Diego-based band twist that dynamic to deliver their most emotionally direct body of work to date: a collection of songs written and performed solely by Carnevale, each track matching its stripped-back simplicity with both raw outpouring and intense reflection.\n\nThe follow-up to their 2019 album Live at the Observatory, Everything Seems Like Yesterday first took shape through a handful of songs Carnevale wrote on acoustic guitar back in fall 2018. \u201cHypochondriac was the first time I\u2019d ever written that way, and it felt really therapeutic,\u201d he says, referring to the band\u2019s 2018 Epitaph debut. \u201cIt pushed me to get much more into the craft of songwriting\u2014as opposed to mostly writing songs for people to mosh to\u2014and it felt right to keep going with that on this record.\u201d\n\nAlthough he originally intended to release that acoustic material as a solo album, Carnevale had a change of heart upon sharing his new songs at a series of shows in San Diego and L.A. \u201cAll the guys in the band came out and the response was pretty positive, so I started to think this might be something more than a bunch of songs to put online for free,\u201d he says. Envisioning the album as a natural evolution for The Frights, Carnevale soon enlisted Dotson as a producer, and the two bandmates set off to record at Carnevale\u2019s grandmother\u2019s cabin in Idyllwild, California.\n\nKicking off with the sweetly offbeat folk of \u201c24,\u201d Everything Seems Like Yesterday documents a particularly challenging year of Carnevale\u2019s life\u2014a period that began with the release of Hypochondriac on August 24, 2018 (i.e., Carnevale\u2019s 24th birthday). \u201cA lot of these songs are about friends who are gone now, either in the sense that they passed away or that we don\u2019t speak anymore,\u201d Carnevale points out. \u201cOur songs have always involved some kind of looking back over the past, but this one feels like the first time where I\u2019m dealing with those situations and growing from them. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s more mature\u2014because I don\u2019t know if I actually am more mature\u2014but it feels a little healthier than the songs where I\u2019m more caught up in nostalgia, and wishing things could just go back to the way they used to be.\u201d\n\nDuring their time at the Idyllwild cabin\u2014a free-flowing but rigorously productive week in late-April 2019\u2014Carnevale and Dotson purposely laid down the entire tracklist to Everything Seems Like Yesterday in exact sequence. In that process, they eschewed all digital production methods in favor of using a field recorder to capture a wide array of ambient sounds. \u201cThere were no plugins on the whole record; we wanted to force ourselves to be as creative as we could,\u201d Carnevale says. To that end, the two musicians ended up relying on everything from pinecones to pots and pans to construct the album\u2019s percussive components, in addition to introducing such sonic elements as the crunching of fallen leaves and the thump of tennis ball thrown against the cabin wall. And while recording the beautifully untethered \u201cSimple and Strange,\u201d Carnevale found his performance disrupted by an incoming call on the cabin landline\u2014then left that ringing in the track\u2019s final version. (\u201cEvery time I go up to Idyllwild my dad will always call to fuck with me\u2014like, \u2018I\u2019m watching you\u2026\u2019, so we just figured it was him,\u201d Carnevale recalls. \u201cBut when we picked up the phone during that take no one was there, and we never actually figured out who was calling.\u201d)\n\nWith recording in sequence giving Carnevale the motivation to \u201cmake each song better than the last,\u201d Everything Seems Like Yesterday ends on the heavy-hearted but hopeful \u201c25\u201d: a harmonica-laced number whose distinctly lo-fi aesthetic stems from some trickery on Dotson\u2019s part. \u201cWhen I was done writing that one I told Richard to come listen, and without telling me he turned on the field recorder\u2014and that\u2019s the take we ended up going with,\u201d says Carnevale. \u201cSo what you\u2019re hearing on the album is the first time I ever even played that song out loud.\u201d\n\nIn creating the more starkly composed songs heard throughout Everything Seems Like Yesterday, Carnevale made a point of placing a more careful focus on his lyrics, partly drawing from his burgeoning love of poets like Allen Ginsberg, Charles Bukowski, and Sylvia Plath. \u201cIf you can read a song as a poem and still get the same feeling from it, you know you\u2019ve done something right,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure I have plenty of songs from the old days that would really lack something if you took away the music and the melody, but these new songs feel more connected to when I first started writing\u2014back before the main concern was mostly just trying to get people to dance.\u201d\n\nAs they gear up for the release of Everything Seems Like Yesterday, The Frights are building up the album\u2019s tracks in order to accommodate the unhinged energy of their live performance. But for Carnevale, the album will always maintain an undeniable intimacy. \u201cWhen this was going to be a solo record, I had it in the back of my mind that it would really just be for my friends and my family,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd to be completely honest, that\u2019s still 100 percent what I want from this album. There\u2019s a lot of stuff on there that\u2019s about things that people close to me have gone through, and in a way the songs are just me trying to talk through them, and get a very personal message across without really worrying about anything else.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Will Dailey ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7763884.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Roots & Blues, Rock And Roll, Artist, Singer Songwriter...

Chris Avey, formerly of The Avey Brothers and former lead guitarist for blues icon Big Pete Pearson, has been called a \"younger, more fiery Coco Montoya mixed with a dash of Tab Benoit\". Avey and drummer Bryan West came in 3rd in the International Blues Challenge in Memphis in 2009 as The Avey Brothers.

But when the sun goes down, he straps on his signature Gretsch 6120, steps up to the mike and is transformed into REVEREND HORTON HEAT, a hellfire-spewing, rock and roll dare-demon.\n\nJim\u2019s tome is iconic: From recording with Lemmy Kilmister, being revered by country music legends like Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins, touring with Soundgarden, ZZ Top, The Cramps, Social Distortion, White Zombie and the Sex Pistols (a young Lydon was connected to Jim\u2019s original 1985 demo), to providing touring opps to upstarts Kyuss, Hank III, Marilyn Manson and countless others across decades on the road.\n\nHeath and longtime confidant and slap-bass general Jimbo Wallace have polished up their 12threlease, Whole New Life, which Heath calls \u201cthe most positive material I have ever written. It focuses heavily on rock and roll but there is a human interest parallel - songs about growing up poor, vices, marriage, having children and walking the rapturous streets of America.\u201d\n\nCall it a new twist on an old sound, Whole New Life was recorded between Fun Guy Studios and Modern Electric in the band\u2019s hometown of Dallas. The eleven track rumination features new sticksman Arjuna \u2018RJ\u2019 Contreras. The Texas based jazz pupil came to the bands attention from a friend\u2019s reference in the summer of 2017, and brought a whole new backbeat to the legendary rockabilly administration. After clicking with Contreras, Heath hired a new pianist in 2018, Matt Jordan, to flesh out the sound with the pomp and power of Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. \u201cI love playing with these guys, it truly is a whole new band, so the title fits perfectly.\u201d\n\nRecording the album, Heath recalled that \u201cBack in the 1950\u2019s, reverb chambers were really hip and I always loved their warmth. I\u2019m all about Sam Phillips and the things he did with tape machines and tape echo. I love that kind of production value, even if it is older than me! It really sent me to this whole other headspace where I worked with a lot of vintage gear on this album - some of which I built myself for a truly unique sound - ribbon, old tube microphones, pre-amps and stuff. Additionally, a year before I started piecing this together I worked especially hard on my singing voice. Whole New Life brought out something in me where I am screaming more and making more throaty sounds. It's got some Louisiana feel to it, a bit of gruff and some Roy Orbison style in it. We tested out new tracks on our most recent tour and they are working better with the audience than any new songs we premiered since the early days of the band.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis tour started around 1986,\u201d Heath chuckles dryly. REVEREND HORTON HEAT still performs nearly 200 shows annually, including their trademark Horton\u2019s Hayride Festival in Southern California, which has expanded to an end-of-the-year jamboree under the name Horton\u2019s Holiday Hayride. The band has also wowed sold-out crowds with their multi-city residencies across America, including performances at Coachella, Reading, Austin City Limits, Riot Fest and countless other festivals. The Texas troubadours also took a unique approach to the term \u2018Special Guests\u2019 on recent tours. Recalling the time the band opened for Jerry Lee Lewis, Heath had a vision, \u201cThe idea of playing in Jerry\u2019s backing band would have been pretty neat. So every once in a while we\u2019ll have a load of fun putting that aspect in our live set. In the middle of our set, we\u2019ll have a special guest come on stage for a mini-set where REVEREND HORTON HEAT is the backing band. The first time we did it was with Lemmy Kilmister. We stopped our set midway, the road crew dragged a Marshall amp on stage, wiped the Rickenbacker clean and out came Lem. He was adamant on playing deep cuts, but I fought tooth and nail with him to do \u2018Ace Of Spades.\u2019 I told him, \u2018Lemmy, we must do this song, we have to give the people want they want.\u2019 He took a drag of his smoke, looked me square in the eye, and said \u2018Never give them what they want, give them what they need!\u2019\u201d\n\nWith over 1 million albums sold and nearly 35 years in the game, Heath and company have been delivering blood-pressure inducing scriptures to millions of fans worldwide. Call it rock and roll, psychobilly or what have you, REVEREND HORTON HEAT is often considered an early architect of the latter genre (at least on this side of the Atlantic) and occupies a peculiar place in American musical terrain.\n\nWhole New Life was delivered November 30, 2018.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jeff Lane ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10336188.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Folk Rock, Americana, Folk, Alt-country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Combining soul-infused folk with a country-blues edge, Tennessee native Jeff Lane puts big stories to song from a common man's point of view.

He was heavily involved with the Occupy Oakland protests and expressed its rage and hope brilliantly in 2015's Wedgewood.

The songs started (mostly) as much of his early, unrecorded work from over a decade and a half ago, that were never properly released. He intended to record these songs to give away to fans, but as he worked on it, he realized the songs could use work and be a legit album.

It's a bright album for cloudy times, filled with a sense of buoyancy \u2014 an anthemic synthesizer here, a four-on-the-floor drumbeat there \u2014 that emphasizes hope and renewal over sorrow. The most modern-sounding project in his catalog, Brand New Hello fires twin barrels of political insight and poppy punch, influenced by everything from America's social climate to the Top 40 music his daughter would play in the car during the album's creation process.\n\nJerry Castle still sings with a slight southern twang \u2014 a product of his childhood days in Abingdon\u2014 but these days, he writes from a more universal perspective on his sixth solo release.

They tour the Northwest regularly as a duo, and put on theatrical shows with their full ensemble. They are alumni of the Johnny Mercer Songwriters Project and have played before Randy Newman.\n\nPortland's The Bylines exists in a unique musical plane, one at once grounded in the big-band past of glamorous pop performances and rooted in a present realm of intricate and highly addictive songwriting. With a focus on grand live spectacle--a facet of music often lost in the digital age--the group is equally at home in velvet-curtained jazz halls, large rooms and intimate venues.\n\nThat sound is the product of a marriage both sonic and literal. The Bylines is made up of two songwriters whose styles and influences converge to bring The Bylines' catchy, addictive sounds to vibrant life. Frontwoman Marianna Thielen, the glamorous face of the group, brings to the fore a background in composition, classical vocal work and, most obviously, musical theater, illuminating the stage with endlessly watchable bravado backed up by her powerful -- yet playful -- vocal prowess. Meanwhile, gliding his fingers across the keys is Reece Marshburn, letting loose a symphony of intricate melodies rooted in a combination of classical, jazz and pop music.\n\nThe resulting combination is a unique pop confection drawing on decades of influences, as if Cole Porter, Carole King, Dusty Springfield, Freddie Mercury, Paul Simon, Rufus Wainwright and Regina Spektor combined forces and filtered their unique compositions through classical maestros and film composers, then sprinkled it with a keen pop sensibility and a commitment to putting on the most involving, charismatic and personalized live shows this side of the Copacabana.\n\nThe Bylines have used their unique-yet-familiar sound to play to audiences large and small throughout the country, and have released both a studio(self titled, recorded by Bob Stark at Kung Fu Bakery) and a live album(The Bylines Live, recorded at the Alberta Rose Theatre in Portland, OR). The Bylines are proud alumni of the Johnny Mercer Songwriting Project, and have had support from the Regional Arts and Culture Council.\n\nWhether performing as a Thielen/Marshburn duo or with a larger band, the result is a blend of butter-smooth melodies, densely layered songwriting and powerful vocals. Most importantly, though, The Bylines musical cocktail goes down easy, and emphasizes something that is so often forgotten when such prolific songwriters present their craft: listening to music is, above all, supposed to be an experience\u2026 and a fun one.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Julia Haltigan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9199503.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Julia Haltigan", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Acclaimed bombshell songstress Julia Haltigan came up on the Lower East Side of New York City when it oozed a heady mix of danger, possibility and art.

In the two years since, the members of Wildermiss\u2014Cole, guitarists Josh Hester and Seth Beamer, and drummer Caleb Thoemke\u2014have built up a massive and fiercely loyal grassroots following in its hometown of Denver, Colorado, and crisscrossed the country winning over fans as the supporting act on tours with the Oh Hellos, Jared and the Mill and Bronze Radio Return.\n\nMore than a fan favorite, the quartet has also earned accolades from the press and radio in the Mile High City on the strength of its music and live show. \u201cCarry Your Heart,\u201d a Lost With You single that has attracted more than half a million streams on Spotify, received heavy rotation on KTCL, the taste-making station that first introduced the country to the Oh Hellos, The Fray, Flobots, Churchill, and many other breakout acts in the past fifteen years.\n\nIn addition to selling out the Bluebird Theater and thrilling capacity crowds with intimate back-to-back New Year\u2019s Eve dates at the Larimer Lounge, Wildermiss has played prime mainstage sets at all of the city\u2019s biggest music festivals, including iHeart Radio\u2019s Big Gig at the 18,000-seat amphitheater Fiddler\u2019s Green, the Westword Music Showcase and the Underground Music Showcase, which drew tens of thousands of fans, in addition to sharing a bill at the 6,500-seat 1STBANK Center arena with the Revivalists, Elle King, American Authors.\n\nThe outfit\u2019s ascent has all been organic. The members of Wildermiss have attracted fans the old fashioned way by writing memorable songs and playing their hearts out each night, winning over fan after fan one at a time. As viewers who happened to catch Wildermiss on Last Call With Carson Daly can attest, the act isn\u2019t a tough sell. Portions of the band\u2019s set at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles were captured for broadcast, and the performance was so compelling that it ended up airing on two different episodes of NBC\u2019s late-night show.\n\nBut just as those performances served as a sneak peek for the fortunate few across the country who were still up in the wee hours of the morning, Lost With You merely hinted at the potential of Wildermiss. In My Mind, the outfit\u2019s new seven-song EP, surpasses any expectations set by the group\u2019s highly acclaimed debut. From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band.

Call me a late bloomer with an eternal youthful spark, I\u2019m trying my best to be the artist I always thought I could be. I love the color orange as it shines down and brings us warmth and hope.

She is a veritable triple-threat of musical talent as a guitarist, songwriter and vocalist. As with many blues women of the past, Foley has a long history of defying convention, and being a positive role model for aspiring, young female musicians.\n\nThe Canadian has been working professionally since the age of 16, and by the age of 21, Foley had relocated to Austin, TX and began recording for Antone\u2019s\u2014the esteemed blues label and historic nightclub that helped launch the career of Stevie Ray Vaughan and many others. In the two decades that have followed, Sue Foley has been busy touring and recording steadily, all while toting her signature pink paisley Fender Telecaster. In 2001, she won the prestigious Juno Award (Canadian equivalent of the Grammy) and also holds the record for the most Maple Blues Awards and has earned three Trophees de Blues de France. She has also garnered several nominations at the Blues Music Awards in Memphis, TN.\n\nWith 11 recordings under her own name, an instructional DVD and book, as well as various compilations and projects, Foley is set to release her new album, The Ice Queen (March 2, 2018) on Stony Plain Records. \u201cI\u2019m extremely excited to be working with Holger Petersen and Stony Plain Records. Holger is one of the most knowledgeable \u201creal music\u201d people in the business\u201d, says Foley. \u201cStony Plain is known to put out great music and I know The Ice Queen has found her home.\u201d\n\nRecorded throughout 2017, The Ice Queen represents Foley\u2019s full circle journey \u2013 her return to the roots of her career in Austin with producer Mike Flanigin. The album was recorded with her long-time friends and collaborators Jimmie Vaughan and Billy F Gibbons (ZZ Top) as well Chris \u2018Whipper\u2019 Layton from Double Trouble, Charlie Sexton, and members of the Tedeschi Trucks and Gary Clark Jr bands.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a teenager I idolized Jimmie Vaughan and Billy F Gibbons,\u201d Foley says. \u201cThey're both legends now so this feels like an historical event (at least it does for me). And I grew up sitting at the feet of players like George \u2018Big Beat\u2019 Rains, Derek O'Brien and The Texas Horns. I spent many nights watching Charlie Sexton and the Arc Angels with Chris Layton. I learned and grew more musically in my years in Austin than at any point in my life. The fact that all these mega talented musicians have graced my album is beyond anything I hoped for. I am still pinching myself.\u201d\n\nA flood of inspiration and themes can be found on each of the tracks \u2013 ranging from lost love, anguish, and struggle to release, forgiveness and rebirth. Mostly recorded live-off-the-floor, Foley\u2019s emotional vocal delivery, conviction, accessible yet inspired lyrics and intrepid guitar playing are all laid out, bare and raw for the songs to reveal.\n\nOpening with the radio friendly and funky \u201cCome to Me\u201d, The Ice Queen also features upbeat and rollicking tracks \u201cRun\u201d, \u201cThe Lucky ones\u201d (a duet with Jimmie Vaughan) and \u201cGaslight\u201d. There are several bluesy and soulful tracks including \u201c81\u201d, \u201cThe Ice Queen\u201d, \u201cFool's Gold\u201d (featuring Billy F Gibbons on vocals and harmonica)\u201d, \u201cIf I Have Forsaken You\u201d, and a cheeky, guitar-heavy cover of Bessie Smith\u2019s \u201cSend Me To The \u2018Lectric Chair\u201d. Foley also provides some more mellow and unexpected songs on The Ice Queen with the jazzy \u201cDeath of a Dream\u201d, the flamenco-blues hybrid \u201cThe Dance\u201d and a beautiful cover of the Carter Family\u2019s \u201cCannonball Blues\u201d.\n\nThe Ice Queen represents Sue Foley\u2019s indefatigable commitment to her craft, and her transparency with the journey that birthed her, further proving that\nyou can\u2019t keep a good blueswoman down, particularly when she is The Ice Queen.\n\nsuefoley.com", "otherInfo": "Texas Blues Party, the NEW weekly livestream show featuring Sue Foley & Mike Flanigin.

While he\u2019s able to bongo, drum, strum, fingerpick, rap, sing and do ventriloquistic performances with his football-shaped alien puppet friend, his most impressive move is stringing his guitar behind his neck and flawlessly playing a killer guitar solo as if he invented guitar solos decades ago. Since the 2014 festival appearance, I have seen him an additional handful of times, every time as if it were the first. This man will blow you off your feet so quickly that you\u2019ll think you\u2019re flying, and he is the sort of musician that not only makes you move but moves you. The intimate relationship he has with his audience is absolutely unmatched in the live music scene.\u201d\n- Nathalie Phan - On Vinyl Music / ATX On Record Sept. 27, 2016", "otherInfo": "Live and improvised Funk/ Disco studio sessions with Henry Invisible.

At the same time, his recordings have consistently landed at the top of the New Adult Contemporary (NAC)/Smooth Jazz charts, a genre of music Tom helped pioneer in the mid-80s. As the Pacific Northwest\u2019s most renowned musical artist, Tom Grant\u2019s career achievements reflect his unique ability to embrace the full spectrum of contemporary music. Born to show business parents, Tom was at home with many musical instruments, but always returned to the piano. At a tender age, he was taught to play piano and drums by his tap dancer father. Later, he learned about music styles listening to music at his father\u2019s record store in Portland, Oregon. His brother, an avant-garde jazz pianist, introduced him to the many different facets of jazz music.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Oregon and a short stint as a high school teacher, Tom answered his musical calling. Native American saxophonist Jim Pepper took Tom to New York in 1970 to record the chant classic Witchi-tai-to. After that, he toured and recorded with such jazz greats as Woody Shaw, Joe Henderson, Charles Lloyd and Tony Williams. Since 1983, Tom\u2019s records have repeatedly topped the Smooth Jazz charts. Several, including the popular Mango Tango, Night Charade, In My Wildest Dreams, and The View from Here, enjoyed lengthy stays at Number One. Tom\u2019s music has been a staple of terrestrial and internet radio both in the U.S. and around the world. His compositions are also used in TV and Films worldwide. He has been featured on CNN and the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Tom is also a tireless worker for humanitarian and charitable causes. He has a scholarship established in his name by the United Negro College Fund. In 1999 Tom was also given the Humanitarian Award for Dedication to Music, Health and Children by the New York Presbyterian Hospital/Cornell Medical Center.\n\nMore recently he has dedicated himself to numerous charity projects for the under-funded public schools in the Northwest, Potluck in the Park, a charity that feeds hungry people in the Portland area, and the Edwards Center for handicapped adults. In 2001, Tom started recording on his own record label, Nu-Wrinkle Records. After nearly 35 years of recording on various labels (Windham Hill, Verve, Shanachie, PAUSA, Gaia, WMOT, Timeless International, Chase Music) he felt it was time to explore the world of self-produced music.

It only took eight years of waiting for one of the most unique artists to finally deliver a new dose of contemporary electro pyrotechnics and a worthy successor to the smashing Total. During those eight years, SebastiAn successfully completed a 360\u00b0 turn. Plus, it\u2019s been eight years of putting his talent to the good use of others (Frank Ocean, Philippe Katerine, Charlotte Gainsbourg) to help him get to where he wants to be today. From European electro to American R&B via classic pop, Thirst sets ablaze all genres. His taste for explosive mechanisms (like his well-known \u201cturbine\u201d techno sub-genre label-mates at Ed Banger) made Total an elegantly revolutionary debut album that captivatingly took things to the extreme, while being as frightening as a ticking bomb. But now, the wait is over. Thirst bursts forward providing an amazing opening to brand new worlds. This 14-track adventure narrates the journey of how he mastered machines, his own demons and even several time zones.\n\n\u201cThe general approach to this record corresponds to the time when Frank Ocean called me in Paris, telling me I had to be in Los Angeles the next day to work alongside him,\u201d reveals SebastiAn. \u201cAt the same time, I\u2019d met Charlotte Gainsbourg to produce her latest album. So I found myself working with these two opposing personalities: on one side you\u2019ve got Frank Ocean, who\u2019s ultra charismatic and fanciful, while on the other, Charlotte Gainsbourg is both an introvert yet so openly real. When Charlotte moved to New York, Frank landed in London, and so the work process suddenly switched. I found this really interesting. My record came about from all the encounters I made going between these two projects.\u201d The energy from such contrasts brought this project to life, provoking SebastiAn to call upon an impressive list of artists to feature on Thirst (Syd from The Internet, Mayer Hawthorne, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Allan Kingdom, Sevdaliza, Cautious Clay, Sunni Col\u00f2n, Sparks, Gallant and Loota). \u201cFrom Ed Banger to Jean-Louis Costes and Katerine, or Frank Ocean to Charlotte Gainsbourg, my music has always looked to build bridges,\u201d outlines the self-confessed fan of DJ Premier, Giorgio Moroder and Suicide, who\u2019s managed to bring different styles together as one on this record. From this head-on collision between cold European techno and the warm tones of R&B, hip-hop and American gospel comes a series of explosions which progressively topple towards unchartered territories. With a certain Slavic melancholy that\u2019s an homage to his roots, SebastiAn makes the single Beograd evolve from metronomic dirty disco to a melody of cinematographic stature worthy of De Roubaix, entangled in a Chopin-esque lamenting sonata. The art of SebastiAn is certainly the art of suspense. He\u2019s like a tightrope walker, juggling a balancing act from the intimate to the epic (just take Run For Me which is a tour de force), and from minimalism to baroque to create a mystical form of electronic music. Thirst has such a contemporary edge to it, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s not aiming for a total collision between music\u2019s major current trends (electro and R&B), but in fact he\u2019s looking to rearrange the rules, settling alight the history of pop (The Beach Boys-eque Better Now) and rock (Handcuffed To A Parking Meter reaching dizzying heights with his idols Sparks), and a certain classicism in a recurring dialogue between strings, piano and knob-twiddling machines.\n\nIn 2011, for the cover work for Total, Jean-Baptiste Mondino captured SebastiAn as a modern-day Narcissus, photographing the musician kissing his alter ego. Eight years later, the same photographer once again depicts the artist with his double, however this time the love affair has ended and it\u2019s fists up ready for a fight. To sum up this game of metaphors, Thirst is a beefed-up declaration of love - not of SebastiAn to himself, but to the world around him. Thirst leaves you thirsty for more.", "otherInfo": "Meditate with Stuart"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SK Shlomo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10359659.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Electronic, Beatbox", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "After collaborating with Ed Sheeran, Bjork and Damon Albarn, award winning singer-songwriter, beatboxer, producer & live looping technologist SK Shlomo's acclaimed debut solo album 'Surrender' is out now raising #MentalHealthAwareness: http://skshlomo.com/listen", "otherInfo": "This Thursday, and for the next 6 Thursdays at 2pm BST, I'm launching a weekly livestream called Homeskool Beatbox Adventures to help isolated families and raise funds for NHS Charities Together.\n\nWe're partnering with 80 music venues to simulcast the livestream to thousands of homes worldwide, with weekly special guests including Basement Jaxx, Bastille, Bill Bailey, Jason Mraz, KT Tunstall and Radio 1\u2019s Dr Radha helping me to raise a target of \u00a32500 to help frontline staff, patients and families affected by COVID19.\n\nThe show will be livestreamed on our brand new beatboxadventures.com website, on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nAnd you can be part of the show!\n\nEach week I am inviting a virtual studio audience of up to 50 lucky families to join me in our digital theatre - also known as the \u2018Zoom Room\u2019.

But not every artist gets asked by their heroes to join\nthem, as artists, on their stage. It's a compliment that Jacob Moon keeps getting from the\nmusicians who have inspired him since he started as a singer-songwriter out in Hamilton,\nOntario. Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "A different theme every day!

Their styles clearly complemented one another, which made for magic on stage and in the recording studio. Their eponymous vinyl EP release was named one of the \u201c10 Essential Albums of 2013\u201d by No Depression.\n\nAlthough she\u2019s a singer and songwriter first, Amy is also an actress.

He has his black-belt in voice and bottleneck guitar and his banjo playing scares the crap out of me.\u201d\n\u2013 David Lindley, musical adventurer\n\nVery few musicians of any stripe so personify a musical genre as completely as Tony Furtado embodies Americana roots music. Tony is an evocative and soulful singer, a wide-ranging songwriter and a virtuoso multi-instrumentalist adept on banjo, cello-banjo, slide guitar and baritone ukulele who mixes and matches sounds and styles with the flair of a master chef (he\u2019s also an accomplished sculptor, but that\u2019s another story). All of the music of America is in Tony\u2019s music. Relix hit the nail on the head when writing of Tony: \u201cTrue talent doesn\u2019t need categories.\u201d\n\nA native of Pleasanton, California, who now makes his home in Portland, Oregon, Tony Furtado took up the banjo at age 12, inspired by the Beverly Hillbillies TV show and a sixth grade music report. He first attracted national attention in 1987, when he won the National Bluegrass Banjo Championship in Winfield, Kansas. Not long after that, Tony opted for the life of a full-time professional musician, joining Laurie Lewis & Grant Street. A second victory at Winfield, in 1991, bookended his years with Grant Street.\n\nIn 1990, Tony signed a recording deal with Rounder Records, one of the country\u2019s preeminent independent record companies. Beginning with Swamped in 1990, he recorded six critically acclaimed albums for the label, collaborating with such master musicians as Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Tim O\u2019Brien, Stuart Duncan, Kelly Joe Phelps and Mike Marshall. During this period, Tony also performed and recorded with the band Sugarbeat and the Rounder Banjo Extravaganza with Tony Trischka and Tom Adams.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s\u2014influenced by such musical heroes as Ry Cooder, David Lindley and Taj Mahal\u2014Tony added slide guitar, singing and songwriting to his musical toolbox and began leading his own band. He is a tireless road musician who performs in a dizzying variety of formats: solo, in a duo or trio or with his full five-person band. He especially values the opportunities he has had to tour with such legendary musicians as Gregg Allman and with such esteemed slide guitarists as David Lindley, Derek Trucks and Sonny Landreth.\n\nTony has performed throughout the world at top venues and appeared at such prestigious music festivals as the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Jazz Aspen, Kerrville Folk Festival, Strawberry Music Festival, Winnipeg Folk Festival, Sisters Folk Festival, San Jose Jazz Festival and countless others. \u201cI love playing live,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my energy is focused on the love of playing music and rolling with the moment. It\u2019s a give and take from the audience to the stage, and back. And the music that is created is something that otherwise might not occur without that flow.\u201d\n\nTony has recorded and produced almost a dozen CDs for various labels such as Dualtone, What Are Records and Funzalo Records. Tony enthusiastically describes his newest CD, The Bell, as \u201cthe most personal of my career.\u201d To be released this summer on his own YousayFurtado Records, The Bell is an important release for several reasons: it represents a return to Tony\u2019s banjo-playing roots, with the banjo and cello-banjo more prominent than in recent years; the original songs concern such weighty themes as the loss of his father, the birth of his son and his own creative rebirth with the move to a new record label and management team; his working band is featured; and, most important of all, this is the first album in a long time on which Tony had complete artistic control.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dash Berlin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10377967.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Music", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Top 25' Dash Berlin including the new singles 'Home' and 'Love Out Loud'!

Barely two weeks have passed since he wrapped up a support tour for Pearl Jam front man Eddie Vedder, and more than five years have gone by since there was a month when he wasn\u2019t on stage. Not to mention the albums: Rhythm and Repose (2012), the Grammy-nominated Didn\u2019t He Ramble (2015), and a soon to be released Between Two Shores (2018); a bevy of EPs; and to top it off, a five week \u201cCamino by sea\u201d in a traditional Irish naomho\u0301g, a journey which was captured on film and released as the full-length The Camino Voyage (2018).\n\nHe has earned both his exhaustion and now his respite: a month in one place. Taking a residency at the Centre Culturel Irlandais, Hansard has come to France to put shape to a new album. The intention is to create \u201can acoustic record with sparse accompaniment\u201d in concert with long-time friends and collaborators Joe Doyle (bass), ROMY (piano, string arrangements, and vocals), and Javier Mas (Spanish guitar, lau\u0301d).\n\nParis, however, has other plans. One night at dinner, friend, author, and classical singer Judith Mok introduces Hansard to the Khoshravesh brothers, who studied classical and traditional music in their native Iran before relocating to Paris. The simple meal quickly turns into a session. Hansard recalls working through one song particularly. \u201cThe Khoshravesh brothers joined me and I was transported. The song took on a new depth: I heard it differently, and new possibilities emerged. The ease by which they followed their own melodic line while being sympathetic to mine was intoxicating.\u201d By the end of the night, the brothers agreed to join Hansard in Black Box studios, where he will be working with producer David Odlum, and what was to be a straightforward album begins to take an interesting turn.\n\nThe roster of musicians quickly increases. Along with Joe Doyle, Romy, and the Khoshravesh brothers, Hansard invites Dublin electronic musicians Dunk Murphy (Sunken Foal) and Deasy to participate in the sessions, eager to see what might spark from the diverse range of musical traditions. Each day is unwritten, defined by an openness, a willingness to follow the spirit of the moment wherever it may lead. \u201cWhen you surround yourself with great musicians and do your best to keep up, stay loose, give little direction, and allow everyone to bring what they bring, something transformative may happen,\u201d Hansard says.\n\nOver the next few months, more musicians cycle in: Graham Hopkins and Earl Harvin (drums, percussion), Michael Buckley (saxophone, horns and flute), Breannda\u0301n O\u0301 Beaglaoich (accordion), Rosie McKenzie (violin), Aida Shahghasemi (Iranian singer and daf player), Eamon O\u2019Leary (banjo, bouzouki, and mandolin), Anna Roberts-Gevalt, (fiddle), Bri\u0301an Mac Gloinn (Ye Vagabonds, fiddle), Marke\u0301ta Irglova\u0301 (vocals), and Rob Moose (strings arrangements). They work with no agenda, no preconceived notion of what the sessions will turn into. But by April, it\u2019s clear that an album has emerged from this group exercise. \u201cSometimes,\u201d says Hansard, \u201cwhen you take a small musical fragment and you care for it, follow it and build it up slowly, it can become a thing of wonder.\u201d\n\nThe resulting album, This Wild Willing (April 12, ANTI- Records), is indeed a collection of wondrous things.\nThose who have followed Hansard\u2019s career since his Academy Award winning turn in the film Once will have witnessed one artistic arc: the journey of a Dublin busker who cut his teeth on the greats - Dylan, Van Morrison, Leonard Cohen \u2013 and followed the path of the troubadour, the singer-songwriter to great effect.\n\nBut there is another thread running through Glen Hansard\u2019s musicianship. In his decades as lead singer of Irish stalwarts The Frames, rock and folk ambitions coexist with moments of strangeness, intimacy, and stillness: love songs drowning in the last fevers of the Spanish Flu (\u201cSanta Maria\u201d), protagonists who ponder throwing it all away and disappearing in a fugue state (\u201cKeepsake\u201d). And above all, the band, veering from silence to cacophony, ready to underpin soaring emotional and dynamic shifts.\nThis Wild Willing marks an inflection point in his career, a turning where he marries the sonic inventiveness of the best of his work in The Frames to the discipline he\u2019s found as a lyricist in his solo career.\n\nIt is an album guided and formed by the twin totems of resolve and surrender \u2013 the resolve to see a thing through alongside a willingness to surrender, to trust in that which lies outside yourself \u2013 the other musicians in the room, your lover, your healer, your audience.\n\nLead track \u201cI\u2019ll Be You Be Me\u201d finds Hansard weighing the risks of such vulnerability, of the giving of oneself to another. His restrained vocal belies the fury of the underlying instrumental\u2019s building storm. \u201cI\u2019ll be you, be me and I\u2019ll be you/I\u2019ll take your truth, your lies, your secrets,\u201d he sings, negotiating the consuming potential of desire. There is danger here, but it is without rancor or ill-will \u2013 the danger of a hare with its belly exposed. There is also a duality in the invitation: the audience is drawn in just as surely as the song\u2019s object, to the immersive world conjured by the album.\n\nA sense of unease lingers in the mysterious \u201cClosing Door\u201d and \u201cRace to the Bottom.\u201d The latter serves as a sort of diary of Hansard\u2019s residency in Paris, finding him \u201ccoughing my lungs up on the Rue des Irlandais/becoming a risk to myself\u201d an \u201c\u2019X\u2019 on my back\u201d as he wanders the city. Hansard insists, \u201cIt\u2019s more about the decline of a person or persons rather than of human kind,\u201d and yet it is hard to escape the sense that a collective worry is being tapped into, with the desecration of Joan of Arc in one memorable line echoing the more recent destruction of the statue of Marianne \u2013 that other great symbol of France \u2013 in the unrest that beset the country in the winter of 2018. It is lyric as prognostication, somehow in tune with coming shockwaves.\n\nIt isn\u2019t all darkness, however. \u201cDon\u2019t Settle,\u201d one of the few tracks not recorded in France, retains the raw energy of the various tour sound checks which brought it to life. It offers not warning, but guidance, as it considers paths of original artistic voices -\nShane McGowan, Lisa O\u2019Neill, Woody Guthrie, and James Baldwin to name a few \u2013 and implores younger artists to stay the course. It finds its conclusion on the record\u2019s penultimate track, \u201cGood Life of Song,\u201d summing up the possibility inherent in the bardic path. For Hansard \u201cthere\u2019s joy and sorrow for me in this recording, where they meet is a hallowed spot.\u201d Alongside these is a trio of songs: \u201cBrother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d \u201cMary,\u201d\n\nand, \u201cThreading Water,\u201d each of which is presented so openly that it is easy forget that they are exploring private, intimate territory rarely seen in Hansard\u2019s lyrics. Here is Hansard at home in Ireland, rambling through October, preparing for winter. Here is a declaration of love, a poem put to song. Here is simple gratitude for a good life.\n\nThe album ends with the deceptively simple, \u201cLeave a Light...\u201d Lingering in the melody is the memory of a journey undertaken with friends, those living and those who have sailed on. And in the lyric is a path out, from disorder and discord, into the place where surrender and resolve meet. \u201cSo, say goodbye to the long, cold winter,\u201d Hansard sings, \u201cAnd farewell to all we\u2019ve left behind. Leave a light on and come out of the shadows. You\u2019re the one I\u2019ll come back to find.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Broadcasting from the National Library of Ireland - Watch on Other Voices YouTube, Facebook & Twitter, broadcast worldwide!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Will Sexton ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Adam Brown ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6337284.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Tyler, Texas", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "www.adamthomasbrown.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Charli XCX ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8363770.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Experimental, Pop, Other", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gary Lucas ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8516552.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Various", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Guitarist extraordinaire, Grammy-nominated songwriter and composer with over 30 acclaimed genre-defying albums", "otherInfo": "Gary is streaming live solo acoustic concerts on Facebook every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday @ 3pm!!\n\nIn this time of no gigs if you like what you hear, please share your appreciation!

Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Surrender Hill ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bowling for Soup ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10386711.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Pop Punk", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bowling for Soup (acronym: BFS, or sometimes B4S) is an alternative, comedy band based in Denton, Texas (but originally from Wichita Falls, Texas) formed in 1994 from the ruins of an old metal band.

A student of house music, Williams has accomplished a full sweep of merited recognition that has accelerated over the last five years.\nEmerging onto the house scene in 2010, T.Williams instantly marked himself as a breakthrough artist with a difference; his unique take on house music has been fruitful has in turn, rewarded him with a loyal allegiance of supporters. Whilst he may appear new to the house scene, Tesfa Williams is far from a newcomer to music with almost twenty years of experience behind him having cut his teeth in the grime scene as Dread.D.\n\nSigned at the tender age of 17 to Jon E Cash\u2019s Black Op\u2019s with \u2018Invasion\u2019, Williams went on to have mass success in the grime and bass world, selling thousands of singles worldwide. After a five year reign in the realm of grime, Williams found himself veering towards the world of house music.\n\nIn 2010 a number of zeitgeist releases from Williams proved too good to ignore, one such release was hit record \u2018Heartbeat\u2019 featuring vocalist Terri Walker. The track played extensively worldwide before settling in at no.2 as iTunes best dance track of the year. In 2011 T.Williams defined himself further by releasing solo works on his own Deep Teknologi imprint, Local Action and Pattern.\n\nWilliams\u2019 remixes for Maya Jane Coles, Charli XCX, Ben Westbeech and Skream were also received with high regard. The end of 2011 saw T.Williams receive a number of accolades and cemented his ability to carve out a career as a serious taste maker. He was nominated as \u2018Best Breakthrough DJ\u2019 by DJ Mag, named as one of the \u2018DJ Stars of 2012\u2019 by Time Out and picked by The Guardian for his Fact Magazine mix as one of their favourites of the year.\n\nIn 2012, two relationships came to the fore and propelled Williams to even greater heights. The first was his weekly show on the legendary London radio station, Rinse FM, a show that featured the likes of Jessie Ware, Soul Clap, MK, Dusky and Duke Dumont as guests; culminating in T mixing Rinse 21, one of the most vital of the renowned mix series to date.\n\nWith all of these accolades behind him T.Williams signed to PMR records in 2013 alongside the likes of Julio Bashmore & Disclosure. He gained a spot on the prestigious Radio 1 \u201cResidency\u201d which facilitated a number of bookings and performances at multiple clubs and festivals around the world, by the end of 2014 Williams had performed over 100 shows across 4 different continents. Having accumulated a global perspective from touring the world, the aficionado started a new Label \"Today,Tomorrow Records\u201d with the focus on releasing music from the pool of talented people he had made connections with over the years.\n\nThis lead to a massive collaboration with UK garage legend MJ Cole in 2015, on the labels first EP \u201cAcoustic Treatment\u201d which gained huge support from Radio 1\u2019s Danny Howard. This seal of approval saw Tesfa play at London's world renowned Fabric, in room 1 alongside Groove Armada and Moxie. He also completed a number of successful headline tours to showcase the EP, which saw him return to Australia, Asia and North America, much to the delight of his die hard following.\n\nSigning and releasing a fresh EP on New York's long standing classic House label \u201cStrictly Rhythm\u201d and hitting the No.2 spot on Radio 1\u2019s dance chart with collab \"Do You\u201d saw T.Williams picked by Traxsource as 1 of their \u201c10 Artist To Watch\u201d in 2016.\n\n2017 looks ever brighter for the West Londoner as he starts work on Vol.3 of his \"Sodality\u201d Series whilst collaborating with Julio Bashmore and James Jacob, all the while further expanding his global touring schedule.", "otherInfo": "T.Williams digging in the crates and playing an all vinyl live stream set!!

But it was in the sweaty climes of the Lock Up Stage at Reading and Leeds 2008 that his solo career really started to take off. Inside the packed out tents, heaving with adoring fans and intrigued passers-by, Frank led the congregation in a mass sing-a-long; a stirring set that not only sparked the interest of the British mainstream but resonated unassumingly across the pond as a wealth of American punk bands watched approvingly from the sidelines.\n\nNo stranger to the festival, Frank had not only played the Lock Up Tent with former hardcore band Million Dead back in 2005 but also as a tentative solo artist in 2007 when debut album \u2018Sleep Is For The Week\u2019 was just an underground success. Within the following year, Frank\u2019s popularity grew with yet more touring and the release of second album 'Love Ire & Song' in March 08. He started to play larger headline shows and develop the live band that he was looking for.\n\nThe profits of all his hard work came together that festival weekend; it kicked started a new wave of interest and thanks to the unwavering support from Radio 1 DJs Mike Davies and Steve Lamacq, the rest of Radio 1 began to follow suit. Soon enough when Frank\u2019s single 'Long Live The Queen' \u2013 taken from \u2018Love Ire & Song' \u2013 was released in October, it made the R1 C-list, was Single Of The Week on Sara Cox\u2019s show and helped sell out Frank\u2019s largest UK headline tour culminating in a bursting-over-capacity-finale at London\u2019s Scala. The following single 'Reasons Not To Be An Idiot' released in January of this year eclipsed those successes by graduating to the R1\u2019s B-list, 6Music\u2019s A-list and XFM\u2019s daytime playlist, prompted a Live Lounge session for Sara Cox, a Hub Session for George Lamb as well as making iTunes Single Of The Week all helping to recruit a new army of Frank followers.\n\nIt was also during this time that sections of the US punk fraternity began to take notice. Having watched the infamous Lock Up Stage set at Reading and Leeds, Vinnie from Less Than Jake got in contact asking to release 'The First Three Years' album (a collection of all early and previously unreleased material, live tracks and b-sides released in the UK in December 08 on his vinyl label Paper and Plastick. Chuck Ragan took him on the Revival Tour with Tim Barry across America, he did a few shows with up and coming stars Fake Problems and New Jersey boys The Gaslight Anthem invited him to support them on their huge UK and European dates in the early part of this year. It was evident that word was spreading throughout the punk scenes both sides of the Atlantic and by the time Frank flew in to Austin, Texas for the annual industry showcase SXSW in March, a whole new chapter in his story was about to begin.\n\nFrank\u2019s brand of folk songwriting, catchy melodies and punk passion had reached the ears of the CEO of US independent label Epitaph Records, Bad Religion\u2019s legendary guitarist: Brett Gurewitz. Excited by what he had heard and seen when Frank headlined LA\u2019s notorious Viper Rooms in March, Gurewitz got in contact and soon enough plans were formulated and a worldwide deal was inked. With loyalty and integrity firmly intact, Frank kept his relationship with his existing label Xtra Mile Recordings for all releases in the UK and Ireland and so the two labels will work closely for what will undoubtedly be an exciting new era in Frank\u2019s ever evolving career.\n\n\u201cFrank Turner\u2019s music is a revelation to me,\u201d says Gurewitz. \u201cI can\u2019t stop listening to it. It\u2019s a real privilege to get out there and help Xtra Mile spread the Frank Turner gospel.\u201d\n\nEpitaph is the perfect home for Frank. With its fiercely independent spirit, rich in punk and hardcore history it is also home to the song-writing talents of Nick Cave and Tom Waits on sister label Anti; mirroring Frank\u2019s cross-over appeal of punk ethics and strong song-writing abilities. Inspired by the likes of Bad Religion as a kid, this really is a dream come true for Frank.\n\nSo with this exciting plot in place the year ahead is looking pretty good. His third studio album, \u2018Poetry Of The Deed\u2019, released worldwide in September, sees Frank venture in a more rock direction recruiting his outstanding band for the recording process. Performing live has always been at the very heart of the Frank Turner experience and whilst he\u2019s still writing all the songs, they will be recorded live to help bring that experience to the album. Grammy nominated producer Alex Newport \u2013 who has previously worked with Death Cab For Cutie, At The Drive-In, Two Gallants \u2013 is on production duties after contacting Frank directly asking if they could work together. Coinciding nicely with the release are tours in America and Europe as well as the massive UK headline tour in October, where having previously supported The Gaslight Anthem at London\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, he will return triumphantly to headline for the last night of the tour.\n\nBefore that though, another summer of further touring and festivals lies ahead. He will jet off to the East Coast of America to support The Offspring for 12 dates of their tour in July, performing solo to potentially 30,000 people. He\u2019ll play at Camp Bestival and Jersey Live fest and return full circle to this year\u2019s Reading and Leeds Festival. This time, however, he will play the larger Radio 1/NME tent midway through the afternoon and judging by what happened last year it\u2019ll be another defining moment in this story of one beardy man and his acoustic guitar.

Shorr was born and raised in Portland, Maine on July 11, 1994, where she was the youngest of seven children born to a single mother. Shorr soaked up a rich variety of influences from her siblings, and at the age of six, she began writing songs. At 13, Shorr learned to play guitar and gained experience playing in a rock band in Portland, singing Pink Floyd and Nirvana covers in a friend\u2019s basement. While she loved rock and pop, Shorr was certain that her future lay in country music after hearing Johnny Cash's cover of \"Hurt, originally by Nine Inch Nails. Determined to make her mark, Shorr took extra classes so she could graduate from high school early, and then held down two jobs at once so she could raise the money to move to Nashville.\n\nBy the time she was 19, Shorr had settled in Music City, and she landed a job at a hot dog stand while she searched for an audience to hear her songs. Things began looking up for Shorr when she became part of a weekly songwriter\u2019s showcase called Song Suffragettes that highlights the work of talented female singer/songwriters in Nashville. Song Suffragettes helped raise Shorr\u2019s profile which resulted in her first publishing deal, solidifying her dream of becoming a professional musician in Nashville.\n\nWith two of her fellow Suffragettes, Hailey Steele and Lena Stone, Shorr wrote a song about resilience titled \u201cFight Like A Girl\u201d and released it as an independent digital single in January 2016. The tune quickly won positive press and airplay on digital radio and social media sources with SiriusXM\u2019s The Highway channel naming Shorr a \u201cHighway Find\u201d and CMT making her part of their \u201cArtist Discovery\u201d program. With that momentum, she released The Y2K Mixtape, an eight-song collection of some of Shorr\u2019s earliest music that led to her becoming 2016\u2019s second best-selling debut female in all of country music (behind only Grammy-winner Maren Morris).\n\nAirplay of a second single, \u201cHe\u2019s Just Not That Into You\u201d, led into 2017 where Shorr and her next EP, Slingshot, received a barrage of critical acclaim from Rolling Stone Country (\u201cArtist You Need To Know\u201d), Taste of Country (\u201c2017\u2019s Hottest Artists Under 25\u201d), Sounds Like Nashville, Morning Hangover, Country Music Chat, Whiskey Riff and CMT. Teen Vogue came calling and in May 2017, the publication named Shorr one of \u201c10 Female Artists Who Are Changing the Music Game\u201d. She was the only country artist featured in their annual music issue which specifically dubbed Shorr \u201cThe New Nashville\u201d. Later that year, Kalie was named to the CMT Next Women of Country Class of 2018, a prestigious list that recognizes the newest and brightest female artists in country music.\n\nCreatively, Shorr spent most of 2017 writing songs and working on a new sound that infuses her country core with many of the rock influences she grew up on. Producer and songwriter Skip Black (Jana Kramer, Theory of a Deadman) helped her finally find the common thread that connects the big guitars of rock music to the story-telling and passion for lyric that cements her in country. It was a deep dive into song craftsmanship and sonic production that yielded her first 2018 single, \u201cTwo Hands\u201d, featured on Shorr\u2019s newest EP Awake.\n\nAmidst critical acclaim for her punk-country sound on Awake, Kalie was named one of the \u201cTop 10 Country Artists To Watch In 2018\u201d by the Huffington Post just as \u201cTwo Hands\u201d was added to prominent playlists at SiriusXM The Highway, Radio Disney Country, TuneIn's Country Roads, Pandora, Amazon Music and Apple Music. The \u201cTwo Hands\u201d music video was also added to CMT, GAC and to Vevo's DSCVR Country playlist.\n\nIn January 2018 after being inspired by speeches at the Golden Globe Awards, Kalie co-wrote a song called \u201cTimes-Up\u201d that went on to be recorded by 23 women of Song Suffragettes with an accompanying music video that received major press coverage from the Associated Press, Boston Globe, Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle, Voice of America and many more including a feature on Grammy.com.\n\nShorr recently wrapped the CMT Next Women of Country Tour with country superstars Sara Evans and RaeLynn and will continue extensive touring throughout the summer.\n\nIn May, Shorr was the only independent artist named to Taste of Country\u2019s \u201c2018 Hottest Artists Under 25\u201d list just as her brand new single \u201cCandy\u201d hit radio airwaves and streaming playlists.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cortezzz ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9822132.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Union City, New Jersey", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "In the early stages of his development, Michael had no knowledge of music.

Songwriters Sima Cunnningham and Macie Stewart formed their unbreakable bond performing throughout the fringes of Chicago's many interlocking communities, collaborating with titans from the city's indie rock, hip-hop, and improvised worlds. But together, along with drummer Matt Carroll, they've stretched the boundaries of what guitar music can do starting with the band's experimental 2016 self-titled EP and their adventurous debut 2018 LP Parts. Now their longstanding partnership culminates with the stunning and muscular follow-up Fantasize Your Ghost.\n\nOhmme formed in 2014 as an outlet for Cunningham and Stewart to explore an unconventional approach to their instruments. \"That's the whole genesis of the band: us walking up to our guitars and saying, 'how can we make this noisemaker do something different?'\" says Cunningham. But as their musical collaboration strengthened, bringing Parts and intensive tours with acts like Wilco, Iron & Wine, Twin Peaks, and more, the band's scope and focus has also broadened. Fantasize Your Ghost is the direct result of the band spending more time on the road than in Chicago, a record deeply concerned with questions of the self, the future, and what home means when you're travelling all the time.\n\n\"Grinding on tour last year for so long, it can alter your mental state where you have to think about your life in a different way than you would if you're home. A lot of the songs stemmed from just thinking about all of the possibilities that life could be and could take,\" says Stewart. On the commanding single \"3 2 4 3,\" which tackles the terrifying realization of needing to make a change. The song opens with the two singing in transfixing harmony, \"Looked in the mirror the other day / Caught my reflection / My mouth had moved a different way / The muscles were straining.\" Their deft scene-setting and the way their disparate voices blend together heightens the song's inherent anxiety. Later, they sing, \"Filling the holes to make amends / Tearing them up to start again.\" These moments of emotional clarity fill Fantasize Your Ghost.\n\nWritten across 2019, early sketches of the album's tracklist were demoed at Sam Evian's Flying Cloud Studios in upstate New York. \"That's where we really started to see the record come together,\" says Cunningham. The sessions were intensely collaborative and open: the product of long, existential conversations between Stewart and Cunningham in the van about their lives and how to channel the anger they were feeling about the state of the world. Tracks like the driving opener \"Flood Your Gut\" underwent several revisions with Ohmme uncovering several new directions the song could go before finishing it. The refrain \"your whole vision's not enough\" is a call to action, says Cunningham. \"Do you want to be someone who can disconnect or someone who is hyper-engaged and present?\"\n\nFantasize Your Ghost was recorded over a six day session in August 2019 when the band decamped to the Post Farm in southern Wisconsin, where Cunningham runs a yearly DIY music festival. With indie rock journeyman producer Chris Cohen and the idyllic setting just outside Chicago, the songs came to vibrant life. Though Parts showcased their wildly burgeoning influences and talents, Fantasize Your Ghost captures the astounding magnetism and ferocity of their live show. \"Selling Candy\" is the perfect example. It's a small snapshot of childhood complete with nostalgic references to summertime hot dogs and wandering the city but set to an explosive, stadium-ready fuzzed-out arrangement. Elsewhere, songs like the dystopian dance rocker \"The Limit\" further stretch their already dynamic palette.\n\nFantasize Your Ghost encapsulates the thrilling and sometimes terrifying joy of moving forward even if you don't know where you're going. It's an album that asks necessary questions: When life demands a crossroads, what version of yourself are you going to pursue? What part of yourself will you feed and let flourish and what do you have to let go of? When they sing, \"Just walk out the door and / Don\u2019t tell them goodbye\" it's drastic but also exhilaratingly hopeful. This is a record of strength, of best friends believing in each other. Unapologetic and brave, Ohmme are ready to figure it all out together.", "otherInfo": "Ohmme live on Dr Martens Instagram - Stay In Series #drmartenspresents\n\n5/21 at 2pm PST/4pm CT"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Arielle Silver ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10247758.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Americana, Indie Folk, Alt-country", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Arielle Silver crafts songs that are luminous, literate, and alive. A Thousand Tiny Torches, the singer-songwriter\u2019s new Indie Folk Americana collection, is a testament to her renewal of inspiration, the rekindling of dreams, and the redemptive power and connective compassion that defines her artistry.\n\nHer rich, expressive alto voice frames expansive melodies that echo the American heartland. Now based in Los Angeles, Arielle knows this geography well. A performing itinerary transported her from Club Passim in her adopted hometown of Boston to venues including Eddie\u2019s Attic in Atlanta and Nashville\u2019s 12th & Porter, plus stops to the Southwest, as she steered a vegetable oil-fueled vehicle across Texas to Abilene, Odessa and Austin.\n\nTen years ago, with three well-received releases accompanied by national tours, she lost sight of her future as an artist. \u201cThough my heart still ached to write songs and sing, I found that I couldn't do it anymore,\u201d she recalls.\n\nArielle moved to the City of the Angels. She divorced and remarried, taught yoga philosophy, and worked behind the scenes in the music industry. She penned and published essays and poems, and was nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best New Poets. She baked innumerable pies. After being rejected for a PhD program, she constructed a blue \u201cshe shed\u201d in her backyard. And it was in this rustic space \u2013 surrounded by 47 volumes of her journals \u2013 that she rekindled her love for music and dedicated herself to writing one song per week.\n\nThe result is A Thousand Tiny Torches. Produced by Shane Alexander, the project is propelled by the masterful playing of a sterling cast of players with credits from Lady Gaga to KT Tunstall to Lukas Nelson: Denny Weston Jr., drums; Carl Byron, keyboards; Darby Orr, bass; Jesse Siebenberg, steel guitar; and Mike Mullins on mandolin. Michael Gehring tracked the project at Secret World Studios in Los Angeles in the famous Sound City Studios complex, and GRAMMY-winners Brian Yaskulka and Hans DeKline mixed and mastered, respectively. A loyal group of supporters funded the recording through a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nA consummate storyteller, Arielle\u2019s narratives crosscut exacting details with universal themes. On the lead single \u201cWhat Really Matters,\u201d she recalls a harrowing season in Southern California as gunshots ricocheted through a country bar and the surrounding hills ignited with apocalyptic wildfires.\n\nIn contrast are incandescent songs with characters and conversations etched in fine lines and deep empathy. Vivid imagery glows with headlights, porch lights, lighthouses, bolts of lightning, fireflies, and stars that have been shining for ten billion years.\n\nAfter launching her return with a holiday single, Arielle is now back onstage at house concerts and listening rooms, including the fabled Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Hollywood. Plans are underway for West Coast tours and upcoming dates in Boston. This time, she says, she is doing it for the right reasons. \u201cWhen I was younger I was performing,\u201d she confirms. \u201cNow, I\u2019m connecting.\"\n\nArielle Silver says that when she made her break with music, her ambition for everything stopped. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see the future. It was beautiful. I became so present in a way I never had been before, and the sense of being present lasted for a long time.\u201d Now, in themes that speak to losing and rediscovering the path, emerges a musical alchemy of renewal and rebirth: A loving light that is reflected from A Thousand Tiny Torches.", "otherInfo": "Tomes & Tunes is a weekly Instagram series, hosted by Arielle Silver, where songwriters talk books and swap songs.\n\nEpisode 4 features guest songwriter, Crissie McCree.\n\nFollow \"Arielle Silver\" on Instagram (@ariellesilver) to watch episode #4.\n\nCatch previous episodes on @ariellesilver IGTV."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Luisana Lopilato ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Daily Livestream"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "T.

The way their voices blend together in song conjures an imagined romance, much like their own. Before they met, Benjamin and Mia worked hard at their craft but each felt separately, something was missing. Their first songwriting session together, in 2004, led to the discovery that what they were missing was each other. Fast forward to today, they have now released five studio albums, one live album, were named semi-finalists at the 2018 International Songwriting Competition, and were nominated at the 2018 International Acoustic Music Awards.\n\nTheir most recent project, \u201cLive at Home\u201d was recorded in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, at a house concert in Azalea\u2019s living room. The recording captures the acoustic heart and soul of six songs from their 2017 studio release, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, two new original songs, and a cover of \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d, from the motion picture \u201cOnce\u201d. Tickets were sold as a crowdfunding perk to help raise funds to record the aforementioned studio release.\n\n\u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was released on October 13, 2017 and was supported by a multi-province 2 week tour. Written and recorded in their home studio, this project features love songs, beautiful vocal harmony and showcases Benjamin & Mia\u2019s musical abilities. The album sits comfortably in the \u201cContemporary Roots\u201d genre featuring songs that borrow from North American and Eastern European folk traditions, as well as conventional pop sensibilities.\n\n\u201cI See The Church\u201d from the album \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d, was nominated at the 2018 IAMA (International Acoustic Music Awards) in the \u201cBest Group/Duo\u201d category .\n\nHamilton Blues Lovers Blog has this to say about the album,\n\n\u201cHamilton musical duo, Azalea keeps growing with every recording and their latest, \u201cGypsy\u2019s Moonlight Motel\u201d proves it.

Their lush vocal harmonies flow through the entire album as the sometimes infectious and always beautiful melodies bolster the sound. It\u2019s a perfect mix of vocals and music that can\u2019t help but effect you emotionally\u2026\u201d\n\nIn May 2015 Azalea was hand picked by GigSalad & CD Baby to play their junket for Canadian Music Week in Toronto, Ontario. In honour of this occasion, Azalea recorded and released a limited edition EP called \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d. As a salute to GigSalad & CD Baby\u2019s DIY methodology, \u201cCanadian Music Week 2015\u201d was made completely in house with fabric bound hand packaging.\n\nIn 2013, Azalea released the EP \"Inside Out\". An album which streamlined their folk- tinged pop sound and showcased songs to tug at the heart strings with haunting melodic and harmonic lines. Reminiscent of The Civil Wars, and Fleetwood Mac \u201cInside Out\u201d shed light on Azalea\u2019s Alt-Country side. The pitch for its successful crowd- funding campaign gave some insight into their work:\n\n\". . . it has always been our goal to release quality music that is culturally relevant and speaks to the heart. . . . However, we wanted to take listeners on a journey beyond the routine of everyday life to the place that connects them with their emotions, beliefs, and values in a real way.\u201d\n\nIn late 2012 Azalea released \u201cAt the End of This Year...\u201d, their seasonal single which has received the nod of approval from CBC radio.\n\nAzalea\u2019s 2010 release, \u201cCoffee & Kisses EP\", was among the top three finalists for Recording of the Year, Rock Recording of the Year, Instrumentalist of the Year, and Producer of the Year at the 2010 Durham Region Music Awards. The album was featured in prominent music magazines and generated good response from college radio across Ontario.\n\nYears before anyone knew Benjamin & Mia Hackett as Azalea, they performed, travelled, and recorded an album as Benjamin & Mia. \u201cThe Carousel of Life\u201d (2007) is the root of their love for each other and for their musical life together.

Born on October 25, 1984, in Santa Barbara, CA, Perry grew up in a Christian household as the daughter of two pastors. Though she was not allowed to listen to secular music as a child, Perry later found herself captivated by Alanis Morissette and Freddie Mercury, having discovered Queen's music during a slumber party. Religious music remained at the forefront, however, and Perry released a self-titled Christian album in 2001 under the name Katy Hudson. She would later abandon the genre in favor of a pop career. At age 17, the burgeoning songwriter began working with hitmaker Glen Ballard, who had produced and co-written Alanis Morissette's chart-topping Jagged Little Pill in 1995. Several years later, she teamed up with the Matrix, a Grammy-nominated production/songwriting team whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included collaborations with Avril Lavigne, Shakira, and Korn. The Matrix had plans to record their own album, with Perry serving as one of the group's two singers. The project was ultimately shelved, but not before Perry appeared in a 2004 write-up by Blender magazine, who hailed her as \"The Next Big Thing!\" With the Matrix's unreleased album sitting in the vaults at Sony Records, Perry went back to the drawing board and ultimately signed with Columbia in 2007. Her debut single, \"UR So Gay,\" generated some online buzz with its mischievous lyrics and accompanying music video, and Perry's audience grew accordingly. In 2008 her debut album, One of the Boys, was released, and she helped promote it by joining the summer's Warped Tour and appearing in an episode of The Young and the Restless. ~ Andrew Leahey & Jason Birchmeier, All Music Guide", "otherInfo": "Special at-home performance"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "J.

After 12 years of playing as many as 300 shows each year, Rev. Peyton, the world\u2019s foremost country blues finger-style picker, along with the biggest little band in the country has pieced together one of the most dedicated followings out there. This following is sure to eat up the bands latest offering, Poor Until Payday, (the second on their own Family Owned Records label through hip Nashville indie Thirty Tigers) out October 5th, a country blues record that was made the right way \u2014 two feet on the ground and both hands getting dirty.\n\nWith all the power of a freight train, the Big Damn Band is known for its live shows. Rev. Peyton delivers guitar pyrotechnics the old fashioned way \u2014 ten fingers, a 6 string and an amp cranked at full tilt. In the country blues style, he plays the bass with his thumb, while picking the lead with his fingers at the same time. When he lifts the guitar behind his head to play there's nothing but skill and 16 gauge nickel strings to make the soundscoming out of the speakers.\n\nBeside him on stage are just two other people. His wife, \u201cWashboard\u201d Breezy Peyton playing with all the nuance and percussive power of a New Orleans drum line, and keeping the train moving is Max Senteney on a lean drum kit including a 5 gallon maple syrup bucket. Together they play Peyton's wildman country blues that's as much ZZ Top as it is Bukka White.\n\nOn Poor Until Payday Peyton wanted a sound as live and electric as the records made in the heyday of 45 rpm blues classics from Chess, Stax and Sun Records. Playing his\nbeloved custom-made National steel resonator, a 1949 Harmony Archtop, a 1954 Supro Dual Tone and a 1955 Kay Speed Demon through a 1949 Supro amp, Rev wanted to restore the \u201cwarmth, pops and hisses\u201d mostly eliminated by modern-day compression. The band played in a room together with minimal micing (using only the best classic pieces they could get) with the main effect being tape saturation.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThe result is an album that is direct, soulful and demands to be played loud.\n\nThe themes of songs like the title track, \u201cYou Can\u2019t Steal My Shine\u201d and \u201cI Suffer I Get Tougher\u201d offer the antidote to today\u2019s hard times by touting \u201cperseverance, inspiration and hope\u2026 being your authentic self despite everything lined against you, a light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d With a vocal style reflecting both the soulfulness and bite of his idols, Rev has added world-class singer to his already-renowned skills as a finger-pickin\u2019 guitar\nphenom. Breezy and Max also contribute background vocals to most of the songs, with \u201cThe Miss Elizabeth of Country Blues\u201d actually taking the spotlight with a sultry call-and- response showcase on \u201cDirty Swerve,\u201d in which she also contributed to the writing.\n\nPeyton's blues pedigree is well established. Woodshedding since he was 12, Peyton has kept alive a tradition of finger picking pioneered by the likes of Mississippi John Hurt. However, Peyton plays with the energy and attitude of a Howlin' Wolf. Indeed if it has strings he can play it whether that's a custom-built National, a cigarbox, an axe or even a shotgun (seriously, Google it.).\n\nHe's done his homework and been given the blessing of the gatekeepers of the tradition \u2014 even befriending and touring with some of the last of the great Delta Blues and Hill Country blues legends like David \u201cHoneyboy\u201d Edwards, T-Model Ford (whose grandson calls him Unk), and Robert Belfour.\n\nRev and Breezy make their home in rural southern Indiana near the adopted home of bluegrass legend Bill Monroe, among national parks and forests in what began as an artist\u2019s colony. \u201cMost of the people here can both paint a picture and skin a deer,\u201d laughs Breezy.\n\nTheres nothing dusty or sentimental about Peyton's music, though. Theres no songs about picking cotton. They aren't a museum piece. The Big Damn Band have taken nearly a century of blues songsmanship and crafted a thing all their own. There is not a single act out there that sounds like this.\n\nThe Big Damn Band make friends and fans every place they go \u2014 and there are few places they haven't been, having performed in 37 countries. After Poor Until Payday, the only people who won't be on the big damn bandwagon will be people who haven't heard or aren't paying attention.\n\nThis is real, from the heart, handmade music made by people, for people who don\u2019t have time for BS.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Oshima Brothers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10151929.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Pop, Indie Folk, Folk", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Oshima Brothers' magnetic sibling sound is the result of a lifetime of making music together.

Luna Guitars bestowed her with their Shining Star award in 2011, and 360 Magazine called her vocals \"seamless\" and her compositions \"effortless\".\n\nAlex continues to develop her unique solo repertoire, reveling in a vision that is still introspective and sensitive, yet equally strong, enigmatic and haunting. With her latest EP Black Roses, Alex has added an electric edge to her acoustic singer/songwriter persona, resulting in a more blunt sound akin to Evanescence and Grace Potter, with a touch of Heart. The new record has a distinctly rock feel that brings a new dimension to her heartfelt songs without alienating longtime fans of Alex's introspective compositions. Her stories of heartbreak, inner turmoil, and life's complications are now told from the perspective of a woman with more edge, a dreamer who has walked a few more miles down her own road.\n\nWhether performing solo, duo, or with a full band, Alex brings a fun yet sophisticated ambiance to her live performances. Her connection to her audience is very real and her stage presence natural and comfortable. You can expect that everyone in the room will feel like they are a close and personal friend by the end of the evening.\n\nAlex is releasing brand new music in 2019, starting with \"Silent Storm\" on August 23rd, followed by more single releases towards the end of 2019 and into 2020.

It's decided that we should respect each band and we should have separate groups for both bands.\n\n\nPopular French rock group Dolly got together in Nantes, a town in the west of France, in 1991. Their formation came about thanks to drummer Thierry Lacroix and singer Emmanuelle Monet - aka Manu - who shared a mutual passion for English and American music. The Anglophile duo teamed up with two musician friends - bass-player Mick Chamberlin and guitarist Nicolas Bonniere (who was just 15 at the time!) - and went on to make a name for themselves on the local music scene as Dolly and C\u00b0.\n\nDolly and C\u00b0's early influences might have been lifted from the best chapters of an English/American rock compendium - indeed, the group's sound was heavily influenced by the likes of Blondie, Prince, the Pixies and the Smashing Pumpkins. But lead singer Manu's greatest source of inspiration was the work of English indie diva PJ Harvey. The young French singer was fascinated by Harvey's deep, melancholy vocals and, after seeing PJ in concert, Manu decided to accompany her own singing on guitar. Performing extensively on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 soon began to build up an extensive repertoire (most of which was written by Manu). And before long the group attracted a massive following of fans.\n\nEncouraged by this early success on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 went into the studio to begin work on their d\u00e9but album. After producing a mini album (featuring six tracks), Dolly and C\u00b0 went on to produce their first full-length album themselves. (The album, entitled simply \"Dolly and C\u00b0, actually scored a considerable hit on the national music scene, selling over 85,000 copies).\n\nShortly after the release of their d\u00e9but album, the group underwent several major changes in their line-up, re-inventing themselves as Dolly. The new-look Dolly went on to sign a recording deal with the East West label and then returned to the studio to set to work on a new CD album.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nDolly (\u30c9\u30ea\u30a3, \uff24\uff4f\uff4c\uff4c\uff59) is an japanese rock band.\nThey started their activities in 2005.\n\nMember:\nVocals: Mitsu\nGuitar: Masa\nGuitar: Yuina (ex Luecie)\nBass : Hachi\nDrums : Takashi (ex Plastic Tree)\n\nThe release Ussetsu Drop had their first proper PV with more of a budget than the previous.\nNow they have just released the Red and White singles of the tricolore opera trilogy making a total of 3 pvs and 9 songs.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SAMIA ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8201231.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Alternative, Rock, Indie Pop, Folk, Indie", "Time": "10:59 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "my friend ian said that I'm the last remaining rockstar on earth and he's usually right but he said it not me", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Leeann Atherton ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jamie Lynn Vessels ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10334864.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Roots Rock, Blues-rock, Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cNEW ORLEANS' LOUDEST SINGER-SONGWRITER!\u201d\n\nOriginally from Raleigh, North Carolina, Jamie graduated with an undergraduate and Master's Degree in Criminal Justice during a stint in the Northeast.

Eight years after that impromptu busking session, the Portland, Oregon-based quintet has grown from a rootsy, string-centric outfit to a full-fledged rock band with an easy but powerful grasp of soul, blues, and British Invasion era pop. On their new album Labor of Love, Fruition shows the complete force of their newly expanded and electrified sound, matching their more daring musicality with sophisticated, melody-minded songcraft. With Anderson, Asebroek, and Naja trading vocal duties and offering up their own singular brand of gutsy yet graceful songwriting, Fruition infuse each track on Labor of Love with timeless urgency and three-part harmonies that never fail to enthrall.\n\nThe follow-up to their 2013 album Just One of Them Nights, Labor of Love came to life over the course of a year-long process of exploring new sonic terrain that included everything from Phil Spector-esque pop to dreamy psychedelia to Motown-inspired soul. \u201cIn the past our approach was always to just get in the studio and get it done, but for this one we decided we were going to take all the time in the world to make the album great,\u201d says Anderson. Teaming up with engineer Justin Phelps (Amanda Palmer, Jolie Holland, Chuck Prophet), Fruition self-produced Labor of Love and mined major inspiration from the inventive precision of longtime Beatles producer George Martin. \u201cThis is the first album where we made a point of bringing out the character of each song to the fullest,\u201d says Thompson, who helmed the mixing of the album. \u201cWith our previous albums we tended to treat each song the same, but this time we really went all the way with whatever sound we were going for.\u201d\n\nDespite pushing into so many disparate directions, Labor of Love emerges as a wholly unified album that subtly imparts the sense of being swept along on a journey. That unity\u2019s got much to do with an open-hearted spirit that sets in from the first notes of the dobro, mandolin and electric guitar driven title track, carries on to the sleepy soul of \u201cSanta Fe,\u201d then unfolds into the beautifully epic balladry of \u201cThe Meaning.\u201d Another key factor in the album\u2019s journey-like feel: Fruition\u2019s ingenious use of between-song transitions, such as the Brazilian-style percussion that lifts Labor of Love from the breezy R&B of \u201cAbove the Line\u201d to the joyful worldbeat-folk of \u201cThe Way That I Do.\u201d \u201cWe brought in a local band called Tapwater one night and enlisted their samba line,\u201d recalls Asebroek. \u201cThey taught us all the drum parts and about ten of us formed a whole drumline, which was just a really fun and unique experience for the band.\u201d\n\nThough Anderson, Asebroek, and Naja each bring a distinct sensibility and boldly nuanced lyricism to their respective songs, a mood of warm melancholy instills much of Labor of Love. \u201cA common theme for all three songwriters is trying to embrace being out on the road all the time, but also feeling like you\u2019re missing out on the everyday lifestyle that most people get to have,\u201d says Leonard. Embedded within that tension is a wistful romanticism that imbues many of the album\u2019s songs. \u201cMost of the love songs are very much about those rare moments of getting to be with the people you love,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cAnd then other songs are about coming back to the people you love, and trying to deal with the strange ways things change because of being apart.\u201d The band chose Labor of Love\u2019s title to reflect that balance of sacrifice and satisfaction, Naja points out. \u201cWe don\u2019t sleep nearly enough and we\u2019re away all the time and we do work really hard,\u201d she says, \u201cbut that\u2019s our job, and it\u2019s pretty much the best job in the world.\u201d\n\nAll near-lifelong musicians, the members of Fruition came to Portland from varied corners of the country and gradually crossed paths by way of their adopted hometown\u2019s music scene. \u201cMimi and Kellen were going to busk one day and I went along with them, \u2018cause that\u2019s what we always did to pay for that night\u2019s dinner and drinks,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cSo we started playing and just instantly nailed these three-part harmonies, to the point where we\u2019d get done with a song and burst out laughing at how good it sounded.\u201d The magic of those harmonies ended up proving instrumental in rounding out the rest of the band. \u201cThe first time I ever played with them, we were jamming in a friend\u2019s attic and the harmonies surrounded me,\u201d says Thompson, who joined Fruition in 2011. \u201cI had goosebumps for an hour afterward, and I decided right then I was quitting my other band and moving to Portland.\u201d Releasing their debut EP Hawthorne Hoedown in 2008, Fruition devoted the coming years to relentlessly writing and performing, The band moved from busking on the street, to scraping their way onto the lower levels of festival lineups, to opening tours for bands like ALO and Greensky Bluegrass and onward to being invited to play bigger festivals with ever bigger billing on those lineups. Last year saw them appear at Bonnaroo, Northwest String Summit and Telluride Bluegrass where Rolling Stone cited their artful choice of covers and \u201craucous originals filled with heartfelt lyrics and stadium-worthy energy.\u201d This year will see them share a Red Rocks bill with JJ Grey and Mofro and The Infamous Stringdusters, along with a full headline tour of the United States.\n\nThat breadth of touring experience has steadily reshaped the band and ultimately allowed them to achieve a sound they\u2019ve long aspired toward. \u201cA few of the songs on the new album actually came from years ago, in an era when we were much more of a string band,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cWe\u2019d imagined the songs in a particular way but didn\u2019t have the ability or experience to get them where we wanted to be\u2014we didn\u2019t even own the right instruments.\u201d But despite broadening their repertoire, a certain spirited simplicity still forms the heart of Fruition. \u201cWe all tend to write on acoustic guitar and let things start in the same stripped-down, folky sort of way that we always did,\u201d says Naja. \u201cSo where the songs come from hasn\u2019t really changed much at all. What\u2019s different is where we let them go from there.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Belle-Skinner ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7851591.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Alternative Folk, Alternative", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Alt-indie folk\nFor fans of : Laura Marling, Sufjan Stevens, Francoise Hardy, Joni Mitchell, Lana Del Rey, Angel Olsen", "otherInfo": "Radio Woodstock and Ulster Savings Bank are proud to present: Sofa Sessions featuring Mondo Cozmo, Los Doggies, and Belle-Skinner."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mondo Cozmo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7332294.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 21 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-21", "Genre": "Alternative, Singer & Songwriter", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "I order 2 beers whenever I go to a bar.

He began his recording career with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, working as both an artist and session musician.\n\nIn 1972, he formed a partnership with childhood friend John Oates and embarked on a 30-odd year creative journey. In addition to his work with Oates, he has made music as a solo artist, first recording with Robert Fripp in the late \u201870s, producing the much-acclaimed Sacred Songs as well as working on Fripp\u2019s critically praised Exposure.\n\nFrom the mid-\u201970s to the mid-\u201980s, Daryl and John would score six #1 singles, including \u201cRich Girl\u201d (also #1 R&B), \u201cKiss on My List,\u201d \u201cPrivate Eyes,\u201d \u201cI Can\u2019t Go For That (No Can Do) (also #1 R&B), \u201cManeater\u201d and \u201cOut of Touch\u201d from their six consecutive multi-platinum albums\u2014\u201976\u2019s Bigger Than Both of Us, \u201980\u2019s Voices, \u201981\u2019s Private Eyes, \u201882\u2019s H2O, \u201883\u2019s Rock N Soul, Part I and \u201884\u2019s Big Bam Boom.

In 1986, Daryl made an album with Dave Stewart, Three Hearts in the Happy Ending Machine, which spawned two top ten hits. By 1987, the R.I.A.A. recognized Daryl Hall and John Oates as the NUMBER-ONE SELLING DUO in music history, a record they still hold today. Daryl has recorded such solo works as Soul Alone in 1993 and Can\u2019t Stop Dreaming in 2003, both of which were well received with international critical acclaim.\n\nIn November of 2007 Daryl created his latest project: a monthly web series, Live from Daryl\u2019s House (http://www.livefromdarylshouse.com).

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

Townes (born January 22, 1965 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), also known as DJ Jazzy Jeff, is an American hip hop and R&B record producer and turntablist. He is best known for his early career with Will Smith as DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. DJ Jazzy Jeff graduated from John Bartram High School in Philadelphia where he is enshrined in the school's \"Wall of Fame\".\n\nHistory\n\nWhen he was growing up, he found that listening to his parents was unbearable. He got a job as a newspaper boy at age 7 to support his family. Once he grew up, he developed a reputation and following as a school and block party DJ extraordinaire, Jazzy Jeff was the feature of the duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. As a duo, they had several gold and platinum-selling albums and singles in the late 1980s and early 1990s, earning them the first rap Grammy ever presented in 1989 for Parents Just Don't Understand. When Smith branched out into television with the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Jazzy Jeff played a recurring character named \"Jazz\", Smith's best friend on the show. The two characters always greeted each other with their signature handshake (swinging mid-five, point-back/snap with both characters saying \"Pssh!\").\n\nJazz' trademarks include being physically ejected from the house by Uncle Phil (James Avery), screaming as he went flying out the front door. This was referenced in the song \"N.Y, N.Y.\" by Lloyd Banks from his second album Rotten Apple, with the lyric \"I throw a bitch out the crib like Jazzy Jeff\". [1]\n\nDJ Jazzy Jeff is not to be confused with Jeffrey Myree from the earlier hip hop group Funky Four Plus One, which in fact filed and won a lawsuit over the name Jazzy Jeff against Jeff Townes and Jive records when they signed DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince. After DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince broke up, Townes went on to become a prominent R&B, soul, and neo soul record producer, establishing the A Touch of Jazz production company in his native Philadelphia. Among the artists that Jazzy Jeff has helped develop are Jill Scott and Musiq. Even though he separated from Will Smith as music partners, they are still best friends and still occasionally work together. Some songs by Will Smith were produced by Jeff Townes (Ex. Here He Comes), and he has performed on some songs by Will Smith such as \"So Fresh\" and \"Potnas\". In addition, he appears in several of Smith's music videos such as \"Will2K\", \"Freakin' It\", and \"Party Starter\". On some occasions, he makes appearances with Smith on live concerts, producing DJ scratches.\n\nHe, along with DJ Cash Money, is credited with making the transform scratch famous.\n\nOn July 2, 2005, DJ Jazzy Jeff performed with Will Smith at the Live 8 concert in Philadelphia. In the past, Will has performed on concerts with DJ Jazzy Jeff for the scratches. Moreover, Will acknowledges him in his music like \"Comin' To The Stage\" from the album Lost & Found or \"Potnas\" in his album Willennium.\n\nHis 2007 release TROTM (The Return of the Magnificent) is a classic work which returns to the roots of hip-hop with a neo-soul mixture included. This album featured numerous collaborations with old school and new school artists including CL Smooth, Big Daddy Kane, Pos from De La Soul, Method Man, Peedi Crakk (a remake of Brand New Funk), Rhymefest, and Raheem DeVaughn.\n\nIn 2007, he appeared with Rhymefest in the video DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Fest directed by Konee Rok, in which he makes music in his home recording studio with Rhymefest and they reveal that they are working on an album together called \"I'm the DJ, I'm the Rapper\".\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nSolo work as DJ Jazzy Jeff\n\n* Unreleased album from Sony Records (1998)\n* One cut in Battle of DJs\n* The Magnificent (2002)\n* Soulheaven Presents Jazzy Jeff in the House (2004)\n* The Soul Mixtape Groovin' Records USA (2005)\n* Hip-Hop Forever II Rapster Records (2004)\n* Hip-Hop Forever III BBE Records (2006)\n* The Return of The Magnificent EP (2007)\n* The Return of the Magnificent (2007)\n* The Return of Hip Hop EP (2007)\n\n\nAs DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince\n\n* Rock the House (1987) #83 US (Gold)\n* He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper (1988) #4 US (3x Platinum)\n* And in This Corner\u2026 (1989) #39 US (Gold)\n* Homebase (1991) #12 US (Platinum)\n* Code Red (1993) #64 US (Gold)\n* Greatest Hits (1998) #144 US, #20 UK\n* Before The Willennium (1999)\n* The Very Best of D.J.

The band features Avi Salloway (Bombino/Hey Mama/Avi & Celia) joined by an inspired cast of singular artists who have performed across five continents including concerts at the Coachella Music & Arts Festival, Newport Folk Festival, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Montreal Jazz Fest, Carnegie Hall, and Lincoln Center. From 2013-16, Salloway toured the globe with Bombino, the Tuareg guitar hero from Niger, Africa. While on the journey and since returning, Salloway wrote the material on the band\u2019s latest album, Strike the Match (Sand & Gold Records).\n\nSalloway has been bringing these songs to life with the Wylder Family, a group of dear friends and musical kindred spirits. In between shows, the band spent ten days recording at Eyeland Studio in the Columbus Theatre, home of The Low Anthem. The music weaves together American folk and rock with sensibilities from the Sahara Desert: think Andrew Bird meets Ali Farka Toure, Pete Seeger and Talking Heads. Strike the Match expands on American musical traditions, building a bridge to their African roots and coloring the songs with experimental art-rock textures: gilded string lines, synthesizers, and angular guitars. Mother Earth is at its center, surrounded by stories of love, conflict, change and dreams.\n\nSalloway shares, \u201cThis album is a reflection of the world we\u2019ve been born into, one filled with supernatural beauty and incomprehensible struggle. My social and environmental activism work has taken me to territories that have been colonized and occupied in the Middle East, North and West Africa, the South Pacific and Standing Rock, here at home. I have experienced the creative spirit rise up in the face of darkness and adversity and it is the most life-affirming feeling I have witnessed. This record has become the artifact at the intersection of these moving events in my life.\u201d\n\nOn Strike the Match, Billy Wylder grapples with some of the most pressing questions of our time. How can we reorient ourselves to nature as a source of strength for resistance to the forces that seek to destroy and profit from it? How can we use music to move beyond capitalism and nationalism to a global society for the benefit of the earth and all living beings? How can we reconcile our painful history with hope and optimism for the future? The album calls the listener to engage with these questions and illuminates the path towards participating in the creation of a more just and sustainable world.\n\nThe band is named after Salloway\u2019s grandmother, Wilma \u201cBillie\u201d Hotaling.\u201d She was a prolific painter, author, musician, and educator. Billie wrote Count the Stars Through the Cracks, a harrowing historical fiction novel about a young brother and sister\u2019s escape from the Antebellum South along the Underground Railroad. Billie\u2019s writing was raw and fearless and her book delivered a powerful narrative about America\u2019s hard truths and the long journey to freedom. \u201cMy grandma Billie led by example, showing me what creativity looks like and how critical art can be as a form of love and resistance. She is part of me and part of the Wylder family,\u201d Salloway reflects.\n\n\u201cRaised in a progressive home and taught to play by Pete and John Seeger, activism is a constant in Avi Salloway\u2019s life and art. During the past decade, he\u2019s performed in world crisis spots, from the Palestinian territories to Standing Rock, always delivering a message of music\u2019s power to heal and bring change.\u201d \u2013The Hippo\n\n\"Engaging mash-up of various strains of American folk and rock and Tuareg desert blues.\" \u2013The Boston Globe", "otherInfo": "Tune in Thursday, May 21 to catch Avi live on the ZenBarn facebook page.

So Brent locked himself in an LA studio with producer and songwriter Lewis Pesacov, of Fool's Gold fame, and they put together the funky foundations for \"High To Low.\u201d Brent and Lewis built the song around the bass-line. The result is exuberant, good time rock n roll. Says Brent, \"It\u2019s a song about dancing like everyone is watching, and you don\u2019t give a damn.\"\n\nBlurring the lines between boisterous rock, R&B, and contemplative folk, Brent\u2019s infectious voice and knack for melody seem to swing effortlessly from quavering intimacy to a soulful roar as they soar atop his exuberant, explosive arrangements.\n\nGrowing up, Cowles first discovered the power of his voice singing hymns at his father\u2019s church in Colorado Springs. Having a pastor for a parent meant heavy involvement in religious life, but Cowles never quite seemed to fit in. At 16 he fell in love with secular music; at 17 he recorded his first proper demos in a friend\u2019s basement; at 18 he was married; at 19 he was divorced. Meanwhile, what began as a solo musical project blossomed into the critically acclaimed band You Me & Apollo, which quickly took over his life.

A self-described \u2018military brat\u2019, Welling\u2019s struggle to feel rooted in any one place carved a unharmonious path of heartbreak, doubt, and insecurity that defined her 20s and early 30s\u2026 a journey that lead to her soul-defining rebirth as an international touring artist with a place to call home in Nashville, TN.\n\nHer bold, sultry voice, reminiscent of Sheryl Crow\u2019s grit, Natalie Maines\u2019 twang, and Stevie Nicks\u2019 heart, is upstaged only by the genuine love and connection this natural performer has with her fans both on and off stage. But embracing confidence has not always been easy for this singer-songwriter, who speaks candidly about her battle to be good to herself, and to quiet the inner voice nagging her to be \u201cperfect\u201d. Through the process of creating her latest work, a collection of songs that encapsulate Carrie\u2019s determination to embrace self-love, self-care, and leave the past behind, she\u2019s found a place of peace and healing, recognizing that authenticity and vulnerability is the glue that binds us all.\n\nIn 2018, a few years after the release of her first solo EP, The Edge, Welling put out a Patreon campaign, embracing her dream to finally quit the side hustle and focus on music full-time. Her patrons, which Carrie refers to as her \u201cchampions\u201d, have proven to be an integral part of the artist\u2019s journey - not only supporting her online but also at live performances across the globe. \u201cMy Patreon champions started out as my fans and now we\u2019re all friends. Some of them I talk to everyday, and they give me music ideas! They keep me going,\u201d she says, reflecting on the creator-founded platform.\n\nMelodies rich in folksy, Americana roots, paired with empowering, honest lyrics are stunningly showcased in Welling\u2019s forthcoming, full length album High Heels and Heavy Things. Created in a home studio in Nashville with purely organic instruments, this raw and vulnerable record was produced by Eric Holljes (Delta Rae) and features songs co-written by the talented likes of Holljes, Mary Bragg, Alex Wong, and Matt Zavala.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things has been a long time labor of love since it\u2019s conception in 2015, to its birth in April 2020. In between studio sessions Carrie took to the stage, opening for notable artists such as Delta Rae and David Cook, and performing at popular music festivals including the the Island Hopper Music Festival (Ft. Meyers, FL). She\u2019ll be a featured artist at the \u201cSongwriters Island Showcase\u201d in Isla Mujeres, Mexico in 2020, and will be opening once again for Delta Rae and David Cook (Summer Tour 2020). In the interim she\u2019s logged countless hours on the road, performing at venues and house concerts across the US, as well as an international tour through Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nHigh Heels and Heavy Things will be available on iTunes and Spotify worldwide in Summer of 2020.

Timeless and timely, it's a classic sound with every word sang from the heart, driven forward by a mix of southern storytelling, Bible Belt twang, and Owens' big, booming baritone.\n\nFresh out of the studio, Owens has just finished recording his latest album due to release at year\u2019s end. He traveled to Texas for this project to record in The Panhandle House Studio enlisting the talents of JT Corenflos | Electric Guitar ( Alan Jackson, George Jones, Charley Pride, George Strait), Mitchell Smithey | Steele Guitar (Ray Price, Lee Ann Rimes, TG Sheppard, Gary Stuart), Dale Morris Jr. | Fiddle (Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Ray Price, Marty Stuart, Travis Tritt), Kerry Huckaba | Bass Guitar (The Hansons, The White River Band), Jay Brown | Piano (Canyon, Ty Herndon), and Andrew Raley | Drums (Deryl Dodd). Together, they captured a sound filled with fiddle, pedal steel and all the hallmarks of classic country music. Ten of the eleven tracks are penned by veteran writer Galen Griffin (Luke Bryan, Joe Diffie, Craig Morgan, Clay Walker) and magically Engineered and Produced by Nick \u201cAce\u201d Lutz (David Alan Coe, Ty Herndon, Little Texas, Ronnie Milsap, Kellie Pickler). This is an album filled with music intended to take the listener back to an earlier era in Country Music reminiscent of a simpler time. Owens shines brightly delivering each song with the same supersized voice that once shook the pews of his hometown church as the musicians expertly lay the sounds of Dance Halls long gone.\n\nLong before he hand-built his career in the honky-tonks and country clubs of the southeast, Owens grew up in rural Alabama. In many ways, it was a classic American upbringing, filled with family, faith, and music. Owens shines a light on those old-school values with his debut album Where I\u2019m Coming From and his newest release It\u2019s A Southern Thing, working closely with a roster of country music's top songwriters \u2014 including Bob Diperio, Greg Barnhill, Tony Stampley, Wynn Varble, Brian Callihan and Trent Willmon \u2014 for his most upbeat collection of songs to date.\n\n\"Like a lot of my favorite country singers, I grew up singing Gospel music,\" says Owens, who grew up listening to artists like Randy Travis and Keith Whitley. \"I grew up the same way, and I've stayed true to my Traditional Country roots. I'm still singing about going to church, eating fried chicken, and keeping it country. Why wouldn't I? Once you start trying to be something you're not, that's when you lose track of where you're headed.\"\n\nLongtime country music journalist Robert K. Oermann agrees, pointing to Owens' traditional approach as his strongest weapon. \"I like to think that there are cycles in [country] music,\" Oermann explains. \"Usually, the pendulum swings out and the Pop-Country people bring in a whole lot of new listeners, and then the new listeners discover real Country music. Then there's usually a swing back to more traditional styles. I hope we're on the cusp of that\u2026 and if we are, Shane is perfectly positioned.\"\nA self-made road warrior who was recently named \"Independent Artist of the Year\" by MusicRow Reveals 2018 Country Breakout Awards, Owens continues to maintain an active schedule of listening room and honky tonk shows along with festival appearances. He made his Grand Ole Opry debut in 2017. He also appeared at summertime events like CMA Music Festival and Jamboree In the Hills, both of which were voted as the top two American country music festivals of the year. Cracker Barrel has picked Owens' music to appear in several of the store's exclusive releases, including Country Faith America and Country Faith Love Songs, while Netflix included his song \"Country Never Goes Out of Style\" in the popular series The Ranch. No wonder Rolling Stone Country named Shane Owens one of the magazine's \"10 New Country Artists You Need to Know!\"\n\nNew music. New album. New shows. Shane Owens continues to more forward, but he also remains rooted in the sound that launched his career, breathing new life into a sound that's at once fresh and familiar. \"I've grown my business the old-school way,\" he explains. \"I played the honky-tonks for years. I developed myself and my sound. It can be tough when you've got a traditional sound, but I can't be anything I'm not. If it was easy to do, everybody would do it. And I'm nowhere near done doing it.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Will Evans Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9864549.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Roots, Folk, Acoustic & Acoustic Rock, Reggae", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Will Evans has spent the last decade as the primary songwriter and frontman for the New England based Roots Rock outfit Barefoot Truth.

The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions. We have to build something to last, rather than just build it because it looks good at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Annie Zeleski", "otherInfo": "donate:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/Ounsworth"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Usher ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10098994.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Called an \"R&B teen dream\" by Rolling Stone, Usher was only 15 years old when he released his self-titled second album in 1994.

It was in that spirit that Matt Maher birthed his latest album, Saints and Sinners (Essential/Sony).\n\nThe garage-turned-studio behind Maher\u2019s home became a haven of reflection as he tirelessly transformed it into a creative songwriting space. \u201cEvery day, I\u2019d go out there and dream a bit and ask, \u2018God, what do you want to build here?\u2019\u201d Maher recalls. \u201cI thought a lot about the nature of what it means to build something, and I didn\u2019t have a clear sense of where I was headed. I found myself in a place of unknowing,\u201d Maher says. \u201cSo I naturally started gravitating toward writings and quotes from people having experienced the tension between certainty and mystery.\u201d He began saving these prayers, quotes and excerpts while also studying prophetic voices who significantly impacted the history of the church - believers who wrestled with matters of faith, who challenged the status quo and left marked legacies.\n\nAmidst creativity unfolding, the record-making process began, unbeknownst to Maher, when he stepped into the studio to record a song based on the timeless Bill Gaither hymn \u201cBecause He Lives.\u201d Initially, he was recording the song for a one-off compilation project, but Maher\u2019s label heard the demo and immediately deemed it his next radio single. \u201cAll of a sudden, it was like, \u2018You\u2019re making a record,\u2019 and what\u2019s funny is my first response was, \u2018But I don\u2019t have any songs,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe more I thought about it, I realized I had already begun the writing process for all these songs, based on all these people I had been studying. I just wasn\u2019t aware of how beautifully it was starting to come together.\u201d \u201cBecause He Lives (Amen)\u201d became the catalyst to initiate an entire chain of songwriting sessions based on a short list of difference makers.\n\nMaher brought together a host of talented songwriters among who were Thad Cockrell (Leagues), Jon Foreman (Switchfoot), Bo and Bear Rinehart (NEEDTOBREATHE), Jason Ingram and several others for the project.\n\nWith songs loosely crafted and ready for the studio, Maher collaborated with longtime friend and producer Paul Moak (Third Day, Mat Kearney) to bring to life the themes of unity and the struggle of living in the \u201cin-between.\u201d This duality was not only explored lyrically but also sonically as the two men creatively experimented in-studio on \u201cSaints and Sinners.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were looking at the idea of the tension between the saint and the sinner - of looking at two contrasting things, and incorporating that into the production of the music. For example, you take an imperfect being, who generates analog sound waves, and they get recorded into a computer that turns them into digital information. You can create so much within a computer that there is a fine line of tension between it sounding perfect versus human, so we tried to arrive at a reconciliation between the two,\u201d Maher explains.\n\nThe lives and work of other influencers became the blueprint for additional cuts, like the album\u2019s driving first track, \u201cFuture Not My Own,\u201d which is based on a prayer inspired by martyr Oscar Romero. \u201cThis prayer really brings to light that we\u2019re announcing a kingdom that\u2019s here, that\u2019s coming, and that\u2019s being built, that we won\u2019t see the finish of. That\u2019s a huge aspect of being a part of the Church, the body of Christ.\u201d\n\nMaher is an outspoken champion of unity and collaboration, not just amongst Christians on a level of faith but also on a civic level,\u201d he says. Perhaps the most outspoken example of this desire is the gospel-tinged \u201cSons and Daughters.\u201d Although the song was written before the Ferguson incident made headlines, the timely track is an ode to Martin Luther King, Jr., and Maher\u2019s attempt to speak into racial reconciliation. \u201cGod used the church in the \u201960s to inspire a nation for healing. Most people don\u2019t think about the fact that a lot of people in the civil rights movement initially were pastors. Faith was the thing that motivated people toward eradicating injustice,\u201d he says. \u201cSons and Daughters\u201d is a special song, and I hope it will play a part in inspiring more Christian leaders toward re-engagement in the issue of civil rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirelight\u201d is inspired by the ministry of Mother Teresa. Maher\u2019s inspiration for the idea of a firelight comes from her saying, \u201cIf I ever become a saint - I will surely be one of \u2018darkness. I will continually be absent from heaven - to light the light of those in darkness on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything Is Grace\u201d is based on a quote by St. Therese of Lisieux out of \u201cHer Last Conversations\u201d that reads, \u201cEverything is a grace, everything is the direct effect of our father's love - difficulties, contradictions, humiliations, all the soul's miseries, her burdens, her needs - everything, because through them, she learns humility, realizes her weakness. Everything is a grace because everything is God's gift. Whatever be the character of life or its unexpected events - to the heart that loves, all is well.\u201d\n\n\u201cRest\u201d sets Psalm 23 to music and features the vocal harmonies of The Vespers. This song, in particular, came at a time when Maher\u2019s grandmother\u2019s health was failing, and the acoustic-driven track proved to be a source of encouragement for his family.\n\nSince his 2008 major label debut, Maher has become a staple in the artistic and songwriting community. A five time-GRAMMY\u00ae nominee, he has garnered multiple radio successes writing and recording songs like \u201cLord, I Need You,\u201d \u201cHold Us Together,\u201d \u201cChrist Is Risen,\u201d \u201cAll The People Said Amen\u201d and \u201cYour Grace Is Enough.\u201d Maher has penned songs recorded by Chris Tomlin, Crowder, Third Day, Matt Redman, Hillsong, Passion and Meredith Andrews, among others. Maher continues to perform and speak as a part of global high-profile events, including the upcoming World Meeting of Families, marking Pope Francis\u2019 first visit to the US this year. In 2013, Maher performed on stage with Pope Francis in front of more than 3 million people at World Youth Day in Rio de Janeiro. Maher and his team are already in the planning stages of participating in World Youth Day 2016 taking place in the summer of 2016 in Krakow, Poland.\n\nMaher has found that while we all come from different backgrounds, amass a range of experiences and even harbor conflicting opinions, the one thing that always binds us together is our humanity. \u201cIt\u2019s the sinful side of me that helps me identify with other broken people and not see myself as better. Christianity doesn\u2019t make me better than anybody else,\u201d he contends. \u201cThe process of being transformed is sometimes a really messy process. When you can remember how far off you were when God found you, your own conversion stands as a testimony to God and mercy, but it also gives you a way to relate to other people.\u201d After all, we were created by a loving God who designed us for a greater purpose. We are each on the pilgrimage of searching out that purpose, being transformed, saints and sinners.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Casey Donahew ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9065318.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Texas Country, Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"One Light Town\" is available NOW\n15 New Songs\nhttp://smarturl.it/OneLightTown\n\nSign up for email updates: http://smarturl.it/CD_Email\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/CD_Spotify\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/CD_Apple\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/CD_Amazon\nPandora: http://smarturl.it/CD_Pandora", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mobina Galore ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/manitobamusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Blue Water Highway ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10354820.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Alternative, Rock, Indie, Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Listen now: https://Blue-Water-Highway.lnk.to/0KrUBba\n\nBlue Water Highway comes from the working class, coastal town background that has informed the work of so many of rock\u2019s greatest writers and artists. They take their name from the roadway that links their hometown of Lake Jackson, Texas to Galveston, where the cops, the teachers, the baristas, and the chemical plant workers travel to work hard and to play hard, blowing off steam, dancing to their favorite bands. Blue Water Highway\u2019s music is the soundtrack for their lives.\n\n\u201cBest Friend\u201d is the first single from their album Heartbreak City, which came out on Blue Water Highway Records/Thirty Tigers on June 8th, 2018. With a hook that\u2019s a mile wide, it chronicles the lives, loves, and friendships that sustain us. Said lead singer Zack Kibodeaux, \u201cWe wrote this as a band, and we wanted to tap into the feeling of that special friendship where you know you can count on one another.

I\u2019ve never had voice lessons, and it wasn\u2019t until after graduating from college that I started teaching myself how to play guitar. So, if you\u2019d told me then that I\u2019d end up making a living as a singer-songwriter, I wouldn't have believed you. Even now, with the release of my fifth studio album, Morning Light, I can barely believe it.\n\nMy performing career began in the smoky corners of Knoxville, TN\u2019s restaurants and bars, singing cover songs for distracted drunks and underage college students. I didn\u2019t seriously consider pursuing a career in music until May 9, 2007, after an unexpected opportunity to open for John Legend at Knoxville\u2019s Tennessee Theatre. The guy that walked on stage that night, wasn\u2019t the same guy that walked off. One set, six songs in just thirty minutes, changed my life forever.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve shared a tour bus with Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Famers, performed in front of crowds of over 20,000 people, and been lucky enough to share the stage with artists like Brandi Carlile, Heart, Gavin DeGraw, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, James Blunt, Edwin McCain, Chris Isaak, and Daughtry, as well as tour Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, performing for our men and women in uniform stationed overseas.\n\nMusic has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It\u2019s taken me to parts of the world I would\u2019ve never seen and connected me with lifelong friends I would\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s given my life purpose. Without music, I may have never met the two greatest loves of my life, my wife, Mandy, and my daughter, Annabelle Rose Baker. However, at the same time, music almost tore my life apart.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2013, I was touring over 200 days a year. By many standards, I was living the dream, but life on the road was taking its toll. While my music career had never been better, my personal life had never been worse. At home, waiting for me, was the life that I\u2019d dreamed of, and I was missing it. First words were being spoken, first steps taken, and it was all passing me by like road signs on the highway. Sadly, the two people I was working hardest to protect, were the ones getting hurt the most.\n\nThen one day I walked into an empty house and found my wife\u2019s wedding ring on the kitchen table along with a note that read, \u201cI will not be sorry for the choice YOU made.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, success as a singer-songwriter didn\u2019t seem nearly as important if it meant failing as a husband and as a father. I was at an intersection in my life and a choice had to be made. I could continue down the road I was on, whatever the cost, or change my direction and come home.\n\nThankfully, I made the choice to refocus on my family, and in January of 2014, I put down my guitar and started picking up the pieces. I stopped recording and touring, and traded the stage lights, for front porch lights, but as it turns out, the day that I decided to stop making music, was the day a new chapter in my music career began.\n\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve learned is that you get what you give in this life. 5 years ago, I GOT a second chance, and everything that\u2019s happened has GIVEN me this moment.\n\nToday, I am a better husband. I\u2019m a better father, and hopefully, I\u2019m a better songwriter. Music may have tried to tear my family apart, but now it\u2019s graciously bringing us back together. So, I see music as a celebration of every wrong turn and right turn that has led me here, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t give thanks for that old wooden box with six strings.\n\nHere\u2019s to the hope that keeps us holding on and to never losing sight of the things that are truly important. Here\u2019s to the promise and possibility of each NEW DAY. Here\u2019s to the beauty of the present moment and to trying our best to make the most of it. The road here has not been easy, but over the last few years, I\u2019ve learned that if you look hard enough, the shadows always show us the light.

While \u201cBreaking Down\u201d and \u201cNo Good\u201d are superb examples of rollicking rock, they are just one of many genres that Hamish dips his toes into on the new album Out Of My Head, produced by Jim Scott (Tom Petty, Tedeschi Trucks Band). Americana, soul, pop, roots, blues, rock; that\u2019s a lot of ground to cover, but Hamish does it with a natural ease that\u2019s far beyond his years.

In the two years since, the members of Wildermiss\u2014Cole, guitarists Josh Hester and Seth Beamer, and drummer Caleb Thoemke\u2014have built up a massive and fiercely loyal grassroots following in its hometown of Denver, Colorado, and crisscrossed the country winning over fans as the supporting act on tours with the Oh Hellos, Jared and the Mill and Bronze Radio Return.\n\nMore than a fan favorite, the quartet has also earned accolades from the press and radio in the Mile High City on the strength of its music and live show. \u201cCarry Your Heart,\u201d a Lost With You single that has attracted more than half a million streams on Spotify, received heavy rotation on KTCL, the taste-making station that first introduced the country to the Oh Hellos, The Fray, Flobots, Churchill, and many other breakout acts in the past fifteen years.\n\nIn addition to selling out the Bluebird Theater and thrilling capacity crowds with intimate back-to-back New Year\u2019s Eve dates at the Larimer Lounge, Wildermiss has played prime mainstage sets at all of the city\u2019s biggest music festivals, including iHeart Radio\u2019s Big Gig at the 18,000-seat amphitheater Fiddler\u2019s Green, the Westword Music Showcase and the Underground Music Showcase, which drew tens of thousands of fans, in addition to sharing a bill at the 6,500-seat 1STBANK Center arena with the Revivalists, Elle King, American Authors.\n\nThe outfit\u2019s ascent has all been organic. The members of Wildermiss have attracted fans the old fashioned way by writing memorable songs and playing their hearts out each night, winning over fan after fan one at a time. As viewers who happened to catch Wildermiss on Last Call With Carson Daly can attest, the act isn\u2019t a tough sell. Portions of the band\u2019s set at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles were captured for broadcast, and the performance was so compelling that it ended up airing on two different episodes of NBC\u2019s late-night show.\n\nBut just as those performances served as a sneak peek for the fortunate few across the country who were still up in the wee hours of the morning, Lost With You merely hinted at the potential of Wildermiss. In My Mind, the outfit\u2019s new seven-song EP, surpasses any expectations set by the group\u2019s highly acclaimed debut. From the opening notes of \u201cStar-Faced,\u201d Emma Cole takes listeners on a riveting ride with melodies that are even more memorable and massive than the first outing, set over music that sounds far more refined and mature.\n\nCole\u2019s captivating vocals are complemented by a captivating backdrop of effervescent guitar-driven pop on songs like \u201cPromise Me\u201d and \u201cHell Or High Water,\u201d which would fit perfectly on a playlist between acts like Coin or Young the Giant.\n\nAnd that stellar set of polished pop songs, which all seem built for big rooms, is contrasted nicely with more delicate, reflective ballads like \u201cParalyzed,\u201d \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d and \u201cFake,\u201d which lead into one of the EP\u2019s more captivating cuts, \u201cGirl,\u201d which is propelled by textural, widescreen, cinematic moments worthy of Muse.\n\nIn My Mind has much more immediacy than its predecessor, which is ironic considering the band spent much more time writing and recording this time around. Whereas Lost With You was recorded over a few days when the group was newly minted, the members labored over producing In My Mind for the better part of a year, polishing the songs and shifting arrangements while on the road.\n\nThe members took their time to create a cohesive piece of work that truly reflects the evolution of the band and where it is at right now. From the strength of the songwriting and the clarity of the production, it\u2019s clear that the foursome succeeded in capturing its vision. The dramatic progression is well represented by the cover of the album, which features a diorama delivered by lauded artist and photographer Scott McCormick, who expertly rendered a heady concept conceived by the band.\n\nWhat appears at first glance to be a heavenly constellation of stars is actually a cluster of everyday garbage composited to resemble a faraway galaxy. Just as the artwork for Lost With You contrasted the intersection of nature and humanity, In My Mind reflects a contrast of inner space and outer space, of everyday people and their place in the universe.\n\nMore than that, though, the cover art perfectly represents the essence of the band. When first listening to the songs, Wildermiss my strike you as a pop band. If you look and listen closely, there is far more to this band than meets the eyes and ears.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Austin Ferrari ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10355535.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Evansville, United States", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Just a simple check in with all of my friends to see how everyone is doing!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Harper and Lee ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8939216.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Rock, Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Harper and Lee are a husband and wife singer/songwriter duo who performs with a suitcase kick-drum, foot tambourine, acoustic guitar and banjo to show their unique style of Folk/Americana music.

Blending a modern Red Dirt Country sound with traces of Americana and Roots Rock, the record is a well founded collection of songs that resonate and grow with listeners, due to its diverse individuality as an album. With a sound that\u2019s simple yet complex, easy-feeling but gritty and weathered, inspiring yet heartbreaking. It\u2019s no stretch to say that there\u2019s a song for every emotion on Lively\u2019s \u201cStronger Ties\u201d.\n\nBorn in Victoria, Texas, but raised just outside of town in the rural community of Inez, Mason Lively grew up in a country music atmosphere. His appreciation for the genre can be traced back to his childhood. Though he enjoyed and was exposed to many types of music, he would listen to artists like Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, and Ray Price to name a few. Growing up, while being influenced by Blues and Classic Rock, Mason started to take interest and study the songwriting of artists from his home state\u2019s music scene like Robert Earl Keen, Pat Green, Hayes Carll, and many more. As a result, when he started playing guitar at age 14, Mason claims that song-writing \"sort of snuck up on him\" not long after that.\n\nLively is currently in the studio working on his sophomore record with iconic Texas singer/songwriter Wade Bowen, and acclaimed producer Justin Pollard... It's safe to say that Mason Lively is going places in Country Music and beyond.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "G.

Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage. Whether Love Saves The Day makes one dollar or a million isn\u2019t a big concern to him. It stands as a huge success because he made the gritty, honest album that he intended by \u201ckeeping it raw, keeping it immediate, keeping it real.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that he has honed over the years: \u201cbe original and be true to what you do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To Benefit 3rd and Lindsley, Nashville"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Harvest Sons ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10387660.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Alternative, Pop, Americana, Rock", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "...a Rust Belt frame of mind bleeds into Harvest Sons' synthesis of Americana and Folk infused Indie Rock.

The accomplished singer/songwriter/producer/multi-instrumentalist\u2014a true quadruple threat\u2014released her impactful and emotional debut album Symptoms last year, and it's only the beginning of her journey with a new single and more new music on the way.\n\nBorn and raised in Hawaii, the Los Angeles-based Crowe was practically brought into the world with music in her life: she started playing violin at the young age of three years old, and her father was a concert pianist alongside his career as an astronomer. \"My parents were very musical\u2014they met performing theater together,\" she explains. \"Music was a huge part of our family and my upbringing.\"\n\nAfter teaching herself how to sing while listening to Broadway musical recordings, Crowe eventually got accustomed to performing locally and accrued the confidence and motivation to try her hand at songwriting and music production, with formative influences that included Jewel and Alanis Morrissette. \"They had strong, empowering lyrics,\" she states. \"Jewel had this beautiful voice\u2014all she had to do is grab a guitar and tell her stories. That was mesmerizing to me. Alanis was all about raw, unapologetic emotion and power, and her lyrics were very dynamic while still retaining introspection.\"\n\nIn 2018, Crowe won the John Lennon Songwriting Contest for her song \"Breaking Things,\" which was co-written and co-produced with her partner and first songwriting collaborator Josh Anderson; a year later, she released her debut album Symptoms, the result of two and a half years of work with Anderson in Los Angeles on songs she'd originally written in her bedroom. \"It was my first chapter as a writer, producer, and artist,\" she states while discussing the album's origins. \"It was such a journey to have people around me and a team who could help guide me in this city.\"\n\nA deeply felt and expressive pop album, Symptoms was inspired by Lady Gaga's own approach to production and songwriting: \"She's a powerhouse performer. A lot of my production is inspired by her, along with songwriters like Sia and Taylor Swift\u2014strong women that are powerful, dynamic, and cathartic above all else.\"\n\nSymptoms' title track\u2014as well as the album as a whole\u2014draws from an abusive experience that took place before moving to the West Coast. \"After I went through that experience, my body went into shock and I started experiencing panic attacks and anxiety,\" she recalls. \"It was about telling myself that everything was going to be okay\u2014and a musical diary that revealed the ways I was coping with what I'd been through.\"\n\nThe transformative \u201cChess Game,\u201d co-written by Kailey Shaffer, zeroes in on the struggles that young women in the music industry often face, as well as how to transcend and evolve amidst such struggles. As young women in our industry, we felt like we were tired of playing everyone else\u2019s games,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe were inspired to write something uplifting\u2014an infectiously driven and empowering anthem in the face of adversity. The symbolism of the lyrics represents transformation, realizing your inner strength and having the courage to take back and own your true power.\u201d The song was an anthem and debuted in the Billboard Dance Charts.\n\n\"Each song is a different piece of a puzzle\u2014a symptom of who I am,\" Crowe continues. \"I took my traumatic experiences and turned them into these fun pop songs to help me get through what I've experienced.\" The latest single from Symptoms, \"Sky Is Falling,\" is particularly close to Crowe's heart; the epic, wide-open ballad finds her drawing from the pain and perseverance of her father's passing. \"It's my most personal song\u2014it encompasses all the things at the core of what I've gone through,\" she explains. I never had the chance to get any closure with him about what had happened to me, and I never got to say goodbye. All my anxiety turned into depression when he died. Because he studied the stars, the title itself is a double meaning. My world was crashing down around me, but I also wanted to make sure the song was uplifting and hopeful.\"\n\nThe accompanying music video for the single is next up, and in Crowe's words, the space-themed clip focuses on \"Finding a connection with that feeling after you experience loss\u2014with that person who may not even be there in the physical form anymore.\" What's next? More new music, starting with a duet with frequent collaborator Nick Mair, \"Can't Find Love\"\u2014as well as continuing to live through the highs and lows of existing, and helping her listeners do the same. \"A lot of things are hard to talk about that we go through, but we can all laugh and cry about it,\" she states. \"It's about letting yourself feel those emotions and coming out stronger from it\u2014feeling more self-assured about who you are.\"", "otherInfo": "Thursday, May 21st\n5:30pm PT\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/roadnationofficial\n\nRoadNation, the pioneering platform that enables artists and fans to build tours together, and A2IM (American Association of Independent Music) have launched the \u201cRoad-Less\u201d livestream series, allowing independent artists to earn money from livestream performances.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006.

The audience, however, is too busy dancing to the one-man acts layered guitar riffs, foot stomping percussion, blues harmonica, and emotionally charged lyrics to even think about looking away.\nThe New Jersey native is able to emulate the sound of a full rock band with his percussive fingerstyle approach to the acoustic guitar and an array of effects pedals. Kenny has even customized a vintage red suitcase which has been dubbed \u201cThe Big Red Suitcase\u201d to use as a kick drum, which has appeared with him on stage for over a decade of live performances.\nHis debut appearances at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park paved the way for Kenny\u2019s developing one-man band show and led him into the national touring circuit and beyond. Over years of honing his craft on the road, Kenny caught the attention of one of his guitar idols, Mickey Melchiondo, a.k.a. Dean Ween from WEEN. Melchiondo recently asked Kenny to tour opening up for his new band, The Dean Ween Group, and has gained him new fans around the United States. Kenny has also been spreading his music internationally with multiple tours throughout Europe and performances in SE Asia to raise awareness about unexploded bombs. In recent years he has shared the stage with the likes of John Butler Trio, Keller Williams, WEEN, The Dean Ween Group, Leon Russell, John Hammond Jr., New Riders of the Purple Sage and John Kadlecik (Further & Dark Star Orchestra). In January of 2016, The Eagles of Death Metal released Kenny\u2019s version of \"I Love You All The Time\" as a part of their Pay it Forward Campaign to raise money for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.\nOn his latest self-titled release, Kenny teamed up with three-time Grammy Winning Producer Justin Guip (Sound engineer for Levon Helm and current touring drummer for Hot Tuna) to create a record that expanded on his signature one-man band sound. The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks. With an influential voice that lies somewhere between Neil Young and Jack White, Kenny delivers clear and concise visions of dynamic musical deliverance. Combining a deep dive into tone, originality and believability, he ushers the listener into his brand new living room of roots riddled rock and roll.\nNever going for the standard attack, he flies far from the 12-bar blues, three-chord rock and Americana stereotype to land some place between a rock and a new place. The album illustrates a highly skilled writer who utilizes the same down-home approach in his music as he does with his day-to-day interactions with others. It\u2019s a combination that will continue to see Kenny reach exciting new levels as he helps future fans \u201csee the light\u201d of his musical message.\nTo hear his full discography, watch recent videos, and check out upcoming tour dates visit www.KeithKenny.com\n(Excerpt from John Pfieffer & Jessica Smith of The Aquarian Weekly)", "otherInfo": "Virtual Tip Jar!\nVenmo: Keith-Kenny-1\nPaypal: Keith@KeithKenny.com or Paypal.me/KeithKenny\nCashApp: $KeithKenny\n\nMerchandise!

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Koah ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9094855.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "KOAH is an accomplished singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist active in both the United States East Coast and West Coast.

If you ask the two remaining members of The Tragic Radicals, apparently several. A four year revolving door of band members has brought guitarist, Aj Caves, and former TR bassist, turned drummer extraordinaire, Tyler Chittick, to one conclusion; less really is more.\nRewind to the chilly month of January, 2016 in Fullerton, CA: The rock band soon to be known as The Tragic Radicals was born. Since the recent disbanding of her all-girl rock group, The Slivers, Aj, bored and bandless, turned to Craigslist, to scout out musicians for her next (and hopefully more successful) band. With a little diligence, it wasn\u2019t too long before drummer, Nathan, bassist, Tyler, and singer, Cassidy, were assembled, auditioning in Aj\u2019s living room. The band began rehearsing there weekly, and the four-piece picked up and put their scent on, roughly, a dozen of Aj\u2019s existing songs, came up with a suitable moniker, and were hitting stages within a couple of months. Over the next few years, the group played steady gigs, recorded two EPs (one unreleased), and also underwent numerous personnel changes.\nFast forward to late August, 2019: Two singers, four drummers, and nearly one hundred shows later, The Radicals found themselves tragically (or not so tragically) half the band they used to be. Having recently become a three-piece after letting go of their second (and last) singer in June 2019, the band was surprised to see their summer filling up very fast. The new formation of TR soon was gaining momentum as an instrumental act, and was booked solid through the end of August. Promoters were all over them. They were playing venues anywhere from the Sunset Strip to Long Beach, to Orange County, an exciting and unexpected turn of events for a band who was fully anticipating a struggle booking gigs without a vocalist. In a matter of six weeks, with nearly a dozen shows down, the band was nearing the end of their stretch, with only two left on the calendar, both of which at The World Famous Doll Hut in Anaheim, CA. The first of the two shows was one they\u2019d been preparing for. A Saturday night prime slot with a stacked bill, this was an excellent opportunity for The Tragic Radicals to earn some decent exposure, as it promised a great turnout. They did not predict the departure of their drummer on the day of the gig.\nThough blindsided and disappointed, indeed, the show must go on. No stranger to flakey musicians, the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was setting in for the two longest running members of The Tragic Radicals as they had hours to prepare for their performance as a duo. This was not the first time Aj and Tyler had been forced to curb their act on short notice. If one thing has remained constant in TR, it\u2019s etiquette, and there would be no backing out of shows due to the lack of professionalism from other members. Put on the spot, the two would naturally resort to just guitar and bass, jokingly dubbing these modified performances as their \u2018Almost Acoustic Christmas\u2019 shows; for whatever reason, this seemed to happen every December, coincidentally. Even though this was far from their first rodeo, it was clear they began to silently doubt their abilities matching the caliber of the lineup that night, fearing the intensity of their sound would suffer without drums. Consultation between the two was unnecessary as Tyler posed the idea of ditching the bass, and instead doing drums and guitar, and without debate, the musical arrangement was settled.\nWith a packed house, surrounded by many semi-famous musicians, the nervous pair took the stage at The Doll Hut that night, hoping to make it through their set semi-painlessly. The crowd\u2019s growing audible response as each new song was playedLittle did it would prove to be the most successful incarnation of The Tragic Radicals yet. In the months following their impressive, pivotal August performance, The Tragic Radicals would have a new look, a new sound, and a new following. Not to mention, new opportunities. In a very short amount of time, they found their calendar packed once again, filled with not only gigs, but appearances on podcasts like Taxi TV, The Flabby Hoffman Radio Show, Die Laughing Records Radio Podcast, and C4OC\u2019s House of Metal Radio Show. Somehow, they\u2019d managed to achieve more in a matter of weeks than they had as a full band in almost four years-time. It was an exciting time for TR, and finally they began reaping the benefits after years of hard work.\nAnd so it goes, with success comes some criticism. Now and again, skeptics who can\u2019t seem to wrap their heads around how a two-piece, instrumental band, with no vocals or bass will argue that TR cannot compete with the live sound capabilities of a traditional four or five-piece rock band. Aware of the criticism, the pair has had much to prove when it comes to their live act. Eliminating the vocals and bass does present some challenges, but the two-piece is adapting quite well, crafting clever songs with shortened or modified arrangements to make up for the sounds of absent band members. For years Tyler and Aj were frustrated with TR\u2019s inability to expand their song catalog. Due to the constant rotation of members, it was nearly impossible to write new material at the desired pace. Relieved of aforementioned obstacles, The Tragic Radicals are rapidly writing new songs, and are preparing to record and release new music by January 2020. The creative process requires a slightly different approach now, but Aj\u2019s melodic riffs and ability uniquely arrange songs to replace lyrics is a major asset to the band. Playing through both guitar and bass amps on stage, she maintains her distinct guitar tone while incorporating low end to fill the void of Tyler\u2019s missing bass. Perfectly accompaniment, Tyler lends emphasis to accents and dynamics, drumming as though he was playing bass. An incredibly versatile musician, capable of mastering numerous instruments, his skills and flexibility allow him to keep up with Aj\u2019s frequent song reworking and tendency to experiment with time changes. The two manage to captivate audiences with, not only their blatant chemistry, but their genuine, intense stage presence, and roll with the punches charm.", "otherInfo": "Every Thursday We'll Be Playing 3 Original Tracks - Personal Faves, And Requests Welcomed!

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Z-Trip ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10386724.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Electronic, Hip-hop, Soul, Turntablism, House, Producer, Edm, Funk, Bass, Rock, Reggae", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "DJ Z-Trip's roots are based in Hip Hop, but he covers and loves all music styles.

Johnson began playing and writing songs on his four-track in the mid-'90s before he formed I Rowboat, a Velvet Underground-inspired indie rock band. Johnson began dabbling in folk with I Rowboat guitarist Dan Strack and drummer Brian Belval as the Fruit Bats. When I Rowboat disbanded, Johnson played guitar and banjo with Califone. That group's Tim Rutili and Ben Massarella, who also own Perishable Records, urged the Fruit Bats to record their work for the label, which resulted in the trio's 2001 debut, Echolocation. Over the next two years the group toured and refined its lineup and sound, adding Lisee as well as more pop and experimental elements to its folk-rock base. In 2002, the group signed to Sub Pop, who released their sophomore effort, Mouthfuls, in spring of 2003. Two years later, after relocating to Seattle and expanding to a four-piece, the band released their third full length album, Spelled in Bones.

Como el buen vino, De La Swing ha madurado con el paso del tiempo y su progresi\u00f3n sonora le ha catapultado hasta poder presumir de compartir tiempo y escenarios con varios de los nombres m\u00e1s importantes de la escena mundial; y es que compartir cabina junto a artistas como Marco Carola, Loco Dice , Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Laurent Garnier, Joseph Capriati, Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch, Paco Osuna o Vitalic, o actuar en festivales y eventos tan emblem\u00e1ticos y reputados como Monegros Desert Festival, Eastern Electrics Festival, Kingsday Madness, We are Together, Plages Electroniques, Ultra Cape Town/Johannesburg & Origin Festival son prueba fehaciente del asentamiento sonoro y arrollador \u00e9xito a escala mundial del madrile\u00f1o. Incorpor\u00e1ndose a la familia Row en 2010 como residente y pilar fundamental de un club como Elrow de Barcelona, la trayectoria de De La Swing ha experimentado un constante crecimiento mejorando exponencialmente y llegando a abanderar, -junto al resto de familia Row-, su residencia tambi\u00e9n en las fiestas especiales a cargo del club catal\u00e1n albergadas en Ibiza como El Row en Privilege Ibiza durante las temporadas 2012 y 2013, o un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s tarde en Space Ibiza. De La Swing es ese tipo de artista inconformista cuya carrera y evoluci\u00f3n musical es cuidada hasta el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo detalle y donde la profundidad, creatividad e innovaci\u00f3n sonora se abrazan sin acritud seg\u00fan pisa el escenario. Son su pasi\u00f3n y buen rollo hacia la m\u00fasica lo que impera en su d\u00eda a d\u00eda y lo que hacen de sus sets un aut\u00e9ntico viaje sonoro y \u00fanica su conexi\u00f3n con el p\u00fablico. Y es que si el de Madrid destaca con sus sesiones desenvueltas en un constante Groove y fusionando techno y house de la nueva escuela, sus producciones van un paso m\u00e1s all\u00e1. Con una mentalidad solida, f\u00e9rtil y arriesgada, De La Swing es el alma m\u00e1ter detr\u00e1s de labels tan en alza en el panorama nacional como Elrow Music, Florida Music & Ker Recordings, habiendo tambi\u00e9n colaborado y remezclado para sellos como Form, Drakos Recordings y Amazing Lab. Pero su amor por la m\u00fasica y el eclecticismo musical le ha hecho mostrar su otra cara art\u00edstica; su faceta m\u00e1s underground bajo el pseud\u00f3nimo \u2018Smoked Signal\u2019, habitualmente presente como residente del Ker Club de la Ciudad Condal y habiendo compartido vivencias y an\u00e9cdotas en su escenario con nombres como Martinez Brothers, Art Department, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Seth Troxler, Scuba o Los Suruba entre otros. English version: Born in Madrid in the 80\u2019s, Domingo Bellot starts his musical career at the age of 16. Influenced in its beginnings by techno and drum&bass, his technical skills, ability to connect with the crowd and he\u2019s diverse musical style has made him one of the most versatile DJ\u00b4s in Spain. Over the past 5 years De La Swing has shared turntables with different top level Djs as Marco Carola, Loco Dice, Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Laurent Garnier, Joseph Capriati, Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch, Paco Osuna or Vitalic among others, and has played at festivals like Monegros Desert Festival (Spain), Eastern Electric Festival (London), Kingsday Madness (Holland), We are Together (Marseille), Plages Electroniques (Cannes), Ultra Cape Town/Johannesburg & Origin Festival (South Africa), resulting rapidly a well-known and familiar Dj in countries as Spain, France, Italy and Holland. Since 2010 this Madrid born is one of the emblematic ElRow residents, the after hour based in the ever growing electronic hub of Barcelona, that has become one of the best clubs worldwide, brainchild of the organisers of Europe's only desert festival, Monegros, and owners of the acclaimed techno club Florida 135 in Fraga, Huesca. Equally important are his recent El Row residencies during the summer season in Privilege Ibiza -in 2012 and 2013- and Space Ibiza in 2014. De la Swing is that type of non-conformist artist which lives in a continuous sound evolution, where the depth, darkness and fun are always present in his sets and throughout which he shows his creativity and innovation on stage, driving his passion and vibrancy to create a different story every time, while establishing a unique connection with the crowd. While in the studio, De la Swing is a solid and fertile mind being in charge of different labels as Elrow Music, Florida Music & Ker Recordings, having also produced and remixed for labels like Form, Drakos Recordings and Amazing Lab. However, his skills and abilities go further on. We can also enjoy its more underground side with his aka \u2018Smoke Signal\u2019, usually as resident in Ker Club Barcelona once a month, sharing his talent with artists such as Martinez Brothers, Art Department, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Seth Troxler, Scuba or Los Suruba.

He rapidly broke through onto the Garage pirate radio stations and forums gaining instant recognition, and was subsequently snapped up by international promoters to perform tours of Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Russia. Majestic has since crossed into a multitude of dance music genres from UK Garage to House to Drum & Bass and Dubstep performing with leading artists across the scene such as Sigma, DJ EZ, Dream Teem, Agent X, MJ Cole, Judge Jules, Micky Slim, Jack Beats, Laidback Luke, The Wideboys, Netsky, High Contrast, Loadstar, Shy FX, Skream, Bar9, Nero and Jacob Plant to name a few.\n\nAs well as a legendary MC known for being risqu\u00e9 in spreading his word, Majestic is also making waves as an artist in his own right. His single \u201cIn The VIP\u201d written and produced with the Wideboys that took a satirical look at the VIP Club culture, was released on Skint Records. After receiving serious hits on YouTube and Radio Support from MistaJam, DJ Target, Kissy Sell Out and Steve Smart on heavy rotation, the record also made its way onto the MOS Bass Culture annual.\nMajestic\u2019s lyrical flow then caught the eye of American Dubstep superstar Skrillex who sampled Majestics legendary, almost anthemic, \u201cRuffneck Bass\u201d spit for his latest massive single of the same title, played by the worlds biggest DJs and over 50m views online.\n\nAfter signing up to be Dubstep wonderkid, Jacob Plant\u2019s official hype man, the pair released, \u201cMosh Pit\u201d on Speakerbox. Majestic has been in the studio collaborating on a number of cutting edge tracks they intend to PA live at their shows. They have already performed for massive student brand Under The Radar on their tour dates up and down the country, as well as for Fresher\u2019s events at all the leading Universities in the UK. Plus having just wowed the crowd at Brighton\u2019s Shakedown festival performing on the main stage in front of 8000 revellers, in-between Razorlight and Example, they are certainly heading for superstar status!\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder Majestic is in demand to perform Live, with Mistajam quoting Majestic as being the \u201cbest live MC in the game\u201d after requesting him to perform alongside him at Exit festival in Serbia and Eddie Temple Morris bringing him onboard The Big Reunion Shows this winter not to mention continuing tours with The Wideboys, the hype has only just begun. After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece. Majestic is also opening for the Prodigy as part of his festival looks with Kiss FM UK.\n\nSo with the Majestic message travelling fast, hyping the crowd into a frenzy, Majestic takes on the role of grand puppeteer, from waiving lighters in the air to chanting back at the DJ, his commands are dutifully followed and quite a sight to behold. Through years of hard graft, quite literally behind the scene, Majestic has studied the sound of the underground for well over a decade. Majestic is realising his destiny as one of the biggest talents to come out of the UK underground scene, infinitely more than just the best live MC in the game.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Bristol Ensemble ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Vishal Dadlani ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9713901.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mohammed Irfan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8159469.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Papon ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Johnny Chops ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8718509.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Blues, Soul-blues, Roots Rock, Blues-rock, Rockabilly", "Time": "3:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Sometimes a side man, sometimes a front man.

But not every artist gets asked by their heroes to join\nthem, as artists, on their stage. It's a compliment that Jacob Moon keeps getting from the\nmusicians who have inspired him since he started as a singer-songwriter out in Hamilton,\nOntario. Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "A different theme every day!

Labels like Schematic in Miami, Interdimensional Transmissions from Detroit & Viewlexx out of The Hague set the foundation for Daze. Daniel Gomez adopted his Daze moniker early on at his mother\u2019s suggestion. Practicing on a set-up she bought him, Daze was spinning at weddings by age 14, funneling his earnings into vinyl to play raves on the side. That eventually led to producing his first tracks in 2004 on a cracked version of Fruity Loops and later that year, he jumpstarted a electro / techno white label called Omniamm. Daze\u2019s risk-taking & punk approach is at the core of everything he does and it\u2019s a big part of the ethos of his current label, Omnidisc. \"We're not searching for chart topping hits. We\u2019re more interested in curating a catalog of music you\u2019ll remember when you walk out the door. We seek out tracks that are as raw as possible & welcome imperfections. We love the charm of an unpolished record\u201d, says Daze. It\u2019s also this freeform & experimental approach together with an element of surprise that sets him apart from the pack as both a DJ & Producer. As a DJ, he prefers to express his versatility across long sets. He is known to cut & weave from Electro to Techno into Italo Disco, into a record by Yazoo deliberately intended to provoke a reaction. \u201cI once played a Paula Abdul record at Berghain\u2026 basically, it\u2019s like it or leave it,\u201d says Daze. As a producer, his output ranges from releases on Kompakt\u2019s Speicher series, to remixes on Phantasy, Comeme, Monkeytown & more\u2026 but he also reaches far beyond techno & has created original runway soundtracks for award winning American streetwear designer John Elliott & the Australian brand Song for the Mute. \"I\u2019m obsessed with the detailed manipulation of audio. It\u2019s at the core of how I make music & I constantly feel the need to involve myself with projects that challenge & allow me to think out of the box... whether it\u2019s creating a single recognizable noise for the new MacBook, or an advert for a fashion campaign blending original music with sound design,\u201d says Daze. Danny Daze\u2019s radical approach to preserving music\u2019s integrity while breaking its boundaries may seem volatile, but it\u2019s not random. \u201cI\u2019ve always gone against the grain & it\u2019s important for everything I do to feel authentic.

As a producer, he has found plenty of ways to express himself musically.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about mood and a housy, hypnotic groove [\u2026] playing those tracks that get you tapping your feet and nodding your head without you realizing it, regardless of tempo, style, or release date. \u201c\n\n2017 / 2018, became one of the most airplayed dj/producer on Dance FM radio with 7 tracks, encouraging him to release the nine EP called \"Going Forward\".\n\n2020 is a year for new challenges.

You\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhy should I care about The Urban Voodoo Machine? They\u2019ve been around for ages, haven\u2019t they? Aren\u2019t they a novelty band who wears funny make-up? Don\u2019t they sometimes play jazz? Aren\u2019t half of them dead or something?\u201d\n\nSo bear with us, sunshine, cos you clearly need educating.\n\nThe story starts with Paul-Ronney Angel, a man with a double-barrelled first name. I could be a wanker about this and say the story starts with Bon Scott-era AC/DC \u2013 with Tom Waits, or the Clash, Louis Armstrong, the Pogues, the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, Johnny Cash, Lionel Bart or Bertolt Brecht \u2013 but let\u2019s stick with Paul-Ronney, it\u2019s quicker.\n\nPaul-Ronney Angel ate his parents and fled the fjords of Norway with just a bottle of moonshine and several slices of decomposing fish in his back pocket. (Before he left they tried him in the Norwegian Army \u2013 he lasted a total of five hours.)\n\nAfter that, Angel washed up in London during the dying breaths of Thatcherism and took advantage of all that swinging London had to offer: he sold The Big Issue, busked Johnny Thunders & Robert Johnson numbers in Soho bus stops and played guitar for anyone who\u2019d have him.\n\nThe Urban Voodoo Machine came to him in 2002 as a fully-formed idea. He\u2019d lead a band who\u2019d play \u2018Bourbon Soaked Gypsy Blues Bop\u2019n\u2019Stroll\u2019. They\u2019d dress in black and red. There would be a LOT of them. And their music would sound like a great night out in a dangerous part of town. From the get-go, The UVM fused junkyard blues and stinging rockabilly with mariachi horns, fiddles, sinister cabaret and punk rock tangos. \u201cI wanted to play rock\u2019n\u2019roll music with a different instrumentation,\u201d says Angel, \u201ctaking inspiration from everything from delta blues, latin and gypsy music without losing the spirit and attitude of punk.\u201d His lyrics \u2013 part Lemmy, part Bob Dylan \u2013 made other (more acclaimed) songwriters sound totally. Fucking. Boring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not Americana and were definitely not \u2018retro\u2019,\u201d says Angel. \u201cI write songs about living in London right now. Although having a shit time, no money, heartbreak, mental illness, addiction and suppression from the big guy is kinda universal and timeless, I guess\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah-yeah-yeah,\u201d you\u2019re thinking, \u201cbut can they cut it live?\u201d Well, there\u2019s a reason why they\u2019ve played Glastonbury, Download, Latitude, Bestival, Hard Rock Calling and toured with The Pogues and New York Dolls. With an act honed alongside the burlesque dancers, snake-charmers and fire-eaters they call friends, The UVM have become one of the greatest live acts in the country \u2013 terrifyingly bizarre, hysterically funny; a riot for the eyes and sensation for the ears: a sing-a-long, drink-a-long, clap-a-long affair.\n\nIn 2006 they launched the Gypsy Hotel Club in the then-unfashionable part of London\u2019s East End, Dalston, a monthly Bourbon Soaked Snake Charmin\u2019 Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Cabaret night for likeminded misfits, movers and shakers. Time Out Magazine wrote, \u201cIf you have 12 hours to live, spend it at Gypsy Hotel!\u201d\n\nMagazines and newspapers have lauded them for their \u201cmariachi-influenced blues, whiskey-soaked country rags and punkabilly-style rave-ups\u201d (The Washington Post) and noted that they\u2019re \u201cdrawing deep from a dirty well where Tom Waits, Nick Cave and Dick Dale are enjoying a burlesque all-nighter with Ennio Morricone\u201d (Classic Rock). They became one of the few bands that could appear on Clive Anderson\u2019s Loose Ends on BBC Radio 4 and Britain\u2019s biggest heavy metal festival Download in the same year and win at both.\n\nIn 2014, when Paul-Ronney named their third album Love, Drink & Death! he had no idea what the year had in store. In October, fiddle-player Rob Skipper died of an accidental heroin overdose, aged just 28. Guitarist Nick Marsh (formerly frontman of Flesh For Lulu) fought throat cancer throughout that year. He died in June 2015, aged 53. The Voodoo Machine transformed themselves into a New Orleans-style marching band for his funeral. The Urban Voodoo Machine Marching Band also played the Classic Rock Awards that year \u2013 the only band to do so without electricity.\n\nAnd that brings us to new album Hellbound Hymns. Marsh plays on eight of its 13 songs. (Angel: \u201cHe was really putting the hours in when he knew the cancer had come back. He was like, \u2018Right, these might be my last recordings with this band, so let\u2019s roll the tape and make it a good one!\u201d) To borrow one of the song titles, it\u2019s all mixed-up. It\u2019s part wake, part protest, part valediction \u2013 a party at the gates of hell \u2013 because the greatest tribute you can pay the dead is to live life to the full: \u201cWe will sing and we will dance/We will drink and we will laugh/We will not forget the past and our fallen brothers\u2026\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Charli XCX ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8363770.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Experimental, Pop, Other", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Elles Bailey ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10387645.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Country, Blues, Blues-rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "They say you get a lifetime to write your first album, then the blink of an eye to make your second.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Rock ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8030110.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Blues, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Rock (born Dwayne Johnson on May 2, 1972) is a professional wrestler turned actor.

He started writing tunes around that time. Later he studied music at the Conservatory in Cologne and also took classes with creative masters such as Dave Holland, Steve Coleman, Muhal Richard Abrams, George Lewis, and Steve Lacy.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2009, he lived in Amsterdam where he became part of that city\u2019s internationally renowned improvised music scene.\nSince 2002, he has been touring internationally with the trio Kaufmann/Gratkowski/de Joode, an improvising unit which has released four CDs so far, to much critical acclaim.\n\nIn the late \u201890s and \u201800s, Achim led two groups with reed player Michael Moore: trio kamosc and gueuledeloup quartet.\nIn 2007, he recorded kyrill, a set of compositions for piano trio featuring Valdi Kolli and Jim Black. Their follow-up cd, entitled verivyr, was released in 2011.\n\nHe has also collaborated with his wife, poet/painter Gabriele Guenther, on the audiodrama Borderline \u2013 From the Shadows of a Journey, and has written music for various chamber ensembles.\nIn his solo work, mixed techniques are used to create a fluctuating world of sounds and gestures. Resonance and reverberation, space and density play an important role in both his solo and ensemble work.\n\nSince his move to Berlin, he got involved in various new projects, such as the trio gr\u00fcnen with Robert Landfermann and Christian Lillinger, Oni Kramler (with Matthias Schubert, Antonio Borghini, and various guests), and a trio with cellist Okkyung Lee and trumpeter Axel D\u00f6rner.\n\nIn 2013, the sextet SKEIN (Kaufmann/Gratkowski/de Joode plus Richard Barrett, Okkyung Lee, and Tony Buck) had its premiere at the dOeK festival in Amsterdam and subsequently recorded for SWR radio.\n\nHe recently released duo albums with long-standing collaborators Michael Moore and Thomas Heberer.\n\nIn addition, Achim has played and/or recorded with Han Bennink, Mark Dresser, George Lewis, Steve Swallow, Tobias Delius, Wolter Wierbos, Mark Helias, Paul Rutherford, Thomas Lehn, Ab Baars, Paul Lovens, Dylan van der Schyff, Peggy Lee, Chris Speed, Tom\u00e1sz Stanko, Gerd Dudek, Bill Elgart, Paul Lytton, Harri Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Andrea Parkins, Harris Eisenstadt, Ingrid Laubrock, Tristan Honsinger, Shelley Hirsch, Steve Swell, Thomas Heberer, Urs Leimgruber, Roger Turner, Fay Victor, Fred Lonberg-Holm, John Hollenbeck, Bob Brookmeyer, Simon Nabatov, L\u00ea Quan Ninh, Gerry Hemingway, John H\u00e9bert, Al Foster, Adam Nussbaum, and many more.\n\nHe was awarded the German SWR Jazz Award in 2001, and the prestigious Albert Mangelsdorff award in 2015.\n\n\u201cFor many years, Achim Kaufmann has been one of the most inspiring and exciting personalities of the European jazz and improvisation scene. His music bears witness to great harmonic subtlety and structural depth. A brilliant pianist and composer, his reflected exploration of tradition has led him to a nuanced, contemporary sound language that encompasses poetry, energy and abstraction in equal measure.\u201d Julia Neupert, SWR Radio\n\nwww.achimkaufmann.com\n\nInto The Shed\nInto The Shed is a concert series focusing on presenting musicians who are all a part of the big and vibrant Berlin jazz and improvised music scene.

He is equally at home playing with jazz veteran Gianluigi Trovesi as he is with Irish sean-n\u00f3s singer Roisin El Safty and with tarantella specialist Lucilla Galeazzi. He has toured with Bobby McFerrin, interpreted the music of Steve Reich with Bang on A Can All Stars and, since 2004, has been a core member of early music ensemble L\u2019 Arpeggiata.

His four beautifully crafted solo albums and two co-led releases have garnered widespread critical acclaim.\nFor Turrisi, tradition and improvisation are not different countries but two sides of the same mountain. Turrisi\u2019s musical traditions - formal and folkloric - span the centuries and a large swathe of the history of European migration. This kaleidoscopic vocabulary - always in flux - provides the grist to Turrisi\u2019s improvisational mill and the rough material from which he crafts his uniquely original, haunting music.\nHis ability to rework ancient melodies and rhythms through a contemporary jazz prism marks him out as one of the most striking voices to have emerged on the European jazz scene in the past decade.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Atreyu ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10386416.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Heavy Metal Thunder", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Web - http://atreyuofficial.com\nMerch - http://atreyu.rockworldmerch.com", "otherInfo": "GET YOUR TICKETS NOW AT BRANDONSALLER.VEEPS.COM\n\nThis will be the most produced performance I have done online to date.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON). The Allaire Show features John sharing the stage with local and up-and-coming talent as well as more experienced and established musicians, some who\u2019ve come from as far away as Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\n\nAWARDS\n- American Songwriter Assoc. \"Best Lyrics\" Award 2009 for \"Magnets\" (Nashville, TN)\n\n- Toronto Independent Music Awards \"Best Live Act\" (2009)\n\n- CBC Telefest top independent music video in Ontario (1989)\n\n- Top independent video in Canada 1989 as selected by MuchMusic\n\n- Canadian College and University Radio Assoc. top album of the month - \"All's Well\" (1989)\n\n- PROCAN (now SOCAN) independent songwriter award for \"Cry at Night\" (1987)", "otherInfo": "Pub Party Fridays brought to you by Flora Hall Brewing.

prolific Brill building pop Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and \u2013 fingers crossed - Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music - and give them an experience that they will never forget.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Every Friday I will transport my viewers into the past where they will feel as thought they are sitting behind the recording console at Motown's Hitsville recording studio.

Released in 2011, it was immediately acclaimed on both sides of the Atlantic.

Billingham writing a dark, noir tale of murder, lust and revenge around 8 King & Dalgleish songs. The Other Half became an album, an audio book, and a stage show and featured contributions from actor David Morrisey and singer songwriter Graham Parker\n\nAfter 18 months of touring The Other Half, including a run at The Edinburgh Festival Michael and Lou returned to the studio for album no. 4. Re-uniting with producer Neil Brockbank, Still Testifying was released in the summer 2017.

In his own way he goes about singing songs from all over the spectrum with an ease that is only fitting of one who is many years older and a prowess on guitar that is singular in its ability to stand alone without accompaniment. Its a wonderful mystery to behold how the essence of any song can be captured so simply by one voice and a guitar, but he does it with originality, taste and an unexpected power for someone who isn\u2019t really on the radar to the wider music community. And it is with a resigned sense of purpose that this 29 year-old Canadian continues to write, interpret and perform music in often the humblest of capacities. This is his path. And he must follow it to the end.\n\n\n\n\u201cI always say \u2018you must inspire yourself, find your path, be true to it and follow it to the end\u2019 because that\u2019s really all that needs to be done in this life. If you can do that then there is nothing to worry about. Whatever your path may be, it will always teach you everything else you need to know about life on the way. For me there is a feeling of obligation to music because it is so clearly the best thing I can offer to the world, but I often fight it in favour of other things only to eventually realize I\u2019m not honouring my true path. So it becomes a balance between seemingly opposing forces that in the end put me right where I need to be.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe opposing force he is referring to is his commitment to a contemplative life of meditation practice. A life traditionally aided by long hours of silence and rigid structure; not a life typically lived by a working musician. After several years of torn aspiration between the life of a Buddhist monk and pursuing a serious music career as a singer/songwriter, Corey is settling somewhat into a situation he feels best serves both of these energies. He feels by maintaining a low-key, almost anonymous attitude to his live performances and online presence he can still allow room to teach guitar (another precious pastime) and spend a few hours alone each day in silent meditation.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the most part I play gigs around here in Southern Ontario. Usually just really ordinary pubs, cafes and restaurants to people who may or may not be listening all that intently but I can show up, play my heart out and leave without having to worry too much about selling tickets, or CD\u2019s and merchandise, trying to make something happen or grow my brand or whatever. I can play covers the way I want, maybe play some originals if I feel like it, work out the kinks of my delivery and be spontaneous. I often don\u2019t even say who I am. Sometimes I don\u2019t really say anything at all. Which is exactly how I go about making my videos as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nOver the years, a devoted worldwide following has sprang up through his YouTube channel where he posts performances of popular and not-so-popular cover songs as well as his own material which has helped define his purpose with music. He plays many kinds of songs without pandering to any one listening demographic and often without much of anything in the way of effects or editing. Just 20 years of craftsmanship and passion on display. The response is overwhelmingly positive as viewers experience the consistent quality and creativity of each performance. Whether its the music of musical heroes or his original songs, its difficult not to be impressed by the standard at which he sets each time he plays.\n\n\n\n\u201cPutting up videos on YouTube has been such a wonderful way for me to exercise my musical freedom and play all the songs I love \u2014 from artists I admire \u2014 and challenge myself to grow as a musician publicly. It allows me to connect with people from all over the world and reminds me why its important for me to do what I\u2019m doing, because they appreciate it. I earn very little money from this medium but its been a constant motivator and mirror for me to reflect and improve which makes it such a valuable aspect of what I do. I really neglected it while I was away travelling recently, which was necessary because I was busy gigging, busking and trying to make ends meet but now that I\u2019m back home with my recording gear I\u2019m looking forward to making videos more consistently.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter spending 18 months in Australia and California doing performances mostly on the street as well as in \u201cordinary pubs and restaurants\u201d half a world away, Corey has returned to Canada and settled in Kitchener, Ontario where he performs regularly, teaches students and still finds time for silence and meditation. Always following his path.

Castillo\u2019s uncle would come home on leave from the Navy and play guitar on the front porch, and Castillo\u2019s father aspired to play just like his older brother. Tragically, his uncle lost his life serving in the Navy and his father\u2014now the oldest son and responsible for his family\u2014never learned to play like he wanted. \u201cAs he got older [my father] said, \u2018If I ever have a son, I want to put a guitar in his hands and make sure he learns to play,\u2019\u201d Castillo says, and to honor the brother he lost, Castillo\u2019s father put a guitar into his son\u2019s hands at a very early age. His mother also loved music. She encouraged him to sing and find harmonies as she introduced him to all kinds of music, and both his father and mother\u2014a \u201ccloset poet\u201d and \u201cgrammar queen,\u201d respectively\u2014encouraged their son to write. It was no surprise then when their son was fronting bands and performing his own music by the time he was 13. With the bands he was in during middle and high school, Castillo would work his own original music into sets of well-known covers at parties and festivals, and the reaction was always very positive. \u201cIt always seemed that every time I\u2019d announce, \u2018Here\u2019s a song that I wrote,\u2019 it immediately drew people in, which caught my attention,\u201d Castillo recalls. \u201cI saw that people all the sudden weren\u2019t just out there dancing and having a good time, their attention was on the song that I\u2019d written. The reaction of those first few folks\u2014they don\u2019t realize it, the influence they had\u2014as they were out there listening and giving me those words of encouragement after they heard the songs, it really encouraged me to continue with the song writing. It really set me on the path that I\u2019m on today.\u201d Despite his early success, he didn\u2019t immediately run off to Nashville to pursue a record deal; his family assumed that first he would get a college education, though they encouraged him to continue with his music while doing so. However, avoiding the temptation to quit college wasn\u2019t easy when record labels started showing interest during his sophomore year. \u201cIt kind of scared my folks a little bit, because they thought that I was just going to stop everything and pack my bags and move to Nashville. It just seemed like the right thing at that point in time.\u201d It was the advice of friend Casey Monahan at the Texas Music Office that persuaded him he could do both, a decision he\u2019s happy with in retrospect: \u201cI often look back at that moment and I know that it didn\u2019t have a huge an impact. If I had moved over there, it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. I was still able to do everything they wanted us to do, but at the same time we were still able to take care of things at home and I was able to continue my education.\u201d Over the last 15 years\u2014through his formative years, his time at the University of Texas, and up to the present day\u2014Castillo has written over a thousand songs for himself and other artists, 25 percent of which are in Spanish. His songwriting strays from that of many other artists, as his music is often more specific and personal than other artists\u2019 music. \u201cA lot of the stuff is based on life experiences and stuff that I\u2019ve gone through, personal stories,\u201d Castillo says of his songwriting. \u201cI try to take actual stories and actual experiences and lay them out in that three and a half minute length of a song.\u201d For Castillo, the joy of songwriting isn\u2019t in mass appeal, but connecting on a deeper, more-personal level with his listeners. \u201cI want to write about real things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about writing the basic love songs where everybody can relate. I want to write about stuff that people out there listening can actually hold on to and say, \u201cThat\u2019s my song. That guy wrote that song about my life and what I\u2019m going through.\u201d His latest single, \u201cThe Flip Side of Sober,\u201d was released on July 4, and is apart of a full CD release entitled The Hombre that Castillo expects to be released in late September. Other songs on the 16-track album include the classic Leo Sayer hit, \u201cMore Than I Can Say\u201d (one of his mother\u2019s favorites), and unofficial Texas High School football anthem, \u201cAny Given Friday.\u201d \u201cSome of my fellow artists and writers are like, \u2018Man you\u2019re nuts. You\u2019re the only one who would serve up that many songs in one project,\u2019\u201d Castillo remarks. \u201cBut hey, it\u2019s music. I\u2019m cranking it out. I feel blessed to be able to write as much as I do. It gives me an opportunity to share some of myself with the fans.\u201d By Andrew Miller, Nashville Music Guide", "otherInfo": "J.R.

The younger brother of Cajun fiddler Michael Doucet, Doucet has used his distinctive hybrid of folk-style fingerpicking and bluegrass-like flatpicking to strengthen the performances of Beausoleil, the band he's shared with his brother for over 21 years. With the release of his debut solo album, Quand J'ai Parti in 1991, Doucet successfully stepped into the spotlight.\nDoucet first played the guitar after recuperating from a broken arm sustained while practicing with his high school football team. Although he initially taught himself to play by using Bob Dylan and Paul Simon songbooks, Doucet became fascinated with flatpicking after listening to an album by Doc Watson.\n\nTogether with his brother and banjo player Raoul Breaux, Doucet played Cajun music in Louisiana clubs in 1975. When the project proved commercially unsuccessful, the band broke up with Doucet enrolling in college and his brother going on to form the Cajun rock band Coteau and the original lineup of Beausoleil. A turning point in Doucet's evolution as a guitarist came when he heard the playing of the late Clarence White on an album, The Kentucky Colonels 1965-1967, in 1980. Inspired by White's use of unusual chords and imaginative melodies, Doucet began to develop his own unique style.\n\nAlthough Doucet did not play on Beausoleil's first recording session in Paris, he joined the group before the recording of their debut album, The Spirit of Cajun Music, in 1976.\n\nGrand Texas Doucet moved to New Orleans, where he continues to reside, in 1980 to work at the World's Fair. In addition to his solo album and recordings with Beausoleil, Doucet was featured on albums by Chuck Guillory (Grand Texas), Octa Clark & Hector Duhon (Ensemble Encore) and Michael Doucet (Dit BeauSoleil).\nDoucet was accompanied on Quand J'ai Parti by members of Beausoleil (Michael Doucet, Jimmy Breaux, Tommy Comeaux, Billy Ware and Tommy Alesi) and influential dobro player Josh Graves, whom he met during a \"Legends of Folk Violin\" tour.\n\n\nMore to come", "otherInfo": "A weekly show of tunes I play now and used to play long ago.

Whether it was \u201cLet it Be\u201d by The Beatles, \u201cBorn to Run\u201d by Bruce Springsteen (a fellow New Jersey native), or \u201cIt\u2019s My Party\u201d by Leslie Gore she was into it. A 90\u2019s baby herself, Bowman\u2019s knowledge and love for music spans decades. Inspired by pop acts and bands of the 90\u2019s in particular she knew she wanted to pursue music at an early age. After graduating high school, not having a clue how to pursue a career in music, she started going into New York City looking to meet with producers and songwriters who might want to work with her. After several failed auditions, several unreturned phone calls, and a little bit of heartbreak she met a producer who saw something in her. Bowman, only a singer at the time began recording songs written by the producer. Suggesting she start writing herself, with the melody and concept already started Bowman alongside her producer finished writing what would be her first single \u201cProblem.\u201d \u201cProblem\u201d was added to Sirius XM 20 on 20 and in 2 weeks was a top 5 requested song. Her next single \u201cKing Boy\u201d trumped her first becoming the 5th most played song of the year on Sirius XM 20 on 20 while also selling over 20,000 copies, a major feat for an independent artist.\n\nWith the success of her first 2 releases Bowman found herself writing with more and more producers/songwriters. She had been working on new music with a writer at Warner Chappell Publishing when the synch team there received a request for a song about staying warm. Alongside the producer Bowman wrote \u201cKeep Me Warm,\u201d a release that would play in a national McDonald\u2019s ad campaign for over a month, as well as receive airplay on 3 different radio formats: Top 40, Hot AC, and AC.\n\nContinuing to work alongside different writers/producers she caught the attention of Kobalt Music. A publishing company who\u2019s rosters includes the likes of Max Martin, Mumford and Sons, Simon and Garfunkel, Lionel Richie, Dixie Chicks, Beck, and countless other successful artists and songwriters. Eventually signed to a Kobalt publishing deal herself Bowman released \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d through AWAL, Kobalt\u2019s global artist services company. \u201cGood Time Good Life\u201d debuted on NBC\u2019s This Is Us, ran in a national Target ad, a national Beaches Resort ad, and was chosen by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to drive The Oscar\u2019s 2017 promo aired on ABC for over 2 months. The Oscar promo lead to Bowman\u2019s national TV debut on Good Morning America where she performed \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d followed up with a performance at the Radio Disney Music Awards, and Live with Kelly and Ryan.\n\nWith the success of \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d and a move out west (a NJ native now in Los Angeles) Bowman found herself working on music going in a slightly different direction. She was doing less co-writes and found herself writing everyday on her own. Songs started pouring out of her. Her life was changing and the music she was writing was some of the realest she had ever written. In March of 2018 Bowman found herself traveling to London to explore a new city and work on new music. A NJ native, now based in Los Angeles, traveling to London. It was on a whim that she decided to attend an open mic night where she\u2019d perform a couple of her new songs for the first time. It was at that open mic night that she would meet the 2 cowriters/producers that would bring this new direction of music, this new project, to life. Bowman traveled back to London for over a month in the summer and in the fall to work on what will be her first ever EP.

Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Doobie Decibel System ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7057985.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 22 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-22", "Genre": "Jam Rock, Psychedelic Rock, Folk, Rock", "Time": "11:20 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Doobie Decibel System (DDS) Trio features Jason Crosby, Roger McNamee, and Dan \u201cLebo\u201d Lebowitz.

Though he remains among the most pop-friendly of today's singer-songwriters - his songs regularly appear in hit movie and TV soundtracks , fans say he has bridged the gulf between the modern folk sound and the populist traditions of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger more successfully than any of his songwriting peers. According to an article by Stephen Thanabalan in Rolling Stone Magazine, Paul's style has also been most notably influential in the late 1990s thru mid 2000s with his prescience vis a vis his unique music and sound: featuring a combination of dextrously deep and smooth vocals as well as raw guitar 'roots' stylistics; emulated most evidently in the industry in ensuing years with the mainstream emergence of melancholic rock and folk pop solo artistes like Rascal Flatts, James Blunt, Damien Rice and Jack Johnson.", "otherInfo": "ELLIS PAUL\u2019S TRAVELING MEDICINE SHOW Returns this Friday May 22nd at 7:30pm EST on Facebook Live at Ellis Paul Music and More!

It\u2019s a word that keeps recurring in any conversation with Chin Injeti, the talented artist/writer/producer associated with three GRAMMY Award-winning projects, two JUNO Awards, and who is also a co-founder of innovative R&B trio, Bass Is Base. And no wonder: the Vancouver-based Injeti barely has enough fingers to place in the various stylistic musical pies he\u2019s juggling, including his latest solo record entitled, The Reverb. Named after a long defunct Toronto nightclub club that offered a wide palate of musical diverse in its weekly programming, the 14 funky and euphoric tracks of delightful groove-a-lusciousness that comprise The Reverb reveal Injeti\u2019s adaptability as a musical chameleon. You\u2019ll find a little bit of everything in the 40+minute opus: a smattering of trip-hop during \u201cAround The Outside\u201d, rock exuberance to \u201cThrowback;\u201d a touch of floating ambience to the dreamy \u201cI Don\u2019t Know Where We Are\u201d, and some gritty funkiness to \u201cOn the Run.\u201d Basically, Injeti is a walking encyclopedia of musical knowledge, and he\u2019s constantly tapping into his own brain to source it. \u201cOne of my biggest tools is my knowledge of music, more than my beat-making or my playing abilities,\u201d Injeti admits. \u201cI\u2019m one of those people that when I produce a record, I could tell you what I\u2019m trying to do, reference it, tell you who played on it, when it was recorded, why it was recorded. I\u2019m a nerd like that. It really helps me when I make records.\u201d It\u2019s a task that has not only served him well on his own work, but the impressive list of clients he\u2019s amassed in the past few years, many with his production partner DJ Khalil.

One listen to his smoky, soulful croon and the breezy way his songs half-step and skip smoothly along the stage, and his hometown Chicago roots are obvious. It was there that Splithoff cut his teeth as a songwriter and performer, and he carried that warm, compositional adventurousness with him to his next and current stop in New York City. The urban soul of the Big Apple taught him to treat the swarms of people buzzing around him as an audience ripe for his evolving pop sound. As Splithoff has grown and moved across various gritty concrete landscapes, so too has his music, which deftly incorporates myriad elements from his surroundings and packages them into one unmistakable pop-soul-dance-urban experience. Splithoff\u2019s style is far from the kitchen-sink mentality permeating much of today\u2019s airwaves: one of his strongest skills may be his ability to draw from his deep bag of tricks\u2014piano, guitar, melody, rhythm\u2014 with precision and harnessed emotion. Now, 2016 finds him writing, touring, and releasing new material, with his sights set on expanding well beyond the two cities of his origin.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B.

He's showing. Appropriately titled, the song \"Country\" is as much positioning statement as introduction. In three minutes and 16 seconds, it is almost precisely who he is in word and deed. The vocal delivery, storytelling, musicianship and reflections of his outdoor lifestyle \u2013 as well as faith, family and patriotism \u2013 offer a spot-on portrayal. Joined by early fan favorites \"Clean Up On Aisle Five\" and \"Come Do A Little Life,\" the song carves an unmistakably country yet completely fresh groove for the genre. In short, it sounds like nothing else, but absolutely belongs.\n\nTo paraphrase the song, a life in music isn't a place on a map; it's a place in Mo Pitney's heart. \"I just love music,\" Pitney says, exhibiting atypical maturity for someone still in their early twenties. \"It has never been about praise. Playing the Grand Ole Opry was an amazing experience, but I have just as much fun sitting on my bed playing along to an old record. It's always been that way.\"\n\nThat music-centered outlook is already generating the unsought acclaim of which he speaks. Perhaps the best example is the aforementioned Opry performance. \"Everybody asked me if I was nervous, but I don\u2019t think I was,\" he says. \"I definitely thought about it a lot more than I normally do. My respect for that stage and the circle is great.\n\nFor his first song, he selected \"Clean Up On Aisle Five\" and eyed one goal: to sing his heart out. \"I didn't feel like anybody was sucked into the song at all, but when it was over I stepped back from the microphone and people erupted,\" he says. A standing ovation approaching a full minute ensued. \"After about 30 seconds, I stepped forward to say something because I thought I heard them dying down, but they just got louder. I lost it. It took me about a week to come off that feeling.\"\n\nThat pivotal moment capped a journey that started in the red brick town of Cherry Valley, IL, where Mo grew up loving the outdoors. \"Right out my back door was a lake about a mile away,\" he says. \"I'd ride my bike there with a fishing pole on each handlebar, like two tridents sticking out in front of me.\"\n\nMusic was a family affair, and Pitney picked up the drums at six and guitar at 12. \"I learned how to play with a cast on my arm by laying a rag over my dad's guitar so it wouldn't get scratched,\" he says. \"Johnny Cash At San Quentin was my introduction to playing music. I learned the whole album.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, he played two Cash songs at an open mic night \u2013 his first public performance. \"After I played, I saw a guy backstage playing a banjo, so I picked that up for a couple of years. By age 15, I grabbed the guitar again playing lead acoustic, my brother played bass and we had a friend who played mandolin.\" His affection for bluegrass led him to Keith Whitley. \"When I heard him sing it helped me bridge over into country music. I started hearing great country songs, songwriters and singers ... and I just fell in love.\"\n\nEncouraged to move to Nashville by a songwriting friend, Pitney was the uncommon arrival who receives early interest from record labels. He signed with Curb and began working on bringing his songs and sound into alignment with his musical vision. One of the lynchpins was connecting with his producer, Tony Brown (George Strait).\n\n\"Instead of trying to put some songs together to come out of my mouth and create an artist with my face, Tony said, 'I want to find out who you are, pull it out of you and put it on tape.' It wasn\u2019t just the way he said it, it was in everything he did. Realizing I can create a record the way I want to and use the musicians I want was an eye-opening experience. We recorded my vocals while I was sitting on a stool and playing guitar at the same time, so it\u2019s a live record in a lot of ways. My hands were untied.\"\n\nAs music lovers become exposed to his music, rousing receptions may be something he'll become accustomed to seeing. But they won't change Mo's core motivation. \"Even if this thing doesn\u2019t go huge, I believe that I can make a decent living playing music,\" he says. \"And I always knew that I could do that. When I was younger, my plan was bluegrass. I used to buy and sell cars, I did body work and I trained bird dogs. I figured I would just kind of piddle around, doing different things around the music.\n\n\"People who have done this for a long time think there's a place for my music, and I hope that's the case. My eyes are set on being successful, but success is not number one for me. If I can make a comfortable living and have a career making music and keep my head on straight, that\u2019s my goal. And I think that I have a great opportunity to do that if I don\u2019t get ahead of myself.\"\n\nAnd that kind of seasoned perspective isn't often heard from someone of his generation. \"I\u2019m a God-fearing man,\" he says. \"I love simple things. I love simplicity in songs because I love simplicity in life. But I\u2019m also very deep, which is weird. I\u2019m a thinker. And I go so deep, a lot of times I just confuse myself and get frustrated, but when I come home and my dog runs and jumps up on my lap, that does something to my spirit. I love to hunt and fish. I love the outdoors. I love my family. I try to live pretty morally square. Pretty clean guy. I\u2019ve got my problems, but I try to stay pretty straight.\"\n\nPerhaps the best expression of how Mo Pitney has created his own definition of country music success is found in \"Behind This Guitar,\" a song by Don Sampson and Phil O'Donnell that may not even make the album. \"People tell me I can\u2019t cut it because the chorus says, 'Behind this guitar there\u2019s just a boy who had a dream in his heart, behind this guitar there\u2019s just a guy that can\u2019t believe he got this far.' And they point out that I haven't gotten anywhere yet, so save it for the second album. But I remember sitting on my bed with the dream of just making music the rest of my life. It wasn\u2019t that I had to be on radio or even make a living doing it. I just loved music. Now I\u2019m on the Opry. I have a record deal. And I\u2019m loving the music that I\u2019m making. I can't believe I got this far!\n\n\"I\u2019m probably just going to cut the song.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Just Joe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9802389.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Piano Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Joe Altier is JUST JOE.\n\nBorn and raised in Syracuse, Joe learned to play piano and started singing around the age of five. Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011.

His songs tell heartfelt stories about real people, and are unfailingly optimistic and forward looking. In addition to being a Billboard Top 10 recording artist, he is also the winner of Best Americana Artist by the Indie Music Channel, and two Grammy certificates, awarded in 2017. He performs frequently in southern Appalachia: Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia - however he has performed everywhere from the Troubadour in Los Angeles to Carnegie Hall in New York, and most places in between.

Equally at home as a solo artist and with his Nashville band, Grant is an engaging performer who delights audiences with his southern humor and passion.\n\nHis most recent album \"Dust Bowl - American Stories\" spent 17 weeks on the Billboard charts, including eleven weeks in the TOP 10 of the Americana/Folk Album Sales Chart, and reached as high as #12 on the Country Album Sales Chart, and #2 on the Heatseekers Chart (across all genres).

The\nMomentum Label Group recording artist was raised in the wild of Kodiak, Alaska, and has been making\nher mark in Nashville and country music.\n\nLynae, who is adept at combining deep, vivid, moving country storytelling with the edge of guitar-driven\nrock and the big hooks of pop, is reminiscent of Shania Twain, who was the queen of country-pop during\nthe \u201890s.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fitting since Shania is a big influence,\u201d Lynae says. \u201cI loved her music when I was growing up and\nnow I think about why we loved her records so much. She and Mutt Lange made big sounding albums\nwith memorable melodies, that stick in your head.\u201d\n\nLynae is doing the same with her two new latest cuts, \u201cWhole Lotta Nothin'\u201d and \u201cQuicksand.\u201d The\nformer is a clever, playful and catchy tune, which is the antidote to the unrelenting pace, which is the\nnorm in our society. Singer-songwriter Hannah Bethel hit Lynae and David Myhre (fellow co-writer) with a melody idea and the songsmiths were off and running.\n\n\u201cHannah came up with something that was so cool melodically,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cAnd then we started talking about how busy we are and how it\u2019s just non-stop. I said, \u2018wouldn\u2019t it be great to take a vacation\nand just hang out\u2019 and that set the mood of the song. What it comes down to is that if you can\u2019t take a vacation, then take a three-minute hiatus from your to-do list with this song.\u201d\n\nThe tune became a fan favorite and was included on Apple Music's \"Country A-List\" along with the likes of country superstars Miranda Lambert and Little Big Town.\n\nAnd then there is the gritty and powerful \u201cQuicksand,\u201d which is Lynae\u2019s latest single. The uber catchy tune was written by songwriter and Emerson Drive member Danick Dupelle, who came in and played a little groove on his guitar and Lynae said, \u2018that sounds like quicksand.\u2019 So along with songwriter Patricia Conroy, they played around with some 'oohs' for the melody, then focused on relationships that feel like you're stuck and sinking in quicksand.\n\n\"I think we all have stepped into 'quicksand' at one time or another when it comes to relationships, so we figured, why not try to save someone a little heartache,\" said Lynae.\n\nHowever, Lynae\u2019s career is in anything but quicksand. She is morphing at warped speed as a well-rounded force after recording her eponymous self-titled debut which dropped in April 2014. She has been touring across the country performing with some of country music's most celebrated artists including Keith Urban, The Band Perry, Maddie & Tae, Kelsea Ballerini and many more. She has also performed the National Anthem at several high profile Major League baseball games and ranked among the Top 25 artists spanning all music genres on Macy's iHeart Radio Rising Stars national campaign. Most recently, Lynae was included in CMT's Artist Discovery Campaign, which recognizes emerging artists they feel have promising futures ahead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m evolving,\u201d Lynae says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking bigger picture. For me I\u2019m not just concentrating on the songs. I\u2019m thinking about everything. I\u2019m involved with the production. I\u2019ve been co-producing with Jamie (O'Neal) and I\u2019m focusing on all things sonically. When I\u2019m writing I\u2019m thinking about everything from the background vocals to special effects to how the song will be arranged. I think about the solo parts on a track. I\u2019m learning how to be a well-rounded musician. What I want to make is ear candy without it sounding too busy kind of like how Shania and Mutt Lange did it.\u201d\n\nLynae can\u2019t help but hark back to when Shania ruled the pop and country chart. Lynae waxes about an era when love songs were in vogue, which is a stark contrast in this era, which toasts conspicuous consumption and frivolity.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re starting to miss the \u201890s and early 2000\u2019s,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cThat was when country music had so many stories that touched on deeper parts of life. However, the recent trend is party songs, which have their place. But there\u2019s something about love songs. That\u2019s what I love to write most. Love is something everyone can relate to. If you\u2019ve never been in love, you yearn for it. If you found love, it\u2019s the most amazing thing that has surpassed anything you\u2019ve ever experienced. Or you could have had love and been crushed beyond your wildest imagination. I think it\u2019s time for love songs to return and for ladies to be on top again.\u201d\n\nLynae will be blazing the way with her big black boots and empowering songs. Like her music, Lynae\u2019s fashion is a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll. \u201cThe way a performer dresses is another form of expression,\u201d Lynae said. \u201cI have that rocker thing going on but I still incorporate the country. I might wear my boots and then have some fringe to blend country and rock, like my sound.\u201d\n\nUnlike many 20-somethings, Lynae understands the art of live performance and delivers onstage like a grizzled veteran. Lynae engages the audience and is often at her best when living in the moment.\n\n\u201cThe more you prepare for a show, the more spontaneous you can be when you perform,\u201d the sage Lynae said. \u201cWhen you have it all down, you can step outside the box. During a recent show in Seattle a microphone literally fell apart. Instead of losing it up there, I just poked fun at the situation. Everyone laughed.

Instead it was his dad that helped shape his musical palate as father and son first farmed together and then worked side by side building custom motorcycles, motors and restoring classic cars, all to dad\u2019s soundtrack of Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Dr. Hook.\n\nDustin attended college ultimately earning a Master's degree and landing a job in corporate banking. In the end, his career took him far from the finance world as he became the owner of his own business building muscle cars for six years, but even the need for speed didn\u2019t give him what he truly wanted.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to play music,\u201d says Olson. \u201cEven when I was working in racing and had my shop, I would always go see live music and wish I could do that.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2009 that Dustin mentioned to his brother Jared how he wished he could play. Remembering that conversation Jared, a guitar player himself, gifted Dustin a jet black Stratocaster. Dustin dove in but like most guitar students, got frustrated and within a few months he put the guitar down, opting instead to run sound for a local country band. That led to Dustin hosting open mic nights at a local bar which reignited his desire to play, so much so he walked into a local guitar shop and walked out with his new best friend, an acoustic Taylor guitar.\n\nFrom that point his sole focus was learning to play, eventually learning enough chords to play George Strait\u2019s \u201cTroubadour.\u201d Excited he showed his brother who immediately insisted on dragging Dustin onstage to perform it with him that night. That night turned into another night, and another, until Dustin formally joined his brother and Melissa Olson to become a full-fledged acoustic trio performing gigs all over the area as The Olson Band.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Olson formed his own band, the Blue Collar Rebellion. Playing many of the same bars, Olson performed primarily covers but introduced his newfound fans to the likes of \u2018red dirt\u2019 country. Artists like Cross Canadian Ragweed, Pat Green, Bart Crow, Randy Rogers, Charlie Robison filled his set lists and began to lay the groundwork for the songwriter Dustin was becoming.\n\nWhile he became more and more comfortable onstage, it was the loss of his mother in October of 2013 that solidified his belief in himself. On the day of her memorial service he and his brother strapped on their guitars and performed their mom\u2019s favorite song, Eric Church\u2019s \u201cLike Jesus Does\u201d and likewise played it again at their show that night. Understandably the second time around was too much but Dustin got through the tears, the song and the show because he knew that\u2019s what his mom would want him to do.\n\nBy 2015 Dustin was taking regular trips to Nashville. The visits got more frequent and Nashville got harder and harder to leave to the point he eventually gave in to his heart, selling his business and in early 2016 making the move to Music City.\n\n\u201cIt was exactly where I wanted to be and scary as hell all at the same time. I don\u2019t think I played out live for the first nine months I lived in Nashville because everyone is so good.\u201d\n\nThe days of self-doubt are now a thing of the past as Olson has forged a number of friendships and writing partnerships with some of Nashville\u2019s songwriting elite, some even considering him in that circle as well. Now with a fully loaded band behind him the time has come to pack up his guitar, load up his growing list of songs and take it all out where it needs to be to breathe \u2013 out on the road.\n\n\n\nThe Music\n\nAfter countless hours of songwriting and the production brilliance of Marc \"Butter\" Fortney (Trailer Choir) Dustin's debut EP, \"Prayer Of A Simple Man,\" was released in November of 2017. The album reached as high as #14 on the iTunes country Pre-Order chart and debuted in the top 100 on the iTunes country chart on release day. Since its release the songs of \"Prayer of a Simple Man\" have gathered nearly 25,000 streams and racked up over 20,000 music video views in 2018 alone.\n\n\n\nMoving forward 2019 is already shaping up to be a big year with a whole bunch of new music and new tour locations already on the calendar. Dustin's next single, \"Memories We Didn't Make,\" is set to release on March 1st and is a complete change of pace from the fun party songs that made up his debut EP. This new single, inspired by a breakup, shows a softer more fragile side of Dustin that we have not previously seen. Dustin is planning on releasing at least two more songs by the end of the summer and using all of that forward momentum and new material to take his touring and music to the next level throughout the year.", "otherInfo": "\ud83d\udce3NEW MUSIC ALERT! 05.08.20 Pre-Save \"Make You Fall\" Today! https://ffm.to/makeyoufall.opr\n\nThen join me for a first listen on May 8th.

Dedicating their 1996 debut 'Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi' to bossa nova pioneer Antonio Carlos Jobim, the Washington, D.C.-based duo have spent nearly two decades creating boundary-warping, complexly crafted electronic music partly inspired by bossa nova\u2019s intricate rhythms and lush textures. Now, with their seventh studio album 'Saudade,' Thievery Corporation present their first release devoted entirely to the Brazilian-born genre that first connected them. \u201cWe always try to progress into something different and stretch our musical chops, and taking a whole album to dive into this one sound seemed like a really great way to do that,\u201d says Hilton. Adds Garza: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a departure for us, but at the same time these are our roots, this is what brought us together. It\u2019s us coming full circle from electronic music back to something organic before we move on to our next chapter.\u201d\n\nReleased on their own label ESL Music, 'Saudade' borrows its title from a Portuguese word meaning \u201ca longing for something or someone that is lost, a contented melancholy, or, simply, the presence of absence.\u201d \u201cSaudade is the essence or feeling of true bossa nova,\u201d explains Hilton, who names \u201cthose warm, soulful, melancholic vocals\u201d as one of the elements of bossa nova that\u2019s most alluring to him. Drawing influence from classic Brazilian performers like Antonio Carlos Jobim, Gal Costa, and Luis Bonf\u00e1\u2014along with Serge Gainsbourg, Ennio Morricone, and more modern artists like electro-samba pioneer Isabelle Antena\u2014Saudade achieves its delicate yet deeply sensuous sound with the help of more than a dozen guest musicians. With each track sung by one of five female vocalists (including longtime Thievery cohort LouLou Ghelichkhani, newcomer Elin Melgarejo, Nouvelle Vague singer Karina Zeviani, Argentine chanteuse Natalia Clavier, and former Bitter:Sweet singer/songwriter Shana Halligan), the endlessly mesmerizing album also features such guests as U.N.K.L.E. drummer Michael Lowery, Argentine singer/songwriter Federico Aubele, and master Brazilian percussionist Roberto Santos.\n\nAlthough Thievery Corporation stay true to traditional bossa nova\u2019s elegant fusion of samba and jazz all throughout 'Saudade,' the album is rich with strange and wonderful flourishes that revel in the duo\u2019s hyper-inventive tendencies. Opening with the dusky \u201cD\u00e9collage,\u201d 'Saudade' glides from the smoldering and string-drenched \u201cQuem Me Leva\u201d to the hushed and mysterious \u201cSola In Citta\u201d (an Italian-sung nod to the legendary sound tracks of Ennio Morricone, featuring Wurlitzer electric piano by Enea Diotaiuti) to the sweetly ethereal \u201cNo More Disguise\u201d (a dream-like piece laced with orchestral strings and bolero rhythms). With the instrumental title track serving as its gently stunning centerpiece, 'Saudade' also offers the sultry and spacey\u201cClaridad\u201d (a swaying Latin number propelled by analog organ beats) and the French lullaby of \u201cLe Coeur\u201d (featuring the sublime saxophone work of Frank Mitchell, Jr.). And on the final track \u201cDepth of My Soul,\u201d Halligan delivers a haunting vocal performance that merges with the song\u2019s swirling symphonic soundscape to hypnotic effect.\n\nOver the years, Thievery Corporation have given nods to their bossa-nova influence on individual album tracks, slipping those quietly enchanting songs into recordings that reveal the duo\u2019s careful studying of everything from Jamaican dub reggae to punk to vintage film soundtracks to psychedelic space rock. After coming up with sketches for several bossa-nova-style numbers while recording their last studio album (2011\u2019s Culture of Fear), Garza and Hilton considered releasing an EP showcasing a handful of Brazilian-inspired songs. \u201cThe more we worked on those songs, the more we got into the vibe of that vintage, organic sound,\u201d recalls Hilton. \u201cMaking an album fully dedicated to that sound felt like a good idea, especially at a time when the electronic dance music world is so saturated and there\u2019s not much of a focus on musicianship.\u201d Rather than feeling hemmed in by the unfamiliar approach of creating music solely in one style, Thievery Corporation found a great deal of freedom in writing and recording the songs that make up 'Saudade.' \u201cIn a way it was really liberating to do something out of our wheelhouse, to put ourselves in a totally different mindset and immerse ourselves in this one particular genre,\u201d notes Garza.\n\nIntense musical exploration has always been essential to Thievery Corporation, a project hatched in 1995 when Hilton and Garza were introduced by a mutual friend at Washington, D.C.\u2019s Eighteenth Street Lounge\u2014a popular gathering spot for musicians that\u2019s co-owned by Hilton. Soon after making their 1996 debut with two underground hit vinyl singles(\u201cShaolin Satellite\u201d and \u201c2001 Spliff Odyssey\u201d) and 'Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi,' the duo became loosely associated with the trip-hop scene that had newly emerged in the UK. In 2000, they released 'Mirror Conspiracy,' which introduced live vocalists (including Bebel Gilberto and the late Pam Bricker) into the project\u2019s mix. Following 2002\u2019s 'The Richest Man in Babylon' and 2005\u2019s 'The Cosmic Game' (featured politically minded collaborations with Perry Farrell, Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne, and David Byrne), Thievery Corporation put out 2006\u2019s 'Versions' (a compilation of their remixes of songs by such artists as Sarah McLachlan, Astrud Gilberto, Anoushka Shankar, and The Doors). By then, Garza and Hilton were itching to evolve past their reputation as ambassadors of the downtempo scene, and began to conjure up more subversive recordings that reflected their passion for social activism, as heard on both 2008\u2019s 'Radio Retaliation' and 'Culture of Fear.'\n\nNow on 'Saudade,' Thievery Corporation are once again changing direction, trading the fiery energy of their last two albums for a wistful mood and summery spirit\u2014a shift that both members found highly refreshing. \u201cEven though we\u2019re very socially conscious, it\u2019s nice to take a break from the political theme and just concentrate creating some beautiful songs in the same vein as all these old records that we love,\u201d says Garza. And as one ofthe most influential and respected names on the electronic/dance music scene, Thievery Corporation also discovered their own breed of rebellion and innovation in committing themselves to a time-worn genre on 'Saudade.'\u201cWe\u2019re still chopping up beats, but this time we\u2019re making them sound warm and vintage\u2014which is not at all what\u2019s happening in electronic music right,\u201d says Hilton. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is pretty traditional and timeless-sounding, and in that it\u2019s completely contrarian.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join our global community for a special event class led by Janet Stone, with live music by Rob Garza of the legendary electronic duo Thievery Corporation.

HuDost\u2019s core musicians are Moksha Sommer and Jemal Wade Hines. Having toured the US, Canada, and Europe constantly since April 2006, HuDost has grown and expanded, travelled rocky and glorious terrain and marveled at all they can learn and explore. Moksha and Jemal Wade, in this time have grown as artists, as seekers, as a couple and as a family. In 2013 their amazing son was brought into the world. Since 2015 they have also been highly engaged activists, doing advocacy work as KY Congressional District Representatives for ONE (a non-profit organization working to end extreme poverty and, specifically, the sexism of poverty).\n\nHuDost is currently in the studio recording a new album with Vance Powell who is a top tier producer/mixer who\u2019s worked with artists such as Jack White (White Stripes), Chris Stapleton, Pearl Jam, Willie Nelson, Buddy Guy, Beyonce, Beck, Alicia Keys, Melissa Etheridge, Kings of Leon and a slew of others. And, to add to this excitement, Dan Haseltine from the Grammy winning band Jars of Clay has been on board to help with production! This album will be released in early 2019.\n\nHuDost functions as a duo (with the core musicians Moksha Sommer and Jemal Wade Hines) or as a band, including guest musicians of varying sensibilities and backgrounds, and often including dance in their shows. As a duo their instrumentation includes vocals, harmonium (Indian Pump-Organ), NORD Keys, guitars, Dulcinet, percussion, and a slew of sonic ambient effects. Their music is a rich, eclectic blending of Pop and Rock with traditional Sufi music, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian and Balkan folk music, Farsi, Turkish, Arabic, and Folk. Their sound crosses all borders and barriers, taking the listener on a journey they will never forget.\n\nHighlight Performances Include Bonnaroo, Resident band at FloydFest, BhaktiFest, World Caf\u00e9 Live, Blissfest, The ARK, Alex Grey\u2019s CoSM, the Salvador Dali Museum, Beloved Festival, headlining The Islands Folk Fest (Vancouver), The Levitt Pavilions, WoodSongs at the Kentucky Theater (on PBS), Nashville\u2019s Bluebird Caf\u00e9, Music City Roots, Tim Robbins\u2019 WTF?!

In 2008, Moksha went through a painful process of brain surgery due to a tumor. The healing from this included re-learning language skills, losing and regaining proper sight, and experiencing seizures. This could have been staggering but instead served as learning that has fueled a potent desire to bring healing through sound. It is through music that the losses and gains, pains and triumphs, and excruciating beauty of life can be given a voice of empathy to the synonymous lives of all people. Both critics and fans have said time and time again that the music of HuDost is this very expression.", "otherInfo": "https://ozarksuficamp.org\n\nPlease check website for time and live-streaming link"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Charley Woods ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371762.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A born-and-raised-in Nashville native, songwriter and recording artist Charley Woods is now making an impact way outside of Music City's borders.

A Thousand Tiny Torches, the singer-songwriter\u2019s new Indie Folk Americana collection, is a testament to her renewal of inspiration, the rekindling of dreams, and the redemptive power and connective compassion that defines her artistry.\n\nHer rich, expressive alto voice frames expansive melodies that echo the American heartland. Now based in Los Angeles, Arielle knows this geography well. A performing itinerary transported her from Club Passim in her adopted hometown of Boston to venues including Eddie\u2019s Attic in Atlanta and Nashville\u2019s 12th & Porter, plus stops to the Southwest, as she steered a vegetable oil-fueled vehicle across Texas to Abilene, Odessa and Austin.\n\nTen years ago, with three well-received releases accompanied by national tours, she lost sight of her future as an artist. \u201cThough my heart still ached to write songs and sing, I found that I couldn't do it anymore,\u201d she recalls.\n\nArielle moved to the City of the Angels. She divorced and remarried, taught yoga philosophy, and worked behind the scenes in the music industry. She penned and published essays and poems, and was nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best New Poets. She baked innumerable pies. After being rejected for a PhD program, she constructed a blue \u201cshe shed\u201d in her backyard. And it was in this rustic space \u2013 surrounded by 47 volumes of her journals \u2013 that she rekindled her love for music and dedicated herself to writing one song per week.\n\nThe result is A Thousand Tiny Torches. Produced by Shane Alexander, the project is propelled by the masterful playing of a sterling cast of players with credits from Lady Gaga to KT Tunstall to Lukas Nelson: Denny Weston Jr., drums; Carl Byron, keyboards; Darby Orr, bass; Jesse Siebenberg, steel guitar; and Mike Mullins on mandolin. Michael Gehring tracked the project at Secret World Studios in Los Angeles in the famous Sound City Studios complex, and GRAMMY-winners Brian Yaskulka and Hans DeKline mixed and mastered, respectively. A loyal group of supporters funded the recording through a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nA consummate storyteller, Arielle\u2019s narratives crosscut exacting details with universal themes. On the lead single \u201cWhat Really Matters,\u201d she recalls a harrowing season in Southern California as gunshots ricocheted through a country bar and the surrounding hills ignited with apocalyptic wildfires.\n\nIn contrast are incandescent songs with characters and conversations etched in fine lines and deep empathy. Vivid imagery glows with headlights, porch lights, lighthouses, bolts of lightning, fireflies, and stars that have been shining for ten billion years.\n\nAfter launching her return with a holiday single, Arielle is now back onstage at house concerts and listening rooms, including the fabled Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Hollywood. Plans are underway for West Coast tours and upcoming dates in Boston. This time, she says, she is doing it for the right reasons. \u201cWhen I was younger I was performing,\u201d she confirms. \u201cNow, I\u2019m connecting.\"\n\nArielle Silver says that when she made her break with music, her ambition for everything stopped. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see the future. It was beautiful. I became so present in a way I never had been before, and the sense of being present lasted for a long time.\u201d Now, in themes that speak to losing and rediscovering the path, emerges a musical alchemy of renewal and rebirth: A loving light that is reflected from A Thousand Tiny Torches.", "otherInfo": "Weekly acoustic happy hour with songs, stories... and now trivia.

With his vocal range of seven plus octaves, ability to swing from a deep guttural baritone to soaring soprano riffs, knack for capturing life through lyrics, and commanding stage presence, he has carved a niche for himself in today\u2019s music world. A prolific songwriter, he has a large and varied catalog of songs ranging from heart-wrenching acoustic ballads to heart-pounding heavier rock. His music is published by EMI Music Publishing Canada (2004-present). Lukas first ventured onto the music scene with two Canadian bands, Cleavage (1995-2005) and Rise Electric (2005-2006), which helped prepare him for what was to come. He entered and won the competition television show Rock Star: Supernova (2006) which earned him front man status with Tommy Lee (Motley Crue), Jason Newsted (Metallica), and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). Their band Rock Star Supernova completed an album and a world tour of the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Following the tour, Lukas returned to Los Angeles and began writing and recording new music. The Love and Lust EP (June 2007) was released and he completed the solo acoustic Love and Lust Tour, making over two dozen stops throughout the United States and Canada. The new material was well-received by fans, and the band Stars Down was born (2008-present). After touring with his new band, Lukas began playing local gigs at such southern California hot spots as The Roxy, The Key Club, The Mint, and Viper Room. The year 2010 kicked off with a mini East Coast tour and Lukas working on his first full length album. Hollywood was released (July 2010) and debuted live at West Hollywood\u2019s famous Viper Room. The all acoustic Hollywood Stripped followed (August 2010). After moving to Nashville, in addition to local and out-of-town gigs, he wrote, recorded, produced, and released six additional recordings. The first three were Seed EP (December 2010), Story Teller (January 2011), and Super, Sex, Magic (February 2011). He also co-wrote, provided vocals, and recorded several music videos for a side-project, Switchblade Glory (April 2011).

MPress, distributed worldwide by Caroline/Universal via SRG-ILS Group, also releases albums by Rachael Sage, Seth Glier, and A Fragile Tomorrow.\n\nGrace Pettis is an award-winning songwriter from Austin, Texas who is a noted member of the South Austin scene. A little bit folk, a little bit country/Americana and with a whole lot of soul, Pettis has released two DIY albums and the Dallas Morning News has hailed her as \"one of the most talented young singer-songwriters in America\".\n\nPettis first came to the attention of MPress founder and President Rachael Sage at a SXSW party in Austin, where her voice and presence, even totally unplugged in a crowded room, commanded the spotlight. Sage gushes, \"Grace Pettis is one of the best singers I have ever had the pleasure to hear. And when I say 'best', I don't mean that in a showy way -\u2013 although her voice is both powerful and beautiful. I mean that she can tell a story with her voice in a way that cuts right to the heart of our collective humanity, whatever the topic may be. Her songwriting is nothing short of masterful, and to see these timeless qualities in someone so young feels like discovering something akin to the magic of Loretta Lynn, Johnny Cash or perhaps, Brandi Carlile. MPress Records is thrilled to be working with Grace!\"\n\nPettis, who is repped by Chas Management, will be touring the southeastern US and Europe in winter/spring 2020. Her first release on MPress is expected later on in the year. In the meantime, she is eager to have found such a supportive new team. \"Signing a record deal sounds pretty daunting\", Pettis admits. \"It's not a decision to take lightly. But from the first conversation with Rachael Sage and her wonderful team, I've felt like I've finally found my way home. After a decade of releasing my own music, I couldn't be more thrilled to announce that I'm partnering with MPress Records, a label that has built its unique reputation on championing and supporting artists and putting music with integrity out into the world. I'm so proud to be a part of the MPress family.\"\n\nAs a card-carrying member of the south Austin scene, Grace Pettis has amassed bragging rights to spare. She is the winner of many of the nation\u2019s most prestigious songwriting contests, including NPR's Mountain Stage NewSong Contest, and has received grants from the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation. Grace\u2019s songs have been recorded by other esteemed artists, including Sara Hickman and Ruthie Foster and she added to her songwriting accomplishments in 2019 by signing a publishing deal with BMG.

The dynamic pair are recording/performing artists, songwriters, musicians, audio engineers and producers.\n\nTheir first single, (an out-and-proud Trip Hop style song titled \"#Queen\") has achieved over 50k streams on Spotify and over 25k views on the official music video via YouTube since it's release on October 5th, 2018. Their follow up single (a soft, House track titled \"Can Be Beautiful\") was released on December 21st, 2018, and has since been featured on Billboard Sound and AXS.\n\nStarting a YouTube channel in August of 2013 and making their debut as Elvis Presley's daughter (Lisa Marie Presley)'s supporting act that same year, together they have since begun to take the music world by storm.\n\nThe duo boast a long list of live touring accomplishments and come equipped with a catalog of over 200 original songs. Their outstanding, solid fan base is made up of an array of live audiences, the YouTube community, and social media; where their popularity is ever increasing. Posting covers of both popular and original songs, live performances, v-logs, and behind-the-scenes videos weekly, their YouTube channel has recently reached an impressive tally of over 3 quarter million views overall.\n\nThe sibling duo regularly perform and tour nationally and have frequented venues such as LA's El Rey Theatre, San Juan Capistrano's The Coach House, and (just recently) have played the House of Blues in Anaheim (twice just in 2018), Bar 20 at the Grafton Hotel in Beverly Hills, the Simi Valley fireworks celebration (with over 20,000 people in attendance), at the Gibson theater in Beverly Hills, at Pickwick's Pub in Woodland Hills, a headlining show at Monterey Court in Tucson, AZ, and much more. Nicole & Scotty are currently booking for 2019, and inquiries can be emailed to ulomag28@sbcglobal.net.\n\nThey continuously entertain radio and television appearances; a few of which have included Los Angeles' Hot 103.9 Move to the Music, KHTS 98.1 FM, New York station Gold Star Radio, Las Vegas' 702 ROX, and the TV Entertainment segment Michelle's Corner. Their music is played regularly on a rapidly growing list of stations world wide, proving that the duo are not only rapidly garnering global recognition, but are also vastly appreciated and loved by their fans from all over the world.\n\nThe siblings also dabble in acting; with Scotty having co-starred in an episode of HBO's popular comedy series \"Vice Principals\", which aired October 8th, 2017.\n\nNicole & Scotty have also been featured in several major entertainment publications; including the international music trade magazine, \"Music Connection\" and the entertainment review, \"What's REALLY Going ON\", (where Nicole occasionally writes her own column and where the sister/brother duo were featured front cover in April of 2015).\n\nFrom playing shows with touring musicians who've accompanied major bands and artists (such as The Four Seasons, Barry Manilow,or John Mayer), to garnering attention from well respected industry folks, (such as producer Teddy Riley), making connections and long lasting relationships in the industry are extremely important to Nicole & Scotty.\n\nPerforming for charities and worthy causes they strongly stand for is also a passion of theirs; the siblings having played shows to raise breast cancer awareness, raise funds for youth programs, and entertain schools in the past.\n\nWhen asked, the siblings cite their brand of Pop music as \"current, energetic and brutally honest\". Their sound is indeed uniquely sincere in a genre where it is crucial to uphold the integrity of new and innovative music. The duo delivers just that by stringing raw, personal lyrics through hypnotic hooks and synth layered foundations, accompanied by thrumming bass lines and drum patterns emulating the heartbeat of their own sound. Combining an assortment of authentic Pop arrangements and Trap influence with Electronic Dance beats and rhythms, the duo offer up a wide variety of innovative and well crafted songs that translate deep rooted emotions of every nature to their listeners. As if their artistic thumbprints aren't already present enough in their recordings, a melodic acoustic and the duo's signature ambient electric guitar can be heard flitting in and out of the tunes the pair proudly create and stand by.\n\nNicole, (21), and Scotty, (17), are two young and immensely talented musicians intent on continuing a journey full of song, and wish to share the melodies in their hearts with the world.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ Chorizo Funk ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Khris Royal ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8964801.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Rock, Jazz, Funk, Rnb, Edm", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Khris Royal was born to be a musician.

This is due to his well-known ability to work with any genre of music, or combination of multiple genres at one time, to produce dynamic and high energy music sets. In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture. As the resident DJ since 2004 of some of Vegas\u2019 hottest clubs and lounges including Rum Jungle, Jet Nightclub & Koi Nightclub inside of the Planet Hollywood. Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip. Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cFRIDAY NIGHT HYPE\u201d EVERY FRIDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

Zane began honing his chops in LA's vibrant music circuit on his 12th birthday and later refined his style at USC's prestigious Thornton School of Music, becoming one of the most in-demand guitarists on both coasts in the process. Possessing an exciting and extremely rare combination of creativity and virtuosity, along with an audiophile's ear for guitar tone and an extraordinary ability to sightread, Zane has been referred to as \"The best guitarist in NY and LA\" by Bono of U2. More recently, John Mayer handpicked Zane to play guitar on his current world tour and latest album, sans audition, after Mayer discovered Zane's fiery performances online. But with his newfound passion for writing and singing his own material, Zane is quickly gaining significant attention as a lead vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. While Zane's guitar playing has been described as daring, passionate, soulful, and jaw-dropping - tremendous labels for a young man many are proclaiming to be the next great guitar hero - Zane is now rapidly accumulating equally praiseworthy descriptions about his compositions and vocal abilities. As people witness Zane's evolution from gunslinging guitarist to full-fledged frontman, comparisons to the early days surrounding the release of John Mayer's debut EP \"Inside Wants Out\" have even been serendipitously drawn. Bob Lefsetz has raved about CARNEY - where Zane began his meteoric rise as a lead guitarist - likening the band's sound to \"a mysterious trip into the heart of darkness.\" But, Zane's original songs lean slightly away from the raw and brooding Rock and Roll that defined CARNEY as they gravitate towards his roots in Jazz, Blues and Pop. His songwriting style is grounded in visual storytelling, honesty, surrender and hope and his melodies, while imaginative and adventurous, are irresistibly catchy and instantly familiar. Zane's lyrics have been likened to those of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray LaMontagne, and his voice has been compared to singing icons Jeff Buckley, Damien Rice, and Jimmy Gnecco. This unique combination of masterful guitars, unforgettable hooks, and emotively provoking lyrics - all expressed with his profoundly moving and honest voice - is what makes Zane such a one-of-a-kind talent; one that seems poised to join not only the greats of his generation, but those who've come before him. Live performance is where Zane's most inherent gift shines; his undeniably infectious charisma - one that captivates the audience the instant he takes the stage.

But when the sun goes down, he straps on his signature Gretsch 6120, steps up to the mike and is transformed into REVEREND HORTON HEAT, a hellfire-spewing, rock and roll dare-demon.\n\nJim\u2019s tome is iconic: From recording with Lemmy Kilmister, being revered by country music legends like Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins, touring with Soundgarden, ZZ Top, The Cramps, Social Distortion, White Zombie and the Sex Pistols (a young Lydon was connected to Jim\u2019s original 1985 demo), to providing touring opps to upstarts Kyuss, Hank III, Marilyn Manson and countless others across decades on the road.\n\nHeath and longtime confidant and slap-bass general Jimbo Wallace have polished up their 12threlease, Whole New Life, which Heath calls \u201cthe most positive material I have ever written. It focuses heavily on rock and roll but there is a human interest parallel - songs about growing up poor, vices, marriage, having children and walking the rapturous streets of America.\u201d\n\nCall it a new twist on an old sound, Whole New Life was recorded between Fun Guy Studios and Modern Electric in the band\u2019s hometown of Dallas. The eleven track rumination features new sticksman Arjuna \u2018RJ\u2019 Contreras. The Texas based jazz pupil came to the bands attention from a friend\u2019s reference in the summer of 2017, and brought a whole new backbeat to the legendary rockabilly administration. After clicking with Contreras, Heath hired a new pianist in 2018, Matt Jordan, to flesh out the sound with the pomp and power of Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. \u201cI love playing with these guys, it truly is a whole new band, so the title fits perfectly.\u201d\n\nRecording the album, Heath recalled that \u201cBack in the 1950\u2019s, reverb chambers were really hip and I always loved their warmth. I\u2019m all about Sam Phillips and the things he did with tape machines and tape echo. I love that kind of production value, even if it is older than me! It really sent me to this whole other headspace where I worked with a lot of vintage gear on this album - some of which I built myself for a truly unique sound - ribbon, old tube microphones, pre-amps and stuff. Additionally, a year before I started piecing this together I worked especially hard on my singing voice. Whole New Life brought out something in me where I am screaming more and making more throaty sounds. It's got some Louisiana feel to it, a bit of gruff and some Roy Orbison style in it. We tested out new tracks on our most recent tour and they are working better with the audience than any new songs we premiered since the early days of the band.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis tour started around 1986,\u201d Heath chuckles dryly. REVEREND HORTON HEAT still performs nearly 200 shows annually, including their trademark Horton\u2019s Hayride Festival in Southern California, which has expanded to an end-of-the-year jamboree under the name Horton\u2019s Holiday Hayride. The band has also wowed sold-out crowds with their multi-city residencies across America, including performances at Coachella, Reading, Austin City Limits, Riot Fest and countless other festivals. The Texas troubadours also took a unique approach to the term \u2018Special Guests\u2019 on recent tours. Recalling the time the band opened for Jerry Lee Lewis, Heath had a vision, \u201cThe idea of playing in Jerry\u2019s backing band would have been pretty neat. So every once in a while we\u2019ll have a load of fun putting that aspect in our live set. In the middle of our set, we\u2019ll have a special guest come on stage for a mini-set where REVEREND HORTON HEAT is the backing band. The first time we did it was with Lemmy Kilmister. We stopped our set midway, the road crew dragged a Marshall amp on stage, wiped the Rickenbacker clean and out came Lem. He was adamant on playing deep cuts, but I fought tooth and nail with him to do \u2018Ace Of Spades.\u2019 I told him, \u2018Lemmy, we must do this song, we have to give the people want they want.\u2019 He took a drag of his smoke, looked me square in the eye, and said \u2018Never give them what they want, give them what they need!\u2019\u201d\n\nWith over 1 million albums sold and nearly 35 years in the game, Heath and company have been delivering blood-pressure inducing scriptures to millions of fans worldwide. Call it rock and roll, psychobilly or what have you, REVEREND HORTON HEAT is often considered an early architect of the latter genre (at least on this side of the Atlantic) and occupies a peculiar place in American musical terrain.\n\nWhole New Life was delivered November 30, 2018.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Marshall Law Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Since forming in 2017, Marshall Law Band (MLB), has grown from an unknown funk-hop six-piece to a lauded community collective."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Timo Tolkki ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/4431584.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A Finnish Grammy nominated record producer, songwriter and musician, Timo Tolkki has sold over 3 million records during his 25 year career. He has played over 1500 shows in every continent across the globe and produced around 50 albums. He has released 13 albums with Stratovarius and 2 solo albums.\n\nTimo started playing guitar when he was 7 years old. His early influences were ABBA, The Beatles and The Shadows. Very quickly he progressed to the point where he wanted an electric guitar. After hearing \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d on the radio the rest was history. As a young teenager, Tolkki practically slept with his guitar and it was not uncommon for him to practice 8 hours a day. He was also playing in some local bands but in 1984 got a phonecall from the Stratovarius camp asking him to join the band. Stratovarius soared to great heights becoming the leading pioneers in progressive power metal. This monumental achievement included 7 world tours, 3 consecutive gold discs in Finland and selling almost 3 million records.\n\nThe recent break up of Stratovarius came about because Tolkki felt that the relationships in the band very very badly contaminated and also because everything that was to be said with that band with those members had already been said and to continue would be simply repeating the same form. He also wanted to be able to concentrate on other things, explaining that:\u201cThere\u2019s just a time for everything in life and Stratovarius came to the end of a road and there was nowhere to go anymore\u201d. During the composing process of his upcoming solo album \u201cSaana-Warrior of Light\u201d he found many new interests in the form of photography, graphics design and video editing. \u201cIt was like a new world to me and I knew I had found something that would determine the course of the rest of my life regarding my art. Now I have these amazing tools available to me to create things I did not know was possible. Lot of studying, but it\u2019s really a lot of fun, which brought me into many different areas in music. On the other hand I can do a production of a dance artist, or a metal artist. Or anyone who I think is real and has it. I rarely do productions outside of my own production company anymore. I am really into finding new talents and developing a project together with an artist, while using enough time for it. Because time is gold in music. I have everything I need here to create a perfect musical and visual experience. Music is the Universal language. Its primary function is to awaken emotions in us. We have no choice. If something doesn\u2019t move me, I know it is not for me\u201d.\n\nTimo is currently running his own Goldenworks production company and has established a comfortable working suite in Helsinki with the latest technology. He calls his place \u201cSanta\u2019s Workshop\u201d. Timo is actively looking for singers and artists who dare to explore the boundaries of themselves and take the step to the unknown.\n\nHe is ready to release his new solo album \u201cSaana-Warrior of Light Pt1\u201d. It is a groundbreaking release in many ways. It will only be available from the shop from his Official website http://www.timotolkki.com that is powered by TheGround.com so you will not find it in record stores. Tolkki is happy about these new opportunities to interact directly with his fans and to offer them products at a much better cost.\n\nSince Stratovarius break-up, he has formed a new Power Metal band that continues the legacy of Stratovarius. This band is called \u201cREVOLUTION RENAISSANCE\u201d and its debut album \u201cNew Era\u201d will be out on 6.6.2008 featuring Michael Kiske and Tobias Sammet on vocals.\n\nTimo Tolkki is looking forward to new musical endeavours and to the exciting new and fresh future in his art. 8.", "otherInfo": "Timo Tolkki Livestream Show.\nTimo Tolkki, ex-L\u00edder y Guitarrista de la Era Cl\u00e1sica de Stratovarius, tocar\u00e1 en vivo el pr\u00f3ximo viernes 22 de mayo a las 22:00 de Chile.Con su guitarra y voz, Timo Tolkki ofrecer\u00e1 un show de covers a Stratovarius y otros cl\u00e1sicos del Rock, como The Beatles y U2, entre varios otros.

Some are party-rockers, using their natural and honed ability to feel out what the room needs and deliver it at exactly the right time. Some are tastemakers; responsible for showing you your next favourite track for the very first time, or maybe playing an old favourite in a way that makes it seem new again. Some are tricksters, who came up through the storied school of turntablism and belong to a small group keeping the niche art of scratching and juggling alive in the era of the digital DJ. And then there are the rare ones who bring a little bit of everything to the table\u2014or in this case, the turntables. Some call them \u201cthe DJ\u2019s DJ,\u201d and C-SIK is one of them.\n\nAfter starting his career as a turntablist battling in such competitions as the DMCs, over the last 10 years C-SIK has become one of Canada\u2019s most versatile DJ\u2019s. He began playing in clubs in 2007 and since then has become known for the undeniable style he brings to his sets, regardless if he\u2019s rocking an intimate basement jam or for a crowd of thousands. His crowd-reading ability and taste-making selections have brought him around the world to DJ in Toronto, San Francisco, Jersey City, Honolulu and everywhere in between. His competitive roots also led him to enter the Red Bull 3Style, where he won the Canadian title in 2014, going on to represent his country on the world stage in Azerbaijan.\n\nCloser to home he\u2019s been holding down coveted residencies at some of Calgary\u2019s best venues including Hifi Club and Untitled Lounge; and also co-founded one of the city\u2019s most successful old-school hip-hop and R&B parties, Rewind (which has consistently sold out its 1000+ person venue for eight years running). He\u2019s also passionate about sharing his love for his craft with the new generation, and since 2013 has been heading up the DJ program at Beat Drop, Calgary\u2019s first DJ and production school. He is also one of the founding members of Skratcher\u2019s Calgary chapter.\n\nWhether he\u2019s dropping a guest mix on Sway In The Morning, playing alongside De La Soul\u2019s Maseo or directly supporting Diplo; whether he\u2019s cuttin\u2019 it up to some classics or dropping the latest heaters\u2014C-SIK does it all with flavour and finesse.

He emerged at Papunya in 1980 as a founding member of the pioneering Warumpi Band, which over three albums (Big Name No Blankets, Go Bush and Too much Humbug) and twenty years of performing thrust contemporary indigenous music into mainstream Australia. Yielding such classic songs as My Island Home, Blackfella Whitefella, Fitzroy Crossing, Jailanguru Pakarnu, Stompin Ground, From The Bush and Waru.\n\nHe has since become one of Australia\u2019s finest singer/songwriters, enjoying a solo career since 1989. He has released a remarkable string of albums - the latest being Blood & Longing.\n\nHis song writing is diverse- from the rollicking Good Light in Broome, the prayerful Native Born, and healing Myall Creek, the roots groove of Long Grass Band and Eddie Mabo, the journeyman monologues of Lights of Hay and Where My People Go, the contemplation of place in Burrumbeep Hill and Whispering Casuarina to the recent Cry My Darling and Byjantic Man.\n\nCollectively, Neil's work has done much to deepen Australia\u2019s contemporary music heritage.\n\nIn 1995, Neil Murray was awarded the APRA song of the year for My Island Home - originally written for the Warumpi Band and re-recorded by Christine Anu. My Island Home featured in the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the opening ceremony of the recent 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth games.\n\nIn 2007, Jailanguru Pakarnu- (Out From Jail) a song he co-wrote with Warumpi Band guitarist Sammy Butcher in the indigenous Luritja language- was honoured by the National Film and Sound Archives, Sounds of Australia series, as a significant recording in Australia\u2019s heritage. Credited as the first commercially released pop rock single in an indigenous language. In 2016, My Island Home, as recorded by Christine Anu, received the same honour.\n\nIn recognition of his influence, Neil Murray was awarded the 2017 Port Fairy Folk Festival Artist of the Year.\n\nNeil Murray\u2019s songs have been recorded by Mary Black, Jimmy Little, Missy Higgins, Liz Stringer, Christine Anu, Peter Denahy, Carus, Adam Brand, Amy Saunders, Powderfinger, The Tiddas, Ursula Yovich, Peter Brandy, Emma Donovan and the Warumpi Band.\n\nIn 2019, he is performing nationally for his Blood & Longing tour.\n\nWhispering Casuarina video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/etiA4IsaAD0\nneilmurray.com.au\nyoutube/neilmurraymusic", "otherInfo": "Neil Murray Live Streamed as part of The Saltwater Music Festival.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thesaltystage\n\nPLEASE NOTE THE TIME DIFFERENCE!\n2pm for WA, 4pm for Eastern states and 3.30pm for Central states!\n\nPAY WHAT YOU CAN - https://www.paypal.me/bulukbaraman"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brendan Gallagher ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8635978.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Country, Guitar Virtuoso, Pop, Blues", "Time": "9:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Brendan Gallagher is a music all rounder \u2013 singer, multi instrumentalist, songwriter, performer, producer, composer, author.\n\nHe is best known as singer/songwriter with Karma County.

Her musical talent was discovered early on and fostered by Helena Guimar\u00e3es Galo and Arnaldo Estrella (student of Alfred Cortot and friend of Villa Lobos), at the Conservatory of Antwerp student of Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge, student of Arthur Schnabel>Leon Fleisher>Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge.\n\nShe played a first recital at the age of 5 in the Teatro Mesbla in Rio de Janeiro. First TV performance at age 6 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Alceo Bocchino with a Haydn concerto, and another two times the same concerto conducted by Eleazar de Carvalho and Isaac Karabtchevsky with the Orquestra Sinfonica Brasileira. At age 7 she performed Mozart KV488 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Edouard van Remoortel (Rio de Janeiro).\n\nIn the USA she received the \"special prize\" of the jury at the Van Cliburn competition, and she made an indelible impression with Beethoven\u00b4s piano concerto n.4 at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium.\n\nAfter the \"wonderkind\" and \"competitions\" happenings, she received invitations to perform in more than 25 countries. Her intelligence and brilliant musical feeling allow her to play a repertory of 61 piano concertos.\n\nIn 1990 she took up composing again, producing brilliant and at times mischievous cadenzas for her concertos. In 1994-95 she wrote her 15 Momentos Musicais and composed the Sonate Oubli\u00e9e with themes from her childhood. Her characteristics have remained unchanged: simplicity and spontaneity, feeling and imagination, technique, perfection without affectation, a delight for the eye and ear.\n\nIn February 1998 Rodrigues' Bach-CD was recorded. The critics describe her improvisations and paraphrases on works for the organ as: \"The sonorities go back to the scale of more than 3 centuries of piano literature and link perfectly well up with the richness in colour of an independent way of pianistic thinking, they have their own new life, a fascinating transfiguration, full of phantasy.\"\n\nAstonishment, admiration and even incredibility caused her Suite n.1 \"Rio de Janeiro\" for piano and orchestra, that was first performed on 9 August 2000.

Two years in the making \u2018We Resonate\u2019 out on Talitres (UK/EU) and Sweetdreams Press (Japan), is an uplifting celebration of life and by far her most collaborative. It sees Rachael joined by Laura Marling\u2019s sideman Marcus Hamblett, experimental Japanese multi-instrumentalist ICHI, Alessi Laurent-Marke of Alessi\u2019s Ark, Rozi Plain, Emma Gatrill of Sons of Noel and Adrian, and Thomas Heather of Woodpecker Wooliams. Born from the richness of Rachael Dadd`s semi-nomadic lifestyle, partly recorded live in a studio followed by playful overdubbing in Rachael\u2019s front room, \u2018We Resonate\u2019 carves out a niche of its own, crossing genres from folk, through pop and experimental. Pulsing with poly-rhythms on prepared-piano, homemade xylophone, voice, clarinets, typewriter, boxes of matches, steel drum, tap-dancing, clapping, and even the heartbeat of Rachael\u2019s baby in the womb, it reveals that her love of African field-recordings www.rachaeldadd.com \u2000 R A C H A E L D A D D W E R E S O N AT E and the spirit embodied within them has seeped into the diverse mix of influences, along with Steve Reich, Tune Yards, and the Japanese underground/ improv scene. \u201cBeing a travelling musician is a furnace for making music. Witnessing how people build things together, watching the changing landscapes from city to wilderness and back to city, becoming connected to other people\u2019s cultures, it all makes it easier to go against the grain of what you grew up with. I feel at home using the pentatonic scale. I veer towards leaving behind the wash of guitar mid-frequencies that I think dominate so much of modern western music.\u201d Rachael\u2019s songwriting hones in on themes of communication, collaboration, nurture and optimism, but the worth of living is emphasized in even greater magnitude within the album\u2019s moments of desolation (unanswered walkie-talkies on a song about flood victims), in its moments of questioning (\"I see you`re flexing the muscle of these modern machines but are you sure you\u2019re fit to drive them?\"), and in its moments of protest (an overblown clarinet and a salute to Ivor Cutler calling \"all the women of the world take over!\"). Overall though optimism spreads its warm sunbeam and sets with a golden light over the ebbing and swelling of \"let it rise, let it fall...\" \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have light and dark to make something truthful, to make something resonate. I was living in Japan when the tsunami hit and the Fukushima nuclear plant blew up. Witnessing the Japanese people\u2019s strength, positivity and collaboration in the face of threat influenced my songwriting. During this time I saw a photograph exhibition of Ama-san, the diving women who work in teams holding their breath for 2 minutes, to dive for sea creatures without scuba gear. The essence of those beautiful and powerful images stayed with me throughout the making of the album and are what the artwork by Betsy Dadd is based on.\u201d Rachael has performed to audiences of up to 3000 and in recent times has taken to the stage at countless festivals including Glastonbury, End of The Road, Green Man, Wilderness, No Direction Home, Truck, Boomtown, Ouvre La Voix (France), Mandstock (Italy), and is gearing up to play Woodford (Australia) after a month tour of Japan. Outside of festivals, Rachael has played numerous headline tours in the UK, Europe, and Japan, and has also toured in the company of David Thomas Broughton, Alessi\u2019s Ark, Francois & The Atlas Mountains, This Is The Kit, and Rozi Plain. She is an experienced collaborator and organiser: she co-curated The Local\u2019s SHHH festival in Bristol, achieving her goal to be inclusive of many cultures and forms of expression; she programmed 'Rachael Dadd and Friends' at King\u2019s Place - a fundraiser for Japan's Tsunami victims; and she\u2019s curated a group exhibition 'DIY is all you need' with fellow musicians and artists. Having graduated from art school with first class honors, Rachael is also a practicing and exhibiting artist always putting emphasis on the record sleeve and often making handmade limited editions, thinking conceptually and regularly collaborating with RCA graduate animator and sister Betsy Dadd. She is the recipient of an Emerging Excellence Award with which she is working towards a new live show in collaboration with Betsy Dadd. www.rachaeldadd.com \u2000 \u201ccontender for the best of the year lists...brilliantly unusual, unexpected tracks, you never know what she`s going to do next\u201d LAUREN LAVERNE", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pictish Trail ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9080945.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Lo-fi Schmaltz", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Svelt, intelligent, adorable balladeer, trapped inside the body of an oversized, oft-bearded folk ogre.

Ihr Gesang und die Band bilden eine emotionale Einheit, sodass Ihre eigenen St\u00fccke tief ber\u00fchren, aber auch m\u00e4chtig rocken k\u00f6nnen. Mit dieser grandiosen eigenst\u00e4ndigen Mischung hat sich die Band bereits in die Herzen ihrer Zuh\u00f6rer gespielt. Grove \u2013 setzen einfach pure Emotionen frei. They groove, they have a stunning dynamics, lyrics written in German and English, tunes inspired by world weariness, love, anger, bliss, and pain. That\u00b4s GROVE. A keen sense of authentic and catchy songwriting attracts the audience like a magnet; these five Hanoveranians definitely know how to rock. GROVE\u2019s sound is carried by Eve\u2019s amazing, clear, pure and powerful voice which masters soft, low tones as perfectly as roaring and growling. Her singing melts into the clear rhythm of GROVE\u2019s accompanying musicians, and stirs up emotions that any true Rock\u00b4n\u00b4Roll-soul could wish for. With their stunning and distinct mixture of deeply touching and rocking songs GROVE accomplishes to capture their listeners\u2019 hearts. GROVE \u2013 emotion unleashed! Alles begann Anfang 2008 mit einem Spontanjam zwischen Robert \u201cGrobi\u201c Radeka (ehem. Hate Squad) und Eve H\u00fcbener (ehem. Castaway, Mobster) auf dem Zytanien Open Air. Schnell war klar, dass das gemeinsame Potenzial voll ausgesch\u00f6pft werden musste. Mit Unterst\u00fctzung von Alex (ehem. Loungefly) am Bass, fanden die ersten gemeinsamen Akustik-Konzerte statt. F\u00fcr die perkussive Begleitung sorgte seinerzeit Hannes Weber, Drummer der Phunkas Symatrix. Weil sich die Rock \u00b4n\u00b4 Roll Seele langfristig nicht nur mit gediegenem Akustik-Sound zufrieden geben kann, wurden im Sommer 2009 die gute alte Paula und die druckfreudige Ricki entstaubt ;) und ihrer eigentlichen Bestimmung zugef\u00fchrt: dem dr\u00f6hnenden Fr\u00f6nen \u00fcber die guten alten R\u00f6hren. Aber \u201cOhne Drummer kein vern\u00fcnftiges Gitarrengejammer\u201c, so stie\u00df Stefan Reese (ehem. Sonic Front, Mindwise) am Schlagzeug hinzu, um dem bisherigen und zuk\u00fcnftigen Repertoire seinen Soundstempel aufzudr\u00fccken. Es entstehen u.a. die Songs \u201cEssenziell\u201c und \u201cInfancy, Maturity & Uncertainty\u201c, die mit Unterst\u00fctzung von Lars Oppermann (Eat No Fish, Superstarfuckers, Dan Hiob Experiment, High Speed Karmageddon) in 2010 dann die ersten Tracks auf ihrem aktuellen Demo werden. 2011 wird Martin als zweiter Gitarrist angeheuert um den Grove-Sound auch LIVE noch fetter zu gestalten. Pressestimmen: \u201cMan w\u00e4hnt sich in der Flower-Power-\u00c4ra. Sp\u00e4te Sechziger, Singer-Songwriter-Rock mit politischer und gesellschaftskritischer Aussage. Aber immer entspannt. Man riecht imagin\u00e4re R\u00e4ucherst\u00e4bchen, auf die B\u00fchne werden aber gro\u00dfe Seifenblasen geschickt, davor tanzen einige Fans gl\u00fcckselig, w\u00e4hrend die Band einen intensiven, immer aber sehr lockeren Auftritt hinlegt.

Inspired by such visceral singers as Janis Joplin and Tina Turner, she left school at sixteen to follow her own dreams. Dilana soon found herself with a promising music career in Holland, becoming one of the country's most coveted live acts. Recording and releasing the album Wonderfool in 2000 yielded five singles, four videos and a string of touring and festival gigs throughout the region, celebrating her natural talents as a songwriter and performer.\n\nBy way of Houston, Dilana arrived in L.A. and auditioned to compete on TV's \"Rock Star Supernova.\" Quoted in the Hollywood Press, \"The moment she stepped on the Mayan Theatre stage for Episode 1 and performed 'Lithium,' Dilana instantly became the show's frontrunner.\" Her powerful vocals and commanding stage presence amassed legions of new fans from around the world. That acclaim inspired Dilana to further pursue her musical passions with characteristic tenacity.\n\nDilana has performed with rock's biggest legends including Tommy Lee and Mick Mars (M\u00f6tley Crue), Dave Navarro (Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). In 2007, she won over the masses with opening slot performances for Aerosmith and Beth Hart. She launched two solo tours spanning North America and Western Europe that both consistently sold out and earned stellar reviews in the press and in 2009, Dilana ended a third successful year performing by touring her native South Africa.\n\n\nFollowing the release of seven singles, Dilana spent much of 2008 in the studio. In November 2009, she unleashed the album Inside Out, featuring 12 original tracks and her first full-length album in nine years. As new opportunities presented themselves, Dilana jumped at the chance to venture into film acting. The singer/songwriter won the BEST ACTRESS award at the Action On Film International Film Festival as well as winning both the BEST ACTRESS award and the BEST MUSIC award at the American International Film Festival for the 9 songs she wrote and performed in the rock drama: Angel Camouflaged.\n\nDuring her extensive world touring, Dilana performed in Afghanistan for the troops in 2009 and 2010. She was a part of the Go Army Concert Series tour in August 2011, sharing the stage with Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Doobie Brothers as well as touring Holland, South Africa, and across the USA.\n\n2012/2013 brought fans news that Dilana would be welcoming two new creations to the world. One, the studio release of her studio album titled Beautiful Monster, in which she went on tour where she opened for Puddle of Mudd and also for Saliva, and the other, Dilana's best creation EVER - a beautiful daughter named River. Both officially released in 2013.\n\nIn 2016 her fifth album was released, called Dilana / Angel Camouflaged, the soundtrack of the movie with the same name.\nIn the same year her first live (acoustic) DVD was also released.\nIn 2016 Dilana was invited to be part of The Voice of Holland...", "otherInfo": "Dilana and NIHZ.

At sixteen, he recorded his first album, soon after which he left South Carolina for Idyllwild Arts Academy in California where he studied classical guitar and was introduced to the practices of yoga and meditation, which would greatly influence his life and his music.\n\nHall\u2019s music, a blend of roots and folk music, is imbued with a deep love of Eastern Mysticism. This powerful symbiosis fostered a deep connectivity with his growing fan base and Trevor quickly matured into a leader of the burgeoning conscious musical community. Along with numerous pilgrimages to India, he has also completed a series of sold-out tours and collaborations with artists such as Steel Pulse, Ziggy Marley, Jimmy Cliff, Matisyahu, Michael Franti, Xavier Rudd and Nahko & Medicine for the People.\n\nHis previous full-length album releases, Chapter of the Forest (2014) and KALA (2015), debuted at #3 and #2 on the iTunes singer/songwriter chart respectively and were supported by extensive tours around the US and Australia.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The SoapGirls ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8607275.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Revolt Rock", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The SoapGirls write outsider anthems that are androgynous, audacious and straight from the heart, with each song born from a real experience, either with themselves or someone close, ensuring every song is very honest.\nMie on guitar and vocals sets the pace beautifully as she powers through each song with a certain style and grace that captivates every audience.\nArmed with unforgettable melodies and catchy choruses, The SoapGirls energy, rawness and authenticity live, has earned these road warriors a formidable reputation.\nPerforming continuously throughout 2016, these fearless French born sisters Ca(Millie) and Noe(MIE) Debray, backed by their strong songwriting abilities, dedication and determination to their craft, have slayed critics and earned a dedicated group of followers known as the \u2018The SoapSuds\u2019, who follow the band across the UK and Europe.\nHer biggest musical influences are Fleetwood Mac, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, Heart, Nirvana,The Butthole Surfers and R.E.M and prefers more chilled out melancholy music.\nMillie on bass and vocals is influenced by Alice in Chains, Marilyn Manson, The Smashing Pumpkins, Korn, Alanis Morrissette, Hole, Aretha Franklin, Nirvana, Napalm Death and L7 and tends to prefer heavy angry music.

Buy LP/CD from http://www.juliajacklin.com or stream online.\n\nThe second full-length album from Australian singer/songwriter Julia Jacklin, Crushing embodies every possible meaning of its title word. It\u2019s an album formed from sheer intensity of feeling, an in-the-moment narrative of heartbreak and infatuation. And with her storytelling centered on bodies and crossed boundaries and smothering closeness, Crushing reveals how our physical experience of the world shapes and sometimes distorts our inner lives.\n\n\u201cThis album came from spending two years touring and being in a relationship, and feeling like I never had any space of my own,\u201d says the Melbourne-based artist. \u201cFor a long time I felt like my head was full of fear and my body was just this functional thing that carried me from point A to B, and writing these songs was like rejoining the two.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up to her 2016 debut Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win, Crushing finds Jacklin continually acknowledging what\u2019s expected of her, then gracefully rejecting those expectations. As a result, the album invites self-examination and a possible shift in the listener\u2019s way of getting around the world\u2014an effect that has everything to do with Jacklin\u2019s openness about her own experience.\n\n\u201cI used to be so worried about seeming demanding that I\u2019d put up with anything, which I think is common\u2014you want to be chill and cool, but it ends up taking so much of your emotional energy,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cNow I\u2019ve gotten used to calling out things I\u2019m not okay with, instead of just burying my feelings to make it easier on everyone. I\u2019ve realized that in order to keep the peace, you have to speak up for yourself and say what you really want.\u201d\n\nProduced by Burke Reid (Courtney Barnett, The Drones) and recorded at The Grove Studios (a bushland hideaway built by INXS\u2019 Garry Gary Beers), Crushing sets Jacklin\u2019s understated defiance against a raw yet luminous sonic backdrop. \u201cIn all the songs, you can hear every sound from every instrument; you can hear my throat and hear me breathing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really important to me that you can hear everything for the whole record, without any studio tricks getting in the way.\u201d\n\nOn the album-opening lead single \u201cBody,\u201d Jacklin proves the power of that approach, turning out a mesmerizing vocal performance even as she slips into the slightest murmur. A starkly composed portrait of a breakup, the song bears an often-bracing intimacy, a sense that you\u2019re right in the room with Jacklin as she lays her heart out. And as \u201cBody\u201d wanders and drifts, Jacklin establishes Crushing as an album that exists entirely on its own time, a work that\u2019s willfully unhurried.\n\nFrom there, Crushing shifts into the slow-building urgency of \u201cHead Alone,\u201d a pointed and electrifying anthem of refusal (sample lyric: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be touched all the time/I raised my body up to be mine\u201d). \u201cAs a woman, in my case as a touring musician, the way you\u2019re touched is different from your male bandmates\u2014by strangers and by those close to you,\u201d notes Jacklin. On the full-tilt, harmony-spiked \u201cPressure to Party,\u201d she pushes toward another form of emotional freedom. \u201cWhen you come out of a relationship, there\u2019s so much pressure to act a certain way,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cFirst it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve gotta take some time for yourself\u2019\u2026but then if you take too much time it\u2019s, \u2018You\u2019ve gotta get back out there!\u2019 That song is just my three-minute scream, saying I\u2019m going to do what I need to do, when I need to do it.\u201d Crushing also shows Jacklin\u2019s autonomy on songs like \u201cConvention,\u201d an eye-rolling dismissal of unsolicited advice, presented in elegantly sardonic lyrics (\u201cI can tell you won\u2019t sleep well, if you don\u2019t teach me how to do it right\u201d).\n\nElsewhere on Crushing, Jacklin brings her exacting reflection to songs on loss. With its transportive harmonies and slow-burning guitar solo, \u201cDon\u2019t Know How to Keep Loving You\u201d ponders the heartache in fading affection (\u201cI want your mother to stay friends with mine/I want this feeling to pass in time\u201d). Meanwhile, on \u201cTurn Me Down\u201d\u2014an idiosyncratically arranged track embedded with hypnotic guitar tones\u2014Jacklin gives an exquisitely painful glimpse at unrequited devotion (\u201cHe took my hand, said I see a bright future/I\u2019m just not sure that you\u2019re in it\u201d). \u201cThat song destroyed me in the studio,\u201d says Jacklin of \u201cTurn Me Down,\u201d whose middle section contains a particularly devastating vocal performance. \u201cI remember lying on the floor in a total state between what felt like endless takes, and if you listen it kind of sounds like I\u2019m losing my mind.\u201d And on \u201cWhen the Family Flies In,\u201d Jacklin shares her first ever piano-driven piece, a beautifully muted elegy for the same friend to whom she dedicated Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win. \u201cThere are really no words to do justice to what it feels like to lose a friend,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cIt felt a bit cheap to even try to write a song about it, but this one came out on tour and it finally felt okay to record.\n\nDespite its complexity, Crushing unfolds with an ease that echoes Jacklin\u2019s newfound self-reliance as an artist. Originally from the Blue Mountains, she grew up on her parents\u2019 Billy Bragg and Doris Day records and sang in musicals as a child, then started writing her own songs in her early 20s. \u201cWith the first album I was so nervous and didn\u2019t quite see myself as a musician yet, but after touring for two years, I\u2019ve come to feel like I deserve to be in that space,\u201d she says.\n\nThroughout Crushing, that sense of confidence manifests in one of the most essential elements of the album: the captivating strength of Jacklin\u2019s lyrics. Not only proof of her ingenuity and artistic generosity, Jacklin\u2019s uncompromising specificity and infinitely unpredictable turns of phrase ultimately spring from a certain self-possession in the songwriting process.\n\n\u201cAs I was making this album there was sort of a slow loosening of pressure on myself,\u201d Jacklin says. \u201cThere\u2019ve been some big life changes for me over the last few years, and I just found it too tiring to try to cover things up with a lot of metaphors and word trickery. I just wanted to lay it all out there and trust that, especially at such a tense moment in time, other people might want to hear a little vulnerability.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SOFT RIOT ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9062681.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Darkwave, Post Punk, Electronic, Minimal Wave, Experimental, Synth Pop", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "www.softriot.com/info", "otherInfo": "Online episode featuring UK-based synth and post-punk artists."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brice Masson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10351433.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Rock, Blues, Boogie Rock, Folk, Country Blues", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Des guitares DIY en jerrycan, caisse de vin, caisse de transport, une style au carrefour du Blues, du Rock, de la Country et de la Folk.

Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "dj Strain ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10327832.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Deep House, House, Funky House, Techno, Tech House, Soulful House", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Tune in for next episode of house stories live streamed straight to your ears & souls ...\n.\n.\nYoutube channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyW3O7KTmk3kQQ1FNsSYGKg\n\nMixcloud LIVE:\n\nhttps://www.mixcloud.com/live/djstrain\n\nTwitch.tv:\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/djstrain_official\n\nPeriscope (pscp.tv) by twitter:\n\nhttps://www.pscp.tv/djStrain_\n.\n.\n#housemusic #dj #djlife #djlifestyle #deephouse #funkyhouse #vocalhouse #techhouse #livestream #praguedjlife #playwithpassion #dowhatyoulove #nevergiveup #neverstop #housemusicalllifelong #inourhouseweareallequal"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Coco Love Alcorn ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Coco Love Alcorn is a Canadian pop and jazz singer.

De afgelopen jaren heeft hij een EP en meerdere singles uitgebracht, waaronder \u2018Wait For Me\u2019, \u2018Traveller\u2019, \u2018Walking Out That Door\u2019 en zijn allernieuwste single \u201cRun Away Together\u201d. Deze nummers zijn te beluisteren op Spotify, Itunes en Youtube.\n\n\n\nQua muzieksmaak is Berend 50 jaar te laat geboren. Hij is een liefhebber van ouder repertoire, vooral de jaren \u201850 en \u201860 spreken hem erg aan. Daarnaast houdt hij van Americana en Countrymuziek. Tijdens optredens hoor je dat terug in liedjes van bijvoorbeeld Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley en The Beatles. Hits uit de jaren \u201970 mogen echter ook niet ontbreken, daarom is er voor ieder wat wils.\n\n\n\nBerend is een muzikant in hart en nieren en, samen met zijn gitaar, in te huren voor allerlei gelegenheden; verjaardagen, zakelijke feesten, trouwerijen, opening van een pand; niets is hem te gek. Hij vindt het belangrijk om aansluiting te vinden bij de gelegenheid en een passend repertoire neer te zetten", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Fink ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7391608.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-23", "Genre": "Dub, Post-rock, Songwriter, Singer, Folk, Indie, Alternative, Blues, Reggae", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Disambiguation:\n\nThere are two artists/bands called Fink. One is a acoustic/electronic act from the United Kingdom (often written Fink (UK)), signed to Ninja Tune, and one is an alternative country act from Germany.\n\nBiographies:\n\na) Fink, AKA Fin Greenall, is a singer-songwriter, producer and DJ from Brighton, England. It is also the name given to the touring trio fronted by Greenall himself, completed by Guy Whittaker (bass) and Tim Thornton (drums). This is his official website\n\nFink's recording career began with Ninja Tune's release of his debut album Fresh Produce in 2001, a well received chill-out set that fitted neatly with the output of the label. However, it was his second release, 2006's Biscuits For Breakfast, that defined his style and began to bring his name to a wider audience.\n\nBuilt around his bluesy voice, finger-picking acoustic guitar and the stripped-back live rhythm section, Biscuits boasted a fledgling pop sensibility while retaining the signature Ninja Tune vibe - a fact not lost on a swelling crowd of industry luminaries, notably Zero 7, who promptly invited Fink to support them on their UK tour, and Nitin Sawhney, with whom Fink guested at the 2006 Electric Proms.A follow-up is currently being recorded for early 2007 release.\n\nDiscography (electronic/acoustic)\n\nDistance and Time - Released: 01/10/07\nBiscuits For Breakfast - Released: 24/04/06\nSo Long - Released: 03/04/06\nPretty Little Thing - Released: 06/02/06\nFresh Produce - Released: 01/06/00\nEver Since I Was A Kid - Released: 01/04/00\nFront Side EP - Released: 01/03/99\nFink Funk EP - Released: 01/07/97\n\nWebsite: Fink World\n\n----------\n\nb) Fink were a German indie-country band from hamburg, led by Nils Koppruch and Andreas Voss (also in band Halma). The band was founded in 1995 and released seven studio albums between 1997 and 2005. The group eventually split prior to the release of Koppruch's first solo album in March 2007.\n\nDiscography: (alternative country)\n\nBam Bam Bam - 2005\nHaiku Ambulanz - 2003\nLetzter September - 2002\nFink - 2001\nMondscheiner - 1999\nLoch in der Welt - 1998\nVogelbeobachtung im Winter - 1997\n\nWebsite: FINK Musik", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}]
