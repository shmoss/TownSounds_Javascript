Simple as that. The Jacksonville, FL based 10-piece has been roaming stages along the southeast for the last four years delivering the goods wherever they turn up. Recent tours have taken them to New Orleans, Atlanta and Savannah, while festival hits are becoming more and more the normal for them. \u201cThe dressing rooms are getting nicer,\u201d says lead vocalist Josue A. Cruz. \u201cAs in now we have some.\u201d Recent opening slots for Santana and Trombone Shorty have also worked to expand their reach to new ears and new dancers.\n\nThe group is now ready to take a larger bite of the music sphere. They recorded and are preparing to release Sin Parar, their debut album comprised of nine original compositions that range from the intricate to the downright jaw-dropping salsa songs. The album is sure to catch the ears, and feet, of the seasoned salsa aficionado and the novice alike.\n\nIn June 2015, LPT made its debut in a small coffee shop in the Riverside neighborhood of Jacksonville. The space was just big enough to hold the then septet. The show was a hit from the downbeat, with the standing-room-only crowd requesting the next date immediately. The band set up a monthly standing Thursday night gig in the back room of Rain Dogs in Five Points and played there until the room no longer held the crowds that showed up. Some astute, early fans started posting about strategic places to stand and dance during an LPT show because the room go so packed and so hot.\n\nLPT eventually grew to a full ten-piece orchestra and, while still able to squeeze into the tight stage at Rain Dogs, bigger stages came calling and continue to do so today. With some of Northeast Florida\u2019s most talented musicians in the melee now, LPT has not stopped making every show an unforgettable experience for all who attend. Post-show social media lights up with first-hand accolade as soon as the last note rings out. LPT says that the energy from the audience has been a motivator from the first show.\n\nLPT is now growing out of the borders of Jacksonville; the energetic performance has made its way to St. Augustine and Gainesville, as of late, and inquiries from further and further away are starting to surface. While moving a ten-piece around is not the simplest of tasks, LPT understands and accepts that they are becoming the new ambassadors of Salsa music in the Southeast, using the music to bridge gaps between cultures. Dancing and joy has no owner and LPT is well-poised to reinforce that freedom, love and inclusion is at the heart of Salsa music and in the hearts of all that enjoy the shows.\n\nAs for what the name LPT stands for, well, it remains a bit of a mystery. Some members say it is simply three letters that stand side by side. Others offer more surreptitious and hilarious definitions. Regardless of what the name stands for, the group will continue to stand up for Salsa music and the roots of the Afro-Cuban sound.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "147 Bleecker St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Lea B.

The Mona Dahls are: Orly Bendavid\u2019s tender, emotional vocal melodies, neatly composed folk chords, rootsy grooves, and bluesy riffs. Daniella Fischetti\u2019s heart wrenching sweeping violin aria\u2019s. Robin Mitchell\u2019s poignant, creative, and sensitive piano constructions. Kevin Hummel\u2019s incredible ability to play the bass as both a complicated rhythmic and melodic instrument. And finally, Andrew Fleming\u2019s talented, dynamic percussion skills.\n\nThe Mona Dahls knit the lyricism of the violin in conversation with the tender and terse cadences of Bendavid\u2019s own voice. At times upbeat and folksy, and other times absorbed in serious melody, they ground both plaintive and ebullient sounds alike in the rhythm of guitar, mandolin, and crashing bells. This pronounces a noise strangely earthly and cerebral all at once, yet above all, emotional. In 2013 The Mona Dahls began recording their first album with producer and engineer Anthony Krizan (The Spin Doctors, Lenny Kravitz).

Her blend of rock, pop & soul is of the strong female caliber; like Bonnie Raitt and K.T. Tunstall\u2026but make no mistake\u2026Nicola is Nicola.\n\nShe is an accomplished singer, songwriter, guitarist, keyboardist, and dancer, who has spent the last 10 years as a professional busker and musician in the NYC underground (as part of the sponsored \u201cMusic Under NY\u201d program). She has found an intimacy that can only exist where the constant rumble of trains drowns out most conversations, where the largest and toughest audiences in the world rush by, where you have to be damn good or you don\u2019t get to come back. This power house of a woman, rocks the New York underground like no other, but she\u2019s been rocking big stages and arenas above ground too.\n\nBorn on the Lower East Side of NYC, Nicola grew up in the low-income projects, sharing toys with her baby brother. Her father was a mechanic, and her mother a nurse. Neither was musically inclined, but both shared their appreciation and love for all types of music with their kids. \u201cMusic was always playing in our house\u2026we grew up with the sounds of Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Joni Mitchell, The Beatles,\u201d she recalls. It definitely rubbed off. Nicola ended up with a guitar in hand at age 7, a piano at age 11, and attended The Fiorello High School of the Arts (\u201cFame\u201d School). She trained classically at Manhattan School of Music and Queens College while studying dance and acting on the side. It wasn\u2019t long before she landed roles in both the critically acclaimed Broadway and National Road Companies of Les Miserables.\n\nLeaving the theater to embark on a music career, Nicola started her own record label \u201cHot Cherry Records\u201d in 2002. She toured the country and spent time living and performing in Europe and South America. Having recently opened for Eve 6, Nicola has shared the stage with Ricky Martin & Muzz Skillings of \u201cLiving Color\u201d. Over the past few years and 4 independently released CDs, having sold over 50,000 units independently, and charted on over 200 national radio stations, Nicola with her hybrid brand of sultry pop/rock/soul music has racked up an impressive list of rock and pop credentials: she's been featured on ABC, CBS & NBC News, Oxygen\u2019s \u201cBad Girls Club\u201d, MTV, VH1, Women Who Rock Magazine, Songwriter Universe Magazine, EMI/Songcircle Music, National Songwriters Hall of Fame , and she's performed at Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium. While performing in the subway, Nicola was scouted by EMI, Sony and Billboard Magazine, and was featured and showcased twice in Billboard Magazine\u2019s \u201cUnderground LP\u201d section for Noteworthy Emerging Artists about to break. The lead singer of the popular band \u201cTOTR\u201d on Interscope Records heard her performing at Union Square not long ago, and asked her to sing on the album they were recording at that time. She was briefly signed with Star Crossed Artist Group (\"Third Eye Blind\") and opened up for \"Eve 6\" and Edwin McCain. Nicola is on the development as well as writing and performance teams for several original prospective Broadway-bound musicals, and is endorsed by Martin Guitars Artist Program, Lampifier Microphones and Dovetail Strings.\n\nNicola\u2019s 5th. album \u201cCanyons and Cathedrals\u201d, released October 2012, was a very complete tapestry of some of her most poetic soulful pop/rock music yet. A unique sonic journey from start to finish, the album contains 14 compositions and even includes 1 instrumental piece.\n\nNicola released her latest single \"Back in Pieces October 2017 which was co-written and co-produced by Matt Colligan.\nShe is Composer/Lyricist for a new original Broadway-Bound Musical called \"We are Ameena\" with A2K Productions.\n\nAbove or below ground \u2013 to experience Nicola live is to be drawn in completely by a high-energy pop/rock/soul mix of driving beats, melodies and intelligent lyrics. All this is anchored by her sizzling vocals and rhythmic guitar chops. Nicola\u2019s performances whether full band or \u201cunplugged\u201d reveal an innate ability not just to dazzle an audience with her fiery presence\u2026but to somehow make you part of it\u2026and that\u2019s just the beginning\u2026", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Brooklyn, Kings County, NY 11214", "Artist": "Elizabeth Luthringer ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8855564.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.9496, 40.6501], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Elizabeth Luthringer", "Time": "1:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Public Library", "moreBioInfo": "E.L. is the name.

His passion for music has evolved and constantly shows in the way he expresses others to enjoy Christ through song. While the single \u201cOn Our Job\u201d is the debut single released, listeners will get the chance to hear Constant Battle\u2019s desire for Christians to show love, grace, mercy and more.\nConstant Battle has aspired to inspire others through not only his music, but through his personal testimony. Working with local artists in Buffalo and even co-directing videos, his testimony shines through his crafty metaphors and slick lines. In 2009, Battle\u2019s first studio album \u201cAre You Ready Pt.1\u201d was released followed by a flux of mixtapes for his fans.

As an artist, Southside Johnny first achieved prominence in the mid-1970s as the second act to emerge from the Jersey Shore music scene and be considered part of the Jersey Shore sound, following Bruce Springsteen. Southside's first three albums, I Don't Want to Go Home (1976), This Time It's For Real (1977), and Hearts of Stone (1978), were Stax-influenced R&B arranged and produced by the co-founder of the band and Springsteen confederate Steven Van Zandt and largely featured songs written by Van Zandt and/or Springsteen. The Van Zandt-written \"I Don't Want To Go Home\" became Southside's signature song, an evocative mixture of horn-based melodic riffs and sentimental lyrics. Other notable songs included \"The Fever\",\"Talk to Me,\" \"This Time It's For Real,\" \"Love on the Wrong Side of Town,\" and the definitive version of Springsteen's \" Hearts of Stone.\"\n\nSouthside has long been considered the Grandfather of \"the New Jersey Sound.\" Jon bon Jovi has acknowledged Southside as \"his reason for singing.\"\n\nIn 1982 the Rolling Stone Magazine voted the album Hearts of Stone among the top 100 albums of the 70's and 80's.\n\nCast under Springsteen's long shadow, national commercial success eluded Southside and the Jukes, and in 1979 they were dropped by their record company. Now working without Van Zandt, they released The Jukes in 1979 and Love is a Sacrifice in 1980. Neither of these achieved much success either. The band's first official live release also came out in 1980, the double album Reach Up and Touch the Sky.\n\nDuring the 1980s Southside Johnny's recording contracts continued to change almost by album, but he continued to release records: Trash It Up (1983), a disco influenced album written by Billy Rush and produced by Nile Rodgers; In the Heat (1984) an album trying to reach out to \"Adult Oriented Radio\"; and At Least We Got Shoes (1986) where guitarist and Jersey shore fixture Bobby Bandiera, who often plays a custom guitar built by First Act Guitars took over songwriting and guitar work from Billy Rush and led the Asbury Jukes back to their original sound. Songwriting credits on At Least We Got Shoes also contain a song co-written by Bandiera and singer Patti Scialfa, who was known as a Jukes collaborator since the 1980 album Love is a Sacrifice and who became a member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band in 1984.\n\nIn 1988 Southside Johnny released his first solo record Slow Dance containing ballads and love songs, but also \"Little Calcutta\" which is still discussed as Southside's most political song of his career, describing the life and environment of the homeless in New York City.\n\nMore record label switches, Jukes personnel changes, tours and club dates followed.\n\nHis recording career was re-launched with the album Better Days (1991), which featured production by Van Zandt, songs by Springsteen, and vocal performances from Van Zandt, Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi. With Bobby Bandiera driving the band, the Jukes were gaining new energy for a world wide tour supporting the album. But once again, Southside Johnny's bad luck with the industry was shown when the record label went bankrupt while the tour was still rolling.\n\nSouthside performed the theme song for the 1990s sitcom Dave's World, a cover of Billy Joel's \"You May Be Right.\"\n\nSouthside eventually relocated to Nashville taking a break from the music business. A few members of the Asbury Jukes would end up being part of The Max Weinberg 7 on the Late Night with Conan O'Brien television show, while some others went on tour and into the recording studio with artists like Jon Bon Jovi, Mink DeVille, Graham Parker, Robert Cray.\n\nIn 1998 Southside Johnny came back into the spotlight with an independent release titled Spittin' Fire, a live record with a semi-acoustic Jukes lineup released in France containing a 20 song set recorded during a series of 10 shows at the \"Chesterfield Caf\u00e9\" in Paris, France.\n\nAfter a decade without a record contract Southside finally founded his own record label in 2001 under the name of Leroy Records, and started releasing and distributing his new records fully under his own control: Messin' with the Blues (2000), Going to Jukesville (2002), Missing Pieces (2004), Into the Harbour (2005).\n\nSouthside continues to perform, and maintains substantial audience followings in some regions of the U.S., such as New Jersey, New York, northeast Ohio, and abroad, in the UK and continental Europe, as 2002's Live At The Opera House DVD, filmed at a sell-out performance in Newcastle upon Tyne, demonstrates. As of 2005, he resides on the Delaware Bay. His annual appearances at Springsteen's Asbury Park holiday shows draw as much crowd excitement as Springsteen himself.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "185 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Adrianna Mateo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8785048.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988346, 40.722035], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Alt-pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall Stage 3", "moreBioInfo": "Adrianna Mateo cuts a singular profile across the music industry as an alt-pop artist, solo violinist, and actress.

So now he\u2019s totally free to do both, and he does. The solo he played on the album Thrust, on the song \u201cActual Proof,\u201d is one of the best drum solos on any of my albums. So many people have remarked about that solo, saying, \u2018Incredible.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n-Herbie Hancock\n\nMIKE CLARK DRUMMER / BAND LEADER\n\nMIKE CLARK gained worldwide recognition as one of America\u2019s foremost jazz and funk drummers while playing with Herbie Hancock\u2019s group in the early 1970\u2019s. Mike became known as a major innovator through his incisive playing on Hancock\u2019s Thrust album, which garnered him an international cult following.\n\nWhile often referred to as the \u201cTony Williams of funk\u201d, Mike considers himself a jazz drummer, and in fact has become one of the most vital to sit behind a set. He's performed with jazz greats such as Herbie Hancock, Chet Baker, Vince Guaraldi, Tony Bennett, Wayne Shorter, Joe Henderson, Eddie Henderson, Rob Dixon, Bobby Hutcherson, Woody Shaw, Donald Harrison, Larry Coryell, Jack Wilkins, Mike Wolff, Wallace Roney, Geri Allen, Billy Childs, James Genus, Bob Hurst, Chris Potter, Onaje Allan Gumbs, Bobby McFerrin, Al Jarreau, Dave Liebman, Nat Adderly, Oscar Brown Jr., Bill Doggett, Nicholas Payton, Christian McBride, Mose Allison, Maxine Brown, Gil Evans and his orchestra and many illuminating etceteras too numerous to list.\n\nBorn in Sacramento, CA, while growing up Mike had the benefit of traveling around the country with his father, a union man for the railroad. He was also a drummer at one time and had a keen ear, a killing record collection, and a great appreciation for music. This allowed the younger Clark to soak up the diverse regional music of the United States, which he credits as providing an invaluable education. Clark was a prodigy as well, picking up his first sticks at the tender age of five and sitting in--and getting \u201chouse\u201d --with bands in Texas and New Orleans when he was as young as 7 and 8.\n\nHe continued to play in a variety of blues, R&B, organ trios, and jazz bands, settling in Oakland, CA, until his introduction to Herbie Hancock and his recruitment into the Headhunters in 1973.\n\nAt the tail end of the 70\u2018s and in 1980, shortly before moving to New York City, Mike did a short but remarkable stint with Brand X, the acclaimed British fusion band founded by Phil Collins, doing two tours and recording their seminal Do They Hurt? and Product.\n\nThe winter of 2000 saw him diversifying his efforts with a foray into the popular jam band scene. His group Prescription Renewal electrified audiences across the country with an eclectic core of cross- generational multi talents, such as Charlie Hunter, Fred Wesley, Skerik, Robert Walter, and DJ Logic, and featured special guests such as George Porter Jr. of Funky Meters\u2019 fame, Kyle Hollingsworth of String Cheese Incident, Les Claypool, Will Bernard, Larry Goldings and fellow Headhunters alumni, Bill Summers, and proved a hit on the thriving young jam band scene. He followed that with several successful tours of the Roots Funk All Stars, another hot ad hoc association that married Mike with James Brown trombonist Fred Wesley, former Headhunter cohort and funk bassist legend Paul Jackson, Dr. Lonnie Smith and Robben Ford.\n\nNext to James Brown's drummer Clyde Stubblefield, Mike's beats with The Headhunters (most notably on \"God Make Me Funky\") are some of the most sampled in hip hop. Featured in Downbeat, Musician, International Musician & Recording World, Modern Drummer, Jazz Times, Guitar Player, Jazz Is and numerous jazz history and method books, Mike is a former faculty member of Drummers Collective, and is a popular and busy clinician around the country. His book Funk Drumming: Innovative Grooves & Advanced Concepts was published last year by Hal Leonard and is a best seller.\n\nHis numerous recording credits include albums with Herbie Hancock, the Headhunters, Brand X, Eddie Henderson, Jack Wilkins, Mark Puricelli, Mike Wolff, and Alien Army, a group led by guitar great Jack Wilkins. As a bandleader, his release Give The Drummer Some was very enthusiastically received, earning a rare four and a half stars in Downbeat, as was The Funk Stops Here, a joint effort with Hancock alumni Paul Jackson. In 2001, his solo CD, Actual Proof met with critical acclaim, as did the 2003 acoustic jazz release, Summertime, featuring Chris Potter and Billy Childs, which spent many weeks in the top ten charts.\n\nOther efforts included a compilation of his legendary, innovative funk beat samples, Mike Clark\u2014The Headhunter, a re-release of the widely acclaimed Thrust album, and, in 1998, The Return Of The Headhunters, featuring Herbie Hancock. Next came Herbie Hancock\u2019s Box Set, featuring Headhunters classics \u201cActual Proof\u201d and \u201cButterfly,\u201d from Thrust, a few choice cuts from Manchild, and also some historical tracks from the classic Flood, previously only available in Japan. The Headhunters\u2019 newest effort, Evolution/Revolution, released in 2003, featured the latest Headhunter configuration, with original founding members Mike, Bill Summers and Paul Jackson, joined by Donald Harrison, Victor Atkins (Los Hombres Caliente), and Nicholas Payton.\n\nHis 2009 release Blueprints of Jazz, Vol. I produced by Talking House Productions, which featured Christian McBride, Donald Harrison, Patrice Rushen, Jed Levy and Christian Scott, was received with critical acclaim and named one of the best recordings of the decade by Downbeat.\n\nHis latest effort, Carnival of Soul released June 11th by Owl Records and climbing the charts, was described by the Indianapolis Star as \u201ca jazz party with a kaleidoscopic array of players.\u201d Those players include guest turns by renowned country blues singer Delbert McClinton, fellow drumming icon Lenny White, tenor player Rob Dixon, and three separate organ-based ensembles offering up some delicious soul-infused jazz.\n\nA true original, Mike\u2019s work continues to delight and astound his fans around the world.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "234 Starr St, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "J.

His string of hit singles, millions of albums sold, and a 28-year recording career aside, Stigers\u2019 commitment to artistic growth, and to bringing new tunes to the Great American Songbook, has become unparalleled in modern music.\n\nBarnstorming concert halls, festivals and clubs everywhere from Moscow to Manhattan, accompanied one night by his quartet, another by big band or orchestra, Stigers continues to release new work nearly every year, frequently collaborating with his musical heroes. Along the way, this musician who began his career playing standards in a Boise hotel lobby while moonlighting as drummer in a punk rock band has redefined the constitution of contemporary jazz singing.\n\n\u201cI was the kid who worshipped songs and the musicians who wrote and recorded them,\u201d he remembers. \u201cBack then, pop radio played everything from Aretha Franklin to Led Zeppelin, Marvin Gaye to Willie Nelson, Joni Mitchell to Elton John. I loved it all, and I studied it.\u201d Often euphoric and always elegant, Stigers possesses a curator\u2019s knack for hearing a song, framing its heart, and making it his own\u2014be it the work of Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Wilco, or The Kinks.\n\nStigers\u2019 repertoire is a reflection of his appreciation for the fundaments of tone and craft, and for quality\u2014the progression of his work is both organic and practical. \u201cJazz songs used to be pop songs. Jazz has always been about reinvention,\u201d Stigers notes.\n\nPerhaps because he has penned so many notable songs himself, as well as writing with the likes of legends like Carole King and Barry Mann, Stigers has come to recognize the small, perfect things that are a great melody and lyric, and how to capture them. That songwriting talent also led to an Emmy nomination for co-writing and singing the theme song to the wildly successful TV series Sons Of Anarchy.\n\nIt is his rich singing voice, however\u2014singular, balletic, and at turns both mournful and playful\u2014that has landed him on records with the likes of Al Green, Shawn Colvin, in studios with venerated producers like Larry Klein, Danny Kortchmar, and Glen Ballard, and on stages and concert bills with a plethora of legends, including pop and rock greats Eric Clapton, Elton John, Bonnie Raitt, Prince, Rod Stewart and The Allman Brothers, and jazz giants Nancy Wilson, Al Jarreau, Gerry Mulligan, Randy and Michael Brecker, Chuck Mangione, Toots Thielmans, Wynton and Branford Marsalis, Kurt Elling, Diana Krall, John Scofield, and many more.\n\nAfter being mentored in his early years by legendary jazz pianist Gene Harris, and by the great jazz singer Mark Murphy, his unique talent was recognized by music business impresario Clive Davis, who signed Stigers to a record deal after hearing him in a New York restaurant. A debut album sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide on the strength of self-penned hit singles like \u201cI Wonder Why,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re All That Matters to Me,\u201d and \u201cNever Saw a Miracle.\u201d A year later, Stigers contributed a cover version of Nick Lowe\u2019s \u201c(What\u2019s So Funny \u2018Bout) Peace Love and Understanding\u201d to The Bodyguard soundtrack, which has sold over 40 million copies worldwide. Multiple appearances on The Tonight Show, The Late Show With David Letterman, The Today Show, and countless international TV shows, put Stigers directly in the spotlight of popular culture. Stigers also made cameo appearances in the movie comedies Ted and Ted 2, written and directed by his friend, Seth MacFarlane.\n\nBorn in Hollywood, raised in Idaho and transplanted to Manhattan, he now resides, between concert appearances, back in Boise, where he\u2019s proud to help raise hundreds of thousands of dollars each year for the Interfaith Sanctuary Homeless Shelter.", "otherInfo": "SORRY THIS SHOW IS CANCELLED!"}, {"Address": "169 Ave E, Bayonne, NJ 07002", "Artist": "Psilocybe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10243737.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.113087, 40.66268], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Rhythm & Grind", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Lot 13 Longbar & Grill", "moreBioInfo": "This metal quartet uses pop structures, melds together get down grooves with ruthless melodies, and adds a dash of punk spunk.", "otherInfo": "Jersey City Hood Thrashers Lethal Strike kick off their 2020 reunion at Lot 13, Saturday March 28th.

He bought a loop pedal and began learning how to integrate it into his gigs, often sharing with concert-goers how he builds his backing band: himself.\n\nTaking inspiration from a wide variety of musicians and songwriters has helped Liberio create his unique sound.

Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, I give you, the wondrous Keane.\u201d\n\n----\n\nNot many British bands these days have more than one big-selling album, let alone five. Fewer still manage to replicate - and maintain - that success outside the UK. And only a tiny number are able to continually develop their sound as their career progresses. But, in the last decade, Keane have achieved all of those things and a whole lot more. After selling over 11 million copies of their five consecutive Number One records, with their four award winning albums and their 8 track EP \u2018Night Train\u2019, it is no exaggeration to say that Keane are firmly established as one of the world's most successful, innovative and cherished bands.\n\nWhen Keane first got together all those years ago, three of the bands they most admired were the Beatles, Radiohead and Blur. What made all of those acts special was that although nobody could ever predict what they'd do next, you knew it would be worth hearing. Over the release of their five albums that's an exclusive club to which Keane have surely now gained membership.\n\nTracklisting for \u2018The Best Of Keane\u2019 below, revealing the story of one of the biggest bands of the decade;\n\nTrack 1. Everybody\u2019s Changing\n\n1997, Battle, Hastings, seaside small-town England. Keane, a struggling trio from the aptly-named Battle, take five years to be discovered \u201covernight\u201d in December 2002 at the Betsey Trotwood pub, east London, by Simon Williams, founder of the atom-sized though astronomically influential Fierce Panda label. Signed in 2003, that year is dominated by America, a glitzy showbiz caterwaul of Black Eyed Peas, Beyonc\u00e9, Avril Lavigne, Justin Timberlake, Eminem and Christina Aguilera. The quintessentially British Keane, by comparison (also championed by Radio 1's Steve Lamacq) wear their hearts on their vulnerably-fraying sleeves and release debut independent single \u2018Everybody's Changing\u2019 in April 2003 before signing to the mighty Island major and releasing world-class epic piano-rock anthem \u2018Somewhere Only We Know\u2019 in early 2004. Debut album \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019 follows, an instantaneous, British rock phenomenon, a soaring rapture of euphoric melancholy which swathes the planet. A UK No.1 album, Keane bloom in a brand new landscape, a post-Britpop era of emotional sensitivity, which dominates the rest of the decade.\n\n\u201cWe're the post-OK Computer generation,\u201d notes Tim Rice-Oxley, Keane's gifted songwriter, lyricist and pianist, of the '97 Radiohead classic. \u201cFor me, that was the album of our generation. We've grown up appreciating the power of a song that can unlock you. And we're all men, I guess, who probably wouldn't otherwise let go. That's our cornerstone. It's just good to feel you're not alone.\u201d\n\nTrack 2. Somewhere Only We Know\n\n2006-2012, four more albums, four heroically different directions. Post \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019, Keane detonate their own blueprint. Like Blur and Radiohead, they've the confidence to diversify: through \u2018Under The Iron Sea\u2019 (2006, portentous document of splintering inter-band relationships), \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 (2008, ambitious experiment in conscience-rock and glittering electro-pop, recorded in Berlin), the \u2018Night Train\u2019 EP (further sonic experiments and lyrical ennui, recorded on the road) and \u2018Strangeland\u2019 (2012, piano-rock progressions on a rousing, reflective sojourn through human relationships and what it means to be 30-something men). \u2018The Best Of Keane\u2019, therefore, is more than just a greatest hits (and there's plenty of them): a compendium of Classic Keane Anthems plus band favourites, fan favourites, live favourites and two new tracks (\u2018Higher Than the Sun\u2019, \u2018Won't Be Broken\u2019), featuring the stunning hymnal \u2018Hamburg Song\u2019 and the glorious reverie \u2018My Shadow\u2019. To date Keane have sold over 11 million albums worldwide, their five albums to date consecutive UK No.1s.\n\n\u201cI'm very proud of the variety on the \u2018Best Of\u2019,\u201d notes Tim. \u201cYou've got the Keane anthems, then something like \u2018Hamburg Song\u2019 which is deeply emotional. \u2018Atlantic\u2019 is weird, sonically ambitious. Same with \u2018Spiralling\u2019 (voted 2008 Song Of The Year by Q magazine). \u2018Silenced By The Night\u2019 covers my craving for American open highway epic rock songs. It's hasn't just been \u2018Somewhere Only We Know\u2019 times sixteen. There's a lyrical reflection of our lives and the way they've changed, in a really true way.\u201d\n\nTrack 3. Bend and Break\n\n2012, Brazil. Tom Chaplin, a man whose astonishingly powerful archangel vocals puncture the human heart with a shard of purest yearning, awakes in a hotel bed. He's poleaxed, once again, by the malady which typifies the global touring colossus Keane have long become: stratospheric jet lag. \u201cI had literally no sense of self,\u201d he boggles. \u201cI couldn't have told you what my name was, what day it was, what year it was.\u201d\n\nTrack 4. Bedshaped\n\n700 shows in over 40 countries worldwide. Keane have now played in over forty individual countries: America, Russia, South America, Indonesia, Asia, the Middle East, Australia, Japan, all across Europe, over and over again. In South Korea they're known as The Autumn Band with all the wistful melancholy, melodic richness and emotional metamorphosis that implies. Their fans unfurl 'Welcome' flags in trees outside their hotels, tattoo their art-work and lyrics on their bodies, hold birthday parties in their honour, in Brazil (when they're not even in Brazil) and send lengthy letters saying their music has \u201csaved my life\u201d. Keane are a universal soul band.\n\nTrack 5. This Is The Last Time\n\n2004, Glastonbury. Newly back from their inaugural tour of America, Keane had left a Britain where their biggest-ever show was at The Forum, Kentish Town (capacity 2,000). \u201cWe got to Glastonbury and 20 thousand people were singing all our songs, it was electrifying,\u201d beams Tim. \u201cBefore that, we had no sense whatsoever what it was like for our music to be everywhere.\u201d\n\nTrack 6. Atlantic\n\n2005, Madison Square Gardens, New York City. Keane support U2 over five nights and Larry Mullen Jnr, shows Keane drummer Richard Hughes how he sets his kit up (with a view to minimising injury). \u201cOne of my absolute heroes,\u201d marvels Rich. \u201cAnd I'm sitting at his drum kit, at Madison Square Gardens. Mind-blowing.\u201d\n\nTrack 7. Is It Any Wonder?\n\nAt the core of Keane lies a precious creative affinity, a vocal gift which interprets emotional music with a stunning synchronicity. \u201cIt's very rare,\u201d notes Tom, \u201cthat both a singer and song-writer have that, together.\u201d Tom feels he can sing like this because he battles, as all proper singers do, \u201cinsecurity, vulnerability and fear of the world, coupled with the ability to stand in front of thousands of people and pour it all out: those two extremes are the beating heart of most singers\u201d. No wonder fellow artists love them: Paul McCartney, Pharrell Williams, Bono, Lily Allen, John Mayer, Nicole Scherzinger, Chris Martin, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gwen Stefani, Zach Braff, novelist Brett Easton Ellis, Kanye West and Snoop Dogg.\n\nTrack 8. Nothing In My Way\n\nApril 2013, BBC Radio 2, London. \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019 is voted No.2 in the 100 Favourite Albums Of All Time by listeners of the UK's mighty Radio 2. Nothing stands in their way (apart from Coldplay at No.1), beating their all-time heroes: Simon & Garfunkel, Bruce Springsteen, The Beatles, REM, U2, Abba...\n\n\u201cTen years down the line and our vulnerability has been our saving grace,\u201d decides Tom. \u201cIt's something that can't be affected by changing fashions. Because that's a human truth.\u201d\n\nTrack 9. Hamburg Song\n\n2008, Germany. Keane love Germany, especially Berlin. \u201cA city which has picked itself up time and time again is so inspirational,\u201d says Tim. \u201cIts history, its creativity, its innovation, its spirit of reconciliation, is also the spirit of the band.\u201d They recorded third album \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 at Teldex Studios in Berlin.\n\nTrack 10. Crystal Ball\n\n2006 onwards, everywhere. As well as old-school universal songwriters, Keane are new-school pioneers: one of the first bands ever to release a single on a USB stick (\u2018Nothing In My Way\u2019, 2006): an acoustic gig on the Great Wall of China (in conjunction with the innovative Burberry, 2011): the first band to stream a 3D live show. \u201cNot bad,\u201d notes Rich, \u201cfor a band who started out playing The Crypt in Hastings.\u201d\n\nTrack 11. A Bad Dream\n\n2005, Helioscentric Studios, Rye, Sussex. Keane record second album \u2018Under The Iron Sea\u2019, lyrically much of which is political and social comment on the modern world, songs such as \u2018A Bad Dream\u2019 and \u2018Is It Any Wonder?\u2019 question the heroics of war. These themes are also present on some of the following album \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 in songs \u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 and \u2018Better Than This\u2019 for example. In 2007 the band become War Child ambassadors and curate a night at Brixton Academy in aid of the charity, featuring Pet Shop Boys, Lily Allen and Guillemots amongst others.\n\nTrack 12. Try Again\n\n2012, Japan. Tom knows more than most what it's like to try again. \u201cThe good old days didn't really work for me, \u201cI didn't really appreciate how brilliant everything was, in the beginning,\u201d muses the ever-philosophical Tom. \u201cI don't think I was grown up enough, then.\u201d he laughs, over breakfast in Japan. \u201cBut now I feel the happiest I've ever felt. In my whole life.\u201d\n\nTrack 13. Spiralling\n\nFrom the very beginning. Of a decade's extraordinary moments, Tim cherishes the ones with his band mates most. \u201cI've a photo on my sitting room wall where we're in Brazil just completely pissing ourselves, basically,\u201d he smiles. \u201cThat for me is the ultimate. Such a simple thing. Being with my friends, laughing, a lot.\u201d\n\nTrack 14. Perfect Symmetry\n\nArt, always. Keane know how to collaborate, choosing dazzling minds to enhance their singular vision: novelist/force of nature Irvine Welsh (director of the foreboding Atlantic video, 2006), graphic designer Sanna Annukka (the dynamic swirls of the Under The Iron Sea art-work), artist Osang Gwon (the life-size, photo-montage sculptures for the Perfect Symmetry art-work). They've met a myriad heroes on what Tom calls \u201cThe Celebrity Thrill Ride at Disneyland\u201d. In 2011, a \u201cbabbling\u201d Tim met all-time hero Paul Simon two nights in a row, \u201cand his security guard clearly had me earmarked as a potentially dangerous nutter\u201d. In 2011 in Glasgow, they had a backstage photo-op with Paul McCartney, Tim\u2019s greatest hero other than Paul Simon. \u201cWe were stood in line and I thought, I'll let Tim stand next to him,\u201d remembers Jesse Quin, Keane's live bass player turned full-time member in 2011. \u201cAnd Paul McCartney shoved him out the way, pulled me next to him and said (comedy Liverpudlian) \u201cus bass players have gorra stick together, man!\u201d. \u201cTim won't let me forget it.\u201d In 2010, Tom sang with Queen at the Albert Hall, introduced by Brian May with the words: \u201cNo-one's sung this song since Freddie sang it, because they haven't been able to.\u201d\n\nTrack 15. My Shadow\n\n2004. Novelist William Boyd (currently penning the new James Bond novel) has enjoyed, in Keane, a curiously symbiotic connection: in their early years Keane wrote the song \u2018Any Human Heart\u2019, inspired by Boyd's novel of the same name. Never released, word filtered back to the writer anyway who was newly besotted with \u2018Hopes And Fears\u2019, beguiled by Tom's \u201cethereal, plangent voice\u201d and Tim's \u201cmelodic generosity that was astounding in contemporary British rock\u201d. William and Tim became friends, by 2012 both individually plundering East Sussex/West Kent for creative inspiration, for the \u2018Strangeland\u2019 album and the \u2018Waiting For Sunrise\u2019 novel. A short story ensued, named after the \u2018Strangeland\u2019 single \u2018Sovereign Light Caf\u00e9\u2019 (published on the deluxe CD sleeve-notes). \u201cKeane,\u201d wrote Boyd in a celebratory appraisal in the Guardian in 2012, \u201care a great British band.\u201d\n\nTrack 16. Silenced By The Night\n\n2006/7, Under The Iron Sea Tour, everywhere. Rich sits behind his drum-kit, transfixed, as Tom sings \u2018Try Again\u2019, the staggeringly plaintive piano dreamscape which doesn't require much drumming. \u201cAnd every night I would almost forget to come back in because I was lost, listening,\u201d he remembers. \u201cTom just does it night after night, absolutely beautifully. A remarkable singer.\u201d\n\nTrack 17. Disconnected\n\n\u201cIt sounds pretentious but the whole culture of Keane, to a lot of people, is a vitally positive thing,\u201d decides Tim. \u201cIt's definitely something real. We're brave and honest in our songs and people respond to that. Whether it's teenagers grappling with adulthood, people getting divorced, people stuck in war zones, they find, somehow, inspiration and comfort in our music.\u201d\n\nTrack 18. Sovereign Light Caf\u00e9\n\n1980s. As kids in the 80s, the boys who would be Keane drank fizzy drinks in the Sovereign Light Caf\u00e9, Bexhill-on-Sea. As men in 2008, they drank fizzier drinks in Schwarzes Caf\u00e9, Berlin, the 24-hour bar where Keane relaxed most nights, sometimes 'til 6am. For the first time in his life, Tim felt he was truly \u201cliving the dream\u201d.\n\nTrack 19. Higher Than The Sun\n\nNovember 2013, everywhere. Keane's first-ever \u2018Best Of\u2019 is released this November, both a glorious celebration of one of Britain's best-loved bands and a soaring testament to the power of melodic rapture. The jury is in: from the magical, perennial alchemy of melancholy and beauty, this is undeniable evidence of Keane's considerable contribution to the sum of human happiness.\n\n\u201cIt's a classic thing in music, isn't it?\u201d decides Tim. \u201cAll the people I love, most of their songs have a melancholy tint, if not very dark. And yet their music makes you happy. People can get very serious about music. But at Keane gigs, everyone's smiling. Even if you're singing about heartbreak, confusion and desperation. Being able to connect with people, that's really all we care about.\u201d\n\nTrack 20. Won't Be Broken\n\nThe Future. As Keane's five No.1 albums attest, they've never faltered. Tim Rice-Oxley remains ambitious, focused, hungry.\n\n\u201cI think there is an undeniable quality to what we've achieved so far,\u201d he decides. \u201cBut it's in my nature to also feel that there's more we could do. One of those great albums of all time which you don't appreciate until you're older, with the extra wisdom you don't have when you're young. I've had my own ups and downs and feel like I'm just approaching the point where I could write an album like that. The richness is beginning to come through.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we all just want to feel connected, don't we?\u201d concludes Tom, of the power of Keane's singularly emotive music. \u201cTo the world. To each other. I hope if we've done anything we've given people a sense that the world is not such a huge scary place as it can sometimes seem. That we are all in it together. To the end. So you might as well try and understand what it is to be a human being, while we're all here.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Leslie Mendelson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9202259.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.98907, 40.72277], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "New York", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "LIVE STREAM - Leslie Mendelson"}, {"Address": "200 Varick St, New York, NY 10014", "Artist": "Gina D'Soto ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10236736.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00478, 40.72826], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Fusion, Cuban Traditions, R&b, Cuban Jazz, Worldbeat, Cuban Pop, Soul, Experimental Alternative, Jazz, Soul Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "SOB's", "moreBioInfo": "Always comfortable and very real, Gina D\u2019Soto graces every stage with her energetic, soulful and powerful vocals; being widely recognized as a very charming, playful and passionate human being, unafraid of showing who she really is, and fiercely open to connect with her audience and those around her.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B.

His debut album Jerome Raheem Fortune, released last year on Fool's Gold Records, with production from Kaytranada on lead single Dance, was the true story of this man who fell to earth.

Francisco Javier Barraza Rodr\u00edguez, a quien todo el mundo conoce como Pancho Barraza, es originario de Juan Jos\u00e9 R\u00edos, Sinaloa. Desde muy peque\u00f1o mostr\u00f3 una gran inclinaci\u00f3n hacia la m\u00fasica, aunque al principio casi nadie cre\u00eda en \u00e9l. Fue hasta la edad de 22 a\u00f1os, mientras era maestro de m\u00fasica en la secundaria del poblado de Villa Uni\u00f3n, que se inicia de manera profesional al formar parte del grupo vers\u00e1til Karisma como vocalista y bajista. Al mismo tiempo, integra el coro de la iglesia del pueblo. Al poco tiempo, su talento y don para componer, lo llevan a la banda Los Recoditos, donde lo designan como su voz principal logrando destacar con sus propias canciones. Adem\u00e1s, se convierte en el creador del estilo rom\u00e1ntico en la m\u00fasica de banda y es as\u00ed que Recoditos empieza a sonar en las radios del Pac\u00edfico gracias a los temas de Pancho. Es tanta su inquietud por crear y la confianza que se tiene como cantante, compositor y m\u00fasico que en 1995 se separa de Los Recoditos para lanzarse como solista y forma su propia banda. La bautiza con el nombre de \u2018Santa Mar\u00eda\u2019. De ah\u00ed en adelante, los nombres de Pancho Barraza y su banda Santa Mar\u00eda empiezan a escucharse con gran insistencia por todo el Pac\u00edfico y parte de Estados Unidos con temas como \u201cMis Canciones De Amor\u201d, \u201cIgnorarte Mis L\u00e1grimas\u201d, \u201cGabriela De Mis Amores\u201d, \u201cPasi\u00f3n De Amor\u201d y \u201cSanta Mar\u00eda Banda\u201d. Todos estos \u00e9xitos vienen incluidos en su primera producci\u00f3n como solista titulada \u201cMis Canciones De Amor\u201d. En abril del 96, lanza su segundo disco compacto titulado \u201cCuenta Conmigo\u201d, del que destacan canciones como \u201cMi Amor Y Mi Agon\u00eda\u201d, \u201cUna Tarde Como Cualquiera\u201d, la titular \u201cCuenta Conmigo\u201d, \u201cTe Amo Y Te Lo Digo\u201d y otras. Es tanta su capacidad musical, que al a\u00f1o siguiente decide incursionar en la m\u00fasica ranchera. Forma su mariachi Santa Mar\u00eda y graba el \u00e1lbum \u201cInv\u00e9ntame Un Amor\u201d, del que se desprenden los \u00e9xitos \u201cPero La Recuerdo\u201d, \u201cSolitario Entre La Gente\u201d y \u201cCantares De Medianoche\u201d. Tanta fue la aceptaci\u00f3n que tuvo Pancho Barraza con este disco que los lugares donde se presentaba siempre estaban llenos a reventar, por lo que merecidamente se gan\u00f3 el titulo de \u201c\u00eddolo de las multitudes\u201d. En 1998, se convierte en \u201cEl Vagabundo Que Te Ama\u201d y con \u00e9ste, que fue su nuevo CD, lanza un nuevo hit a ritmo de banda: \u201cMi Enemigo El Amor\u201d, y uno m\u00e1s a ritmo de cumbia: \u201cAquella Morena\u201d. Adem\u00e1s, por primera vez graba un corrido: \u201cHistoria De Amores\u201d. En junio de 1999, vuelve a sorprender con su producci\u00f3n titulada \u201cDel Camino A La Ciudad\u201d, un disco lleno de inspiraci\u00f3n y nostalgia por los momentos dificiles que pasa cualquier ser humano. De este nuevo trabajo musical se desprenden 12 temas en los que Pancho muestra su madurez art\u00edstica y humana, ya que incursiona al mismo tiempo en g\u00e9neros como la salsa, el bolero, la balada y la cumbia. \u201cYa Se Fue\u201d es el disco que el \u2018\u00eddolo de las multitudes\u2019 lanza para comenzar el a\u00f1o 2000. Por primera vez en su exitosa carrera incluye temas de otros autores. Pero les imprime su muy peculiar estilo interpretativo como es el caso de \u201cUn Indio Quiere Llorar\u201d, \u201cMi Juramento\u201d, \u201cAy Amigo\u201d, y \u201cLas Rejas No Matan\u201d, entre otros. \u201cYa Se Fue\u201d tambi\u00e9n cuenta con temas de su propia inspiraci\u00f3n, como \u201cCompa\u00f1era M\u00eda\u201d, \u201cLola La Bailera\u201d, \u201cNo Va A Matarme Tu Amor\u201d y \u201cLa Vaca Pinta\u201d. Para finales de ese mismo a\u00f1o, saca \u201cUna Noche Cualquiera\u201d una producci\u00f3n musical en la que vuelve a demostrar el porqu\u00e9 se ha convertido en uno de los \u2018cantautores\u2019 preferidos del p\u00fablico, al interprerar canciones como \u201cCon M\u00fasica Rom\u00e1ntica\u201d, \u201cEl Paso De La Iguana\u201d, \u201cH\u00e1blame Claro\u201d, \u201cDebajo De Los Laureles\u201d y la que da t\u00edtulo a este disco. Pero el talento y la creatividad de Pancho no deja de fluir y para mediados del 2000, casi a la par, lanza dos producciones. Una de estas es \u201cFormas De Vivir\u201d, con la que expone su gran versatilidad como autor, int\u00e9rprete y arreglista. Se trata de un disco completo, con acompa\u00f1amiento de su propio mariachi. Incluye temas a ritmo de cumbia como \u201cTienes Que Volver\u201d, \u201cRegresa Por Favor\u201d, \u201cMi Dama\u201d y \u201cSi Por Amor\u201d. La otra producci\u00f3n a ritmo de banda se llama \u201cVuelve Por Favor\u201d. Por primera vez incluye una bachata (\u201cBurbuja De Amor\u201d) y un tema a ritmo de soca (\u201cPu tun tun\u201d), cumbias (\u201cLa Roncona\u201d, \u201cEl Muerto Se Fue De Rumba\u201d y \u201cEl Toro Baquet\u00f3n\u201d) y las rancheras que tan bien le van (\u201cArr\u00e1ncame La Vida\u201d, \u201cNo Volver\u00e9\u201d, \u201cCuando Nadie Te Quiera\u201d, \u201cA La Luz De Un Farol\u201d, \u201c\u00c1nimas Que No Amanezca\u201d y \u201cEl Dinero\u201d) y una balada (\u201cVuelve Por Favor\u201d). Por su trayectoria y sus logros, su nombre es muy importante para quienes realmente gustan de la m\u00fasica popular. Pancho Barraza comenz\u00f3 el nuevo milenio con la alegre producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica \u201cSinverg\u00fcenza Y Mujeriego\u201d, grabada bajo el sello que lo ha visto crecer: Discos Musart/ Balboa Records. Con \u201cSinverg\u00fcenza y Mujeriego\u201d, sigui\u00f3 en los primeros sitios de popularidad, sonando fuertemente en las estaciones de radio y sorprendiendo a propios y extra\u00f1os por su mezcla de ritmos y gran calidad art\u00edstica, con \u00e9xitos tan inolvidables como \u201cTe Esperar\u00e9\u201d, que contin\u00faa en la programaci\u00f3n de muchas emisoras hasta siete a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su estreno.

While they could barely tune their guitars back then (assuming anyone even remembered to bring a tuner to the shows), they were able to develop a unique, rowdy take on Americana by drawing on a fascination with country music and their own experiences drinking and hanging out in the fields and parking lots of their suburban home towns.\n\nTen years later, after moving to NYC in 2007, GunFight! has grown into a cohesive Brooklyn act with one EP and two LP\u2019s in their repertoire, a steady following, and a sound they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cPost-Country\" \u2014a raucous blend of roots-country, punk, post-punk and good old rock n\u2019 roll, that serves as a timely rebuke and New York-style re-appropriation of the \u201crah-rah red-state\u201d nature of contemporary country music. Think The Clash and The Ramones playing Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings covers with a healthy dose of Bruce Springsteen mixed in. Initially a four piece, the band has grown over the years to include five members: Drew Mintz (guitar and vocals), Rich DiGregorio (drums), Bill Dvorak (guitar), Mark Karges (bass) and Griffin McMahon (keys).\n\nSince moving to NYC, GunFight! has built a strong following in the live settings of loft parties, basements and venues like Mercury Lounge, Cake Shop, BK Bazaar, and Brooklyn Bowl. They released the Hide Your Empties EP (on BNS Sessions) in early 2009 and their first full-length, Frontier Land in 2010. GunFight! has played on bills with Those Darlins, Langhorne Slim, Beach Fossils, J. Roddy Walston and The Business, and others. The band has also been written about by SPIN, FILTER, CMJ, Tiny Mix Tapes, New York Magazine and more.\n\nIn 2017, the band released their second full-length, Stripes (recorded with Jeff Berner at GaluminumFoil Productions). The album features a mix of \u201cclassic\u201d GunFight! country/punk, along with a ballad or two, a \u201cproper\u201d country song and even a few experimental moments.\n\nGunFight! is currently toiling away on new material for a third album. Sparked initially as tribute to Ray Price's classic 1963 album Night Life, this yet to be completed collection of songs will similarly draw its inspiration from the many goings-on that occur between sunset and sunrise.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "915 Wyckoff Ave, Ridgewood, NY 11385", "Artist": "sadie dupuis ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-73.906299, 40.696974], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Trans Pecos", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Natural History (Record Release) with Ted Leo + Sadie Dupuis (of Speedy Ortiz)"}, {"Address": "1008 Brown Street, Lake Peekskill, NY", "Artist": "aNight ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6046552.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.919712, 41.290228], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Rock, House, Electro, Progressive-house, Electro-house, Progressive, Electronic", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Paramount Hudson Valley Theater", "moreBioInfo": "Head of Nameless Music Festival & WhiteBormio, from Lecco, Italy.

They were still in need of a bass player, and less than a week after graduating college, in June '01, Max's brother Julian joined the band.

As NPR says of the British transplant, \u201chis timeless songwriting style, which seems to draw from great songwriters of every era, conveys quiet confidence and lovely intimacy.\u201d\n\nNodding to \u201870s rock with shimmering acoustic guitars, an understated rhythm section and flourishes of fiddle, mandolin, piano and dobro, \u2018Another Life\u2019 bridges the mainstream appeal of songwriters like Jesse Harris and Norah Jones and the quirkier sensibility of Loudon Wainwright. With funding entirely from fan contributions through PledgeMusic, Maddock worked with producer Matt Pierson, multi-instrumentalist Larry Campbell (who\u2019s played with Bob Dylan and Levon Helm) and bassist Tony Scherr (who plays with Norah Jones).\n\nThe 13 songs on 'Another Life' paint a portrait of a man reaching the midpoint of his life, a natural progression from themes in Maddock's earlier releases. He\u2019s looking back on roads not taken, and isn\u2019t always sure he chose the right one. On the title track, Maddock wants an extra 50 years to try \u201cacting, white-water rafting,\u201d \u201csome illegal substances,\u201d even having a kid or three. \u201cI\u2019ve Been There Too,\u201d built around an indelible guitar riff, shows Maddock\u2019s knack for instrumental hooks as well as lyrical ones. \u201cDon\u2019t Go Lonely,\u201d in a well-timed moment of levity, hints at reggae with dub bass, bubbling organ and the chorus\u2019s entreaty to \u201cgo get high, go get found, go crazy on this town / don\u2019t go lonely.\u201d\n\nAfter fronting the Columbia Records band Wood, whose debut \u2018Songs From Stamford Hill\u2019 was featured prominently on TV shows such as \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek,\u201d Maddock moved from England to New York City in 2003.

Several demos, a few years, a new group name, and additional members later, the direction of the crew took its turn towards blending science fiction and conspiracy theories into rap songs, which at the time, was a rare take on hip hop music in the early 90s. In 1994, the early \"Demigodz\" group split up due to the ever-so-popular break up reason: \"musical differences\". However, it was through this transition that the Demigodfather met another fellow CT lyricist, Apathy. As the musical partnership between Open Mic and Apathy progressed, the two decided to rebuild the Demigodz name and take their aspirations to an entirely different level. After years of recording songs, mastering the ASR-10, co-hosting a radio show, and gaining ties with the likes of Alien Nation, Mothership aka Eternia, and Al T of Newcleus, Mic's dues were slowly but surely being paid. Along with Apathy, he also headed up a Connecticut based chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation and recorded the cassette-only \"Sureshot Affair\" EP, which was self-released in 1997 and sold throughout the underground circles of the North East. Shortly thereafter, Mic took a step back from the scene after getting married and becoming a father for the first time in his life... In 2000, the Demigodz became resurrected by Apathy and expanded into a military-like squadron of MCs and DJs. With that movement in motion, it couldn't have existed without the inclusion of its original creator, Open Mic, and once again he became immersed into the hip hop world. Since then, Mic has kept himself afloat by making appearances on wax, including \"Science of the Bumrush\" on UK-based Stonegroove Recordings and the Demigodz EP released on Ill Boogie Records in mid-2002, all of which received critical acclaim in such publications as XXL and The Source. Outside of the microphone realm, he has made quite a name for himself over the years as a professional graphic designer, in which his lengthy resume extends widely with the creation of many 12\" single, vinyl album, and CD covers for an extensive list of labels - beginning with Bronx Science Records (Apathy's first label), Raptivism Records, Domination Recordings and most recently Babygrande. In early 2006, after being reunited with early 'Nobility' member and co-founder of the first generation of the Demigodz, P-Air, Open Mic has begun work on a new duo project. Returning to his original group base from 1989-1990, and bringing back that boom-bap early 90's sound that hip-hop has lacked since it took a commercial nosedive, Open Mic is ready to deliver what many Demigodz fans have been asking for.... the real raw shit. Keep your eyes open for the debut of his new group the \"Megadonz\" in late 2007.\n\nFor more info on MEGADONZ check out their MySpace page at:\nwww.myspace.com/megadonzmusic", "otherInfo": "WE TAKE CAUTION UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE WE SHALL ENTERTAIN AN EVEN SMALLER AUDIENCE THAN EVER BEFORE.

When there are rules, it doesn't become art, and it's not fun. I've learned that you can't please everybody, so I'd rather be concerned with making good art, and the people that like this art will stick with you.\" Philadelphia born and based Josh Wink is one of the true pioneers of techno, house and allied styles - blurring the definitions. At 13, a young Josh Wink began his first job as an apprentice at Captain Jack\u2019s mobile DJ Company, three years later, he had started to DJ at local house parties. By 1988 \u2013 the year that \u2018rave\u2019 exploded into public conscious - Wink was already a main player on the underground music scene. \u201cThen I began to realize that I had ideas of songs. Instead of DJing other people\u2019s music, I wanted to translate these ideas into my own music that was in my head. House music and new wave electronic music really influenced me when I was a teenager. Plus, going to see Jazzy Jeff and Cash Money DJ in Philly made me want to get more into the 'art' of DJing.\u201d In 1990, just out of his teens, Wink released his first EP \u2018Tribal Confusion\u2019 on the infamous Strictly Rhythm imprint, under the moniker E-Culture (with King Britt), also releasing other EPs under various different guises. In 1994 he formed his own imprint \u2018Ovum Recordings\u2019 and released \u2018Liquid Summer\u2019 \u2013 a track which helped propel him onto the international circuit. \u201cI\u2019d say that Wink 'Liquid Summer' (Ovum), Wink \u2018Meditation Will Manifest' (R & S Records), Winx \u2018How's The Music\u2019 (Sorted) and \u2018Nervous Build Up\u2019 (Nervous) were some tracks that got me to start traveling around the world in the early 90's.\u201d In 1995, Josh Wink became one of the first DJ/producers to translate his music from the underground to above and to international success. He consecutively unleashed a string of classics including \u2018Don't Laugh\u2019 (recorded as Winx on Nervous Records) and \u2018Higher State of Consciousness\u2019 \u2013 tracks that topped charts worldwide and that are still recognized and played today. He also remixed Moby and Firefly in the same year. In 1996, whilst gaining recognition from leading press including Rolling Stone magazine, Josh Wink released his debut album \u2018Left Above The Clouds\u2019 (under the name Winx) on Nervous Records. In 1998, he released his second LP \u2018HearHere\u2019 on his own Ovum imprint. With \u2018HereHear\u2019 Wink pushed boundaries even further, inviting fellow artists as diverse as Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails), Caroline Crawley (Shelleyann Orphan / This Mortal Coil), and Philly poet Ursula Rucker (Jazzanova / The Roots) to contribute to a far-reaching disc that ran the gamut of electronic music styles - from ambient and trip-hop to drum & bass, as well as the trademark mix of house and techno on which Wink has built his international reputation. \u201cI wanted to continue to push my envelope of making diverse electronic music and not have pressure to only make dance music.\u201d In 1999, as well as remixing Steve Bug\u2019s \u2018Loverboy\u2019 on Poker Flat, Josh Wink began his highly respected \u2018Profound Sounds\u2019 Ovum compilation series with \u2018Profound Sounds Vol.1\u2019. In 2000, he sampled Chicago legend Lil Louis\u2019s \u2018French Kiss\u2019 to create \u2018How\u2019s Your Evening So Far\u2019, released on FFRR records, he also remixed The Utah Saints and Mood II Swing. In 2001 Josh Wink released \u2018Evil Acid\u2019 on Ovum and also teamed up with Carl Cox to release Wink Vs Carl Cox \u2018It\u2019s The Machines\u2019 on Cox\u2019s Intec imprint, as well as delivering highly coveted remix workings of Depeche Mode, Dave Clarke and Slam. Into 2002 and Josh Wink delivered \u2018Superfreak\u2019 \u2013a release that again caught the ears of many and inspired many in the process. He also remixed Paul Oakenfold\u2019s \u2018Starry Eyed Surprise\u2019, FC Kahuna, Sebastien Leger and Range Of Motion for his own Ovum imprint. In 2003 Josh Wink delivered his third artist album \u201820 To 20\u2019 on Ovum \u2013 moreover a collection of his own work that he would class as his \u2018secret weapons\u2019 on the dancefloor; heavily 303 inspired releases that delved into Wink\u2019s Acidic House roots. He also delivered his masterful \u2018Profound Sounds Vol.2\u2019 mix CD and remixed artists including Sting, Masters At Work, Ladytron, Harry Romero and Icelandic band GusGus. In 2004 Josh Wink once again set dancefloors in motion with EPs \u2018516 Acid\u2019 and \u2018Oakish\u2019 \u2013 EPs which garnered support both from both the old-school and the new DJs and styles filtering into the scene. He also remixed DJ Minx for Richie Hawtin\u2019s M-nus imprint, Australian band Infusion, Steffan Goldmann\u2019s \u2018Shimmer\u2019 EP on Ovum and Alexkid\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t Hide It\u2019 for FCommunications. In 2005, Josh Wink remixed artists including DJ Sneak and Alter Ego and, in 2006, he released \u2018Have To Get Back\u2019 (no vox version) on M-nus, under the moniker Dinky Dog, as part of M-nus\u2019s 'MinimizeToMaximize' / various artist compilation. He also released the third in the Profound Sounds series \u2013 \u2018Profound Sounds Vol.3\u2019 (coming out in the UK on Ministry of Sound entitled \u2018Sessions\u2019) \u2013 which exclusively included the remix he crafted for Radiohead\u2019s \u2018Everything In It\u2019s Right Place\u2019. His \u2018Have To Get Back\u2019 release came out as a double A-side on M-nus, backed with Loco Dice\u2019s \u2018Seeing Through Shadows\u2019. In 2007, Josh Wink released his EP \u2018Thick As Thieves\u2019 on Steve Bug\u2019s Poker Flat imprint \u2013 an exchange for a release Bug had given to Ovum \u2018Houze/Summer Nights\u2019 (released in 2004) - he also released \u2018Swirl\u2019/\u2019Have To Get Back\u2019 (Vox version) on Ovum and remixed Chicken Lips, Taho (for Ovum), Someone Else and Radio Slave\u2019s \u2018Screaming Hands\u2019 for Rekids. Into 2008 and Wink has once again switched styles, altered rules and initiated a change. With his influential EP \u2018Stay Out All Night\u2019, released on Ovum in May (a massive Miami track and an \u2018Essential New Tune\u2019 for Pete Tong on Radio 1), Wink went against the current musical grain and paired NYC 90's house with Chicago jackin\u2019 beats and a bit of St. Germain. Wink also spent the first half of 2008 preparing his fourth artist album \u2013 \u2018When a Banana Was Just a Banana\u2019. Josh Wink\u2019s Ovum imprint, since its beginnings in 1994, has seen releases from Loco Dice, Shlomi Aber, Marc Romboy, DJ Pierre, Aaron Carl, King Britt, Steve Bug, D\u2019Julz and of course his own productions. It still continues to grow by both introducing new talents and releasing one-offs from some of the world\u2019s best known producers. \u201cOvum is about integrity to good music! We feel that we don\u2019t have to follow the music that is trendy or fad-like at the moment.\u201d As a DJ, since his 1988 \u2018rave\u2019 beginnings, Josh Wink extensively traveled the globe since 1995 \u2013 playing every festival that counts, through to the smallest and underground venues around the globe. \u201cThe Best DJ experience is being able to create an audio atmosphere where an audience can absorb from me, while I get absorbed from them.\u201d His only residency in the world is held in his hometown of Philadelphia at Fluid. Taking trends, making trends and breaking trends, Josh Wink\u2019s music (under its many monikers including Wink, Winc, Winks, Winx, The Crusher, E-Culture, and Size 9, Accent, Dinky Dog, J Dawg and The Crusher) has always experimented and influenced. The sound of Josh Wink today remains one of a man unafraid to walk the border between stylistic boundaries.

Most quickly realize that such a feat is nearly impossible, but every once in a while someone manages the wonderful trick of putting a new spin on things in a way that sounds completely and wholly fresh.\n\nSuch is the case with Rene Lopez\u2019s new EP, Love Has No Mercy. While the veteran NYC musician\u2019s earlier records flirted with everything from salsa to soul, the seven tracks on Love are a decidedly more dance-friendly affair. The record\u2014which incorporates the sanguine Latin influences of his previous albums and interjects them with a healthy dose of disco and funk\u2014seems tailor made for both impromptu house parties and late nights at the club.\n\n\u201cThere was no grand plan,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cI wrote a ton of songs for my last record that I didn\u2019t end up using, so I booked some studio time and decided just to go in and kind of see what happened. I wrote \u201cLove Has No Mercy\u201d first and then the other songs just kind of happened. You know, I started off in the early 90\u2019s playing in a Latin funk band with an MC\u2014we\u2019d play with Public Enemy or The Meters or jam bands. We were kind of chameleons. I\u2019ve grown used taking all of my influences and then fusing them together into something new. I never felt very comfortable just working in one genre. This time around it just happened that I started to incorporate a dance sensibility into the work as well, which felt very natural.\u201d\n\nClocking in at just under 30 minutes, Love Has No Mercy is a remarkably slick statement of intent. The EPs title track, which features vocals from NYC powerhouse Carol Cee, is equal parts Chic and Giorgio Moroder\u2014a siren song of synthed-out futuristic disco that swings with the same kind of effortlessness that brings to mind the likes of \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and old school Donna Summer. In other words, it\u2019s a track that basically requires dancing. Elsewhere, tracks like \u201cLovegod\u201d and \u201cCity Streets are Dead Tonight\u201d pulse with same kind of subdued electro-funk that made early Prince and Rick James tracks so eternally irresistible. For Lopez, the tracks represent a natural musical evolution\u2014a move from the sweaty rock and Latin grooves of his previous albums to a place located firmly on the dance floor.\n\nThe somewhat kaleidoscopic array of influences manifesting on Love Has No Mercy make sense considering Lopez\u2019 rich musical heritage. A native New Yorker (and the son of renowned salsa musician Rene Lopez, Sr), Lopez grew up absorbing the non-stop musical melting pot that the city had to offer, eventually channeling those influences into a his own music. A jazz trained drummer and multi-instrumentalist, Lopez recorded with a variety of band projects (The Authority, Extra Virgin) before taking wing as a solo artist, eventually perfecting a style that he came to refer to as E.L.S. (Electric Latin Soul). Though his previous solo records (People Are Just People, E.L.S., Paint The Moon Gold) flirted with the aesthetics of dance music, Love Has No Mercy embraces the spirit of classic 1970\u2019s NYC club culture.\n\n\u201cThis record is a first for me,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m just kind of dipping my toe into this new world. I\u2019m excited to see people remix these songs and for them to have a life out in the clubs. It makes sense when I think about the way I grew up. I was a kid during the disco era.

In-demand all over the world, Moudaber has played everything from intimate after-hours clubs; to revered nightclub institutions like Space, DC10, Output and Stereo; to massive festival stages, including Glastonbury, Electric Daisy Carnival (hosting her own MoodZONE stages), and two appearances at Coachella. She\u2019s been featured by the New York Times and CNN, named \u201cone to watch\u201d by Billboard and Paper magazine, and has graced the cover of electronic music magazines in several countries. Her weekly radio show In The MOOD - which Moudaber hosts with her unmistakable husk-and-honey voice - won Best Online Music Show in the 2016 Online Radio Awards and is syndicated across over 80 stations in 50 countries, commanding over 16 million listeners worldwide. She has over a million social followers who she dialogues with daily, sharing candid thoughts on music, work, and life.\n\nMood Records, the imprint she founded in 2013, is a vessel for her own music, and that of other artists who complement her style - which is percussive, deep, and dynamic. She linked up with Skunk Anansie frontwoman Skin for the \u201cBreed\u201d EP in 2015. Backed by a set of high-fashion, black-and-white music videos, it fused their two worlds of techno and rock to critical acclaim, and was submitted and accepted into the 2015 GRAMMYS for consideration.

The band currently divides it's time between New Jersey and Nashville TN, but perform shows all over the country. They play a large repertoire of their own material written mainly by head songwriter Strevens, but also include collaborations with Kelly. 2010 saw the independent release of their debut album \"Hillbilly Clubhouse\" to critic\u2019s raves with the title track receiving airplay both nationally and internationally. In 2012 \"Burning Down The Farm\" the 2nd single from that album stayed on the Music Row Charts for 32 weeks hitting #72.

Their single \"Jersey Strong\" featured on their second album has been named the official anthem of New Jersey by the organization Strong Than The Storm and was a feature point on Discovery's Destination American Red, White and You. It has put them in the national media spotlight, in which they completed a media tour in support of the song. In 2014 the band suffered a setback with the sudden death of longtime drummer Herb Van Note. For a moment the band was unsure if it could continue, but with the help of replacement drummer Greg Annunziata the band hit the road again in April. By the year\u2019s end they will have clocked in over 75 shows. 2014 also saw the band doing repeat shows with Sara Evans and Phil Vassar, plus performing with The Swon Brothers. 2014-2015 the band performed headlining theater shows in New Jersey and Virginia.

A musical ambassador and a veteran of acid house, a champion of techno, a dance music pioneer, label owner, King of Ibiza \u2013 you name it, Carl's been there and done it, never losing sight of his passions \u2013 playing music, breaking tunes and celebrating life. It was at the age of 15 that Carl bought a set of turntables and began working as a mobile DJ. Disco was the first music that captivated him but by the early 80s Cox had moved on to playing the same music as other young London DJs \u2013 rare groove, New York hip-hop and electro. He was perfectly placed to hear Chicago house music in its earliest forms, and when the epic 'Acid Trax' by Phuture (a.k.a. DJ Pierre) came out in early '87. \u201cIt was then that I thought, 'This is it,\u2019 says Carl. \u201cI would do my parties, and I'd play old rare groove and hip hop and soul and I would say 'Right you've got to hear this Phuture track\u2019 and people would just stop and listen.\u201d As a founder of the sound, Carl rode the exploding British rave scene. He played the opening night of Danny Rampling's legendary Shoom, co-promoted The Project with Paul Oakenfold, where he also DJ\u2019d and did the sound system. He held a residency at the Zap Club in Brighton and at the Sunrise rave in 1988, hooked up a third turntable for his dawn-breaking set, got 15,000 people back on their feet, and established a personal rep for three-deck wizardry. The next step was to make music, and Carl's 1991 debut single for Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto label, 'I Want You,' reached Number 23 in the national UK charts and gave Carl his first Top of the Pops appearance. Two more singles also made the charts. But Carl was a reluctant pop star and as the masses moved onto fluffy house and trance, and the hardcore created jungle, Cox retreated into the club world that had nurtured him, and instead embraced the underground sounds of techno. \"Techno drives home somewhere,\" he says of his core music. \"It takes you to an element of surprise, not knowing where you're going. It's scary but wonderful at the same time.\" Carl\u2019s classic releases include his 1995 mix CD, 'F.A.C.T,' which became a techno benchmark, selling over 250,000 copies, and the 1996 EP 'Two Paintings and a Drum,' which again broke the British top 30. Alongside Carl\u2019s \u2018Ultimate Music Management\u2019 company, which counted Josh Wink and Laurent Garnier among 27 clients, there was the Ultimatum record label, for which Carl recorded his third top 30 UK single, 'Sensual Sophis-ti-cat.' In 2005, Carl\u2019s third album, \u2018The Second Sign\u2019 caused a stir across Europe and reached number 3 in Spain\u2019s national chart. Also gaining critical acclaim was \u2018Dirty Bass,\u2019 a collaboration with Christian Smith, and the funky \u2018Give Me Your Love\u2019, both released on 23rd Century Records, an outlet for his own burgeoning production output. Carl formed his own label, Intec Records, in 1999, scoring a series of underground hits and enjoying eight years at the forefront of electronic music. After its closure in 2006, Carl was still inundated with new music, finally deciding to re-launch the label as Intec Digital at the start of 2010. It\u2019s been a triumphant return, thanks to exclusives from some of the biggest names in techno. \u201cThe label couldn\u2019t be going better,\u201d says Carl. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be back at the helm discovering underground DJs.\u201d Intec Digital was also the home for Carl\u2019s 6th studio album, \u2018All Roads Lead To the Dancefloor,\u2019 released to critical acclaim in 2011 on state-of-the-art, self-updating USB technology. In 2013 Carl re-launched his seminal Pure Intec series, 9 years after the hugely successful original \u2018Pure Intec.\u2019 The release also coincided with the launch of a new series of Intec club nights where Carl played to a sold out XOYO in East London. Since then Intec have continued to hold regular parties across the world, including sell outs in Ibiza, Madrid, Switzerland, Amsterdam for ADE, and London\u2019s fabric. And of course Carl\u2019s name cannot be mentioned without Ibiza. His legendary Ibiza residency at Space came to an end in 2016, after an unbelievable 15 consecutive years. Since 2001 Carl helped establish Space as one of the biggest clubs in the world. With carefully thought out line ups, and as much emphasis on new talent as big names, Carl always strived to keep his night at the forefront of Ibiza clubbing making it one of the most successful residencies in Ibiza history. Starting out in 2001 with just 6 nights, his residency grew and adapted as the club did, so for Carl it was only right to end his residency as Space itself closed its doors. And what a way to go out. Carl\u2019s final 15 week season was his biggest ever, with every single night selling out, heralded by fans and critics alike as a triumphant finale to a piece of dance history. Following the end of his Ibiza residency Carl also decided to say goodbye to his record breaking weekly Global Radio show, which he\u2019d been broadcasting for nearly 16 years. When the final show aired in February 2017, the show was reaching a staggering 17-million weekly listeners worldwide, syndicated across over 60 terrestrial FM, satellite and DAB stations throughout 35 countries. \u201cIt was a hard decision as I loved every minute of creating my Global shows\u201d said Carl at the time. \u201cBut all things must come to an end at some point and it was time to focus on new ventures.\u201d And focus on new ventures he has\u2026. Carl continues to be one of most in demand DJs on the planet, with club dates and festival appearances across the world. After 12 years delivering his Carl Cox & Friends stage at Ultra, Carl is now proud to be ambassador for the Resistance parties, for Ultra worldwide. He also now has his own festival, Pure \u2013 which he initially launched in Australia in 2016. It returned this year with even more dates, including Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Auckland, his Pure brand is something he\u2019s keen to expand on and he\u2019s already taking it global. Summer 2017 saw Carl return to Ibiza with Pure Carl Cox \u2013 two sold out parties at super club Privilege. Built on the idea of taking things back to basics, Carl put the music first and foremost for some no nonsense, no frills house and techno parties \u2013 heralded by many as a highlight of the summer.

They also opened for punk bands The Stranglers and The Motors. They had a hit with the single \"On and On\", and refer to their music as \"Athletic Rock.\"\n\nFormed in Newcastle, England by brothers John and Mark Gallagher, Raven quickly set the pace for the burgeoning metal renaissance in the UK at the time. Raven began creating a sound which was rooted in British hard rock with progressive tendencies and a willingness to take musical chances . The band's highly energized live show and interaction between members developed an image and style of play the band described as \"athletic\". They began wearing guards, helmets and plates from various sports (hockey, baseball,etc...) and incorporating them into the playing of their instruments (for instance, elbow pads were used to strike cymbals for a unique performance angle). Eventually, the band signed with Neat Records, the legendary, low-budget metal label of the Northlands, releasing Wiped Out and Rock Until You Drop within a year's time and making an impressive showing on the UK charts a the time. Sufficient noise was made for the American market to take notice and New Jersey's Megaforce Records signed them, issuing their next recording in the States as All for One. The band came stateside in 1983 and toured extensively with Megaforce bands Metallica and Anthrax, both of whom would gain a place of prominence in the growing thrash metal movement. Manager/Megaforce founder Johnny Zazula believed that Raven were major label material and kept them touring constantly until the big labels noticed. The infamous Live at the Inferno recording was a product of one of those tours. Atlantic Records signed Raven to a worldwide contract after a minor bidding war (major label contracts would follow for Metallica and Anthrax in the following year). The band moved its permanent base from Newcastle to New York.\n\nStay Hard was released in 1984 and proved a minor hit on the strength of single/video On and On. The Atlantic years proved to be less-than-stellar for the band. A drastic shift in a more \"commercial\" direction came at the label's behest, with many diehard fans being alienated by the slick, lightweight production of The Pack Is Back (effectively marketing the band with their weird musical forays and confusing image was likely very difficult). However, the band recorded 2 LPs and the Mad EP before being let go by Atlantic. After touring behind the Life's a Bitch album, Wacko left the band to spend more time with his new wife and family. He would later pursue a career in audio production and engineering, eventually working with jazz greats Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick, Jr. Virginian Joe Hasselvander (ex-Pentagram) took over the drum set and the band dropped the outlandish image for a more conventional \"denim and leather\" look for their 1988 release Nothing Exceeds Like Excess. After the advent of grunge and the dissolution of their record label (Combat Records) led the band to concentrate on continental Europe and Japan, where they retained more of a following. The band recorded and toured until 2001, when a wall collapsed on Mark, crushing his legs. Raven went on hiatus for nearly 5 years while the guitarist rehabilitated. As of 2006, Raven is touring with a new release in the works.\n\n\n2) RAVEN is a Solo project by Terui Toshiyuki (\u7167\u4e95\u5229\u5e78), bassist of BLANKEY JET CITY and ROSSO. In 2003, RAVEN released one album, Kagirinaku aka ni chikai kuro (\u9650\u308a\u7121\u304f\u8d64\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u9ed2), most notably featuring Chiba Yusuke of Thee Michelle Gun Elephant and ROSSO on vocals for most of the tracks.\n\n\n3) Raven is Czech artist and multiinstrumentalist Vladim\u00edr Ku\u010dera (*1966), who's released four albums so far - Bubny a p\u00ed\u0161\u0165aly (1991), Salome a dal\u0161\u00ed p\u00edsn\u011b Karla Kryla (1993), Harmonie (2002) and Kamen\u00ed (2006).\n\n\n4) Raven was an influential band from Buffalo, N.Y., in the 1960s. Raven began as Stan Szelest's backing band in Stan and the Ravens, which featured Tom Calandra on bass and Gary Mallaber on drums. When Stan and the Ravens broke up, Calandra and Mallaber joined a band called The Rising Sons with vocalist Tony Galla, guitarist John Weitz, and pianist/keyboardist Jimmy Calire.\n\nRaven manager Marty Angelo, trying to book gigs for the band outside of Buffalo, met Jimi Hendrix at Steve Paul's Scene in New York City in 1967. Hendrix was so impressed with the tape he heard, that he convinced the club's owner to book Raven.\n\nLater that same year, Angelo sent the same tape Hendrix had heard to Beatle George Harrison. Harrison sent a letter back to Angelo which expressed an interest in signing Raven to Apple Records.\n\n\n5) Raven:\nGenre: Black Metal\nLyrical theme: Misanthropy\nOrigin: Norway\nFormed in: 1993\nLabel: No Colours Records\nLast known line-up:\nRune Vedaa (Forgotten Woods, Joyless)\nothers - unknown\n\nMember(s) of Forgotten Woods involved in this. Their demos were released under the name Ravn.\n\nRumours say that Raven is now a solo band, changed their name to Mengele, and is still making music, but not recording. Might, against all odds, release an MCDlater this year.\n\n\n6) Raven:\nA project of the German band Sleipnir.\n\n7) Raven :\nOhio heavy blues rock band from Ohio, who released one, ultra-rare LP, 1975's \"Back to Ohio Blues\".\n\n8) Raven :\nsee Shape of Despair. They started as Raven, released demo Alone In The Mist and then renamed to their current name\n\n9) Raven:\nRaven is a trash metal band formed in 2007 in Kicevo, Macedonia.", "otherInfo": "The show that started a worldwide movement.

They have released one album by the name \"Familjen P\u00e5 St\u00e5lv\u00e4gen 5\"\n\nIn \"Hip-hop Lives,\" KRS-One says, \"Hip means to know / It's a form of intelligence / To be hip is to be up-date and relevant / Hop is a form of movement / You can't just observe a hop / You got to hop up and do it.\" Boise-based hip-hop artist David Maxwell, who uses the stage name Eleven, holds KRS-One's testament to heart. Eleven raps about the life he has led and the things he has learned along the way. He also rocks the crowd. Eleven has honed some interactive stage techniques at his day job as a teacher. He spends his days guiding young minds through the rigors and joys of writing while teaching ninth- and 11th-grade English at Eagle High School. When the bell rings, however, Eleven immerses himself in his own writing\u2014words that he eventually takes to the stage. Born in Florida and raised San Diego, Eleven was raised primarily by his mother after she split from his father early on. Eleven made the point that though he grew up with his mom, his dad wasn't completely out of the picture. \"My dad and I are more than just father and son, we are also great friends. He was never a deadbeat dad.\" Having an always-at-work single mother meant Eleven's home life was a bit lonely. Instead of staying home and watching TV, Maxwell took to the streets to hang out with his friends. For a soon to be hip-hop artist in So-Cal, he was growing up at just the right time. \"I was a break dancer as a kid. I listened to all the big groups at the time: Run DMC, Eric B and Rakim ... I loved the whole Krush Groove era,\" Eleven said. \"As I got into high school, I really got into EPMD and then big time into the West Coast hip-hop when Dre and Snoop got big.\" Eleven found inspiration in the artists he was listening to in high school and formed his own hip-hop group. He christened himself Voice and along with two other MCs, started performing wherever he could\u2014including the parking lots of other high schools and street corners. Unfortunately, just as they started to generate a buzz, the band members graduated and each went their separate ways. So Maxwell put down his microphone and headed off to Fresno Pacific University to focus on an education and sports. In college, Eleven earned a degree in communication and after graduation started working in broadcasting\u2014a job he quickly realized he wasn't cut out for. Shortly after quitting his broadcasting job, he fell into what he felt was his true calling and started substitute teaching in San Diego, very quickly being hired as a full-time English teacher. Spending his days inspiring young minds to write also inspired Eleven to pick up the pen again. \"I thought back to the teachers that inspired me. My literature teachers were my favorite. They had me reading books and writing things that I never would have done on my own,\" said Eleven. \"I was writing these raps to interest the kids, and I realized how much I still liked it.\" Very quickly his spiral notebooks started filling up with his deeply introspective verse. \"Anybody can write about cars ... money ... it's a few of us that look beyond those things and write about our real purpose in life,\" he said. Maxwell started making mix-tapes of his verses to pre-recorded beats. He began getting on stage again and was soon working on projects with all original beats and production. This time around, he dubbed himself Eleven. \"I have a lot of lines that refer to the number. It was my football number and basketball number ... so I associate it with a lot of things that I do. I consider myself to be one of one and I try to hold myself above. One above the average,\" said Eleven. \"I preach that in my music. Be yourself. If someone is going to influence you, let it be positive.\"", "otherInfo": "The Rub \u2022 Saturday \u2022 Mar 28, 2020 \u2022 Tickets On Sale Now!"}, {"Address": "11 Trinity Pl, New York, NY 10006", "Artist": "Lily Vakili Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10242733.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.013633, 40.706556], "Date": "Sat Mar 28 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-28", "Genre": "Female Fronted, Progressive Alternative, Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "N.O.R.D. - New Old Rock Deli", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cLily Vakili\u2019s new single \u201cShe Wants What\u201d continues blazing an upward trajectory for a multi-cultural artist who transcends genres and labels\u201d \u2013 Vents Magazine\n\nSongwriter and performer, Lily Vakili, has been on a wild ride: \u201cI was born in Honduras during a military coup,\u201d says the New Jersey-based artist, \u201cmy dad walked over injured soldiers in the hospital to welcome me to the world.

A musical ambassador and a veteran of acid house, a champion of techno, a dance music pioneer, label owner, King of Ibiza \u2013 you name it, Carl's been there and done it, never losing sight of his passions \u2013 playing music, breaking tunes and celebrating life. It was at the age of 15 that Carl bought a set of turntables and began working as a mobile DJ. Disco was the first music that captivated him but by the early 80s Cox had moved on to playing the same music as other young London DJs \u2013 rare groove, New York hip-hop and electro. He was perfectly placed to hear Chicago house music in its earliest forms, and when the epic 'Acid Trax' by Phuture (a.k.a. DJ Pierre) came out in early '87. \u201cIt was then that I thought, 'This is it,\u2019 says Carl. \u201cI would do my parties, and I'd play old rare groove and hip hop and soul and I would say 'Right you've got to hear this Phuture track\u2019 and people would just stop and listen.\u201d As a founder of the sound, Carl rode the exploding British rave scene. He played the opening night of Danny Rampling's legendary Shoom, co-promoted The Project with Paul Oakenfold, where he also DJ\u2019d and did the sound system. He held a residency at the Zap Club in Brighton and at the Sunrise rave in 1988, hooked up a third turntable for his dawn-breaking set, got 15,000 people back on their feet, and established a personal rep for three-deck wizardry. The next step was to make music, and Carl's 1991 debut single for Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto label, 'I Want You,' reached Number 23 in the national UK charts and gave Carl his first Top of the Pops appearance. Two more singles also made the charts. But Carl was a reluctant pop star and as the masses moved onto fluffy house and trance, and the hardcore created jungle, Cox retreated into the club world that had nurtured him, and instead embraced the underground sounds of techno. \"Techno drives home somewhere,\" he says of his core music. \"It takes you to an element of surprise, not knowing where you're going. It's scary but wonderful at the same time.\" Carl\u2019s classic releases include his 1995 mix CD, 'F.A.C.T,' which became a techno benchmark, selling over 250,000 copies, and the 1996 EP 'Two Paintings and a Drum,' which again broke the British top 30. Alongside Carl\u2019s \u2018Ultimate Music Management\u2019 company, which counted Josh Wink and Laurent Garnier among 27 clients, there was the Ultimatum record label, for which Carl recorded his third top 30 UK single, 'Sensual Sophis-ti-cat.' In 2005, Carl\u2019s third album, \u2018The Second Sign\u2019 caused a stir across Europe and reached number 3 in Spain\u2019s national chart. Also gaining critical acclaim was \u2018Dirty Bass,\u2019 a collaboration with Christian Smith, and the funky \u2018Give Me Your Love\u2019, both released on 23rd Century Records, an outlet for his own burgeoning production output. Carl formed his own label, Intec Records, in 1999, scoring a series of underground hits and enjoying eight years at the forefront of electronic music. After its closure in 2006, Carl was still inundated with new music, finally deciding to re-launch the label as Intec Digital at the start of 2010. It\u2019s been a triumphant return, thanks to exclusives from some of the biggest names in techno. \u201cThe label couldn\u2019t be going better,\u201d says Carl. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be back at the helm discovering underground DJs.\u201d Intec Digital was also the home for Carl\u2019s 6th studio album, \u2018All Roads Lead To the Dancefloor,\u2019 released to critical acclaim in 2011 on state-of-the-art, self-updating USB technology. In 2013 Carl re-launched his seminal Pure Intec series, 9 years after the hugely successful original \u2018Pure Intec.\u2019 The release also coincided with the launch of a new series of Intec club nights where Carl played to a sold out XOYO in East London. Since then Intec have continued to hold regular parties across the world, including sell outs in Ibiza, Madrid, Switzerland, Amsterdam for ADE, and London\u2019s fabric. And of course Carl\u2019s name cannot be mentioned without Ibiza. His legendary Ibiza residency at Space came to an end in 2016, after an unbelievable 15 consecutive years. Since 2001 Carl helped establish Space as one of the biggest clubs in the world. With carefully thought out line ups, and as much emphasis on new talent as big names, Carl always strived to keep his night at the forefront of Ibiza clubbing making it one of the most successful residencies in Ibiza history. Starting out in 2001 with just 6 nights, his residency grew and adapted as the club did, so for Carl it was only right to end his residency as Space itself closed its doors. And what a way to go out. Carl\u2019s final 15 week season was his biggest ever, with every single night selling out, heralded by fans and critics alike as a triumphant finale to a piece of dance history. Following the end of his Ibiza residency Carl also decided to say goodbye to his record breaking weekly Global Radio show, which he\u2019d been broadcasting for nearly 16 years. When the final show aired in February 2017, the show was reaching a staggering 17-million weekly listeners worldwide, syndicated across over 60 terrestrial FM, satellite and DAB stations throughout 35 countries. \u201cIt was a hard decision as I loved every minute of creating my Global shows\u201d said Carl at the time. \u201cBut all things must come to an end at some point and it was time to focus on new ventures.\u201d And focus on new ventures he has\u2026. Carl continues to be one of most in demand DJs on the planet, with club dates and festival appearances across the world. After 12 years delivering his Carl Cox & Friends stage at Ultra, Carl is now proud to be ambassador for the Resistance parties, for Ultra worldwide. He also now has his own festival, Pure \u2013 which he initially launched in Australia in 2016. It returned this year with even more dates, including Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Auckland, his Pure brand is something he\u2019s keen to expand on and he\u2019s already taking it global. Summer 2017 saw Carl return to Ibiza with Pure Carl Cox \u2013 two sold out parties at super club Privilege.

Endowed with an innate talent and yet an even greater gift for pouring out the hard work necessary, the artist is building his own Hip-Hop empire, crafting and creating his own music while helping to promote and produce that of other up and coming artists along the way. He\u2019s sticking to his guns, being true to himself and what he believes, and his unwavering commitment to excellence, substance, and honesty permeates everything the artist touches.\n\nPhenom\u2019s journey has been an unusual one, finding him drop out of school in the eighth grade where he soon discovered the joys of music.\n\u201cI first started making music at age 13,\u201d he offers. \u201cMy older sister was dating a producer who taught me how to produce beats. After a while of making beats, I started to produce songs for some local artists and by age 16, I was writing songs for other artists as well as for myself.\u201d\n\nInspired by the work of artists like Nas, Jay-Z, and the legendary Michael Jackson, the artist\u2019s work quickly gained steam, finding him release his first EP, Feeling Like a Champion, in 2011 which boasted popular hits like \u201cLocal Celebrity,\u201d featuring DeX! and \u201cMy Better Half\u201d which found him teaming with Jovanna. The accolades continued to come, drawing comparisons to artists such as Fabolous, Drake, and Jay-Z, while applauding the unique voice in Phenom\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one to emulate trends,\u201d the artist shares. \u201cI keep honesty in my music whether I\u2019m doing a thought-provoking song or something for the radio. I stay true to my character in my music. I don\u2019t put on a persona for sales. And contrary to most Hip-Hop artists, I don\u2019t degrade women or talk about money and violence in my music.\u201d\n\nSimilar success and energy fueled the artist\u2019s work on the production end as he was provided the opportunity to work with a variety of producers from all across the globe. He\u2019s executive produced a number of mixtapes, albums, and EPs for multiple artists and also earned his stripes engineering for well-known acts like Triple Seis (formerly of Terror Squad) and Oun-P.\n\nWith his commercial, radio-ready sounds on the move, it was time for the artist to roll out the second phase of his master plan, launching his own entertainment company, So Phenomenal Entertainment, at the age of 21. That transition saw him not only working at his own music but wearing an array of hats, taking on duties as executive producer, audio engineer, songwriter, manager, and head of artist development.\n\nPhenom\u2019s built his company around a set of core beliefs that resonate throughout everything he does. Authenticity is chief among his beliefs and finds itself front and center in the company \u2019s motto, \u201cBe True. Be You. Be So Phenomenal.\u201d Passion is another key virtue that fuels the artist\u2019s drive, in particular, a passion that is accompanied by a die-hard work ethic. As the artist shares, \u201cI never considered myself overly talented but I consider myself a hard worker and hard work will always beat talent when talent doesn\u2019t work hard.\u201d\n\nPhenom\u2019s formula seems to be working, as the company and his music continue to gain steam, fueled by his lyrical honesty, musical integrity, and his desire for excellence in each and every facet of his business. And when you hear \u201cSo Phenomenal\u201d in a new song, you\u2019re going to know it\u2019s something special.", "otherInfo": "Use Referral Code PHENOM for tickets"}, {"Address": "198 Broadway, Amityville, NY 11701", "Artist": "Riddlin\u2019 J ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9643918.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.41742, 40.67899], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "Alternative, Dub, Hip Hop", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Amityville Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "More details to follow"}, {"Address": "15 Mohawk Dr #2005, Marlboro Township, NJ 07746", "Artist": "Nefesh Mountain ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9155106.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.244062, 40.307964], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "Old Time, Bluegrass", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Temple Rodeph Torah", "moreBioInfo": "Nefesh Mountain is the place where American Bluegrass and Old-time music meet with Jewish Heritage and tradition.

Koser entered and won various singing contests up until college, 2008-2012, where she served as the national anthem vocalist for Temple University Athletics. Koser sang the national anthem for 40,000 people as a prize for winning WI105 radio's Fall Fest Star, as the first non-country artist to take the title. In 2013, Koser began opening for many national artists, including rap sensation Mobb Deep. In 2015, Koser co-found Philly pop/reggae band ReddPanda, seen on-air by networks like WFMZ and Good Day PA. After recording the EP \"Stranded\" and performing at festivals like \"West Chester Restaurant Fest\" and \"Turks Head Music Fest\", it was clear that Koser had more experimenting to do beyond the scope of her work with ReddPanda. In March 2019, Koser entered one of Philly's longest running singing contests, Songbird Philly. This was the true beginning of Koser\u2019s solo career. Koser, formerly \u201cK.

The band quickly gained attention for their blistering live shows, and amassed a rabid fanbase in the fertile soil of the late-1980s Southeast music scene. Now, 33 years later, and after releasing four full length albums on Island Records and one on Geffen Records, founding members Kevn Kinney and Tim Nielsen find themselves enjoying a milestone anniversary for the band, having survived the pressures of fame, a shifting musical landscape, multiple lineup changes, and miles of backroads and highways to arrive here.\nWith a gold record, 10 full-length albums, and a handful of EPs to their credit, the band still refuses to rest. In 2012, a documentary about the band entitled Scarred but Smarter: Life n Times of Drivin' N\u2019 Cryin' was produced. In 2015, a collection of 10 choice cuts from the band\u2019s 4-EP \u201cSongs\u201d series, entitled Best of Songs, was released on Nashville\u2019s Plowboy Records. Additionally, the band was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame that same year. The following year, Drivin N Cryin released a vinyl-only album, entitled Archives Vol One, with a collection of basement recordings from the years 1988 to 1990.\nWith Dave V. Johnson as their drummer, and the band's newest member Laur Joamets (originally Sturgill Simpson) now being added to the lineup, Drivin N Cryin is continuing to tour the U.S. to great acclaim.\nIsland Records re-released their much celebrated \u201cMystery Road\u201d album through Universal Music Group (2017) & Darius Rucker cut \u201cStraight to Hell\u201d on his new album, \u201cWhen Was the Last Time\u201d, released October 2017 with guest vocal appearances by Luke Bryan, Charles Kelley, and Jason Aldean. \u201cMystery Road\u201d was named one of The 50 Best Southern Rock Albums of All Time by Paste Magazine this year as well.\nA quote from the band\u2019s lead singer, Kevn Kinney, gives a little insight into what Drivin N Cryin is all about: \u201cWe are a band that's like your record collection.\u201d Drawing influence from a wide array of musical elements, Drivin N Cryin has developed a unique sound over the years.

On the album, songwriter Lauren Denitzio (they/them) addresses themes of reconstructing and reexamining relationships as they relate to the current zeitgeist. \u201cI thought a lot about how the state of the world makes any sort of partnership stressful. The album is partially autobiographical but it\u2019s also addressing more universal questions that people have to ask these days. Do we have kids? Do we move to a place that could be underwater in 20 years? How does having no idea how you\u2019ll ever retire affect planning your future?\u201d\n\nSonically, the new album does an incredible job of reflecting these anxieties. To help capture the band\u2019s fresh sound, Denitzio recruited veteran producer John Agnello, best known for his work with some of indie rock\u2019s most influential acts such as Sonic Youth, Kurt Vile, Alvvays, and Dinosaur Jr. Agnello recorded with Worriers over 11 days in Jersey City, NJ at Kaleidoscope Sound and in Brooklyn, NY at Russell Street Recording. On the album, Denitzio is joined by new guitarist Frank Piegaro, and longtime drummer Mikey Erg and bassist Nick Psillas. Unlike their previous releases, 2015\u2019s Imaginary Life (Don Giovanni) and 2017\u2019s Survival Pop (Side One Dummy/reissued by 6131 Records), the band recorded the majority of the album live in the studio.

In October 1985 Drivin N Cryin played their first show at Atlanta\u2019s famed 688 Club. The band quickly gained attention for their blistering live shows, and amassed a rabid fanbase in the fertile soil of the late-1980s Southeast music scene. Now, 33 years later, and after releasing four full length albums on Island Records and one on Geffen Records, founding members Kevn Kinney and Tim Nielsen find themselves enjoying a milestone anniversary for the band, having survived the pressures of fame, a shifting musical landscape, multiple lineup changes, and miles of backroads and highways to arrive here.\nWith a gold record, 10 full-length albums, and a handful of EPs to their credit, the band still refuses to rest. In 2012, a documentary about the band entitled Scarred but Smarter: Life n Times of Drivin' N\u2019 Cryin' was produced. In 2015, a collection of 10 choice cuts from the band\u2019s 4-EP \u201cSongs\u201d series, entitled Best of Songs, was released on Nashville\u2019s Plowboy Records. Additionally, the band was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame that same year. The following year, Drivin N Cryin released a vinyl-only album, entitled Archives Vol One, with a collection of basement recordings from the years 1988 to 1990.\nWith Dave V. Johnson as their drummer, and the band's newest member Laur Joamets (originally Sturgill Simpson) now being added to the lineup, Drivin N Cryin is continuing to tour the U.S. to great acclaim.\nIsland Records re-released their much celebrated \u201cMystery Road\u201d album through Universal Music Group (2017) & Darius Rucker cut \u201cStraight to Hell\u201d on his new album, \u201cWhen Was the Last Time\u201d, released October 2017 with guest vocal appearances by Luke Bryan, Charles Kelley, and Jason Aldean. \u201cMystery Road\u201d was named one of The 50 Best Southern Rock Albums of All Time by Paste Magazine this year as well.\nA quote from the band\u2019s lead singer, Kevn Kinney, gives a little insight into what Drivin N Cryin is all about: \u201cWe are a band that's like your record collection.\u201d Drawing influence from a wide array of musical elements, Drivin N Cryin has developed a unique sound over the years. Their name derives from the eclectic nature of this sound: a little drivin' rock n roll and a little country twang. Comfortable with their past and confident in their future, the band has an arsenal of songs, a full tank of gas, and no plans of stopping any time soon.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "635 Sackett Street, Brooklyn, NY 11217", "Artist": "Sam Jay ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9618955.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.983337, 40.678441], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "littlefield", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Comedians You Should Know brings you the best stand-up the world's greatest city has to offer.

Making people believe you deserve their attention, is at the top of the list. But when you get the attention of such legends as Teddy Riley and Quincy Jones, your future gets a whole lot brighter.\n\nLenny Harold, a New Jersey native R&B crooner and songwriter, wears his homegrown local artist roots just as proudly as the many stamps on his passport.\n\nHaving toured the world over, for five years, as a member of the reformatted legendary R&B group Blackstreet, led by the New Jack Swing creator himself, Teddy Riley, Lenny has had a hefty helping of what a major label star\u2019s life would be like. Yet, he still grinds just as hard as any local artist you may come across. That\u2019s what has kept Lenny Harold on the radar of many music lovers. From his winning tenure on Showtime at The Apollo [under old moniker Chanj] to his ovation grabbing tributes to Patti Labelle and Berry Gordy in the years following. Lenny\u2019s striking tenor range mixed with smooth vibrato has even turned many of today\u2019s industry heavyweights into mere fans from the likes of Marsha Ambrosius to Jamie Foxx.\n\nThis vocal prowess became highly evident on Lenny Harold\u2019s first official offering, \u201cThe Journal of Wonders: Tale of The Phoenix in The Moon Labyrinth,\u201d which led to an EP entitled \u201cYesterday Morning.\u201d Which Lenny details as the full story behind \u201cWaiting on Yesterday,\u201d a song from that first project, of a romantic mistake.\n\nTwo years later, while with Blackstreet, Lenny would then begin a new journey of reinvention, with a project entitled, \u201cNew Testament: Mountain High,\u201d first of a trilogy of projects to come. This musical sharing would begin to truly solidify the seriousness of his artistry, as many more took notice and loved.\n\nBut as with most unstoppable independent artists, a chance at personal success is always looming. Inspired by the experience of touring the world, finding his own fandom in places like Japan, Nigeria, London, and Germany, and sharing the stage with R&B greats, as a member of Blackstreet, Lenny felt the need to leave the group, after five years, to explore his solo career with full force.\n\nWith his latest singles, \u201cMore\u201d (which became an instant fan favorite) & \u201cHeat\u201d reaching number 7 on the UK Soul Charts, the release of his highly anticipated album, \u201cCOSMIC,\u201d has excited the hearts of his \u2018Wonders\u2019 [the name he gave his fans] and still introducing him to more ears, there\u2019s only greatness from here.\n\nLenny shares, \u201cCOSMIC is something bold, honest, sexy and beautiful, with love at it\u2019s core.

Formed shortly after composer Monte Weber met choreographer and vocalist Claire Cuny at a DIY show in Brooklyn in 2015, the duo pairs music with their unique talents of sound design, wearable technology, modern dance, and non-genre specific songwriting.\nMonte comes from a musical family and began his journey at a young age. His parents ran, and still run, a Brazilian Band in Western, MA. This initially lead him to perform and teach Brazilian percussion. As an adult he went on to study music composition in college and graduate school, first focusing on electro-acoustic composition and then studying at IRCAM where he began designing his Kontrol instrument, a way for Weber to make electronic music more tactile in performance. While Monte continues to compose for ensembles, he has always loved playing in bands but never had the opportunity to mix the two genres until he met Claire. Monte states, \u201cReliant Tom gives me the outlet to explore both pulse driven works while maintaining the other musical elements which I find fascinating - timbre, aleatoric processes, and interactive technologies.\u201d\nClaire started playing music much later in life. Beginning her artistic journey as a ballet dancer in Dallas, she later moved to NYC where she immersed herself in the NYC art scene. She danced in immersive dance companies, sang in multiple bands, performed with theatre companies, and started writing songs. She desired to combine all of these interests of study into one project but hadn\u2019t been able to until she met Monte. Claire explains,\u201cIt is very interesting to work together from our differing backgrounds. Our ultimate goal with Reliant Tom is to be a multi-media performance experience that straddles the line between pop and experimental music - and philosophizing about what that even means, and is that even possible as \"experimental pop\"? It seems like it's an oxymoron. I've learned so much from just trying to navigate this with him.\u201d\nThe music focuses on the themes of pitfalls in digital communication and the general blas\u00e9 nature of modern social interaction - all through the guise of avant-pop/avant-punk influenced musical devices. The band's instrumentation is generally comprised of electric guitar, voice, a hybrid electro-acoustic drum kit, synthesizers, as well as elements of Monte's Kontrol Instrument.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "538 Hart St, Brooklyn, NY 11221", "Artist": "LACEY SPACECAKE ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10231726.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.929977, 40.696366], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "Post Punk, Space Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Hart Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1027 Flatbush Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11226", "Artist": "Omer Adam ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9851702.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.95724, 40.64599], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Kings Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Omer Adam is currently the most popular vocalist and recording artist in Israel, whose work combines the melodies and modes of the Middle Eastern-Oriental Mizrahi style with Western pop instrumentation and rhythms.

Indeed, since he debuted almost two and a half years ago on New York City hip hop station WWPR Power 105.1 FM, Norie\u2019s Sunday night show \u201cAnything Goes-Caribbean Edition\u201d, a vigorous blend of soca, reggaeton, roots reggae and dancehall, accented with a distinctive Brooklyn flavor, consistently tops the ratings for the 8-10 PM time slot according to Arbitron statistics.\nRespectfully referred to as Da Reggae Don, DJ Norie was born to Panamanian parents in Brooklyn, which is often referred to a Jamaica\u2019s 15th parish, due to its concentration of immigrants from reggae\u2019s birthplace. Raised in Brooklyn\u2019s East Flatbush area, Norie became familiar with the music of Shabba Ranks, Super Cat and Ninja Man (dancehall reggae superstars of the late 1980s and early \u201890s) by listening to coveted sound clash cassettes that furthered the popularity of the latest reggae hits and the renown of the era\u2019s premier Jamaican sound systems. \u201cListening to the cassettes of Stone Love, Kilimanjaro and other sounds I thought, I want to be a part of that,\u201d Norie recalled.\nBarely into his teens, Norie began working with a neighborhood sound doing odd jobs such as carrying speakers and other equipment to their various gigs around Brooklyn. He paid close attention to the deejays (or selectors in Jamaican parlance) observing their proficiency in choosing just the right tunes to elicit roaring responses from the crowd and keep them on the dance floor. When the selectors needed to take a break, Norie got the chance to display his burgeoning skills on the wheels of steel; however, these early career-training sessions took place unbeknownst to Norie\u2019s mother. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will get in trouble for saying this now but my mom used to work nights so I used to sneak out to play at these basement parties, and basically that is how I learned to select,\u201d Norie laughingly discloses. \u201cIt was kind of hard in the beginning; they used to line up four or five records, tell me what to play and when I played them, people used to go crazy. So it used to seem like, yeah, I can do this, even though I was scared as s*#t. But I did it anyway and it was a good experience.\u201d\n\nNorie\u2019s fears subsided with repeated stints at the turntables and eventually he was recruited by Spectrum Disco, working with selectors Redds and Super C; as Spectrum\u2019s popularity spread throughout Brooklyn and the greater New York area during the 1990s, so too did Norie\u2019s renown as an intimidating selector. In the late 1990s Super Claude, the founder of Afrique Sound Station, one of the most venerated sound systems in the New York area, recruited Norie to join the set. Alongside Afrique\u2019s remarkable team of selectors, which included Jagga B, Crazy Richie and Super Twitch, Norie\u2019s talents were taken to a wider audience that spanned many states and several countries. \u201cSometimes you have to make a move, enhance yourself and go for you, and Afrique is where my name really started from, its what took me to the level of traveling with the music,\u201d Norie reflects. \u201cI will never forget Spectrum Disco because that is where I came from but Afrique has been in the business for more than 20 years, they set the trend for \u2018nuff sounds and it is a blessing to have been a part of it.\u201d\nNorie has also played on numerous Brooklyn based pirate and Internet stations that exclusively play reggae and Caribbean music (he even started one of his own, My Radio 94.3 FM), a phenomenon indicative of the vast potential for Caribbean music in the New York area. But Norie\u2019s expertise in selecting dancehall also resonated with a mainstream listenership, as he found out when he joined up with (hip hop) DJ Self as one of six deejays comprising a collective called Da Union, which enabled him to take dancehall into several (Manhattan) clubs where it had previously been excluded. This led to a few guest appearances on Power 105.1 FM, and eventually his Sunday night show on the station, which has contributed to his enviable status as America\u2019s most influential radio personality for dancehall reggae. As such, Norie is usually the first to transform a core dancehall anthem into an international hit, which he recently did with Stephen and Damian Marley\u2019s single \u201cJah Army\u201d, featuring Buju Banton.\nNorie is also the personal deejay for Beenie Man, with whom he travels whenever the artist has a show outside of Jamaica and he has also toured with Elephant Man, Bounty Killer, Mavado and Serani. On March 30, 2011 at New York City\u2019s BB King\u2019s nightclub, Norie made history selecting the rhythms for seven time Grammy winner Stephen Marley\u2019s first performance done solely to backing tracks (that is, without his band\u2019s accompaniment); Marley headlined Norie\u2019s two year anniversary party for his Power 105 show, which was also the one year anniversary celebration for his immensely popular monthly live concert series, \u201cAnything Goes\u201d. \u201cStephen was a little hesitant at first, because he never performed to tracks before, but he did it and he was happy about it, so it is a great experience to have under my belt,\u201d Norie shares.\nNorie has recently partnered on several projects with Queens New York based VP Records, the largest independent reggae label in the world. He selects the music at each of VP\u2019s album release parties and the label\u2019s artists are regularly showcased at his \u201cAnything Goes\u201d series. For VP Records\u2019 \u201cReggae Gold 2011\u201d, a collection of the year\u2019s biggest reggae hits, Da Reggae Don provided a vibrant, 35-minute bonus mix CD, rife with artists\u2019 shout-outs to Norie (including 2011 Celebrity Apprentice winner/country superstar John Rich) and customized renditions of popular songs. Additionally, Norie has just started recording artists on his own dancehall rhythms and he plans to release those tracks as part of his own compilation series sometime in the near future.\nEach of Norie\u2019s endeavors is in pursuit of his ultimate goal: expanding the overall popularity of Caribbean music, especially dancehall reggae, the music that inspired his career path almost 20 years ago. \u201cMy radio show has served a lot of purposes; not only did it allow my fans to get to know me but it allowed me to give back to this music game,\u201d Norie explains. \u201cBut I would like to get further in radio, be more than just a deejay because then I can help reggae by impressing upon program directors that New York\u2019s Caribbean population is really an untapped market that no one is paying attention to so why not go out and support it? We don\u2019t have to follow the same trends that everyone has been doing for years and years, we can do things differently, add on and make it much stronger.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "167 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Cupid ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/258476.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.988702, 40.72133], "Date": "Sun Mar 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-29", "Genre": "Rock, R&b, Alternative Rock, Soul, Rnb-soul, R&b/soul", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Slipper Room", "moreBioInfo": "Bryson Bernard first began to sing in his church's choir, encouraged by his pastor father.

The dissolution of the group didn't sway Bernard's pursuit for a singing career as he went solo immediately after. He sang at every type of venue he could, including at talent shows, weddings, and funerals. With his five-octave vocal range, Bernard earned the name Cupid during this process for his impressive performance of the late-'90s 112 hit single \"Cupid.\"\n\nThe singer first enjoyed radio airplay in 2001 with his single \"Do Ya Thing,\" which appeared on his self-pressed, eponymous debut the following year. His gospel-tinged vocals began to attract local promoters and rappers alike as Cupid was tapped to open for blues concerts as well as to record background vocals for various rap albums. Both experiences informed his second independently released album, The King of Down South R&B (2005), which contained elements of country, blues, and New Orleans bounce music.\n\nIn late 2006, Cupid was finally discovered by Atlantic because of the enormous buzz surrounding his latest local single at the time, \"Cupid Shuffle\". He signed with the label that following January, and soon his dance record was standing its ground in the Top 30 of the R&B charts for several weeks.

That 2008 release, with its gorgeously melodic writing and improvising and deft use of indie-rock, electronica and hip-hop elements, established Parks as one of the most gifted and original young voices in jazz. \u201cThis is the natural successor to that record,\u201d says the New York-based artist, 34. \u201cIt\u2019s taking the ideas of that project and doubling down on them\u2014fully committing to that direction.\u201d\n\nLittle Big also marks the recorded debut of the intuitive working group that gives the album its title (and which takes its name from a fantastical novel by John Crowley\u2014a favorite book of Parks and, the pianist notes, Wayne Shorter). Parks handled the production duties, with engineering by Daniel Schlett (whose credits include The War on Drugs and Ghostface Killah). The album was mixed by both Schlett and Grizzly Bear bassist/producer Chris Taylor, the latter of whom Parks met in a Seattle big band at the age of 10. \u201cWe put a lot of time and care into the way this record sounds, and the result\u201d\u2014simultaneously crystalline and warm, postmodern and natural\u2014\u201cmakes me really happy,\u201d Parks adds.\n\nAfter experimenting with various lineups and sessions, Parks landed on three musicians ideally suited for this atmospheric, genre-bending new work. \u201cThis feels like a real band, one that will be around for a while,\u201d he says. Greg Tuohey is the longest-running member, a guitarist who places taste and tone ahead of chops-focused bravado\u2014or, as Parks puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s chasing Miles Davis\u2019 phrasing with Jimi Hendrix\u2019s attitude.\u201d On electric bass is David \u201cDJ\u201d Ginyard Jr., a left-handed player with a distinctively lyrical approach and an aptitude for seeing the bigger musical picture. \u201cHe really understands what the bass does, and he thinks super compositionally,\u201d Parks says, noting how some of Ginyard\u2019s basslines have become integral to the songs. Anchoring the unit is Tommy Crane, a forward-looking, stylistically resourceful drummer who brings both explosive creativity and a producer\u2019s knack for precision. \u201cHe has a very unique ability to internalize and commit to the particular heartbeat of each song,\u201d Parks explains, \u201cbut always with this vital and elastic human element, which is rare to hear in combination with the kinds of grooves we\u2019re exploring.\u201d\n\nTogether they interpret a panoramic set of Parks\u2019 original compositions\u2014from the 21st-century fusion of \u201cKid,\u201d to the odd-metered studio jam \u201cProfessor Strangeweather,\u201d to the trip-hop ambiance and folkish melody of \u201cBells.\u201d The psychedelic \u201cAquarium\u201d\u2014\u201cprobably the sexiest tune on the album,\u201d Parks says, chuckling\u2014conjures up the trippy, sultry neo-soul vibe of Meshell Ndegeocello, before Tuohey offers a solo that channels Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood. \u201cDigital Society\u201d somehow manages to evoke Afrobeat, bluegrass and Aphex Twin. \u201cLilac\u201d is, as Parks describes it, \u201ca solo-piano pop tune.\u201d The leader\u2019s \u201csecret favorite\u201d cut, \u201cDoors Open,\u201d seeks inspiration in late Talk Talk and the \u201cearnestness\u201d of Brian Blade & the Fellowship Band. That closing track is \u201cdefinitely not afraid to go straight for your heart,\u201d Parks says with a laugh.\n\nA prodigal talent raised outside of Seattle, Parks moved with his family to study at the Manhattan School of Music when he was 16. Two years later, on the recommendation of a teacher, NEA Jazz Master Kenny Barron, he was invited to join trumpet great Terence Blanchard\u2019s band. That tenure began the relationship with Blue Note that would yield Invisible Cinema, released when Parks was just 24. In The Guardian, John Fordham called the album \u201ca real independent vision,\u201d adding that \u201cParks is a fast-rising star.\u201d In the September 2008 issue of JazzTimes, Parks was named a \u201cNew Jazz Visionary\u201d alongside current giants like Esperanza Spalding, Robert Glasper and Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah. Over the ensuing decade, Parks certainly made good on that early promise. He was an essential presence in Kurt Rosenwinkel\u2019s band, including on the guitarist\u2019s well-received double album from 2012, Star of Jupiter. As a member of the supergroup James Farm, also featuring saxophonist Joshua Redman, bassist Matt Penman and drummer Eric Harland, Parks put out two celebrated albums on Nonesuch. In 2013 he released his first disc as an ECM Records artist, Arborescence, which DownBeat\u2019s J.D. Considine called \u201ca forest-invoking solo-piano effort marked by wonderfully detailed narratives and a harmonic palette worthy of Ravel.\u201d Find the Way, an ECM trio session with bassist Ben Street and drummer Billy Hart, followed last year and garnered equally enthusiastic reviews.\n\nOn Little Big, Parks taps into the lessons he\u2019s absorbed throughout those far-reaching experiences, while also progressing some of the au courant sounds he investigated on Invisible Cinema. \u201cThis feels like the most personal record I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d he says. What\u2019s more, the album reflects his worldview, an outlook in which optimism and inclusion supersede politics. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot out there right now to protest against, and it feels like it\u2019s the artist\u2019s duty to create music that reckons with the issues of the day. Nonetheless, this is not a protest record. It\u2019s not against anything; it\u2019s much more for something.

For although the world seems strangely intent on fixing him in his early twenties (or more specifically, a series of internet sites who have seemingly overlooked the fact that biography ages require a yearly update!), the time has come to acknowledge that DJ and producer James Holden is not quite so young anymore. The timely release of Holden's 'The Idiots Are Winning' mini-album in 2006 marked the occasion, and formed a fitting musical illustration of Holden's new-found maturity.\n\nStill reluctant to bestow upon it the accolade of 'debut album', for Holden himself 'The Idiots Are Winning' remains an EP which grew out of control: take four dancefloor-length Holden tracks, mix in the obligatory DJ tools and alternative versions that he is so keen on, and an interlude or two for good measure, and you have far exceeded the single realm and are pushing into album territory. Not that the manner of its creation should affect the listening experience: Holden's intricate and inimitable production style ensures a coherence of atmosphere, where even DJ-friendly extended intros hold up to home-listening scrutiny. The Guardian went so far as to proclaim it \"the most astonishing debut in electronic music since Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children.\" And who are we to argue?\n\nThe producer James Holden's journey to this point began back in 1999, aged just 19, when he burst onto the UK scene with the exuberant teenage trance hit 'Horizons'. Produced on a basic home computer set-up and the freeware music program Buzz whilst still studying towards a Maths degree at the University of Oxford, the young punk's overnight success was a slap in the face for the audiophile establishment, and went some way towards opening doors for the legions of young bedroom producers who have now become the mainstay of the dance world. The floodgates had opened, and an intensive course of remixing, djing, production and collaborations extended before Holden in place of the conventional Oxford graduate career path.\n\nBut if the axis of English (and those related countries which take their lead from the Anglo-American progressive house and trance scenes) took to Holden overnight, the rest of the world took a little longer to convince. It was not until the launch of his own Border Community label in 2003, kicked off in fine style with his own future anthem 'A Break in the Clouds', when key players in the hugely influential German scene began to sit up and take notice. Having found himself wedged rather uncomfortably between the prog and trance scenes in his native UK, this entrance into the German market represented a new-found freedom for Holden, and the non-generic approach to making melodic electronic music which he found amongst many of his peers in Cologne and Berlin finally had him feeling right at home. A string of hugely-influential and often-imitated monster remixes of everyone from Madonna and Britney Spears, through Depeche Mode and New Order, to Nathan Fake and Kieran Hebden and Steve Reid cemented his place as a mainstay of DJ record boxes everywhere, and Holden's global dancefloor domination was complete.\n\nOriginally founded to offer a restriction-free outlet for Holden's own music, as well as serving as a launch pad for the production careers of his talented friends, the rather fanatical cult of Border Community which has sprung up around Holden's own label has of course been essential in achieving this independence from the narrow limitations of genre-specific music. The accolades due to Holden's Border Community baby include bucking the trend of declining vinyl sales in a major way, unleashing a whole host of idiosyncratic dancefloor classics on the world, kickstarting the careers of many a young musician, and making serious inroads on the realm of the artist album with offerings from Nathan Fake, Fairmont and Holden himself. Now in its fifth year, Border Community is firmly established as one of the foremost breeding grounds for fresh young electronic talent, thanks to their small but faithful army of free-spirited genre benders who between them have injected a new life into the European scene.\n\nThe best place to catch a glimpse of the soon-to-be-massive delights yet to come from his Border Community label is of course a James Holden DJ set, where his tireless dedication to hunting down the next wave of young production talent meets his own sense of exemplary taste in selecting tracks from other labels to bring his unique vision of what club music ought to be to life. Barely coming up for air between his non-stop sampler and CDJ wizardry, Holden is a very modern sort of DJ, brazenly uniting tracks from music's past and present, disregarding genre, confounding the purists and making club hits out of many an unwitting dancefloor virgin. His supreme and unrivalled command of the modern technology available to him allows Holden to go where other DJs fear to tread, consistently pulling off daring mixes on-the-fly which just wouldn't be possible on a conventional two turntable set-up. And so distinct is the resultant sound that your average conservative dance music night can barely contain it, which is why James Holden is often best experienced alongside his edgy labelmates at one of his many Border Community label nights, at The End in London, and beyond.\n\nBetween a hectic touring schedule which has taken in just about every corner of the world, running his Zeitgeist-defining label, and his status as hugely in-demand remixer du jour, it is little wonder that Holden's own original productions have occasionally seemed a little thin on the ground. But something has got to give if Renaissance man Holden is ever going to finish his next album, which is why his plans for 2008 feature a scaled down set of DJ dates and a strictly-enforced remix embargo. With that all-important studio time freed up, the time has come to begin plotting the next chapter in the James Holden story.", "otherInfo": "Thom Yorke"}, {"Address": "102 Norfolk Street, New York, NY 10576", "Artist": "Svetlana ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9301408.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.939108, 40.580577], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "Swing, Jazz, Sophisti-pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Back Room", "moreBioInfo": "\"Breakfast at Tiffany's Meets Some Like It Hot\" (Lucid Culture)\n\"Outstanding vocalist\" (Wall Street Journal)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "131 W 3rd St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Julius Rodriguez ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9974606.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.00074, 40.730839], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "Soul, Country, Pop, Jazz, Gospel, Hip Hop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Blue Note Jazz Club", "moreBioInfo": "Born in White Plains, NY, Julius' interest in music began very early on.

The timely release of Holden's 'The Idiots Are Winning' mini-album in 2006 marked the occasion, and formed a fitting musical illustration of Holden's new-found maturity.\n\nStill reluctant to bestow upon it the accolade of 'debut album', for Holden himself 'The Idiots Are Winning' remains an EP which grew out of control: take four dancefloor-length Holden tracks, mix in the obligatory DJ tools and alternative versions that he is so keen on, and an interlude or two for good measure, and you have far exceeded the single realm and are pushing into album territory. Not that the manner of its creation should affect the listening experience: Holden's intricate and inimitable production style ensures a coherence of atmosphere, where even DJ-friendly extended intros hold up to home-listening scrutiny. The Guardian went so far as to proclaim it \"the most astonishing debut in electronic music since Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children.\" And who are we to argue?\n\nThe producer James Holden's journey to this point began back in 1999, aged just 19, when he burst onto the UK scene with the exuberant teenage trance hit 'Horizons'. Produced on a basic home computer set-up and the freeware music program Buzz whilst still studying towards a Maths degree at the University of Oxford, the young punk's overnight success was a slap in the face for the audiophile establishment, and went some way towards opening doors for the legions of young bedroom producers who have now become the mainstay of the dance world. The floodgates had opened, and an intensive course of remixing, djing, production and collaborations extended before Holden in place of the conventional Oxford graduate career path.\n\nBut if the axis of English (and those related countries which take their lead from the Anglo-American progressive house and trance scenes) took to Holden overnight, the rest of the world took a little longer to convince. It was not until the launch of his own Border Community label in 2003, kicked off in fine style with his own future anthem 'A Break in the Clouds', when key players in the hugely influential German scene began to sit up and take notice. Having found himself wedged rather uncomfortably between the prog and trance scenes in his native UK, this entrance into the German market represented a new-found freedom for Holden, and the non-generic approach to making melodic electronic music which he found amongst many of his peers in Cologne and Berlin finally had him feeling right at home. A string of hugely-influential and often-imitated monster remixes of everyone from Madonna and Britney Spears, through Depeche Mode and New Order, to Nathan Fake and Kieran Hebden and Steve Reid cemented his place as a mainstay of DJ record boxes everywhere, and Holden's global dancefloor domination was complete.\n\nOriginally founded to offer a restriction-free outlet for Holden's own music, as well as serving as a launch pad for the production careers of his talented friends, the rather fanatical cult of Border Community which has sprung up around Holden's own label has of course been essential in achieving this independence from the narrow limitations of genre-specific music. The accolades due to Holden's Border Community baby include bucking the trend of declining vinyl sales in a major way, unleashing a whole host of idiosyncratic dancefloor classics on the world, kickstarting the careers of many a young musician, and making serious inroads on the realm of the artist album with offerings from Nathan Fake, Fairmont and Holden himself. Now in its fifth year, Border Community is firmly established as one of the foremost breeding grounds for fresh young electronic talent, thanks to their small but faithful army of free-spirited genre benders who between them have injected a new life into the European scene.\n\nThe best place to catch a glimpse of the soon-to-be-massive delights yet to come from his Border Community label is of course a James Holden DJ set, where his tireless dedication to hunting down the next wave of young production talent meets his own sense of exemplary taste in selecting tracks from other labels to bring his unique vision of what club music ought to be to life. Barely coming up for air between his non-stop sampler and CDJ wizardry, Holden is a very modern sort of DJ, brazenly uniting tracks from music's past and present, disregarding genre, confounding the purists and making club hits out of many an unwitting dancefloor virgin. His supreme and unrivalled command of the modern technology available to him allows Holden to go where other DJs fear to tread, consistently pulling off daring mixes on-the-fly which just wouldn't be possible on a conventional two turntable set-up. And so distinct is the resultant sound that your average conservative dance music night can barely contain it, which is why James Holden is often best experienced alongside his edgy labelmates at one of his many Border Community label nights, at The End in London, and beyond.\n\nBetween a hectic touring schedule which has taken in just about every corner of the world, running his Zeitgeist-defining label, and his status as hugely in-demand remixer du jour, it is little wonder that Holden's own original productions have occasionally seemed a little thin on the ground. But something has got to give if Renaissance man Holden is ever going to finish his next album, which is why his plans for 2008 feature a scaled down set of DJ dates and a strictly-enforced remix embargo. With that all-important studio time freed up, the time has come to begin plotting the next chapter in the James Holden story.", "otherInfo": "Thom Yorke"}, {"Address": "102 Norfolk Street, New York, NY 10576", "Artist": "Svetlana ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9301408.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.939108, 40.580577], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "Swing, Jazz, Sophisti-pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Back Room", "moreBioInfo": "\"Breakfast at Tiffany's Meets Some Like It Hot\" (Lucid Culture)\n\"Outstanding vocalist\" (Wall Street Journal)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "45-58 Vernon Blvd, Queens County, NY 11101", "Artist": "Eleanor Dubinsky ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10137525.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-73.952819, 40.747015], "Date": "Mon Mar 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-30", "Genre": "Pop, Jazz, Jazz Fusion, World", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "LIC Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Eleanor Dubinsky has found the tender edge where jazz, world, and pop sensibilities meet emotionally forthright songwriting.

Then, he landed the role of Elvis Presley on Norwegian Cruise\nLine. Dan's dream ever since he picked up the guitar at the age of 12 was to entertain on stage. His\nmusical influences have ranged from Joe Cocker to Justin Bieber, however he never truly felt that he \"fit\nin\" with any particular style.\nDan turned his tiny cabin on the cruise ship into a home-recording studio, churning out several original\ndemos. One night, while performing in For The Record: The Brat Pack on Norwegian, music manager\nJonathan Wax happened to be vacationing with his wife when he discovered Dan's powerful vocals and\ntechnical prowess on the guitar. Wax knew that this could be an artist who could breathe new life into\nthe pop scene, weaving classic guitar lines with catchy modern hooks and vocal acrobatics.\nAfter returning to land, Dan went to Los Angeles to meet with Jonathan's brother, singer-songwriter\nMikey Wax, and producer Jacob Lee. Together, the three of them co-wrote and recorded an EP. The\nresult was exactly what they had hoped for; a modern meets classic vibe. Catchy and infectious pop\nmelodies with soaring, old-soul vocals.\nThat\u2019s when Renata Baiocco entered the picture.

The new music kept flowing, and since then Deputy has released four critically acclaimed full length studio albums. As a special sneak peek into his new music, Zach will sprinkle songs from his upcoming album throughout his sets this fall.\n\nReflecting on his live shows, Zach says \"music to me is about bringing people together from all walks of life and living in the moment with a joyful heart!\" Deputy's one man show creates a unique experience straight from the soul every night, raw and uncut with absolutely nothing prerecorded. As a pioneer of looping and synth guitar work well ahead of his time, he's taken the technology to uncharted lands delivering a pocket groove unique to the ears. Zach says, \"call me crazy, but I've always believed live music should always be live, but I've also always loved a good tranced out dance party too.\" With this in mind he tailored his performances to meet his convictions. Combining his family roots Island vibe with his low country southern soul, a pinch of tranced out hippy hop, and a vast amount of talent, Zach's sound emerges in focus.\n\nSelect shows will feature Zach's vibrant band The Yankees, a bluesy jam band who will be supporting Deputy with keys, Drums, Bass, and a whole lot of soul. Alongside Deputy on tour, supporting acts will include powerhouse musicians Audacity Brass Band, Afterfunk & Sarah Blacker, the Trailheads, and Mike Pinto.\n\nThis fall Zach Deputy will hit the road and perform live across the east coast of the United States.

He also starred in a Kanye West produced national Pepsi TV commercial and has appeared on the world\u2019s most venerable stages including Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and Madison Square Garden.\n\nBut his true passion is music education. His program Electrify Your Strings (EYS) \u2013 founded in 2001 \u2013 is an intensive rock and roll workshop for school music education departments that boosts student self-esteem and motivation and helps raise money for music education. Today EYS visits upwards of 75 schools per year and there is a waiting list of schools wanting to participate. The organization has been featured on The Today Show and CBS Evening News and in countless local media outlets.\n\nBut for Wood, it\u2019s all about the kids. He\u2019s dedicated to providing educators with the opportunity to ignite their students\u2019 passions and to inspiring students to open their minds and unlock their potential. His book \u201cElectrify Your Strings: The Mark Wood Improvisational Violin Method\u201d (published by Cherry Lane) is regarded as the definitive electric violin method book. The first in a series of forthcoming educational books, Wood is passionate about providing educators and students with the tools they need to succeed in the classroom and beyond.\n\nA genuine family man, Wood runs his operations alongside his wife, business partner, and longtime collaborator Laura Kaye out of their home in Port Washington, New York. Their child Elijah is a drummer (Shania Twain, Jordan Rudess, Grace VanderWaal, America's Got Talent) and occasionally tours with EYS and The Mark Wood Experience. In addition to EYS, Wood and his family run the annual MWROC Music Festival (a week-long music camp), as well as the Mark Wood Electrify Your Music Foundation, a 501-C3 dedicated to supporting music and the arts.\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of students reached, millions of dollars raised to help high school music departments across the US, and dozens of school orchestra programs saved from the chopping block because of funds raised through his efforts, Mark Wood has proven himself a man of ideas, action and results. Showing no signs of slowing down, the multi faceted visionary continues to write, perform, record, invent and inspire.

Either way, allow us to present the real story from the horse\u2019s (man\u2019s) mouth\u2026\n\nDISCLAIMER 2: (No animals were harmed in the making of this bio.)\n\nThroughout over three decades in music, Steve Poltz did it all and more\u2014often shared by way of his rockin\u2019 countrified folk slices of sardonic Americana (hatched in Halifax). Of course, he co-wrote Jewel\u2019s multiplatinum Hot 100-topping megahit \u201cYou Were Meant For Me,\u201d but he also went on a whale watch with her and a few federales that turned into a drug bust. The two still share the story at every festival they play together. He made his bones as the frontman for underground legends The Rugburns, who burned rubber crisscrossing the continent on marathon tours and still pop up once in a while for the rare and quickly sold out reunion gig.\n\nIn 20 years since his full-length solo debut, One Left Shoe, he blessed the world\u2019s ears with twelve solo records, spanning the acclaimed 2010 Dreamhouse and most recently Folk Singer in 2015. NPR summed it up best, \u201cCritics and fans alike now regard Poltz as a talented and prolific songwriter.\u201d By 2016, he survived a stroke, endured anything the music industry could throw at him, and still performed like \u201c280 days a year.\u201d\n\nHowever, he still never lived in Nashville, which represents a turning point in the story and the genesis of his 2018 Red House Records debut, Shine On\u2026\n\n\u201cMy girlfriend Sharon sold the condo we were living in, and I was ready to live in a van, which seemed like a good idea for one night\u2014then I decided I wanted a kitchen and a closet,\u201d he admits. \u201cSharon wanted to move to Nashville, because she thought it would be good for me. It caused a huge fight. I\u2019d been in San Diego since 1980, and that\u2019s where I cut my musical teeth. I thought I\u2019d never leave. In fact, at the height of our fight, I said, \u2018I\u2019m not leaving San Diego. I am San Diego!\u2019 This makes me laugh now. As soon as I got to Nashville, I immediately knew I wanted to make a record in \u2018Music City\u2019.\u201d\nSo, the man who once protested \u201cI am San Diego\u201d made Shine On in his new home of Nashville with one of its elder statesman behind the board, Will Kimbrough [Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell]. Holing up in the studio at Kimbrough\u2019s house, nothing would be off limits. Together, they unlocked the kind of creative chemistry you only hear about in band bios\u2014but for real.\n\n\u201cI respect Will so much, and I\u2019d always wanted to work with him,\u201d says Steve. \u201cLike two mad scientists, we just took our time and had fun. We didn\u2019t overthink things. Everything felt organic. We ate soul food and drank lots of really good coffee. We tried out weird sounds, and the songs always started with voice and guitar\u2014no click track, just how I\u2019d play them. I road tested many of them, and they were ripe for the picking when recording time came around.\u201d\n\nEvoking themes of \u201chope, love, contemplation, celebration of Wednesday, pharmacists, and the fact that windows are not inanimate objects and they sometimes have conversations with each other,\u201d the record represents Steve at his most inspired and insightful. The opener and title track \u201cShine On\u201d pairs a delicate vocal with lithely plucked acoustic strings as he urges, \u201cShine on, shine on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe song was a gift,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI woke up really early in Encinitas, California at Sharon\u2019s sister\u2019s house. The sun was just coming up. I was all alone in perfect solitude. My guitar was there. The sky was gorgeous. I wrote it as a poem. Everyone always told me, \u2018Never start a record with a really slow song.\u2019 So, seeing that I have O.D.D. (Oppositional Defiance Disorder), I started my record with one. I love the mood it sets. It\u2019s almost like my mission statement, trying to find some semblance of positivity and light in a sometimes ruthless world.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cPharmacist,\u201d rustling guitar and harmonica propel a tale of \u201cthis dude having a crush on his pharmacist.\u201d It also serves as an extension of his friendship with neighbor Scot Sax\u2014with whom he shares the podcast \u201cOne Hit Neighbors\u201d (since they\u2019ve both had one hit song). Meanwhile, he joined forces with Molly Tuttle on \u201c4th of July,\u201d which, of course, came to life on the 3rd of July. \u201cBallin On Wednesday\u201d drew its title and chorus from a diner checkout girl (with a super cool gold tooth) who Steve paid with a $100 bill and she replied, \u201cOooh, ballin\u2019 on a Wednsday.\u201d The finale \u201cAll Things Shine\u201d skips along on sparse instrumentation as Steve sends a message.\n\n\u201c\u2018All Things Shine\u2019 came about after one of the many mass shootings on this planet,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI was feeling overwhelmed. So, I wanted to put my feelings into words and melody. I was thinking that even if we\u2019re feeling hopeless that there is still beauty. All things shine in their own way.\u201d\nWho could contend that?\n\nIn the end, for everything you can call him \u201csearcher, smartass, movie freak, lover of technology, news junkie, baseball fan to nth degree, lapsed catholic who still believes in god even though all his friends are atheists and think he\u2019s an idiot, and maker of fun,\u201d you might just call Steve that little light in the dark we all need in this day and age.\n\nOr Nashville\u2019s Canadian Jiminy Cricket\u2026\n\n\u201cI hope Shine On makes listeners smile and feel welcome, and they want to share it with their friends,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cMusic means energy to me. All things. It connects us, makes us move, helps us relax, and inspires us to change things up.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "125 MacDougal St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "SugarTone Brass Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6133593.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-74.000148, 40.730557], "Date": "Tue Mar 31 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-31", "Genre": "Rnb-soul, Funk, Jazz, R&b/soul", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Groove", "moreBioInfo": "Sugartone Brass Band has been Funkin up the brass band scene in New York City for over a decade.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers.

On the album, songwriter Lauren Denitzio (they/them) addresses themes of reconstructing and reexamining relationships as they relate to the current zeitgeist. \u201cI thought a lot about how the state of the world makes any sort of partnership stressful. The album is partially autobiographical but it\u2019s also addressing more universal questions that people have to ask these days. Do we have kids? Do we move to a place that could be underwater in 20 years? How does having no idea how you\u2019ll ever retire affect planning your future?\u201d\n\nSonically, the new album does an incredible job of reflecting these anxieties. To help capture the band\u2019s fresh sound, Denitzio recruited veteran producer John Agnello, best known for his work with some of indie rock\u2019s most influential acts such as Sonic Youth, Kurt Vile, Alvvays, and Dinosaur Jr. Agnello recorded with Worriers over 11 days in Jersey City, NJ at Kaleidoscope Sound and in Brooklyn, NY at Russell Street Recording.

For although the world seems strangely intent on fixing him in his early twenties (or more specifically, a series of internet sites who have seemingly overlooked the fact that biography ages require a yearly update!), the time has come to acknowledge that DJ and producer James Holden is not quite so young anymore. The timely release of Holden's 'The Idiots Are Winning' mini-album in 2006 marked the occasion, and formed a fitting musical illustration of Holden's new-found maturity.\n\nStill reluctant to bestow upon it the accolade of 'debut album', for Holden himself 'The Idiots Are Winning' remains an EP which grew out of control: take four dancefloor-length Holden tracks, mix in the obligatory DJ tools and alternative versions that he is so keen on, and an interlude or two for good measure, and you have far exceeded the single realm and are pushing into album territory. Not that the manner of its creation should affect the listening experience: Holden's intricate and inimitable production style ensures a coherence of atmosphere, where even DJ-friendly extended intros hold up to home-listening scrutiny. The Guardian went so far as to proclaim it \"the most astonishing debut in electronic music since Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children.\" And who are we to argue?\n\nThe producer James Holden's journey to this point began back in 1999, aged just 19, when he burst onto the UK scene with the exuberant teenage trance hit 'Horizons'. Produced on a basic home computer set-up and the freeware music program Buzz whilst still studying towards a Maths degree at the University of Oxford, the young punk's overnight success was a slap in the face for the audiophile establishment, and went some way towards opening doors for the legions of young bedroom producers who have now become the mainstay of the dance world. The floodgates had opened, and an intensive course of remixing, djing, production and collaborations extended before Holden in place of the conventional Oxford graduate career path.\n\nBut if the axis of English (and those related countries which take their lead from the Anglo-American progressive house and trance scenes) took to Holden overnight, the rest of the world took a little longer to convince. It was not until the launch of his own Border Community label in 2003, kicked off in fine style with his own future anthem 'A Break in the Clouds', when key players in the hugely influential German scene began to sit up and take notice. Having found himself wedged rather uncomfortably between the prog and trance scenes in his native UK, this entrance into the German market represented a new-found freedom for Holden, and the non-generic approach to making melodic electronic music which he found amongst many of his peers in Cologne and Berlin finally had him feeling right at home. A string of hugely-influential and often-imitated monster remixes of everyone from Madonna and Britney Spears, through Depeche Mode and New Order, to Nathan Fake and Kieran Hebden and Steve Reid cemented his place as a mainstay of DJ record boxes everywhere, and Holden's global dancefloor domination was complete.\n\nOriginally founded to offer a restriction-free outlet for Holden's own music, as well as serving as a launch pad for the production careers of his talented friends, the rather fanatical cult of Border Community which has sprung up around Holden's own label has of course been essential in achieving this independence from the narrow limitations of genre-specific music. The accolades due to Holden's Border Community baby include bucking the trend of declining vinyl sales in a major way, unleashing a whole host of idiosyncratic dancefloor classics on the world, kickstarting the careers of many a young musician, and making serious inroads on the realm of the artist album with offerings from Nathan Fake, Fairmont and Holden himself. Now in its fifth year, Border Community is firmly established as one of the foremost breeding grounds for fresh young electronic talent, thanks to their small but faithful army of free-spirited genre benders who between them have injected a new life into the European scene.\n\nThe best place to catch a glimpse of the soon-to-be-massive delights yet to come from his Border Community label is of course a James Holden DJ set, where his tireless dedication to hunting down the next wave of young production talent meets his own sense of exemplary taste in selecting tracks from other labels to bring his unique vision of what club music ought to be to life. Barely coming up for air between his non-stop sampler and CDJ wizardry, Holden is a very modern sort of DJ, brazenly uniting tracks from music's past and present, disregarding genre, confounding the purists and making club hits out of many an unwitting dancefloor virgin. His supreme and unrivalled command of the modern technology available to him allows Holden to go where other DJs fear to tread, consistently pulling off daring mixes on-the-fly which just wouldn't be possible on a conventional two turntable set-up. And so distinct is the resultant sound that your average conservative dance music night can barely contain it, which is why James Holden is often best experienced alongside his edgy labelmates at one of his many Border Community label nights, at The End in London, and beyond.\n\nBetween a hectic touring schedule which has taken in just about every corner of the world, running his Zeitgeist-defining label, and his status as hugely in-demand remixer du jour, it is little wonder that Holden's own original productions have occasionally seemed a little thin on the ground. But something has got to give if Renaissance man Holden is ever going to finish his next album, which is why his plans for 2008 feature a scaled down set of DJ dates and a strictly-enforced remix embargo. With that all-important studio time freed up, the time has come to begin plotting the next chapter in the James Holden story.", "otherInfo": "Due to restrictions put in place to minimise the spread of COVID-19, we regret that the North American leg of the Thom Yorke Tomorrow?s Modern Boxes tour is postponed.
